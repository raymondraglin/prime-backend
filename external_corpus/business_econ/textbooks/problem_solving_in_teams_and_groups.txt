GROUPS & TEAMS OVERVIEW

This section introduces the basics for groups and teams.

DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS

The content included in this chapter is adapted from two Open University
chapters: Working in Groups and Teams and Groups and Teamwork

                            What is a group?

Our tendency to form groups is a pervasive aspect of organizational life. In addition to formal groups,
committees, and teams, there are informal groups, cliques, and factions.

                                                                   Formal groups are used to organize and
                                                                distribute work, pool information, devise plans,
                                                                coordinate activities, increase commitment,
                                                                negotiate, resolve conflicts and conduct inquests.
                                                                Group work allows the pooling of people's
                                                                individual skills and knowledge, and helps
                                                                compensate for individual deficiencies. Estimates
                                                                suggest most managers spend 50 percent of their
                                                                working day in one sort of group or another, and
                                                                for top management of large organizations this can
rise to 80 percent. Thus, formal groups are clearly an integral part of the functioning of an organization.
   No less important are informal groups. These are usually structured more around the social needs of
people than around the performance of tasks. Informal groups usually serve to satisfy needs of affiliation,
and act as a forum for exploring self-concept as a means of gaining support, and so on. However, these
informal groups may also have an important effect on formal work tasks, for example by exerting subtle
pressures on group members to conform to a particular work rate, or as `places' where news, gossip, etc., is
exchanged.

What is a team?

                                                     Exploration Activity
       Write your own definition of a `team' (in 20 words or less).
       Provide an example of a team working toward an achievable goals

You probably described a team as a group of some kind. However, a team is more than just a group. When
you think of all the groups that you belong to, you will probably find that very few of them are really
16 | DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS

teams. Some of them will be family or friendship groups that are formed to meet a wide range of needs such
as affection, security, support, esteem, belonging, or identity. Some may be committees whose members
represent different interest groups and who meet to discuss their differing perspectives on issues of interest.

   In this reading the term `work group' (or `group') is often used interchangeably with the word `team,'
although a team may be thought of as a particularly cohesive and purposeful type of work group. We can
distinguish work groups or teams from more casual groupings of people by using the following set of criteria
(Adair, 1983). A collection of people can be defined as a work group or team if it shows most, if not all, of
the following characteristics:

 · A definable membership: a collection of three or more people identifiable by name or type;
 · A group identity: the members think of themselves as a group;
 · A sense of shared purpose: the members share some common task or goals or interests;
 · Interdependence: the members need the help of one another to accomplish the purpose for which

      they joined the group;
 · Interaction: the members communicate with one another, influence one another, react to one

      another;
 · Sustainability: the team members periodically review the team's effectiveness;
 · An ability to act together.

Usually, the tasks and goals set by teams cannot be achieved by individuals working alone because of
constraints on time and resources, and because few individuals possess all the relevant competences and
expertise. Sports teams or orchestras clearly fit these criteria.

                                                     Exploration Activity
       List some examples of teams of which you are a member - both inside and outside work - in

                                                       your learning file.
                                                    Now list some groups.
                                       What strikes you as the main differences?

   By contrast, many groups are much less explicitly focused on an external task. In some instances, the
growth and development of the group itself is its primary purpose; process is more important than
outcome. Many groups are reasonably fluid and less formally structured than teams. In the case of work
groups, an agreed and defined outcome is often regarded as a sufficient basis for effective cooperation and
the development of adequate relationships.Teamwork is usually connected with project work and this is
a feature of much work. Teamwork is particularly useful when you have to address risky, uncertain, or
unfamiliar problems where there is a lot of choice and discretion surrounding the decision to be made.
In the area of voluntary and unpaid work, where pay is not an incentive, teamwork can help to motivate
support and commitment because it can offer the opportunities to interact socially and learn from others
(Piercy & Kramer, 2017). Furthermore, people are more willing to support and defend work they
helped create (Stanton, 1992).

   Importantly, groups and teams are not distinct entities. Both can be pertinent in personal development
                                          DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS | 17

as well as organizational development and managing change. In such circumstances, when is it appropriate
to embark on teambuilding rather than relying on ordinary group or solo working?

   In general, the greater the task uncertainty the more important teamwork is, especially if
it is necessary to represent the differing perspectives of concerned parties. In such situations, the facts
themselves do not always point to an obvious policy or strategy for innovation, support, and development:
decisions are partially based on the opinions and the personal visions of those involved.

   There are risks associated with working in teams as well. Under some conditions, teams may produce
more conventional, rather than more innovative, responses to problems. The reason for this is that team
decisions may regress towards the average, with group pressures to conform cancelling out more innovative
decision options (Makin, Cooper, & Cox, 1989). It depends on how innovative the team is, in terms of its
membership, its norms, and its values.

   Teamwork may also be inappropriate when you want a fast decision. Team decision making is usually
slower than individual decision making because of the need for communication and consensus about the
decision taken. Despite the business successes of Japanese companies, it is now recognized that promoting
a collective organizational identity and responsibility for decisions can sometimes slow down operations
significantly, in ways that are not always compensated for by better decision making.

Is a team or group really needed?

There may be times when group working - or simply working alone - is more appropriate and more
effective. For example, decision-making in groups and teams is usually slower than individual decision-
making because of the need for communication and consensus. In addition, groups and teams may produce
conventional rather than innovative responses to problems, because decisions may regress towards the
average, with the more innovative decision options being rejected (Makin et al., 1989).

   In general, the greater the task uncertainty, that is to say the less obvious and more complex the task
to be addressed, the more important it will be to work in a group or team rather than individually. This
is because there will be a greater need for different skills and perspectives, especially if it is necessary to
represent the different perspectives of the different stakeholders involved.

   Table 2 lists some occasions when it will be appropriate to work in teams, in groups or alone.

Types of teams

Different organizations or organizational settings lead to different types of team. The type of team affects
how that team is managed, what the communication needs of the team are and, where appropriate, what
aspects of the project the project manager needs to emphasize. A work group or team may be permanent,
forming part of the organization's structure, such as a top management team, or temporary, such as a task
force assembled to see through a particular project. Members may work as a group continuously or meet
only intermittently. The more direct contact and communication team members have with each other,
the more likely they are to function well as a team. Thus, getting a group to function well is a valuable
management aim.

   The following section defines common types of team. Many teams may not fall clearly into one type, but
may combine elements of different types. Many organizations have traditionally been managed through a
hierarchical structure. This general structure is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

   The number of levels clearly depends upon the size and to some extent on the type of the organization.
Typically, the span of control, the number of people each manager or supervisor is directly responsible for,
averages about five people, but this can vary widely. As a general rule it is bad practice for any single
manager to supervise more than 7-10 people.

Figure 1 The traditional hierarchical structure. Note: The highlighted area shows one
supervisor's span of control: the people who work for that supervisor

   While the hierarchy is designed to provide a stable `backbone' to the organization, projects are primarily
concerned with change, and so tend to be organized quite differently. Their structure needs to be more fluid
than that of conventional management structures. There are four commonly used types of project team:
the functional team, the project (single) team, the matrix team and the contract team.
                                          DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS | 19

                                                     Exploration Activity
        Why is it problematic for a manager to supervise too many people? How does this relate to

                                 groups, is there an ideal group size or configuration?

 The project (single) teamThe hierarchical structure described above divides groups

of people along largely functional lines: people working together carry out the same or similar functions.
A functional team is a team in which work is carried out within a group organized around a similar
function or task. This can be project work. In organizations in which the functional divisions are relatively
rigid, project work can be handed from one functional team to another in order to complete the work. For
example, work on a new product can pass from marketing, which has the idea, to research and development,
which sees whether it is technically feasible, thence to design and finally manufacturing. This is sometimes
known as `baton passing' - or, less flatteringly, as `throwing it over the wall'!

   The project, or single, team consists of a group of people who come together as a distinct
organizational unit in order to work on a project or projects. The team is often led by a project manager,
though self-managing and self-organizing arrangements are also found. Quite often, a team that has been
successful on one project will stay together to work on subsequent projects. This is particularly common
where an organization engages repeatedly in projects of a broadly similar nature - for example developing
software, or in construction. Perhaps the most important issue in this instance is to develop the collective
capability of the team, since this is the currency for continued success. People issues are often crucial in
achieving this.

   The closeness of the dedicated project team normally reduces communication problems within the
team. However, care should be taken to ensure that communications with other stakeholders (senior
management, line managers and other members of staff in the departments affected, and so on) are not
neglected, as it is easy for `us and them' distinctions to develop.

The matrix team

In a matrix team, staff report to different managers for different aspects of their work. Matrix structures
are often, but not exclusively, found in projects. Matrix structures are more common in large and multi-
national organizations. In this structure, staff are responsible to the project manager for their work on
the project while their functional line manager may be responsible for other aspects of their work such as
appraisal, training, and career development, and `routine' tasks. This matrix project structure is represented
in Figure 2. Notice how the traditional hierarchy is cross-cut by the `automated widget manufacturing
configuration.'
20 | DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS

Figure 2 An example matrix project structure. The matrix team is highlighted in white.

In this form of organization, staff from various functional areas (such as design, software development,
manufacturing or marketing) are loaned or seconded to work on a particular project. Such staff may work
full- or part-time on the project. The project manager thus has a recognizable team and is responsible for
controlling and monitoring its work on the project.

   However, many of the project staff will still have other duties to perform in their normal functional
departments. The functional line managers they report to will retain responsibility for this work and for
the professional standards of their work on the project, as well as for their training and career development.
It is important to overcome the problems staff might have with the dual reporting lines (the `two-boss'
problem). This requires building good interpersonal relationships with the team members and regular,
effective communication.

The contract team

The contract team is brought in from outside in order to do the project work. Here, the responsibility
to deliver the project rests very firmly with the project manager. The client will find such a team harder to
control directly. On the other hand, it is the client who will judge the success of the project, so the project
manager has to keep an eye constantly on the physical outcomes of the project. A variant of this is the so-
called `outsourced supply team', which simply means that the team is physically situated remotely from the
project manager, who then encounters the additional problem of `managing at a distance'.

Mixed structures

Teams often have mixed structures:

 · Some members may be employed to work full time on the project and be fully responsible to the
      project manager. Project managers themselves are usually employed full time.

 · Others may work part time, and be responsible to the project manager only during their time on the
      project. For example, internal staff may well work on several projects at the same time. Alternatively,
      an external consultant working on a given project may also be involved in a wider portfolio of
      activities.

 · Some may be part of a matrix arrangement, whereby their work on the project is overseen by the
      project manager and they report to their line manager for other matters. Project administrators often
      function in this way, serving the project for its duration, but having a career path within a wider
                                          DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS | 21

      administrative service.
 · Still others may be part of a functional hierarchy, undertaking work on the project under their line

      manager's supervision by negotiation with their project manager. For instance, someone who works
      in an organization's legal department may provide the project team with access to legal advice when
      needed.

In relatively small projects the last two arrangements are a very common way of accessing specialist services
that will only be needed from time to time.

                              Modern teams

In addition to the traditional types of teams or groups outlined above, recent years have seen the growth of
interest in three other important types of team: `self-managed teams', `self-organizing teams', and `dispersed
virtual teams.'

   A typical self-managed team may be permanent or temporary. It operates in an informal and non-
hierarchical manner, and has considerable responsibility for the way it carries out its tasks. It is often found
in organizations that are developing total quality management and quality assurance approaches. The
Industrial Society Survey observed that: "Better customer service, more motivated staff, and better quality
of output are the three top motives for moving to [self-managed teams], managers report."

   In contrast, organizations that deliberately encourage the formation of self-organizing teams are
comparatively rare. Teams of this type can be found in highly flexible, innovative organizations that thrive
on creativity and informality. These are modern organizations that recognize the importance of learning
and adaptability in ensuring their success and continued survival. However, self-organizing teams exist,
unrecognized, in many organizations. For instance, in traditional, bureaucratic organizations, people who
need to circumvent the red tape may get together in order to make something happen and, in so doing,
spontaneously create a self-organizing team. The team will work together, operating outside the formal
structures, until its task is done and then it will disband.

   Table 2 shows some typical features of self-managed and self-organizing teams.
                      Table 2: Comparing Self-managed and Self-Organizing Teams

22 | DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS

   Many organizations set up self-managed or empowered teams as an important way of improving
performance and they are often used as a way of introducing a continuous improvement approach. These
teams tend to meet regularly to discuss and put forward ideas for improved methods of working or
customer service in their areas. Some manufacturers have used multi-skilled self-managed teams to improve
manufacturing processes, to enhance worker participation and improve morale. Self-managed teams give
employees an opportunity to take a more active role in their working lives and to develop new skills and
abilities. This may result in reduced staff turnover and less absenteeism.

   Self-organizing teams are usually formed spontaneously in response to an issue, idea or challenge. This
may be the challenge of creating a radically new product, or solving a tough production problem. In Japan,
the encouragement of self-organizing teams has been used as a way of stimulating discussion and debate
about strategic issues so that radical and innovative new strategies emerge. By using a self-organizing team
approach companies were able to tap into the collective wisdom and energy of interested and motivated
employees.

   Following the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual teams are increasingly common. A virtual team is one
whose primary means of communicating is electronic, with only occasional phone and face-to-face
communication, if at all. Virtual teams use technologies like, Zoom, Skype, Teams, Basecamp, etc. to
coordinate, meet, and share work (Kniffen et al., 2021). Table 3 contains a summary of benefits virtual
groups provide to organizations and individuals, as well as the potential challenges and disadvantages virtual
groups present.

disadvantages

Why do (only some) teams succeed?

Clearly, there are no hard-and-fast rules which lead to team effectiveness. The determinants of a successful
team are complex and not equivalent to following a set of prescriptions. However, the results of poor
teamwork can be expensive, so it is useful to draw on research, experience and case studies to explore some
                                          DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS | 23

general guidelines. What do I mean by `team effectiveness'? - the achievement of goals alone? Where do the
achievements of individual members fit in? and How does team member satisfaction contribute to team
effectiveness?

   Borrowing from Adair's (1983) leadership model, the left-hand side of Figure 3 shows the main
constituents of team effectiveness: the satisfaction of individual membership needs, successful team
interaction and the achievement of team tasks. These elements are not discrete, so Figure 3 shows them as
overlapping. For example, team member satisfaction will be derived not only from the achievement of tasks
but also from the quality of team relationships and the more social aspects of teamworking: people who
work almost entirely on their own, such as teleworkers and self-employed business owner-managers, often
miss the opportunity to bounce ideas off colleagues in team situations. The experience of solitude in their
work can, over time, create a sense of isolation, and impair their performance. The effectiveness of a team
should also relate to the next step, to what happens after the achievement of team goals.

Figure 3 The internal elements of team effectiveness

The three elements could be reconfigured as an iceberg, most of which is below the water's surface (the
right-hand side of Figure 3). Superficial observation of teams in organizations might suggest that most, if
not all, energy is devoted to the explicit task (what is to be achieved, by when, with what budget and what
resources). Naturally, this is important. But too often the concealed part of the iceberg (how the team will
work together) is neglected. As with real icebergs, shipwrecks can ensue.

   For instance, if working in a particular team leaves its members antagonistic towards each other and
disenchanted with the organization to the point of looking for new jobs, then it can hardly be regarded as
fully effective, even if it achieves its goals. The measure of team effectiveness could be how well the team has
prepared its members for the transition to new projects, and whether the members would relish the thought
of working with each other again.

   In addition to what happens inside a team there are external influences that impact upon team
operations. Restated, teams operate in complex systems composed on both internal and external
stakeholders, resources, and outcomes. The factors shown in Figure 4 interact with each other in ways that
affect the team and its development. We don't fully understand the complexity of these interactions and
combinations. The best that we can do is discuss each factor in turn and consider some of the interactions
between them and how they relate to team effectiveness. For instance, discussions about whether the wider
culture of an organization supports and rewards teamworking, whether a team's internal and/or external
customers clearly specify their requirements and whether the expectations of a team match those of its
sponsor will all either help or hinder a team's ongoing vitality.

COOPERATION

 Introduction

People cooperate with others throughout their life. Whether on the playground with friends, at home with
family, or at work with colleagues, cooperation is a natural instinct (Keltner et al. 2014). Children as young
as 14 months cooperate with others on joint tasks (Warneken et al. 2007). Humans' closest evolutionary
relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, maintain long-term cooperative relationships as well, sharing resources
and caring for each other's young (de Waal & Lanting, 1997; Langergraber et al. 2007). Ancient animal
remains found near early human settlements suggest that our ancestors hunted in cooperative groups
(Mithen, 1996). Cooperation, it seems, is embedded in our evolutionary heritage.

   Yet, cooperation can also be difficult to achieve; there are often breakdowns in people's ability to work
effectively in teams, or in their willingness to collaborate with others. Even with issues that can only
be solved through large-scale cooperation, such as climate change and world hunger, people can have
difficulties joining forces with others to take collective action. Psychologists have identified numerous
individual and situational factors that influence the effectiveness of cooperation across many areas of life.
From the trust that people place in others to the lines they draw between "us" and "them," many different
processes shape cooperation. This chapter will explore these individual, situational, and cultural influences
on cooperation.

The Prisoner's Dilemma

Imagine that you are a participant in a social experiment. As you sit down, you are told that you will be
playing a game with another person in a separate room. The other participant is also part of the experiment
but the two of you will never meet. In the experiment, there is the possibility that you will be awarded some
money. Both you and your unknown partner are required to make a choice: either choose to "cooperate,"
maximizing your combined reward, or "defect," (not cooperate) and thereby maximize your individual
reward. The choice you make, along with that of the other participant, will result in one of three unique
outcomes to this task, illustrated below in Figure 1. If you and your partner both cooperate (1), you will each
receive $5. If you and your partner both defect (2), you will each receive $2. However, if one partner defects
and the other partner cooperates (3), the defector will receive $8, while the cooperator will receive nothing.
Remember, you and your partner cannot discuss your strategy. Which would you choose? Striking out on
your own promises big rewards but you could also lose everything. Cooperating, on the other hand, offers
the best benefit for the most people but requires a high level of trust.

                                              This scenario, in which two people independently

                                              choose between cooperation and defection, is

                                              known as the prisoner's dilemma. It gets its name

                                              from the situation in which two prisoners who

                                              have committed a crime are given the opportunity

                                              to either (A) both confess their crime (and get a

                                              moderate sentence), (B) rat out their accomplice

                                              (and get a lesser sentence), or (C) both remain

                                              silent (and avoid punishment altogether).

                                              Psychologists use various forms of the prisoner's

                                              dilemma scenario to study self-interest and

                                              cooperation. Whether framed as a monetary game

Figure 1. The various possible outcomes of a  or a prison game, the prisoner's dilemma
prisoner's dilemma scenario                   illuminates a conflict at the core of many decisions
                                              to cooperate: it pits the motivation to

maximize personal reward against the motivation to maximize gains for the group (you and your partner

combined).

For someone trying to maximize his or her own personal reward, the most "rational" choice is to defect

(not cooperate), because defecting always results in a larger personal reward, regardless of the partner's

choice. However, when the two participants view their partnership as a joint effort (such as a friendly

relationship), cooperating is the best strategy of all, since it provides the largest combined sum of money

($10--which they share), as opposed to partial cooperation ($8), or mutual defection ($4). In other words,

although defecting represents the "best" choice from an individual perspective, it is also the worst choice to

make for the group as a whole.

This divide between personal and collective interests is a key obstacle that prevents people from

cooperating. Think back to our earlier definition of cooperation is when multiple partners work together

toward a common goal that will benefit everyone. As is frequent in these types of scenarios, even though

cooperation may benefit the whole group, individuals are often able to earn even larger, personal rewards by

defecting--as demonstrated in the prisoner's dilemma example above.

You can see a small, real-world example of the prisoner's dilemma phenomenon at live music concerts.

At venues with seating, many audience members will choose to stand, hoping to get a better view of the

musicians onstage. As a result, the people sitting directly behind those now-standing people are also forced

to stand to see the action onstage. This creates a chain reaction in which the entire audience now has to

stand, just to see over the heads of the crowd in front of them. While choosing to stand may improve one's

own concert experience, it creates a literal barrier for the rest of the audience, hurting the overall experience

of the group.

Simple models of rational self-interest predict 100% defection in cooperative tasks. That is, if people

were only interested in benefiting themselves, we would always expect to see selfish behavior. Instead,

there is a surprising tendency to cooperate in the prisoner's dilemma and similar tasks (Batson & Moran,

1999; Oosterbeek et al., 2004). Given the clear benefits to defect, why then do some people choose to

cooperate, whereas others choose to defect?
                                                                  COOPERATION | 27

Individual Differences in Cooperation

Social Value Orientation

One key factor related to individual differences in cooperation is the extent to which people value not only
their own outcomes, but also the outcomes of others. Social value orientation (SVO)describes people's
preferences when dividing important resources between themselves and others (Messick & McClintock,
1968). A person might, for example, generally be competitive with others, or cooperative, or self-sacrificing.
People with different social values differ in the importance they place on their own positive outcomes
relative to the outcomes of others. For example, you might give your friend gas money because she drives
you to school, even though that means you will have less spending money for the weekend. In this example,
you are demonstrating a cooperative orientation.

   People generally fall into one of three categories of SVO: cooperative, individualistic, or competitive. While
most people want to bring about positive outcomes for all (cooperative orientation), certain types of people
are less concerned about the outcomes of others (individualistic), or even seek to undermine others in order
to get ahead (competitive orientation).

   Are you curious about your own orientation? One technique psychologists use to sort people into one
of these categories is to have them play a series of decomposed games--short laboratory exercises that
involve making a choice from various distributions of resources between oneself and an "other." Consider
the example shown in Figure 2, which offers three different ways to distribute a valuable resource (such as
money). People with competitive SVOs, who try to maximize their relative advantage over others, are most
likely to pick option A. People with cooperative SVOs, who try to maximize joint gain for both themselves
and others, are more likely to split the resource evenly, picking option B. People with individualistic SVOs,
who always maximize gains to the self, regardless of how it affects others, will most likely pick option C.

Figure 2. Example of an SVO decomposed game used to determine how competitive or
cooperative a person is

Researchers have found that a person's SVO predicts how cooperative he or she is in both laboratory
experiments and the outside world. For example, in one laboratory experiment, groups of participants were
asked to play a commons dilemma game. In this game, participants each took turns drawing from a central
collection of points to be exchanged for real money at the end of the experiment. These points represented
a common-pool resource for the group, like valuable goods or services in society (such as farm land,
ground water, and air quality) that are freely accessible to everyone but prone to overuse and degradation.
Participants were told that, while the common-pool resource would gradually replenish after the end of
28 | COOPERATION

every turn, taking too much of the resource too quickly would eventually deplete it. The researchers found
that participants with cooperative SVOs withdrew fewer resources from the common-pool than those with
competitive and individualistic SVOs, indicating a greater willingness to cooperate with others and act in a
way that is sustainable for the group (Kramer et al., 1986; Roch & Samuelson, 1997).

   Research has also shown that people with cooperative SVOs are more likely to commute to work
using public transportation--an act of cooperation that can help reduce carbon emissions--rather than
drive themselves, compared to people with competitive and individualistic SVOs (Van Vugt, Meertens,
& Van Lange, 1995; Van Vugt et al., 1996). People with cooperative SVOs also more frequently engage
in behavior intended to help others, such as volunteering and giving money to charity (McClintock &
Allison, 1989; Van Lange et al., 2007). Taken together, these findings show that people with cooperative
SVOs act with greater consideration for the overall well-being of others and the group as a whole, using
resources in moderation and taking more effortful measures (like using public transportation to protect the
environment) to benefit the group.

Empathic Ability

Empathy is the ability to feel and understand

another's emotional experience. When we

empathize with someone else, we take on that

person's perspective, imagining the world from his

or her point of view and vicariously experiencing

his or her emotions (Davis, 1994; Goetz et al.,

2010). Research has shown that when people

empathize with their partner, they act with greater

cooperation and overall altruism--the desire to

help the partner, even at a potential cost to the self.

People that can experience and understand the

emotions of others are better able to work with

others in groups, earning higher job performance

ratings on average from their supervisors, even

after adjusting for different types of work and          Feelings of empathy lead to greater levels of
other aspects of personality (Côté & Miners,             cooperation. Research shows that even young
2006).                                                   children cooperate more when experiencing
                                                         feelings of empathy. [Image: US Army,
   When empathizing with a person in distress, the       https://goo.gl/psWXOe, CC BY 2.0,

to cooperate. In one study, just before playing an

economic game with a partner in another room, participants were given a note revealing that their partner

had just gone through a rough breakup and needed some cheering up. While half of the subjects were urged

by the experimenters to "remain objective and detached," the other half were told to "try and imagine how

the other person feels." Though both groups received the same information about their partner, those who

were encouraged to engage in empathy--by actively experiencing their partner's emotions--acted with

greater cooperation in the economic game (Batson & Moran, 1999). The researchers also found that people

who empathized with their partners were more likely to act cooperatively, even after being told that their

partner had already made a choice to not cooperate (Batson & Ahmad, 2001)! Evidence of the link between

empathy and cooperation has even been found in studies of preschool children (Marcus et al., 1979). From

a very early age, emotional understanding can foster cooperation.

Although empathizing with a partner can lead to more cooperation between two people, it can also
                                                                  COOPERATION | 29

undercut cooperation within larger groups. In groups, empathizing with a single person can lead people to
abandon broader cooperation in favor of helping only the target individual. In one study, participants were
asked to play a cooperative game with three partners. In the game, participants were asked to (A) donate
resources to a central pool, (B) donate resources to a specific group member, or (C) keep the resources
for themselves. According to the rules, all donations to the central pool would be increased by 50% then
distributed evenly, resulting in a net gain to the entire group. Objectively, this might seem to be the best
option. However, when participants were encouraged to imagine the feelings of one of their partners said
to be in distress, they were more likely to donate their tickets to that partner and not engage in cooperation
with the group--rather than remaining detached and objective (Batson et al., 1995). Though empathy can
create strong cooperative bonds between individuals, it can sometimes lead to actions that, despite being
well-intentioned, end up undermining the group's best interests.

Situational Influences of Cooperation

Communication and Commitment

Open communication between people is one of the best ways to promote cooperation (Dawes et al.,
1977; Dawes, 1988). This is because communication provides an opportunity to size up the trustworthiness
of others. It also affords us a chance to prove our own trustworthiness, by verbally committing to cooperate
with others. Since cooperation requires people to enter a state of vulnerability and trust with partners,
we are very sensitive to the social cues and interactions of potential partners before deciding to cooperate
with them.

   In one line of research, groups of participants were allowed to chat for five minutes before playing a
multi-round "public goods" game. During the chats, the players were allowed to discuss game strategies and
make verbal commitments about their in-game actions. While some groups were able to reach a consensus
on a strategy (e.g., "always cooperate"), other groups failed to reach a consensus within their allotted five
minutes or even picked strategies that ensured noncooperation (e.g., "every person for themselves"). The
researchers found that when group members made explicit commitments to each other to cooperate, they
ended up honoring those commitments and acting with greater cooperation. Interestingly, the effect of face-
to-face verbal commitments persisted even when the cooperation game itself was completely anonymous
(Kerr & Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994; Kerr et al., 1997). This suggests that those who explicitly commit to
cooperate are driven not by the fear of external punishment by group members, but by their own personal
desire to honor such commitments. In other words, once people make a specific promise to cooperate, they
are driven by "that still, small voice"--the voice of their own inner conscience--to fulfill that commitment
(Kerr et al., 1997).
30 | COOPERATION

Trust

When it comes to cooperation, trust is key

(Chaudhuri et al., 2002; Parks et al., 1996).

Working with others toward a common goal

requires a level of faith that our partners will repay

our hard work and generosity, and not take

advantage of us for their own selfish gains. Social

trust, or the belief that another person's actions

will be beneficial to one's own interests (Kramer,

1999), enables people to work together as a single

unit, pooling their resources to accomplish more

than they could individually. Trusting others,

however, depends on their actions and reputation.

One common example of the difficulties in

trusting others that you might recognize from

being a student occurs when you are assigned a          Trust is essential for cooperation, people are
group project. Many students dislike group              much more motivated to cooperate if they
projects because they worry about social                know others in the group will support one
loafing--the way that one person expends less           another. [Image: Wesley Fryer, https://goo.gl/
                                                        LKNLWp, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/rxiUsF]

effort but still benefits from the efforts of the

group. Imagine, for example, that you and five other students are assigned to work together on a difficult

class project. At first, you and your group members split the work up evenly. As the project continues,

however, you notice that one member of your team isn't doing his "fair share." He fails to show up to

meetings, his work is sloppy, and he seems generally uninterested in contributing to the project. After a

while, you might begin to suspect that this student is trying to get by with minimal effort, perhaps assuming

others will pick up the slack. Your group now faces a difficult choice: either join the slacker and abandon all

work on the project, causing it to collapse, or keep cooperating and allow for the possibility that the

uncooperative student may receive a decent grade for others' work.

If this scenario sounds familiar to you, you're not alone. Economists call this situation the free rider

problem -when individuals benefit from the cooperation of others without contributing anything in return

(Grossman & Hart, 1980). Although these sorts of actions may benefit the free rider in the short-term,

free riding can have a negative impact on a person's social reputation over time. In the above example, for

instance, the "free riding" student may develop a reputation as lazy or untrustworthy, leading others to be

less willing to work with him or her in the future.

Indeed, research has shown that a poor reputation for cooperation can serve as a warning sign for

others not to cooperate with the person in disrepute. For example, in one experiment involving a group

economic game, participants seen as being uncooperative were punished harshly by their fellow

participants. According to the rules of the game, individuals took turns being either a "donor" or a

"receiver" over the course of multiple rounds. If donors chose to give up a small sum of actual money,

receivers would receive a slightly larger sum, resulting in an overall net gain. However, unbeknownst to

the group, one participant was secretly instructed never to donate. After just a few rounds of play, this

individual was effectively shunned by the rest of the group, receiving almost zero donations from the other

members (Milinski et al., 2001). When someone is seen being consistently uncooperative, other people have

no incentive to trust him/her, resulting in a collapse of cooperation.

On the other hand, people are more likely to cooperate with others who have a good reputation for

cooperation and are therefore deemed trustworthy. In one study, people played a group economic game
                                                                   COOPERATION | 31

similar to the one described above: over multiple rounds, they took turns choosing whether to donate to
other group members. Over the course of the game, donations were more frequently given to individuals
who had been generous in earlier rounds of the game (Wedekind & Milinski, 2000). In other words,
individuals seen cooperating with others were afforded a reputational advantage, earning them more
partners willing to cooperate and a larger overall monetary reward.

Group Identification

                                               Another factor that can impact cooperation is a

                                               person's social identity, or the extent to which he

                                               or she identifies as a member of a particular social

                                               group (Tajfel & Turner, 1979/1986). People can

                                               identify with groups of all shapes and sizes: a group

                                               might be relatively small, such as a local high school

                                               class, or very large, such as a national citizenship or

                                               a political party. While these groups are often

                                               bound together by shared goals and values, they

                                               can also form according to seemingly arbitrary

                                               qualities, such as musical taste, hometown, or even

                                               completely randomized assignment, such as a coin

                                               toss (Tajfel et al., 1971; Bigler et al., 2001; Locksley

2.0, https://goo.gl/tgFydH]                    identity is emphasized (for example, when

                                               laboratory participants are referred to as "group

members" rather than "individuals"), they are less likely to act selfishly in a commons dilemma game. In

such experiments, so-called "group members" withdraw fewer resources, with the outcome of promoting

the sustainability of the group (Brewer & Kramer, 1986). In one study, students who strongly identified

with their university were less likely to leave a cooperative group of fellow students when given an attractive

option to exit (Van Vugt & Hart, 2004). In addition, the strength of a person's identification with a group

or organization is a key driver behind participation in large-scale cooperative efforts, such as collective action

in political and workers' groups (Klandersman, 2002), and engaging in organizational citizenship behaviors

(Cropanzano & Byrne, 2000).

Social identities shape who we are and how we feel about ourselves. List some groups and

  teams you are a member of that give you a sense of social identity. These can be formal
  groups (e.g., sorority, workplace, religious groups) and informal groups (e.g., basketball

            player, videogamer). Your family is also a likely source of social identity.
32 | COOPERATION

   Emphasizing group identity is not without its costs: although it can increase cooperation within groups,
it can also undermine cooperation between groups. Researchers have found that groups interacting with
other groups are more competitive and less cooperative than individuals interacting with other individuals,
a phenomenon known as interindividual-intergroup discontinuity (Schopler &; Insko,
1999; Wildschut et al. 2003). For example, groups interacting with other groups displayed greater self-
interest and reduced cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma game than did individuals completing the same
tasks with other individuals (Insko et al., 1987). Such problems with trust and cooperation are largely due
to people's general reluctance to cooperate with members of an outgroup, or those outside the boundaries
of one's own social group (Allport, 1954; Van Vugt et al., 2000). Outgroups do not have to be explicit
rivals for this effect to take place. Indeed, in one study, simply telling groups of participants that other
groups preferred a different style of painting led them to behave less cooperatively than pairs of individuals
completing the same task (Insko et al., 2005). Though a strong group identity can bind individuals within
the group together, it can also drive divisions between different groups, reducing overall trust and
cooperation on a larger scope.

   Under the right circumstances, however, even rival groups can be turned into cooperative partners in
the presence of superordinate goals. In a classic demonstration of this phenomenon, Muzafer Sherif and
colleagues observed the cooperative and competing behaviors of two groups of twelve-year-old boys at a
summer camp in Robber's Cave State Park, in Oklahoma (Sherif et al. 1961). The twenty-two boys in
the study were all carefully interviewed to determine that none of them knew each other beforehand.
Importantly, Sherif and colleagues kept both groups unaware of each other's existence, arranging for them
to arrive at separate times and occupy different areas of the camp. Within each group, the participants
quickly bonded and established their own group identity--"The Eagles" and "The Rattlers"--identifying
leaders and creating flags decorated with their own group's name and symbols.

   For the next phase of the experiment, the researchers revealed the existence of each group to the other,
leading to reactions of anger, territorialism, and verbal abuse between the two. This behavior was further
compounded by a series of competitive group activities, such as baseball and tug-of-war, leading the two
groups to engage in even more spiteful behavior: The Eagles set fire to The Rattlers' flag, and The Rattlers
retaliated by ransacking The Eagles' cabin, overturning beds and stealing their belongings. Eventually, the
two groups refused to eat together in the same dining hall, and they had to be physically separated to avoid
further conflict.

   However, in the final phase of the experiment, Sherif and colleagues introduced a dilemma to both
groups that could only be solved through mutual cooperation. The researchers told both groups that there
was a shortage of drinking water in the camp, supposedly due to "vandals" damaging the water supply. As
both groups gathered around the water supply, attempting to find a solution, members from each group
offered suggestions and worked together to fix the problem. Since the lack of drinking water affected both
groups equally, both were highly motivated to try and resolve the issue. Finally, after 45 minutes, the two
groups managed to clear a stuck pipe, allowing fresh water to flow. The researchers concluded that when
conflicting groups share a superordinate goal, they are capable of shifting their attitudes and bridging group
differences to become cooperative partners. The insights from this study have important implications for
group-level cooperation. Since many problems facing the world today, such as climate change and nuclear
proliferation, affect individuals of all nations, and are best dealt with through the coordinated efforts of
different groups and countries, emphasizing the shared nature of these dilemmas may enable otherwise
competing groups to engage in cooperative and collective action.

Culture

There are cultural differences in how and how much people cooperate. Some societies require more
cooperation to ensure survival. [Image: Cindy Cornett Seigle, http://goo.gl/u0kE9Z, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0,

Culture can have a powerful effect on people's beliefs about and ways they interact with others. Might
culture also affect a person's tendency toward cooperation? To answer this question, Joseph Henrich and
his colleagues surveyed people from 15 small-scale societies around the world, located in places such as
Zimbabwe, Bolivia, and Indonesia. These groups varied widely in the ways they traditionally interacted with
their environments: some practiced small-scale agriculture, others foraged for food, and still others were
nomadic herders of animals (Henrich et al., 2001).

   To measure their tendency toward cooperation, individuals of each society were asked to play
the ultimatum game, a task similar in nature to the prisoner's dilemma. The game has two players: Player A
(the "allocator") is given a sum of money (equal to two days' wages) and allowed to donate any amount of
it to Player B (the "responder"). Player B can then either accept or reject Player A's offer. If Player B accepts
the offer, both players keep their agreed-upon amounts. However, if Player B rejects the offer, then neither
player receives anything. In this scenario, the responder can use his/her authority to punish unfair offers,
even though it requires giving up his or her own reward. In turn, Player A must be careful to propose an
acceptable offer to Player B, while still trying to maximize his/her own outcome in the game.

   According to a model of rational economics, a self-interested Player B should always choose to accept any
offer, no matter how small or unfair. As a result, Player A should always try to offer the minimum possible
34 | COOPERATION

amount to Player B, in order to maximize his/her own reward. Instead, the researchers found that people in
these 15 societies donated on average 39% of the sum to their partner (Henrich et al., 2001). This number
is almost identical to the amount that people of Western cultures donate when playing the ultimatum game
(Oosterbeek et al., 2004). These findings suggest that allocators in the game, instead of offering the least
possible amount, try to maintain a sense of fairness and "shared rewards" in the game, in part so that their
offers will not be rejected by the responder.

   Henrich and colleagues (2001) also observed significant variation between cultures in terms of their level
of cooperation. Specifically, the researchers found that the extent to which individuals in a culture needed to
collaborate with each other to gather resources to survive predicted how likely they were to be cooperative.
For example, among the people of the Lamelara in Indonesia, who survive by hunting whales in groups of a
dozen or more individuals, donations in the ultimatum game were extremely high--approximately 58% of
the total sum. In contrast, the Machiguenga people of Peru, who are generally economically independent at
the family level, donated much less on average--about 26% of the total sum. The interdependence of people
for survival, therefore, seems to be a key component of why people decide to cooperate with others.

   Though the various survival strategies of small-scale societies might seem quite remote from your own
experiences, take a moment to think about how your life is dependent on collaboration with others. Very
few of us in industrialized societies live in houses we build ourselves, wear clothes we make ourselves, or
eat food we grow ourselves. Instead, we depend on others to provide specialized resources and products,
such as food, clothing, and shelter that are essential to our survival. Studies show that Americans give about
40% of their sum in the ultimatum game--less than the Lamelara give, but on par with most of the small-
scale societies sampled by Henrich and colleagues (Oosterbeek et al., 2004). While living in an industrialized
society might not require us to hunt in groups like the Lamelara do, we still depend on others to supply the
resources we need to survive.

Discussion Questions

1. Which groups do you identify with? Consider sports teams, home towns, and universities. How does
      your identification with these groups make you feel about other members of these groups? What
      about members of competing groups?

2. Thinking of all the accomplishments of humanity throughout history which do you believe required
      the greatest amounts of cooperation? Why?

3. In your experience working on group projects--such as group projects for a class--what have you
      noticed regarding the themes presented in this module (eg. Competition, free riding, cooperation,
      trust)? How could you use the material you have just learned to make group projects more effective?

Key Terms

Altruism
      A desire to improve the welfare of another person, at a potential cost to the self and without any
      expectation of reward.

Learning Objectives

 · Understand the reasons people make social comparisons.
 · Identify consequences of social comparison.
 · Understand the Self-Evaluation Maintenance Model.
 · Explain situational factors that can affect social comparison.

When athletes compete in a race, they are able to observe and compare their performance against those of
their competitors. In the same way, all people naturally engage in mental comparisons with the people
around them during the course of daily life. These evaluations can impact our motivation and feelings. In
this chapter, you will learn about the process of social comparison: its definition, consequences, and the
factors that affect it.

Introduction: Social Comparison

One pleasant Saturday afternoon, Mr. Jones arrives home from the car dealership in a brand-new Mercedes-
Benz C-Class, the entry-level sedan in the Mercedes family of cars. Although Mercedes-Benzes are common
in Europe, they are often viewed as status symbols in Mr. Jones' neighborhood in North America. This new
car is a huge upgrade from his previous car. Excited, Mr. Jones immediately drives around the block and into
town to show it off. He is thrilled with his purchase for a full week--that is, until he sees his neighbor across
the street, Mr. Smith, driving a brand-new Mercedes S-Class, the highest tier of Mercedes sedans. Mr. Smith
notices Mr. Jones from a distance and waves to him with a big smile. Climbing into his C-Class, Mr. Jones
suddenly feels disappointed with his purchase and even feels envious of Mr. Smith. Now his C-Class feels
just bland as his old car.

   Mr. Smith is experiencing the effects of social comparison. Occurring frequently in our lives, social
comparison shapes our perceptions, memory, and behavior--even regarding the most trivial of issues. This
40 | SOCIAL COMPARISON

chapter takes a closer look at the reasons we make social comparisons and the consequences of the social
comparison process.

Social Comparison:
Basics

In 1954, psychologist Leon Festinger hypothesized

that people compare themselves to others in order

to fulfill a basic human desire: the need for self-

evaluation. He called this process social

comparison theory. At the core of his theory is

the idea that people come to know about              Social comparison is a well-known concept to
themselves--their own abilities, successes, and      advertisers. They create idealized images that
personality--by comparing themselves with            influence consumers' self-perceptions as well as the
others. These comparisons can be divided into two    things they feel they must buy in order to be
basic categories.                                    satisfied. [Image: SenseiAlan, http://goo.gl/XOwjq5,
                                                     CC BY 2.0, http://goo.gl/T4qgSp]

In one category, we consider social norms and

the opinions of others. Specifically, we compare our own opinions and values to those of others when our

own self-evaluation is unclear. For example, you might not be certain about your position on a hotly

contested issue, such as the legality of abortion. Or, you might not be certain about which fork to use first

in a multi-course place setting. In these types of instances people are prone to look toward others--to make

social comparisons--to help fill in the gaps.

Imagine an American exchange student arriving in India for the first time, a country where the culture

is drastically different from his own. He notices quickly through observing others--i.e., social

comparison--that when greeting a person, it is normal to place his own palms together rather than shaking

the other person's hand. This comparison informs him of how he should behave in the surrounding social

context.
                                                        SOCIAL COMPARISON | 41

                                                        The second category of social comparison pertains

                                                        to our abilities and performance. In these cases, the

                                                        need for self-evaluation is driven by another

                                                        fundamental desire: to perform better and

                                                        better--as Festinger (1954) put it, "a

                                                        unidirectional drive upward." In essence, we

                                                        compare our performance not only to evaluate

                                                        ourselves but also to benchmark our performance

                                                        related to another person. If we observe or even

                                                        anticipate that a specific person is doing better

                                                        than us at some ability then we may be motivated

                                                        to boost our performance level. Take, for example,

                                                        a realistic scenario where Olivia uses social

                                                        comparison to gauge her abilities: Olivia is a high

When comparing, similarity is important. A              school student who often spends a few hours in her
professional athlete is far more likely to compare his  backyard shooting a soccer ball at her homemade
or her own performance against that of other            goal. A friend of hers suggests she try out for the
professional athletes than that of an amateur.          school's soccer team. Olivia accepts her friend's

                                                        good enough to make the team. On the day of

tryouts, Olivia gets her gear ready and starts walking towards the soccer field. As she approaches, she feels

butterflies in her stomach and her legs get wobbly. But, glancing towards the other candidates who have

arrived early to take a few practice shots at the goal, she notices that their aim is inconsistent and they

frequently miss the goal. Seeing this, Olivia feels more relaxed, and she confidently marches onto the field,

ready to show everyone her skills.

Relevance and Similarity

There are important factors, however, that determine whether people will engage in social comparison.
First, the performance dimension has to be relevant to the self (Festinger, 1954). For example, if excelling in
academics is more important to you than excelling in sports, you are more likely to compare yourself with
others in terms of academic rather than athletic performance. Relevance is also important when assessing
opinions. If the issue at hand is relevant to you, you will compare your opinion to others; if not, you most
likely won't even bother. Relevance is thus a necessary precondition for social comparison.

   A secondary question is, " to whom do people compare themselves ?" Generally speaking, people
compare themselves to those who are similar (Festinger, 1954; Goethals & Darley, 1977), whether similar
in personal characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnic background, hair color, etc.) or in terms of performance
(e.g., both being of comparable ability or both being neck-and-neck in a race). For example, a casual tennis
player will not compare her performance to that of a professional, but rather to that of another casual tennis
player. The same is true of opinions. People will cross-reference their own opinions on an issue with others
who are similar to them rather than dissimilar (e.g., ethnic background or economic status).

Direction of Comparison

Social comparison is a bi-directional phenomenon where we can compare ourselves to people who are
42 | SOCIAL COMPARISON

better than us--upward comparisons--or worse than us--downward comparisons. Engaging in either
of these two comparisons on a performance dimension can affect our self-evaluation. On one hand, upward
comparisons on relevant dimensions can threaten our self-evaluation and jeopardize self-esteem (Tesser,
1988). On the other hand, they can also lead to joy and admiration for others' accomplishments on
dimensions that are not relevant to the self, where one's self-evaluation is not under threat. For example,
an academic overachiever who distinguishes himself by having two advanced degrees, both a PhD and a law
degree, may not enjoy meeting another individual with a PhD, a law degree, and an MBA, but may well
enjoy meeting a fellow overachiever in a domain that is not self-relevant, such as a famous NASCAR racer
or professional hockey player.

   Downward comparisons may boost our self-evaluation on relevant dimensions, leading to a self-
enhancement effect (Wills, 1981), such as when an individual suffering from an illness makes downward
comparisons with those suffering even more. A person enduring treatment for cancer, for instance, might
feel better about his own side effects if he learns that an acquaintance suffered worse side effects from the
same treatment. More recent findings have also shown that downward comparisons can also lead to feelings
of scorn (Fiske, 2011), such as when those of a younger generation look down upon the elderly. In these
cases, the boost to self-evaluation is so strong that it leads to an exaggerated sense of pride.

   Interestingly, the direction of comparison and a person's emotional response can also depend on
the counterfactual thinking--"what might have been"--that comes most easily to mind. For example,
one might think that an Olympic silver medalist would feel happier than a bronze medalist. After all,
placing second is more prestigious than placing third. However, a classic study by Medvec, Madey, and
Gilovich (1995) found the opposite effect: bronze medalists were actually happier than silver medalists.
The reason for this effect is that silver medalist's focus on having fallen short of achieving the gold (so
close!), essentially turning a possible downward comparison into an upward comparison; whereas the bronze
medalists recognize they came close to not winning any medal, essentially turning a possible upward
comparison (to another medalist) into a downward comparison to those who did not even receive a medal.

Consequences of Social
Comparison

The social comparison process has been associated Table 1: The effects of social comparison.
with numerous consequences. For one, social
comparison can impact self-esteem (Tesser, 1988), especially when doing well relative to others. For
example, having the best final score in a class can certainly increase your self-esteem. Social comparison can
also lead to feelings of regret (White et al., 2006), as when comparing the negative outcome of one's
investment strategy to the positive outcome of a different strategy taken by a neighbor. Social comparison
can also lead to feelings of envy (Fiske, 2011; Salovey & Rodin, 1984), as when someone with thinning hair
envies the thick hair of a colleague.
                                                        SOCIAL COMPARISON | 43

                                                        Social comparison can also have interesting

                                                        behavioral consequences. If you were to observe a

                                                        discrepancy in performance between yourself and

                                                        another person, then you might behave more

                                                        competitively (Garcia et al., 2013), as you attempt

                                                        to minimize the discrepancy. If, for example, you

                                                        are among the top 10% on your class mid-term you

                                                        might feel competitive with the other top students.

                                                        Although competition can raise performance it can

                                                        also take more problematic forms, from inflicting

positive form of competitive motivation arises, whether that means running harder in a race or striving to

earn a higher test score.

Self-Evaluation Maintenance Model

The self-evaluation maintenance(SEM; Tesser, 1988) model builds on social comparison theory. SEM
points to a range of psychological forces that help and maintain our self-evaluation and self-esteem. In
addition to relevance and similarity, SEM reveals the importance of relationship closeness. It turns out that
relationship closeness--where two people stand on the continuum from being complete strangers to being
intimate friends--affects self-evaluations.

   For example, in one study, Tesser and Smith (1980) asked people to play a verbal game in which they
were given the opportunity to receive clues from a partner. These clues could be used to help them guess
the correct word in a word game. Half the participants were told the game was related to intelligence
whereas the other half were not. Additionally, half the participants were paired with a close friend but the
other half played with a stranger. Results show that participants who were led to believe the task was self-
relevant or having to do with intelligence provided more difficult clues when their partner was a friend
versus a stranger--suggesting a competitive uptick associated with relationship closeness. However, when
performance was implied to be irrelevant to the self, partners gave easier clues to friends than strangers.

   SEM can predict which of our friends and which of our comparison dimensions are self-relevant (Tesser
& Campbell, 2006; Zuckerman & Jost, 2001). For example, suppose playing chess is highly self-relevant
for you. In this case you will naturally compare yourselves to other chess players. Now, suppose that your
chess-playing friend consistently beats you. In fact, each time you play she beats you by a wider and wider
margin. SEM would predict that one of two things will likely happen: (1) winning at chess will no longer
be self-relevant to you, or (2) you will no longer be friends with this individual. In fact, if the first option
occurs--you lose interest in competing--you will begin to bask in the glory of your chess playing friend as
his or her performance approaches perfection.
44 | SOCIAL COMPARISON

   These psychological processes have real world
implications! They may determine who is hired in
an organization or who is promoted at work. For
example, suppose you are a faculty member of a
university law school. Your work performance is
appraised based on your teaching and on your
academic publications. Although you do not have
the most publications in your law school, you do
have the most publications in prestigious journals.

Now, suppose that you are chairing a committee to    It is common advice in the business world for

all the faculty members. How do you think social     than the manager. The SEM model suggests that
comparison might influence your choice of            managers may prefer sub-optimal candidates who
applicants? Research suggests that someone in        aren't likely to challenge their standing in the
                                                     organization. [Image: amtec_photos https://bit.ly/
                                                     372xIOm]

your hypothetical shoes would likely favor the

second candidate over the first candidate: people will actively champion the candidate who does not

threaten their standing on a relevant dimension in an organization (Garcia et al., 2010). In other words, the

SEM forces are so powerful that people will essentially advocate for a candidate whom they feel is inferior!

Individual Differences

It is also worth mentioning that social comparison and its effects on self-evaluation will often depend
on personality and individual differences. For example, people with mastery goals (Poortvliet et al., 2007 )
may not interpret an upward comparison as a threat to the self but more as challenge, and a hopeful sign
that one can achieve a certain level of performance. Another individual difference is whether one has a
fixed mindset or growth mindset (Dweck, 2007). People with fixed mindsets think that their abilities and
talents cannot change; thus, an upward comparison will likely threaten their self-evaluation and prompt
them to experience negative consequences of social comparison, such as competitive behavior, envy, or
unhappiness. People with growth mindsets, however, are likely to interpret an upward comparison as a
challenge, and an opportunity to improve themselves.

Situational factors

Social comparison researchers are actively exploring situational factors that can likewise influence degrees of
social comparison:

Number

As the number of comparison targets (i.e., the number of people with whom you can compare) increases,
social comparison tends to decrease. For example, imagine you are running a race with competitors of
similar ability as your own, and the top 20% will receive a prize. Do you think you would try harder if there
were only 10 people in the race, or if there were 100? The findings onN-Effect (Garcia & Tor, 2009; Tor &
                                                        SOCIAL COMPARISON | 45

Garcia, 2010) suggest the answer is 10 . Even though the expected value of winning is the same in both cases,
people will try harder when there are fewer people. In fact, findings suggest that as the number of SAT test-
takers at a particular venue increases, the lower the average SAT score for that venue will be (Garcia & Tor,
2009). One of the mechanisms behind the N-Effect is social comparison. As the number of competitors
increases, social comparison--one of the engines behind competitive motivation--becomes less important.
Perhaps you have experienced this if you have had to give class presentations. As the number of presenters
increases, you feel a decreasing amount of comparison pressure.

Local

   Research on the local dominance effect(Zell &        It is natural to make comparisons between oneself

comparison when the comparison is more localized        Comparisons to friends are among the most
rather than being broad and general. For example,       influential of all. [Image: Corrie M, http://goo.gl/
if you wanted to evaluate your height by using          FRbOfQ, CC BY-ND 2.0, http://goo.gl/FuDJ6c]
social comparison, you could compare your height
to a good friend, a group of friends, people in your
workplace, or even the average height of people
living in your city. Although any of these
comparisons is hypothetically possible people
generally rely on more local comparisons. They are
more likely to compare with friends or co-workers
than they are to industry or national averages. So, if
you are among the tallest in your group of friends,
it may very well give you a bigger boost to your self-
esteem, even if you're still among the shortest
individuals at the national level.

Social Category Lines

Social comparison can also happen between groups. This is especially the case when groups come from
different social categories versus the same social category. For example, if students were deciding what kind
of music to play at the high school prom, one option would be to simply flip a coin--say, heads for hip-hop,
tails for pop. In this case, everyone represents the same social category--high school seniors--and social
comparison isn't an issue. However, if all the boys wanted hip-hop and all the girls wanted pop flipping a
coin is not such an easy solution as it privileges one social category over another (Garcia & Miller, 2007).
For more on this, consider looking into the research literature about the difficulties of win-win scenarios
between different social categories (Tajfel et al., 1971; Turner et al., 1979).

Central and Related Phenomena

Frog Pond Effect

One interesting phenomenon of social comparison is the Frog Pond Effect. As the name suggests, its
46 | SOCIAL COMPARISON

premise can be illustrated using the simple analogy of a frog in a pond: as a frog, would you rather be in a
small pond where you're a big frog, or a large pond where you're a small frog? According to Marsh et al.,
(2008), people in general had a better academic self-concept if they were a big frog in a small pond (e.g., the
top student in their local high school) rather than a small frog in a large one (e.g., one of many good students
at an Ivy League university). In a large study of students, they found that school-average ability can have a
negative impact on the academic self-esteem of a student when the average ability is 1 standard deviation
higher than normal (i.e., a big pond). In other words, average students have a higher academic self-concept
when attending a below-average school (big fish in a small pond), and they have a lower academic self-
concept when attending an above-average school (small fish in a big pond) (Marsh, 1987; Marsh & Parker,
1984).

The Dunning-Kruger Effect

Another related topic to social comparison is

the Dunning-Kruger Effect. The Dunning-

Kruger effect, as explained by Dunning et al.

(2003), addresses the fact that unskilled people

often think they are on par or superior to their

peers in tasks such as test-taking abilities. That is,

they are overconfident. Basically, they fail to

accurately compare themselves or their skills

within their surroundings. For example, Dunning

et al. (2003) asked students to disclose how well

they thought they had done on an exam they'd just       The Dunning-Kruger Effect shows that the least
taken. The bottom 25% of students with the lowest       experienced and least knowledgeable people are
test scores overestimated their performance by          over-confident. These people don't know what they
approximately 30%, thinking their performance           don't know and are more likely to overestimate their

was above the 50th percentile. This estimation

problem doesn't only apply to poor performers, however. According to Dunning et al. (2003), top

performers tend to underestimate their skills or percentile ranking in their surrounding context. Some

explanations are provided by Dunning et al. (2003) for this effect on both the good and poor performers:

The poor performers, compared to their more capable peers, lack specific logical abilities similar to the logic

necessary to do some of the tasks/tests in these studies and, as such, cannot really distinguish which

questions they are getting right or wrong. This is known as the double-curse explanation. However, the

good performers do not have this particular logic problem and are actually quite good at estimating their

raw scores. Ironically, the good performers usually overestimate how well the people around them are doing

and therefore devaluate their own performance. As a result, most people tend to think they are above

average in what they do, when in actuality not everyone can be above average.

Conclusion

Social comparison is a natural psychological tendency and one that can exert a powerful influence on the
way we feel and behave. Many people act as if social comparison is an ugly phenomenon and one to be
avoided. This sentiment is at the heart of phrases like "keeping up with the Joneses" and "the rat race,"
in which it is assumed that people are primarily motivated by a desire to beat others. In truth, social
comparison has many positive aspects. Just think about it: how could you ever gauge your skills in chess
                                                        SOCIAL COMPARISON | 47

without having anyone to compare yourself to? It would be nearly impossible to ever know just how good
your chess skills are, or even what criteria determine "good" vs. "bad" chess skills. In addition, the engine of
social comparison can also provide the push you need to rise to the occasion and increase your motivation,
and therefore make progress toward your goals.

Discussion Questions

1. On what do you compare yourself with others? Qualities such as attractiveness and intelligence?
      Skills such as school performance or athleticism? Do others also make these same types of
      comparisons or does each person make a unique set? Why do you think this is?

2. How can making comparisons to others help you?
3. One way to make comparisons is to compare yourself with your own past performance. Discuss a

      time you did this. Could this example be described as an "upward" or "downward" comparison?
      How did this type of comparison affect you?

The Psychology of Groups

A thorough understanding of people requires a thorough understanding of groups. Each of us is an
autonomous individual seeking our own objectives, yet we are also members of groups--groups that
constrain us, guide us, and sustain us. Just as each of us influences the group and the people in the group, so,
too, do groups change each one of us. Joining groups satisfies our need to belong, gain information and
understanding through social comparison, define our sense of self and social identity, and achieve
goals that might elude us if we worked alone. Groups are also practically significant, for much of the
world's work is done by groups rather than by individuals. Success sometimes eludes our groups, but when
group members learn to work together as a cohesive team their success becomes more certain. People also

turn to groups when important decisions must be made, and this choice is justified as long as groups avoid
such problems as group polarization and groupthink.

Nearly all human activities--working, learning,

worshiping, relaxing, playing, and even

sleeping--occur in groups. The lone individual

who is cut off from all groups is a rarity. Most of us

live out our lives in groups, and these groups have a

profound impact on our thoughts, feelings, and

actions. Many psychologists focus their attention

on single individuals, but social psychologists

expand their analysis to include groups,

organizations, communities, and even cultures.

To examine the psychology of groups and group

membership, we begin with a basic question: What

of the key findings from studies of groups.

Researchers have asked many questions about people and groups: Do people work as hard as they can when

they are in groups? Are groups more cautious than individuals? Do groups make wiser decisions than single

individuals? In many cases the answers are not what common sense and folk wisdom might suggest.

The Psychological Significance of Groups

Many people loudly proclaim their autonomy and independence. Like Ralph Waldo Emerson, they avow,
"I must be myself. I will not hide my tastes or aversions . . . . I will seek my own" (1903/2004, p. 127). Even
though people are capable of living separate and apart from others, they join with others because groups
meet their psychological and social needs.

The Need to Belong

                                              Across individuals, societies, and even eras,

                                              humans consistently seek inclusion over exclusion,

                                              membership over isolation, and acceptance over

                                              rejection. As Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary

                                              (1995) conclude, humans have a need to

                                              belong: "a pervasive drive to form and maintain at

                                              least a minimum quantity of lasting, positive, and

                                              impactful interpersonal relationships" (p. 497).

                                              And most of us satisfy this need by joining groups.

                                              When surveyed, 87.3% of Americans reported that

                                              they lived with other people, including family

                                              members, partners, and roommates (Davis &

The need to belong is a strong psychological  Smith, 2007). The majority, ranging from 50% to

Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]                such as attending a sports event together, visiting

                                              one another for the evening, sharing a meal

together, or going out as a group to see a movie (Putnam, 2000).

People respond negatively when their need to belong is unfulfilled. People who are accepted members

of a group tend to feel happier and more satisfied. But should they be rejected by a group, they feel

unhappy, helpless, and depressed. Studies of ostracism--the deliberate exclusion from groups--indicate

this experience is highly stressful and can lead to depression, confused thinking, and even aggression

(Williams, 2007). When researchers used a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner to track neural

responses to exclusion, they found that people who were left out of a group activity displayed heightened

cortical activity in two specific areas of the brain--the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior

insula. These areas of the brain are associated with the experience of physical pain sensations (Eisenberger et

al., 2003). It hurts, quite literally, to be left out of a group.

Affiliation in Groups

Groups not only satisfy the need to belong, they also provide members with information, assistance, and
social support. Leon Festinger's theory of social comparison (1950, 1954) suggested that in many cases
people join with others to evaluate the accuracy of their personal beliefs and attitudes. Stanley Schachter
(1959) explored this process by putting individuals in ambiguous, stressful situations and asking them if
they wished to wait alone or with others. He found that people affiliate in such situations--they seek the
company of others.

   Although any kind of companionship is appreciated, we prefer those who provide us with reassurance
and support as well as accurate information. In some cases, we also prefer to join with others who are even
worse off than we are. Imagine, for example, how you would respond when the teacher hands back the test
and yours is marked 85%. Do you want to affiliate with a friend who got a 95% or a friend who got a 78%? To
maintain a sense of self-worth, people seek out and compare themselves to the less fortunate. This process is
known as downward social comparison.
                                           THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS | 55

Identity and Membership

Groups are not only founts of information during times of ambiguity, they also help us answer the
existentially significant question, "Who am I?" People are defined not only by their traits, preferences,
interests, likes, and dislikes, but also by their friendships, social roles, family connections, and group
memberships. The self is not just a "me," but also a "we."

   Even demographic qualities such as sex or age can influence us if we categorize ourselves based on
these qualities. Social identity theory, for example, assumes that we don't just classify other people into
such social categories as man, woman, Anglo, elderly, or college student, but we also categorize ourselves.
According to Tajfel and Turner (1986), social identities are directed by our memberships in particular
groups. or social categories. If we strongly identify with these categories, then we will ascribe the
characteristics of the typical member of these groups to ourselves, and so stereotype ourselves. If, for
example, we believe that college students are intellectual, then we will assume we, too, are intellectual if we
identify with that group (Hogg, 2001).

   Groups also provide a variety of means for maintaining and enhancing a sense of self-worth, as our
assessment of the quality of groups we belong to influences our collective self-esteem (Crocker &
Luhtanen, 1990). If our self-esteem is shaken by a personal setback, we can focus on our group's success and
prestige. In addition, by comparing our group to other groups, we frequently discover that we are members
of the better group, and so can take pride in our superiority. By denigrating other groups, we elevate both
our personal and our collective self-esteem (Crocker & Major, 1989).

   Mark Leary's sociometer model even suggests that "self-esteem is part of a sociometer that monitors
peoples' relational value in other people's eyes" (2007, p. 328). He maintains self-esteem is not just an index
of one's sense of personal value, but also an indicator of acceptance into groups. Lowered feelings of self-
worth, then, prompt us to search for and correct characteristics and qualities that put us at risk of social
exclusion. Self-esteem is not just high self-regard, but the self-approbation that we feel when included in
groups (Leary & Baumeister, 2000).

Evolutionary Advantages of Group Living

Groups may be humans' most useful invention, for they provide us with the means to reach goals that
would elude us if we remained alone. Individuals in groups can secure advantages and avoid disadvantages
that would plague the lone individuals. In his theory of social integration, Moreland concludes that groups
tend to form whenever "people become dependent on one another for the satisfaction of their needs"
(1987, p. 104). The advantages of group life may be so great that humans are biologically prepared to
seek membership and avoid isolation. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, because groups have
increased humans' overall fitness for countless generations, individuals who carried genes that promoted
solitude-seeking were less likely to survive and procreate compared to those with genes that prompted
them to join groups (Darwin, 1859/1963). This process of natural selection culminated in the creation
of a modern human who seeks out membership in groups instinctively, for most of us are descendants of
"joiners" rather than "loners."
56 | THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS

Motivation and Performance

Social Facilitation in Groups

Do people perform more effectively when alone or when part of a group? Norman Triplett (1898) examined
this issue in one of the first empirical studies in psychology. While watching bicycle races, Triplett noticed
that cyclists were faster when they competed against other racers than when they raced alone against
the clock. To determine if the presence of others leads to the psychological stimulation that enhances
performance, he arranged for 40 children to play a game that involved turning a small reel as quickly as
possible (see Figure 1). When he measured how quickly they turned the reel, he confirmed that children
performed slightly better when they played the game in pairs compared to when they played alone
(see Stroebe, 2012; Strube, 2005).

Figure 1: The "competition machine" Triplett used to study the impact of competition on performance.
Triplett's (1898) study was one of the first laboratory studies conducted in the field of social psychology.

Triplett succeeded in sparking interest in a phenomenon now known as social facilitation: the
enhancement of an individual's performance when that person works in the presence of other people.
However, it remained for Robert Zajonc (1965) to specify when social facilitation does and does not
occur. After reviewing prior research, Zajonc noted that the facilitating effects of an audience usually only
occur when the task requires the person to perform dominant responses(i.e., ones that are well-learned
or based on instinctive behaviors). If the task requires nondominant responses (i.e., novel, complicated,
or untried behaviors that the organism has never performed before or has performed only infrequently)
then the presence of others inhibits performance. Hence, students write poorer quality essays on complex
philosophical questions when they labor in a group rather than alone (Allport, 1924), but they make fewer
mistakes in solving simple, low-level multiplication problems with an audience or a coactor than when
they work in isolation (Dashiell, 1930). Social facilitation, then, depends on the task: other people facilitate
performance when the task is so simple that it requires only dominant responses, but others interfere when the
task requires nondominant responses.

Social Loafing

Groups usually outperform individuals. A single student, working alone on a paper, will get less done in an
hour than will four students working on a group project. One person playing a tug-of-war game against a
group will lose. A crew of movers can pack up and transport your household belongings faster than you can
by yourself. As the saying goes, "Many hands make light the work" (Littlepage, 1991; Steiner, 1972).

Groups, though, tend to be underachievers. Studies of social

as much cognitive effort trying to solve problems, as they do when

working alone. They display social loafing (Latané, 1981).

Latané, Williams, and Harkins (1979) examined both coordination losses and social loafing by arranging

for students to cheer or clap either alone or in groups of varying sizes. The students cheered alone or

in 2- or 6-person groups, or they were lead to believe they were in 2- or 6-person groups (those in the

"pseudo-groups" wore blindfolds and headsets that played masking sound). As Figure 2 indicates, groups

generated more noise than solitary subjects, but the productivity dropped as the groups became larger in

size. In dyads, each subject worked at only 66% of capacity, and in 6-person groups at 36%. Productivity

also dropped when subjects merely believed they were in groups. With noise cancelling headphones on,

if subjects thought that one other person was shouting with them, they shouted 82% as intensely, and

if they thought five other people were shouting, they reached only 74% of their capacity. These loses in

productivity were not due to coordination problems; this decline in production could be attributed only to

a reduction in effort--to social loafing (Latané et al., 1979, Experiment 2).
58 | THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS

Teamwork

Social loafing is not a rare phenomenon. When

sales personnel work in groups with shared goals,

they tend to "take it easy" if another salesperson is

nearby who can do their work (George, 1992).

People who are trying to generate new, creative

ideas in group brainstorming sessions usually put

in less effort and are thus less productive than

people who are generating new ideas individually

(Paulus & Brown, 2007). Students assigned group

projects often complain of inequity in the quality

and quantity of each member's contributions:

Some people just don't work as much as they

should to help the group reach its learning goals

(Neu, 2012). People carrying out all sorts of

physical and mental tasks expend less effort when

working in groups, and the larger the group, the

more they loaf (Karau & Williams, 1993).              Figure 2: Sound pressure per person as a function of

impediment to performance through teamwork.

A group may include many talented individuals, but they must learn how to pool their individual abilities

and energies to maximize the team's performance. Team goals must be set, work patterns structured, and a

sense of group identity developed. Individual members must learn how to coordinate their actions, and any

strains and stresses in interpersonal relations need to be identified and resolved (Salas et al., 2009).

                                                       Researchers have identified two key ingredients

                                                       to effective teamwork: a shared mental

                                                       representation of the task and group unity.

                                                       Teams improve their performance over time as they

                                                       develop a shared understanding of the team and

                                                       the tasks they are attempting. Some semblance of

                                                       this shared mental model is present nearly from

                                                       its inception, but as the team practices, differences

                                                       also, in most cases, cohesive groups (Dion,

ones that lack cohesion. This cohesion-performance relationship, however, is a complex one. Meta-analytic

studies suggest that cohesion improves teamwork among members, but that performance quality influences
                                           THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS | 59

cohesion more than cohesion influences performance (Mullen & Copper, 1994; Mullen et al., 1998; see
Figure 3). Cohesive groups also can be spectacularly unproductive if the group's norms stress low
productivity rather than high productivity (Seashore, 1954).

Figure 3: The relationship between group cohesion and performance over time. Groups that are cohesive
do tend to perform well on tasks now (Time 1) and in the future (Time 2). Notice, though, that the
relationship between Performance at Time 1 and Cohesiveness at Time 2 is greater (r=.51) than the
relationship between Cohesion at Time 1 and Performance at Time 2 (r=.25). These findings suggest that
cohesion improves performance, but that a group that performs well is likely to also become more
cohesive. Mullen et al., (1998)

Group Development

In most cases groups do not become smooth-functioning teams overnight. As Bruce Tuckman's (1965)
theory of group development suggests, groups usually pass through several stages of development as they
change from a newly formed group into an effective team. As noted in Focus Topic 1, in the forming phase,
the members become oriented toward one another. In the storming phase, the group members find
themselves in conflict, and some solution is sought to improve the group environment. In
the norming, phase standards for behavior and roles develop that regulate behavior. In
the performing, phase the group has reached a point where it can work as a unit to achieve desired goals,
and the adjourning phase ends the sequence of development; the group disbands. Throughout these
stages groups tend to oscillate between the task-oriented issues and the relationship issues, with members
sometimes working hard but at other times strengthening their interpersonal bonds (Tuckman & Jensen,
1977).
60 | THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS

Focus Topic 1: Group Development Stages and
Characteristics

       Stage 1 - "Forming". Members expose information about themselves in polite but
       tentative interactions. They explore the purposes of the group and gather information about
       each other's interests, skills, and personal tendencies.
       Stage 2 - "Storming". Disagreements about procedures and purposes surface, so criticism
       and conflict increase. Much of the conflict stems from challenges between members who are
       seeking to increase their status and control in the group.
       Stage 3 - "Norming". Once the group agrees on its goals, procedures, and leadership,
       norms, roles, and social relationships develop that increase the group's stability and
       cohesiveness.
       Stage 4 - "Performing". The group focuses its energies and attention on its goals,
       displaying higher rates of task-orientation, decision-making, and problem-solving.
       Stage 5 - "Adjourning". The group prepares to disband by completing its tasks, reduces
       levels of dependency among members, and dealing with any unresolved issues.
       Sources based on Tuckman (1965) and Tuckman & Jensen (1977)

We also experience change as we pass through a group: We don't become full-fledged members of a group
in an instant. Instead, we gradually become a part of the group and remain in the group until we leave it.
Moreland and Levine's (1982) model of group socialization describes this process, beginning with initial
entry into the group and ending when the member exits it. For example, when you are thinking of joining
a new group--a social club, a professional society, a fraternity or sorority, or a sports team--you investigate
what the group has to offer, but the group also investigates you. During this investigation stage you are
still an outsider: interested in joining the group, but not yet committed to it in any way. But once the
group accepts you and you accept the group, socialization begins: you learn the group's norms and take on
different responsibilities depending on your role. On a sports team, for example, you may initially hope to
be a star who starts every game or plays a particular position, but the team may need something else from
you. In time, though, the group will accept you as a full-fledged member and both sides in the process--you
and the group itself--increase their commitment to one another. When that commitment wanes, however,
your membership may come to an end as well.

Making Decisions in Groups

Groups are particularly useful when it comes to making a decision, for groups can draw on more resources
than can a lone individual. A single individual may know a great deal about a problem and possible
solutions, but his or her information is far surpassed by the combined knowledge of a group. Groups
not only generate more ideas and possible solutions by discussing the problem, but they can also more
objectively evaluate the options that they generate during discussion. Before accepting a solution, a group
                                           THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS | 61

may require that a certain number of people favor it, or that it meets some other standard of acceptability.
People generally feel that a group's decision will be superior to an individual's decision.

   Groups, however, do not always make good decisions. For example, juries sometimes render verdicts that
run counter to the evidence presented. Community groups take radical stances on issues before thinking
through all the ramifications. Military strategists concoct plans that seem, in retrospect, ill-conceived and
short-sighted. Why do groups sometimes make poor decisions?

Group Polarization

Let's say you are part of a group assigned to make a presentation. One of the group members suggests
showing a short video that, although amusing, includes some provocative images. Even though initially you
think the clip is inappropriate, you begin to change your mind as the group discusses the idea. The group
decides, eventually, to throw caution to the wind and show the clip--and your instructor is horrified by
your choice.

   This hypothetical example is consistent with studies of groups making decisions that involve risk.
Common sense notions suggest that groups exert a moderating, subduing effect on their members.
However, when researchers looked at groups closely, they discovered many groups shift toward more
extreme decisions rather than less extreme decisions after group interaction. Discussion, it turns out,
doesn't moderate people's judgments after all. Instead, it leads to group polarization: judgments made
after group discussion will be more extreme in the same direction as the average of individual judgments
made prior to discussion (Myers & Lamm, 1976). If a majority of members feel that taking risks is more
acceptable than exercising caution, then the group will become riskier after a discussion. For example, in
France, where people generally like their government but dislike Americans, group discussion improved
their attitude toward their government but exacerbated their negative opinions of Americans (Moscovici &
Zavalloni, 1969). Similarly, prejudiced people who discussed racial issues with other prejudiced individuals
became even more negative, but those who were relatively unprejudiced exhibited even more acceptance of
diversity when in groups (Myers & Bishop, 1970).

Groupthink

                                                     Groups sometimes make spectacularly bad

                                                     decisions. In 1961, a special advisory committee to

                                                     President John F. Kennedy planned and

                                                     implemented a covert invasion of Cuba at the Bay

                                                     of Pigs that ended in total disaster. In 1986, NASA

                                                     carefully, and incorrectly, decided to launch the

                                                     Challenger space shuttle in temperatures that were

                                                     too cold.

                                                     Irving Janis (1982), intrigued by these kinds of

                                                     blundering groups, carried out a number of case

                                                     studies of such groups: the military experts that

                                                     planned the defense of Pearl Harbor; Kennedy's

                                                     Bay of Pigs planning group; the presidential team

                                                     that escalated the war in Vietnam. Each group, he

                                                     syndrome groupthink: "a mode of thinking that

people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for

unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action" (p. 9).

Janis identified both the telltale symptoms that signal the group is experiencing groupthink and the

interpersonal factors that combine to cause groupthink. These symptoms include overestimating the

group's skills and wisdom, biased perceptions and evaluations of other groups and people who are outside

of the group, strong conformity pressures within the group, and poor decision-making methods.

Janis also singled out four group-level factors that combine to cause groupthink: cohesion, isolation,

biased leadership, and decisional stress.

· Cohesion: Groupthink only occurs in cohesive groups. Such groups have many advantages over
    groups that lack unity. People enjoy their membership much more in cohesive groups, they are less
    likely to abandon the group, and they work harder in pursuit of the group's goals. But extreme
    cohesiveness can be dangerous. When cohesiveness intensifies, members become more likely to accept
    the goals, decisions, and norms of the group without reservation. Conformity pressures also rise as
    members become reluctant to say or do anything that goes against the grain of the group, and the
    number of internal disagreements--necessary for good decision making--decreases.

· Isolation. Groupthink groups too often work behind closed doors, keeping out of the limelight.
    They isolate themselves from outsiders and refuse to modify their beliefs to bring them into line with
    society's beliefs. They avoid leaks by maintaining strict confidentiality and working only with people
    who are members of their group.

· Biased leadership. A biased leader who exerts too much authority over group members can increase
    conformity pressures and railroad decisions. In groupthink groups, the leader determines the agenda
    for each meeting, sets limits on discussion, and can even decide who will be heard.

· Decisional stress. Groupthink becomes more likely when the group is stressed, particularly by time
    pressures. When groups are stressed they minimize their discomfort by quickly choosing a plan of
    action with little argument or dissension. Then, through collective discussion, the group members
    can rationalize their choice by exaggerating the positive consequences, minimizing the possibility of
                                           THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GROUPS | 63

      negative outcomes, concentrating on minor details, and overlooking larger issues.

Groupthink, thus, represents and issue with group process. Members in groups that fall victim to
groupthink do not spend enough time, energy, or effort on meaningful process (Kramer & Dougherty,
2013). It is also important to note that cohesion alone is not sufficient to prompt groupthink. Teams who
are vigilant against biased decision making can avoid problematic groupthink process.

You and Your Groups

                                                      Most of us belong to at least one group that

                                                      must make decisions from time to time: a

                                                      raising project; a union or employee group that

                                                      must ratify a new contract; a family that must

appointing devil's advocates, and breaking the group up into small discussion groups.

If these precautions are taken, your group has a much greater chance of making an informed, rational

decision. Furthermore, although your group should review its goals, teamwork, and decision-making

strategies, the human side of groups--the strong friendships and bonds that make group activity so

enjoyable--shouldn't be overlooked. Groups have instrumental, practical value, but also emotional,

psychological value. In groups we find others who appreciate and value us. In groups, we gain the support

we need in difficult times, but also have the opportunity to influence others. In groups we find evidence of

our self-worth, and secure ourselves from the threat of loneliness and despair. For most of us, groups are the

secret source of well-being.

SHARED INFORMATION BIAS

Original content remixed from FEMA's guide on Group Decision Making, The
Noba Project, and Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Group decision-making is complex. There are certain conditions that make group decision-making more
desirable:

1. The situation is complex.
2. Consequences are significant.
3. Commitment and buy-in are important.
4. There is time for deliberation and consensus building.

When there is sufficient motivation for group decision-making, it is critical to be aware of some of the biases

or complexities that group conversation can invite. This chapter briefly reviews Shared Information Bias

and the Hidden Profile Task. As you read, try to consider why this bias is important to keep in mind.

One of the advantages of making decisions in

groups is the group's greater access to information.

When seeking a solution to a problem, group

members can put their ideas on the table and share

their knowledge and judgments with each other

through discussions. But all too often groups

spend much of their discussion time examining

shared information--information that two or

more group members know in common--rather

than unshared information. This shared                Picture of people deliberating. Credit: Horasis
information bias will result in a bad outcome if      https://bit.ly/3rH1FNl
something known by only one or two group

members is very important.

Researchers have studied this bias using the hidden profile task. On such tasks, information known

to many of the group members suggests that one alternative, say Option A, is best. However, Option B is

definitely the better choice, but all the facts that support Option B are only known to individual groups

members--they are not common knowledge in the group. As a result, the group will likely spend most of

its time reviewing the factors that favor Option A, and never discover any of its drawbacks. In consequence,

groups often perform poorly when working on problems with nonobvious solutions that can only be

identified by extensive information sharing (Stasser & Titus, 1987).

Sharing information with other group members is associated with group member perceptions of

competence, knowledge, and credibility (Wittenbaum & Park, 2001). According to Broderick et al., (2007),

information known to only a single member of a group prior to group discussion will be mentioned less

often and evaluated less favorably compared with information known to multiple group members prior to a
                                               SHARED INFORMATION BIAS | 71

group discussion.This phenomenon describes shared information bias (Baker, 2010). Shared information
bias (or the hidden profile problem) is thus a tendency for group members to spend more time and
energy discussing information that multiple members are already familiar with (i.e., shared information).
Researchers predict poor decision-making can arise when the group does not have access to unshared
information for making well-informed decisions. The result of inaccessible unshared information is called
hidden profiles. Hidden profiles describe group decision tasks in which different (but correct) possible
solutions exist, but no group member detects it based on his or her individual information prior to the
discussion (Stasser, 1988).

Causes

Although discussing unshared information may be enlightening, groups are often motivated to discuss
shared information in order to reach group consensus on some course of action. According to Postmes et
al., (2001), when group members are motivated by a desire to reach closure (e.g., a desire imposed by time
constraints), their bias for discussing shared information is stronger. However, if members are concerned
with making the best decision possible, this bias becomes less salient.

   Stewart and Stasser (1998) have asserted that the shared information bias is strongest for group members
working on ambiguous, judgment-oriented tasks because their goal is to reach consensual agreement than
to distinguish a correct solution. The shared information bias may also develop during group discussion
in response to the interpersonal and psychological needs of individual group members. For example, some
group members tend to seek group support for their own personal opinions. This psychological motivation
to garner collective acceptance of one's own initial views has been linked to group preferences for shared
information during decision-making activities (Greitemeyer & Schulz-Hardt, 2003; Henningsen &
Henningsen, 2003).

   Lastly, the nature of the discussion between group members reflects whether biases for shared
information will surface. According to Wittenbaum et al. (2004), members are motivated to establish and
maintain reputations, to secure tighter bonds, and to compete for success against other group members. As
a result, individuals tend to be selective when disclosing information to other group members.

Outcomes

                                                          Focusing on shared information leads teams to

                                                          make poorer decisions and often to ignore critical

                                                          information that might help facilitate better

                                                          decision outcomes. Wittenbaum et al. (1999)

                                                          examined mutual enhancement during various

                                                          discussions about job candidates (i.e., interactions

                                                          between two people). Participant dyads were

                                                          assigned to one of two conditions. Before meeting

                                                          to discuss candidate profiles, researchers had dyads

                                                          in the first condition look at same information

                                                          about candidates, while the second condition had

                                                          dyads receive different information. Participants in

                                                          condition one evaluated both their partner and self

                                                          as more component and credible.

Shared information bias is about sharing what you            Teams which engage in shared information bias
know, even if you think it might be irrelevant,           are often unable to come to the best conclusion
tangential, or unrelated. Credit: pedrik https://bit.ly/  because they do not share all relevant information.
2UV28zt                                                   The shared information bias demonstrates the

importances of thoughtful and sustained deliberation. Shared information bias also highlights how we

often are unsure what we need to share to help solve the problem. Thus, sharing openly any potentially

helpful information is essential if teams expect to succeed. If you think it might be useful-share it with the

group!

Avoidance strategies

Several strategies can be employed to reduce group focus on discussing shared information:

 · Make effort to spend more time actively discussing collective decisions. Given that group members
      tend to discuss shared information first, longer meetings increase likelihood of reviewing unshared
      information as well.

 · Make effort to avoid generalized discussions by increasing the diversity of opinions within the group
      (Smith, 2008).

 · Introduce the discussion of a new topic to avoid returning to previously discussed items among
      members (Reimer, Reimer, & Hinsz, 2010).

 · Avoid time pressure or time constraints that motivate group members to discuss less information
      (Kelly & Karau, 1999; Bowman & Wittenbaum, 2012).

 · Clarify to group members when certain individuals have relevant expertise (Stewart & Stasser, 1995).
 · Include more group members who have task-relevant experience (Wittenbaum, 1998).
 · Technology (e.g., group decision support systems, GDSS) can also offer group members a way to

      catalog information that must be discussed. These technological tools (e.g., search engines, databases,
      computer programs that estimate risk) help facilitate communication between members while
      structuralizing the group's decision-making process (Hollingshead, 2001).

Learning Objectives

 · Learn about inattentional blindness and why it occurs.
 · Identify ways in which failures of awareness are counterintuitive.
 · Better understand the link between focused attention and failures of awareness.

Hearing and listening are fundamentally different processes. Hearing is the biological process of sound
reverberating in our ear drums, listening is a psychological process that involves hearing and attending to
what another person is saying. We think important objects and events in our world will automatically
grab our attention, but they often don't, particularly when our attention is focused on something else.
The failure to notice unexpected objects or events when attention is focused elsewhere is now known as
inattentional blindness. The study of such failures of awareness has a long history, but their practical
importance has received increasing attention over the past decade. This chapter describes the history and
status of research on inattentional blindness, discusses the reasons why we find these results to be
counterintuitive, and the implications of failures of awareness for how we see and act in our world.

Do you regularly spot editing errors in movies? Can you multitask effectively, texting while talking with
your friends or watching television? Are you fully aware of your surroundings? If you answered yes to any
of those questions, you're not alone. And, you're most likely wrong. More than 50 years ago, experimental
psychologists began documenting the many ways that our perception of the world is limited, not by our
eyes and ears, but by our minds. We appear able to process only one stream of information at a time,
effectively filtering other information from awareness. To a large extent, we perceive only that which
receives the focus of our cognitive efforts: our attention.

Imagine the following task, known as dichotic

listening (e.g., Cherry, 1953; Moray, 1959;

Treisman, 1960): You put on a set of headphones

that play two completely different speech streams,

one to your left ear and one to your right ear. Your

task is to repeat each syllable spoken into your left

ear as quickly and accurately as possible,

mimicking each sound as you hear it. When

performing this attention-demanding task, you

won't notice if the speaker in your right ear

switches to a different language or is replaced by a

different speaker with a similar voice. You won't

notice if the content of their speech becomes

nonsensical. In effect, you are deaf to the substance

of the ignored speech. But, that is not because of     Some researchers contend that there really is no
the limits of your auditory senses. It is a form of    such thing as multi-tasking. Instead, people are just
cognitive deafness, due to the nature of focused       rapidly switching their attention between tasks,
selective listening. Even if the speaker on your       rather than holding those tasks in their attention at
right headphone says your name, you will notice it     the same time. [Image: Mike Licht, https://goo.gl/

only about one-third of the time (Conway et al.,

2001). And, at least by some accounts, you only notice it that often because you still devote some of your

limited attention to the ignored speech stream (Holendar, 1986). In this task, you will tend to notice only

large physical changes (e.g., a switch from a male to a female speaker), but not substantive ones, except in

rare cases.

This selective listening task highlights the power of attention to filter extraneous information from

awareness while letting in only those elements of our world that we want to hear. Focused attention is

crucial to our powers of observation, making it possible for us to zero in on what we want to see or

hear while filtering out irrelevant distractions. But, it has consequences as well: We can miss what would

otherwise be obvious and important signals.

The same pattern holds for vision. In a groundbreaking series of studies in the 1970s and early 1980s,

Neisser and his colleagues devised a visual analogue of the dichotic listening task (Neisser & Becklen, 1975).

Their subjects viewed a video of two distinct, but partially transparent and overlapping, events. For example,

one event might involve two people playing a hand-clapping game and the other might show people passing

a ball. Because the two events were partially transparent and overlapping, both produced sensory signals

on the retina regardless of which event received the participant's attention. When participants were asked

to monitor one of the events by counting the number of times the actors performed an action (e.g., hand

clapping or completed passes), they often failed to notice unexpected events in the ignored video stream

(e.g., the hand-clapping players stopping their game and shaking hands). As for dichotic listening, the

participants were unaware of events happening outside the focus of their attention, even when looking right

at them. They could tell that other "stuff" was happening on the screen, but many were unaware of the

meaning or substance of that stuff.

                                                       To test the power of selective attention to induce

                                                       failures of awareness, Neisser and colleagues

                                                       (Neisser, 1979) designed a variant of this task in

                                                       which participants watched a video of two teams of

                                                       players, one wearing white shirts and one wearing

                                                       black shirts. Subjects were asked to press a key

                                                       whenever the players in white successfully passed a

                                                       ball, but to ignore the players in black. As for the

                                                       other videos, the teams were filmed separately and

                                                       then superimposed so that they literally occupied

                                                       the same space (they were partially transparent).

                                                       Partway through the video, a person wearing a

                                                       raincoat and carrying an umbrella strolled through

                                                       the scene. People were so intently focused on

changed, you didn't even notice it had? [Image: Tilde
Ann Thurium, https://goo.gl/pb8I6Q, CC BY-NC-SA           These surprising findings were well known in
2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]                            the field, but for decades, researchers dismissed

                                                       their implications because the displays had such an

odd, ghostly appearance. Of course, we would notice if the displays were fully opaque and vivid rather than

partly transparent and grainy. Surprisingly, no studies were built on Neisser's method for nearly 20 years.

Inspired by these counterintuitive findings and after discussing them with Neisser himself, Christopher

Chabris and I revisited them in the late 1990s (Simons & Chabris, 1999). We replicated Neisser's work,

again finding that many people missed the umbrella woman when all of the actors in the video were partially

transparent and occupying the same space. But, we added another wrinkle: a version of the video in which

all of the actions of both teams of players were choreographed and filmed with a single camera. The players

moved in and around each other and were fully visible. In the most dramatic version, we had a woman in a

gorilla suit walk into the scene, stop to face the camera, thump her chest, and then walk off the other side

after nine seconds on screen. Fully half the observers missed the gorilla when counting passes by the team in

white.

This phenomenon is now known as inattentional blindness, the surprising failure to notice an

unexpected object or event when attention is focused on something else (Mack & Rock, 1998). The past

15 years has seen a surge of interest in such failures of awareness, and we now have a better handle on the

factors that cause people to miss unexpected events as well as the range of situations in which inattentional

blindness occurs. People are much more likely to notice unexpected objects that share features with the

attended items in a display (Most et al., 2001). For example, if you count passes by the players wearing

black, you are more likely to notice the gorilla than if you count passes by the players wearing white because

the color of the gorilla more closely matches that of the black-shirted players (Simons & Chabris, 1999).

However, even unique items can go unnoticed. In one task, people monitored black shapes and ignored

white shapes that moved around a computer window (Most et al., 2001). Approximately 30 percent of

them failed to detect the bright red cross traversing the display, even though it was the only colored item and

was visible for five seconds.

Another crucial influence on noticing is the effort you put into the attention-demanding task. If you have

to keep separate counts of bounce passes and aerial passes, you are less likely to notice the gorilla (Simons &

Chabris, 1999), and if you are tracking faster moving objects, you are less likely to notice (Simons & Jensen,
                                              INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS | 77

2009). You can even miss unexpected visual objects when you devote your limited cognitive resources to a
memory task (Fougnie & Marois, 2007), so the limits are not purely visual. Instead, they appear to reflect
limits on the capacity of attention. Without attention to the unexpected event, you are unlikely to become
aware of it (Mack & Rock, 1998; Most et al. 2005).

   In a recent study, Chabris and colleagues (2011) simulated a famous police misconduct case in which
a Boston police officer was convicted of lying because he claimed not to have seen a brutal beating (Lehr,
2009). At the time, he had been chasing a murder suspect and ran right past the scene of a brutal assault. In
Chabris' simulation, subjects jogged behind an experimenter who ran right past a simulated fight scene. At
night, 65 percent missed the fight scene. Even during broad daylight, 44 percent of observers jogged right
passed it without noticing, lending some plausibility to the Boston cop's story that he was telling the truth
and never saw the beating.

   Perhaps more importantly, auditory distractions can induce real-world failures to see. In a dramatic
illustration of cell phone-induced inattentional blindness, Ira Hymen observed that people talking on a cell
phone as they walked across a college campus were less likely than other pedestrians to notice a unicycling
clown who rode across their path (Hyman, et al., 2011).

   Recently, the study of this sort of awareness failure has returned to its roots in studies of listening, with
studies documenting inattentional deafness: When listening to a set of spatially localized conversations
over headphones, people often fail to notice the voice of a person walking through the scene repeatedly
stating "I am a gorilla" (Dalton & Fraenkel, 2012). Under conditions of focused attention, we see and hear
far less of the unattended information than we might expect (Macdonald & Lavie, 2011; Wayand et al.,
2005).

                                                                Thus, the greater the demands on attention, the
                                                                less likely people are to notice objects falling
                                                                outside their attention (Macdonald & Lavie,
                                                                2011; Simons & Chabris, 1999; Simons & Jensen,
                                                                2009). The more like the ignored elements of a
                                                                scene, the less likely people are to notice. And, the
                                                                more distracted we are, the less likely we are to be
                                                                aware of our surroundings. Under conditions of
                                                                distraction, we effectively develop tunnel vision.

Now you see me, now you don't! Although the          Inattention Outcomes and
research on attention has only developed over the    Group Dynamics

                                                     of individual differences in noticing (Simons &

Jensen, 2009). Do some people consistently notice the unexpected while others are obliviously unaware of

their surroundings? Or, are we all subject to inattentional blindness due to structural limits on the nature

of attention? The question remains controversial. A few studies suggest that those people who have a greater

working memory capacity are more likely to notice unexpected objects (Hannon & Richards,

2010; Richards et al., 2010). In effect, those who have more resources available when focusing attention are

more likely to spot other aspects of their world. However, other studies find no such relationship: Those

with greater working memory capacity are not any more likely to spot an unexpected object or event

(Seegmiller et al., 2011; Bredemeier & Simons, 2012). There are theoretical reasons to predict each pattern.
78 | INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS

With more resources available, people should be more likely to notice (see Macdonald & Lavie, 2011).
However, people with greater working memory capacity also tend to be better able to maintain their focus
on their prescribed task, meaning that they should be less likely to notice. At least one study suggests that
the ability to perform a task does not predict the likelihood of noticing (Simons & Jensen, 2009; for a
replication, see Bredemeier & Simons, 2012). In a study I conducted with Melinda Jensen, we measured
how well people could track moving objects around a display, gradually increasing the speed until people
reached a level of 75% accuracy. Tracking ability varied greatly: Some people could track objects at more
than twice the speed others could. Yet, the ability to track objects more easily was unrelated to the odds
of noticing an unexpected event. Apparently, as long as people try to perform the tracking task, they are
relatively unlikely to notice unexpected events.

   Given the limits on attention coupled with our mistaken impression that important events will capture
our attention, how has our species survived? Why weren't our ancestors eaten by unexpected predators?
One reason is that our ability to focus attention intently might have been more evolutionarily useful than
the ability to notice unexpected events. After all, for an event to be unexpected, it must occur relatively
infrequently. Moreover, most events don't require our immediate attention, so if inattentional blindness
delays our ability to notice the events, the consequences could well be minimal. In a social context, others
might notice that event and call attention to it. Although inattentional blindness might have had minimal
consequences over the course of our evolutionary history, it does have consequences now.

   At pedestrian speeds and with minimal distraction, inattentional blindness might not matter for survival.
But in modern society, we face greater distractions and move at greater speeds, and even a minor delay in
noticing something unexpected can mean the difference between a fender-bender and a lethal collision. If
talking on a phone increases your odds of missing a unicycling clown, it likely also increases your odds of
missing the child who runs into the street or the car that runs a red light. Why, then, do people continue
to talk on the phone when driving? The reason might well be the same mistaken intuition that makes
inattentional blindness surprising: Drivers simply do not notice how distracted they are when they are
talking on a phone, so they believe they can drive just as well when talking on a phone even though they
can't (Strayer & Johnston, 2001).

   So, what can you do about inattentional blindness? The short answer appears to be, "not much." There
is no magical elixir that will overcome the limits on attention, allowing you to notice everything (and that
would not be a good outcome anyway). But, there is something you can do to mitigate the consequences
of such limits. Now that you know about inattentional blindness, you can take steps to limit its impact by
recognizing how your intuitions will lead you astray.

                                         First, maximize the attention you do have

                                         available by avoiding distractions, especially under

                                         conditions for which an unexpected event might

                                         be catastrophic. The ring of a new call or the ding

                                         of a new text are hard to resist, so make it

                                         impossible to succumb to the temptation by

                                         turning your phone off or putting it somewhere

                                         out of reach when you are driving. If you know

                                         that you will be tempted and you know that using

Distracted Driving Retrieved from        your phone will increase inattentional blindness,
https://unsplash.com/photos/BNrlDv8w07Y  you must be proactive. Second, pay attention to
                                         what others might not notice. If you are a bicyclist,

don't assume that the driver sees you, even if they appear to make eye contact. Looking is not the same as
                                              INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS | 79

seeing. Only by understanding the limits of attention and by recognizing our mistaken beliefs about what
we "know" to be true can we avoid the modern-day consequences of those limits.

   Groups need to acknowledge their inability (as a collective) to take in all information. Setting an agenda,
taking notes, leaving space for conversation, asking followup questions, and taking advantage of our ability
to focus or attend to one another can all help avoid issues of inattentional blindness as a group. In many
ways, avoiding inattentional blindness is a matter of being more effective listeners. We must both devote
attention, listen to, and focus on one another to avoid the problems that inattention can cause which might
inhibit teams from hearing one another (both as a biological process and as a mental process) and attending
to all relevant information.

Discussion Questions

1. Many people, upon learning about inattentional blindness, try to think of ways to eliminate it,
      allowing themselves complete situation awareness. Why might we be far worse off if we were not
      subject to inattentional blindness?

2. If inattentional blindness cannot be eliminated, what steps might you take to avoid its consequences?
3. Can you think of situations in which inattentional blindness is highly likely to be a problem? Can

      you think of cases in which inattentional blindness would not have much of an impact?

Vocabulary

Dichotic listening
      A task in which different audio streams are presented to each ear. Typically, people are asked to
      monitor one stream while ignoring the other.

Inattentional blindness
      The failure to notice a fully visible, but unexpected, object or event when attention is devoted to
      something else.

Inattentional deafness
      The auditory analog of inattentional blindness. People fail to notice an unexpected sound or voice
      when attention is devoted to other aspects of a scene.

Selective listening
      A method for studying selective attention in which people focus attention on one auditory stream of
      information while deliberately ignoring other auditory information.

Creating successful teams: A holistic view

Teams are systems. Thinking about your team as part of a system helps encourage members to consider the
context in which they work. Systems are a group of interacting or interrelated elements that interact to
form a unified whole. A system is surrounded and influenced by its environment. Systems are described by
its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are divided into three parts:
inputs, throughputs and outputs. These highlight the different issues and activities teams and leaders needs to
engage with or oversee during the life of a team.

The open systems approach to team work: Inputs, throughputs,
and outputs

                                                   The systems perspective ask us to think of teams

                                                   as part of the wider context of an organization or

                                                   the community. Considering a systems perspective

                                                   ensures that team-leaders can find the resources to

                                                   help the team function successfully. A systems

                                                   perspective asks: what needs to be controlled,

                                                   monitored and/or influenced within and outside

                                                   the team? At the same time, leaders needs to

                                                   consider the team in terms task phases and

                                                   processes, from start to finish. Considering how

                                                   the team is developing, where the team is in terms

                                                   of project development, and how the internal and

                                                   external environment affect the team all improve

                                                   team function.

                                                   its component parts. The open systems model of

team work can help to explain and characterize effective team-work processes (Schermerhorn et al., 1995;

Ingram et al., 1997).

Schermerhorn and colleagues suggest that teamwork can be considered as a three-stage sequence: Inputs

-> Throughputs -> Outputs. This is illustrated in Figure 2 below.

Inputs are factors which are controlled and influenced by management. (Throughputs) refer to the

activities and tasks that help to transform inputs into outputs. They may have the greatest influence on
                                                          TEAMS AS SYSTEMS | 83

effective team work as they include team processes such as developing and maintaining cohesiveness, and
communication. They also involve task activities which get the work done and maintenance activities which
support the development and smooth functioning of the team. Outputs are those (successful) outcomes
which satisfy organizational or personal goals or other predetermined criteria.

Inputs

   Inputs are often controlled or influenced by
management. This may be the direct manager of
the group or team or the result of senior
management decisions and strategies. This means
in practice that the way a team is put together and
will function is influenced by the organization's
values, vision and strategy, and its practices and Figure 2: Inputs, Throughputs, and Outputs
procedures.

   Two main factors to consider at this stage are communication climate and group
configuration. Communication climate refers to the communicative norms for a workplace, usually this
focuses on how willing or unwilling people are to raise issues or concerns and to speak freely. Group
configuration refers to the roles adopted by group members. Some groups have strong hierarchy (the
leader makes all decisions) other groups distribute decisions among all members (i.e., democratic or
egalitarian). The communication climate and configuration of members determines how inputs can be
leveraged.

   Some input-related questions for you to consider at this stage are given in Table 1:

       Table 1 Input-related questions
                      How much support is there for this project among senior management?
                      Who might need to be influenced?
                      What objectives will it fulfill?
                      What resources will be provided for it? What others might be needed? Where
                      could they come from?
                      How will individuals working on this be rewarded or recognized?
                      What might they learn? What skills could they hope to develop?
                      How many people will be needed to perform this task?
                      What technical skills are needed (e.g. desktop publishing)?
                      What training and development opportunities are available?
                      What roles are needed (e.g. a co-coordinator)?
                      Who might work well together?

Throughputs

Some common throughputs include:
84 | TEAMS AS SYSTEMS

 · Team processes. A sense of unity is created through sharing clear goals which are understood and
      accepted by the members.

 · Cohesiveness. This involves encouraging feelings of belonging, cooperation, openness and
      commitment to the team.

 · Communication. Shared meaning making among team members. Many contend communication
      involves being clear, accurate, open, and honest, though certainly there are times when being vague,
      indirect, or even deceitful can be necessary.

 · Decision-making. The process of engaging in meaningful deliberation and striving to come to a
      resolution. Successful decision-making often involves discussion, avoiding biases, and second-
      guessing assumptions.

 · Task and maintenance activities. These include activities that ensure that the task is produced
      effectively, such as planning, agreeing on procedures and controls. They also include activities that
      minimize threats to the process, such as monitoring and reviewing internal processes and dealing
      constructively with conflict.

Throughputs represent the work the group is doing to accomplish its goals. Some throughput-related
questions are set out in Table 2.

       Table 2: Throughput-related questions

                      What can you do to build a sense of belonging among the team members?
                      How will the group communicate? (Face-to-face, email, group software?)
                      Do any ground rules need setting up? How can this be done?
                      What established procedures for decision-making are there?
                      Will there be a team leader? How will the person be chosen?
                      What tasks need to be performed to complete the project?
                      What maintenance behaviors does the group need to exhibit to get the job done
                      and to benefit and develop from the experience?
                      Who will be responsible for ensuring that the different tasks and maintenance
                      activities are performed?
                      Are there structures and systems in place to review processes?

Outputs

Outcomes can be examined in terms of task performance, individual performance and other (incidental)
outcomes.

 · Task performance. This may be judged on a number of criteria, such as quality of the formal
      outputs or objectives. In this case a product (e.g., goal, materials, etc.) and the time taken to perform
      the task are the criteria.

 · Individual outputs. These may include personal satisfaction and personal development and
      learning.
                                                          TEAMS AS SYSTEMS | 85

 · Other outcomes. These include transferable skills to apply in future to other teamwork. They
      include, for example, experience of effective teamwork and task-specific skills.

Outputs can take many forms depending on the criteria the group has for success. Some examples include
team commitment, performance on the task, team identification, and other outcomes from team
experiences. Output-related questions are presented in Table 3.

       Table 3 Output-related questions
       Has the team completed the task it was given?
       Has it kept to cost and to time?
       What has the team learned from this experience?
       Should the team now be broken up or could it go on to another activity?
       What have individuals learned from the experience?
       Have members experienced an effective team?
       Have any learning and development needs been identified? How can they be addressed?
       Have members developed transferable teamworking and other skills?
       Where can these skills be used in the organization?

   The open systems model of teamwork shows us how effective teamwork can offer benefits to organization
and staff. However, it also shows us that these benefits do not occur without effort and planning. Leaders
need to ensure that the right team is put together to perform a given task and that it is given appropriate
tasks. They also need to secure the freedom, resources and support for the team to undertake the task.
The model alerts teams and leaders to both the micro and the macro issues they will need to be aware of in
managing effective teams.

Group size

Another significant feature of a work group is its size. To be effective it should be neither too large
nor too small. As membership increases there is a trade-off between increased collective expertise and
decreased involvement and satisfaction of individual members. A very small group may not have the
range of skills it requires to function well. The optimum size depends partly on the group's purpose. A
group for information sharing or decision making may need to be larger than one for problem solving. A
simple calculation can indicate how quickly the number of two-way interactions in a group increases with
increasing size. In a group of N people (where N stands for a number) each of the N individuals relates with
N × 1 others, so there are N × (N - 1) / 2 possible interactions.

   In many organizations, there is a tendency to include representatives from every conceivable grouping
on all committees in the belief that this enhances participation and effectiveness. There is also the view that
putting a representative of every possible related department into a given group helps smooth information
flow and project progress. In practice, communication is usually reduced in larger groups. As the group size
grows, members feel less involved in the process, alienation tends to increase and commitment to the project
86 | TEAMS AS SYSTEMS

tends to decrease. The numbers most commonly quoted for effective group size in a face-to-face team are
between 5 and 10, so reducing the number of interactions and lessening the risk of conflict.

   There is a nice demonstration that the `between 5 and 10' rule is due to communication limitations. If we
devise special procedures to manage the interpersonal exchanges (as in some computer-based brainstorming
systems, where the computers handle all the gathering and feeding back of ideas) the advantages of the small
group disappears: the larger the group, the more ideas are generated.

   However, in the normal face-to-face mode, if there are more than about 12 members in our team we are
likely to encounter group-size problems. If the numbers cannot be reduced we might consider restructuring
the team into sub-groups and delegating responsibility for achieving some of the team's objectives. We may
find that if we don't do this deliberately it will happen anyway. For instance, members who like each other
or share common interests may spontaneously form sub-groups.

   Unfortunately, the breakdown of large groups into sub-groups and cliques may not help a team achieve
its goals. One device for keeping large numbers of people informed about a project is for a small group
to manage the task and for it to invite relevant people to attend particular meetings. Alternatively, the
small group can arrange to give information seminars to larger groups of colleagues. So, for the purposes of
achieving team goals it is better that the process of restructuring big groups into smaller groups is managed
consciously and carefully.

Managing group membership

The range of people that makes up the membership of a team, and the relationships they have with each
other, have great influence on the team's effectiveness. The members should all be able to contribute their
skills and expertise to the team's goals to make the best use of the resources. If you are ever in the position of
being able to select your own team, you will need to identify your objectives and the methods for achieving
your goals. From this will come the competences - the knowledge, understanding, skills and personal
qualities - which you need in your team members.

   The least-sized group principle contends that the ideal group size is one which incorporates a wide
variety of views and opinions but contains as few members as possible. Restated, a group should be as small
as possible while still incorporating as wide a range of perspectives as possible. It is important to appraise
as systematically as possible the relationship between team functions and required competences in order to
identify gaps and begin to allocate responsibilities, organize training and so on.

   Figure 3 provides a useful way of weighing up the mixture of `task' and `relational' functions (or `faces')
of a team. Faces 1 and 2 are external to the team and concern: adapting to the environment and using
organizational resources effectively in order to satisfy the requirements of the team's sponsor. relating
effectively with people outside the team in order to meet the needs of clients or customers, whether internal
or external to the organization. Faces 3 and 4 are internal to the team and concern: using systems and
procedures appropriately to carry out goal-oriented tasks. working in a way which makes people feel part of
a team. Each face implies different competences.

                                                 We may find that when we are setting up a team

                                                 we have to guess a little about the competences that

                                                 are required. We may also find that as the team

                                                 develops and gets on with its work, there are

                                                 changes in everyone's perception of the skills and

                                                 knowledge needed. It is therefore important to

                                                 keep an eye on changes that affect the expertise

                                                 needed by the team and actively recruit new

                                                 members if necessary. It is frequently the case that

                                                 team members have other work commitments

Figure 3 The four faces of a team (adapted from  outside the team. The implications of this should
Lewis and Lawton, 1992).                         be taken into account when recruiting team
                                                 members and allocating tasks and responsibilities

to them. Team loyalties and commitments need to be balanced with other loyalties and commitments.

Often we will have limited or no choice about who is recruited to the team. We may find that we just have

to make do with the situation and struggle to be effective despite limitations in the competence base.

As well as competencies there are other factors that can influence the working of a team. The balance of

men and women and people from different nationalities or cultural backgrounds all play a part. Differences

in personality can also have a significant effect. Achieving the best mix in a team invariably involves working

on the tensions that surround issues of uniformity and diversity. The pushes and pulls in different

directions need to be managed. The dismantling of many of the restrictions in the European labour market

supports moves towards recruitment practices which seek team members with proven capabilities to work

in other countries. Legislation and social changes make it easier for organizations to develop and train their

staff to appreciate ethnic and national differences in values, style, attitudes and performance standards.

Nevertheless, there are countervailing tendencies, internally and externally.

Developing openness and trust, for example, can often seem easier in the first instance on the basis of a

high degree of homogeneity; strengthening diversity can seem threatening in an established team.

Functional and team roles

When individuals are being selected for membership of a team, the choice is usually made on the basis
of task-related issues, such as their prior skills, knowledge, and experience. However, team effectiveness
is equally dependent on the personal qualities and attributes of individual team members. It is just as
important to select for these as well.

   When we work with other people in a group or team we each bring two types of role to that relationship.
The first, and more obvious, is our functional role, which relies on the skills and experiences that we bring
to the project or problem in hand. The second, and often overlooked, contribution is our team role, which
tends to be based on our personality or preferred style of action. To a large extent, our team role can be said
to determine how we apply the skills and experiences that comprise our functional role.

   Belbin (1981, 1993) researched the functional role/team role distinction and its implications for teams.
She found that, while there are a few people who do not function well in any team role, most of us have
perhaps two or three roles that we feel comfortable in (our so-called `preferred roles') and others in which
we feel less at ease (our so-called `non-preferred roles'). In fact, Belbin and her associates identified nine such
team roles. Some of the non-preferred roles are ones we can cope with if we have to. However, there are also
likely to be others in which we are both uncomfortable and ineffective. Belbin's team roles are listed in
Table 4. All nine are equally important to team effectiveness, provided that they are used by the team at the
right times and in an appropriate manner.
88 | TEAMS AS SYSTEMS

   When a team first addresses a problem or kicks off a project, the basic requirement is usually for
innovative ideas (the need for a `plant'), closely followed by the requirement to appreciate how these ideas
can be turned into practical actions and manageable tasks (the `implementer'). These steps stand most
chance of being achieved if the team has a good chairperson (the `coordinator') who ensures that the
appropriate team members contribute at the right times. Drive and impetus are brought to the team's
activities by the energetic `shaper'. When delicate negotiations with contacts outside the team are called for,
it is the personality of the `resource investigator' that comes into its own. To stop the team becoming over-
enthusiastic and missing key points, the `monitor/evaluator' must be allowed to play a part. Any sources of
friction or misunderstanding within the team are diffused by the `teamworker', whilst the `specialist' is used
for skills or knowledge that are in short supply and not used regularly. The `completer/finisher' ensures that
proper attention is paid to the details of any solutions or follow-up actions.

   It is essential that team members share details of their team roles with their colleagues if the team is to
gain the full benefit from its range of roles; the team can then see if any of the nine team roles are missing.
If this is the case, those team members whose non-preferred roles match the missing roles need to make
the effort required to fill the gap. If not it may be necessary to bring in additional team members. Clearly,
this sharing calls for a degree of openness and trust, which should exist in a well-organized, well-led team.
Unfortunately, in teams that have not yet developed mutual trust and openness, some people who may be
quite open about the details of their functional roles tend to be somewhat coy about sharing personality
details. A competent leader will handle this situation in a sensitive manner.

                       Clarifies goals; good chairperson         Can be seen as manipulative
                       Promotes decision making                  Inclined to let others do the work
                       Good communicator; social leader          May take credit for the team's work
                       Provides rare skills and knowledge        Contributes only on a narrow front
                       Single-minded and focused                 Communication skills are often weak
                       Self-starting and dedicated               Often cannot see the `big picture'

Leaders sometimes try to rationalize having teams that are unbalanced in a team-role sense by claiming
that they have been assigned a group of people as their team and they must live with it. In most of
today's workplaces there is a steady and regular movement of staff in and out of management groups
and departments. When selecting or accepting new people into their groups or departments, leaders with
an understanding of team-role concepts will look for team-role strengths in addition to functional-role
strengths.

   Each team role brings valuable strengths to the overall team (team strength), but each also has a downside.
Belbin has coined the phrase `an allowable weakness' for what is the converse of a team strength. The
tendency is for a leader to try to correct perceived weaknesses in an employee. But by doing this with
allowable weaknesses we face the possibility of not only failing to eradicate what is after all a natural
weakness, but also risking undermining the strength that goes with it. This is not to suggest that weaknesses
should not be addressed. The point is that any attempts at improvement should be kept in balance and we
90 | TEAMS AS SYSTEMS

should be prepared to manage and work around the weaknesses of our team colleagues and ourselves. Many
people put on an act in an attempt to hide their weaknesses. Once they see that they can admit to them
without prejudice, they feel a sense of relief and are ready to play their part in the team in a more open
manner.

PROFESSIONAL WRITING

This chapter is adapted from Business Communication for Success.

This chapter presents a high-level overview of important considerations while
writing. Specific examples are presented in the next Writing Supplement
Chapter.

I'm not a very good writer, but I'm an excellent rewriter. -James A. Michener
   Half my life is an act of revision. -John Irving

   Business writing ultimately values writing that produces results or outcomes in environments where
you do not have the luxury of controlling the variables, designing the context, or limiting the scope of
your inquiry. Your business document will be evaluated by both a primary audience-those you prepared
the document for like bosses, colleagues, clients-and, likely, a secondary audience-those who find your
document online, get forwarded the message, or incidentally have access to your writing. In short, what we
write often finds a broad audience.

   In every career, industry, and profession, today's business climate is a result-oriented . Regardless of what
you write, there exists the possibility, even probability, that misunderstandings and miscommunications can
and will occur. Although you will not always have control over the importance of the ideas you are assigned
to communicate in your writing, there is one thing you can control: errors. If you avoid mistakes, both in
the document itself and in the way your audience interprets your message, your document will have its best
chance of success. Thus, a thorough revision is an important part of your writing process.

   As you review and evaluate documents, those written by you and others, you will need to keep in mind
the three goals: to be correct, to be clear, and to be concise. Next you will have to focus on effectiveness and
efficiency, recognizing that in a climate of increasing demands and limited resources like time, you need to
get it right the first time.

   Being a business writer can be stressful, but it can also be rewarding. Recognition from your
peers--suppliers, internal department colleagues, or customers--can make it all worthwhile. Still, the
reward in terms of acknowledgement may come in the form of silence. When your document clearly meets
expectations and accomplishes its goal, the outcome may be the absence of error or misinterpretation, a
rare occasion that often goes unheralded. As a business writer you need to value your work and note what
works. When it does, take pride in your hard work in effort. You may not always be celebrated for your
error-free documents that communicate concepts and ideas clearly, but know that they are successful, and
their success is your success.

General Revision Points to Consider

                                                    document is done, the revision process begins. The

                                                    writing process requires effort, from overcoming

                                                    writer's block to the intense concentration

                                                    composing a document often involves. It is only

                                                    natural to have a sense of relief when your

                                                    document is drafted from beginning to end. This

                                                    relief is false confidence, though. Your document is

                                                    not complete, and in its current state it could, in

                                                    it reaches your audience. Now is not time to let

your guard down, prematurely celebrate, or to move on to the next assignment. Every document, whether

written by a seasoned expert or a novice writer, requires editing and revision.

General revision requires attention to content, organization, style, and readability. These four main

categories should give you a template from which to begin to explore details in depth. Across this chapter

we will explore ways to expand your revision efforts to cover the common areas of weakness and error. You

may need to take some time away from your document to approach it again with a fresh perspective. Take

at least 24 hours away from your document between the drafting and revision process. Writers often juggle

multiple projects that are at different stages of development. This allows the writer to leave one document

and return to another without losing valuable production time.

Evaluate Content

Content is the first key aspect of your document. Let's say you were assigned a report on the sales trends
for a specific product in a relatively new market. You could produce a one-page chart comparing last year's
results to current figures and call it a day, but would it clearly and concisely deliver content that is useful
and correct? Are you supposed to highlight trends? Are you supposed to spotlight factors that contributed
to the increase or decrease? Are you supposed to include projections for next year? Our list of questions
could continue, but for now let's focus on content and its relationship to the directions. Have you included
the content that corresponds to the given assignment, left any information out that may be necessary to
fulfill the expectations, or have you gone beyond the assignment directions? Content will address the central
questions of who, what, where, when, why and how within the range and parameters of the work or school
assignment.

Evaluate Organization

Organization is another key aspect of any document. Standard formats that include an introduction,
body, and conclusion may be part of your document, but did you decide on a direct or indirect approach?
Can you tell? A direct approach will announce the main point or purpose at the beginning, while an
indirect approach will present an introduction before the main point. Your document may use any of a
wide variety of organizing principles, such as chronological, spatial, compare/contrast. Is your organizing
principle clear to the reader?
                                                   PROFESSIONAL WRITING | 95

   Beyond the overall organization, pay special attention to transitions. Readers often have difficulty
following a document if the writer makes the common error of failing to make one point relevant to the
next, or to illustrate the relationships between the points. Finally, your conclusion should mirror your
introduction and not introduce new material.

Evaluate Style

Style is created through content and organization, but also involves word choice and grammatical
structures. Is your document written in an informal or formal tone, or does it present a blend, a mix, or
an awkward mismatch? Does it provide a coherent and unifying voice with a professional tone? If you
are collaborating on the project with other writers or contributors, pay special attention to unifying the
document across the different authors' styles of writing. Even if they were all to write in a professional,
formal style, the document may lack a consistent voice. Read it out loud--can you tell who is writing what?
If so, that is a clear clue that you need to do more revising in terms of style.

Evaluate Readability

Readability refers to the reader's ability to read and comprehend the document. A variety of tools are
available to make an estimate of a document's reading level, often correlated to a school grade level. If this
chapter has a reading level of 11.8, it would be appropriate for most readers in the eleventh grade. But
just because you are in grade thirteen, eighteen, or twenty-one doesn't mean that your audience, in their
everyday use of language, reads at a postsecondary level. As a business writer, your goal is to make your
writing clear and concise, not complex and challenging.

   You can often use the "Tools" menu of your word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word) to
determine the approximate reading level of your document. The program will evaluate the number of
characters per word, add in the number of words per sentence, and come up with a rating. It may also note
the percentage of passive sentences, and other information that will allow you to evaluate readability. Like
any computer-generated rating, it should serve you as one point of evaluation, but not the only point. Your
concerted effort to choose words you perceive as appropriate for the audience will serve you better than any
computer evaluation of your writing.

2 Specific Revision Points to Consider

This section presents six specific elements of every document to check for revision. When revising your
document, it can be helpful to focus on specific points. When you consider each point in turn, you will be
able to break down the revision process into manageable steps. When you have examined each point, you
can be confident that you have avoided many possible areas for errors. Specific revision requires attention to
the following:

1. Format
2. Facts
3. Names
4. Spelling
5. Punctuation
6. Grammar
96 | PROFESSIONAL WRITING

Format

Format is an important part of the revision process. Format involves the design expectations of author and
audience. If a letter format normally designates a date at the top, or the sender's address on the left side of
the page before the salutation, the information should be in the correct location. Formatting that is messy
or fails to conform to the company style will reflect poorly on you before the reader even starts to read it. By
presenting a document that is properly formatted according to the expectations of your organization and
your readers, you will start off making a good impression.

Facts

Another key part of the revision process is checking your facts. Did you know that news organizations
and magazines employ professional fact-checkers? These workers are responsible for examining every article
before it gets published and consulting original sources to make sure the information in the article is
accurate. This can involve making phone calls to the people who were interviewed for the article--for
example, "Mr. Diaz, our report states that you are thirty-nine years old. Our article will be published on
the fifteenth. Will that be your correct age on that date?" Fact checking also involves looking facts up in
encyclopedias, directories, atlases, and other standard reference works; and, increasingly, in online sources.

   While you can't be expected to have the skills of a professional fact-checker, you do need to reread your
writing with a critical eye to the information in it. Inaccurate content can expose you and your organization
to liability, and will create far more work than a simple revision of a document. So, when you revise a
document, ask yourself the following:

 · Does my writing contain any statistics or references that need to be verified?
 · Where can I get reliable information to verify it?

It is often useful to do independent verification--that is, look up the fact in a different source from the
one where you first got it. For example, perhaps a colleague gave you a list of closing averages for the Dow
Jones Industrial on certain dates. You still have the list, so you can make sure your document agrees with
the numbers your colleague provided. But what if your colleague made a mistake? The Web sites of the Wall
Street Journal and other major newspapers list closings for "the Dow," so it is reasonably easy for you to
look up the numbers and verify them independently.

Names

   Always spell a person's name correctly.              Figure 1 © 2010 Jupiterimages Corporation
   There is no more embarrassing error in business
writing than to misspell someone's name. To the
writer, and to some readers, spelling a name
"Michelle" instead of "Michele" may seem like a
minor matter, but to Michele herself it will make a
big difference. Attribution, giving credit where
credit is due, is essential and often involves listing
people by name. There are many other reasons for
including someone's name, but regardless of your
reasons for choosing to include names, you need to
                                                   PROFESSIONAL WRITING | 97

make sure the spelling is correct. Incorrect spelling of names is a quick way to undermine your credibility; it
can also have a negative impact on your organization's reputation, and in some cases it may even have legal
ramifications.

Spelling

                                                Correct spelling is another element essential for

                                                your credibility, and errors will be glaringly

                                                oblivious (that's a joke) to many readers. The

                                                negative impact on your reputation as a writer,

                                                based on perceptions that you lack attention to

                                                detail or do not value your work, will be hard to

                                                overcome. In addition to the negative personal

                                                consequences, spelling errors can become factual

                                                errors and destroy the value of content.

and do make mistakes. Often an incorrect word may in fact be a word, and according to the program be

correct. For example, suppose you wrote, "The major will attend the meeting" when you meant to write

"The mayor will attend the meeting." The program would miss this error because "major" is a word, but

your meaning would be twisted beyond recognition. In short, there is no substitution for careful human

proofreading and editing!

Punctuation

Punctuation marks are the traffic signals, signs, and indications that allow us to navigate the written word.
They serve to warn us in advance when a transition is coming or the complete thought has come to an end.
A period indicates the thought is complete, while a comma signals that additional elements or modifiers are
coming. Correct signals will help your reader follow the thoughts through sentences and paragraphs, and
enable you to communicate with maximum efficiency while reducing the probability of error.

   Table 1 lists twelve punctuation marks that are commonly used in English in alphabetical order along
with an example of each.

It may be daunting to realize that the number of possible punctuation errors is as extensive as the number of
symbols and constructions available to the author. Software program may catch many punctuation errors,
but again it is the committed writer that makes the difference. Here we will provide details on how to avoid
mistakes with three of the most commonly used punctuation marks: the comma, the semicolon, and the
apostrophe.

Collaborative Writing

As an experienced business writer, you may be called upon to collaborate and review others' work. Having a
clear understanding of the process will help you be efficient in your review, producing constructive changes
or advice that would benefit the essay while resisting change for change's sake.

   Writing with others can be difficult. Most important is the establishment of who has the final say on a
document. It is crucial that you discuss with your teammates if it alright to edit the document (e.g., "Would
you prefer that I make suggestions in comments or directly edit the document?" "Should I use track changes
or highlight the things I change?" "I'm not particularly strong at grammar, could you please proofread my
section for issues with grammar and spelling?") Be open and honest with your collaborators and set clear
boundaries that help you determine who is doing what in the writing process. When you write with others
you may find it useful to use comments, track changes, or digital collaborative writing spaces like Google
Docs to help facilitate team-writing. It is helpful to assign each member of your team a specific role, section,
or job in the writing process to ensure that you do not duplicate each others' efforts. Perhaps the most
important role is the person designated to unify the style, format, and voice of the document. One team
member should be designated as the `voice' of the group. This person should, ideally, be a very strong writer
with the ability to edit, synthesize, and proofread content. Last, when writing with others, we sometimes
engage in evaluation, commenting on and suggesting changes to writing by other people. Evaluation other
people's writing is difficult and can often feel personal. The next section details how to deliver appropriate
evaluative feedback to teammates.

Five Steps in Evaluation

Whether you are evaluating a document for your own team someone else's writing, the goal is to offer fair,
constructive, and useful feedback. There are five steps to writing evaluation:

1. Understand the task or assignment.
2. Evaluate how well the writing carries out the assignment.
3. Evaluate assertions.
4. Check facts.
5. Look for errors.

First, review the instructions or tasks that were given to the writer. Make sure you understand the
assignment and the target audience. What resources did the writer have access to, and how much time was
allotted for completing the assignment? What purpose did the document need to fulfill, and what role will
this document have in future business activities or decisions?

   Second, evaluate how well the document fulfills its stated goals. As a reader, do you see the goals carried
out in the document? If you didn't know the writer and you were to find the document next year in a file
where you were searching for information, would it provide you with the information it aims to convey?
For example, suppose the document refers to the sales history of the past five years. Does the writer provide
the sales history for the reader's reference, or indicate where the reader can get this information?

   Evaluate the assertions made in the document. An assertion is a declaration, statement, or claim of fact.
Suppose the writer indicates that the sales history for the past five years is a significant factor. Does the writer
explain why this history is significant? Is the explanation logical and sufficient?

   Evaluate the facts cited in the document. Does the writer credit the sources of facts, statistics, and
numbers? For example, suppose the writer mentions that the population of the United States is
100 | PROFESSIONAL WRITING

approximately three hundred million. Obviously, the writer did not count all U.S. residents to arrive at this
number. Where did it come from? If you have access to sources where you can independently verify the
accuracy of these details, look them up and note any discrepancies.

   Finally, check the document for proper format and for errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
Word processing spell checkers do not catch all errors.

Delivering the Evaluation

If you are asked to evaluate someone else's

written work, keep in mind that not everyone can

separate process from product, or product from

personality. Many authors, particularly those new

to the writing process, see the written word as an

extension of self. To help the recipient receive your

evaluation as professional advice, rather than as

personal criticism, use strategies to be tactful and

diplomatic.

   Until you know the author and have an               Evaluation requires delivering feedback in a
established relationship, it is best to use "I"        constructive manner. Credit: wocintechchat.com
statements, as in "I find this sentence difficult to

understand." The sentence places the emphasis on the speaker rather than the sentence, and further

distances the author from the sentence. If you were to say, "This sentence is awful," all the author may hear

is, "I am an awful writer" and fail to pay attention to your message, the sentence under examination, or ways

to improve it. Business writing produces products, and all products can be improved, but not all authors

can separate messenger from message.

Avoid the use of the word you in your evaluation, oral or written, as it can put the recipient on the

defensive. This will inhibit listening and decrease the probability of effective communication. It can be

interpreted as a personal attack. Just as speakers are often quite self-conscious of their public speaking

abilities, writers are often quite attached to the works they have produced. Anticipating and respecting

this relationship and the anxiety it sometimes carries can help you serve as a better evaluator. To help the

recipient receive your evaluation as professional advice, rather than as personal criticism, use strategies to be

tactful and diplomatic.

Phrasing disagreement as a question is often an effective response strategy. For example ask: "What is this

sentence intended to communicate?" This places the emphasis on the sentence, not the author, and allows

for dialogue. Phrasing your evaluation as a question emphasizes your need to understand, and provides the

author with space to respond in a collaborative fashion.

Focus on the document as the focal product, not the author. There may be times when the social rank or

status of the individual involved with work requires respectful consideration, and choosing to focus on the

document as a work in progress, distinct from authors themselves, can serve you well. This also means that

at times you may notice a glaring error but be reluctant to challenge the author directly as you anticipate a

less than collaborative response. By treating the document as a product, and focusing on ways to strengthen

it, keeping in mind our goals of clear and concise as reference points, you can approach issues without

involving personalities.

Proofreading and Design Evaluation

In traditional publishing, proofreading and design are the final stages a book undergoes before it is
published. If the earlier steps of research, organizing, writing, revising, and formatting have been done
carefully, proofreading and design should go smoothly. Now is not the time to go back and revise a
document's content, or to experiment with changes in format. Instead, the emphasis is on catching any
typographical errors that have slipped through the revision process, and "pouring" the format into a design
that will enhance the writer's message.

Proofreading

By now you have completed a general and specific review of the document, with attention to details outline
above. You may have made changes, and most word processing programs will allow you to track those
changes across several versions and authors.

Design Evaluation

If you are asked to review a document, design an element that deserves consideration. While most of our
attention has focused on words (i.e., sentence construction and common errors), design can have a strong
impact on the representation and presentation of information.

Document Layout

Document layout refers to how information is presented, including margins, line justifications, and
template expectations. Just as frame creates a border around a painting, highlighting part of the image
while hiding the margins, the document layout of a page influences how information is received. Margins
create space around the edge and help draw attention to the content. One-inch margins are standard, but
differences in margin widths will depend on the assignment requirements. A brief letter, for example, may
have margins as wide as two inches so that the body of the letter fills up the stationery in a more balanced
fashion. Template expectations are distinct from audience expectation, though they are often related. Most
software programs have templates for basic documents, including letters, reports, and résumés.

   Templates represent the normative expectations for a specific type of document. Templates have spaces
that establish where a date should be indicated and where personal contact information should be
represented. They also often allow you to "fill in the blank," reflecting each document's basic expectations
of where information is presented.

   For example, line justification involves where the text lines up on the page. Letters often have a left justify,
lining up the text on the left side of the page while allowing the ends of each line on the right side to be
"ragged," or not aligned. This creates even spaces between words and gives the appearance of organization
while promoting white space, the space on the page free of text. Balance between text (often black) and
white space creates contrast and allows for areas of emphasis. Left justify often produces the appearance of
balance, as the words are evenly spaced, while left and right justify can produce large gaps between words,
making the sentences appear awkward and hard to read.

   Paragraphs
   Paragraphs are the basic organizational unit for presenting and emphasizing the key points in a
document. Effective paragraphs can provide an effective emphasis strategy, but the placement within the
102 | PROFESSIONAL WRITING

page can also influence recall and impact. The first point presented is often the second in importance, the
second point is the least important, and the third point in a series of three is often the most important.
People generally recall the last point presented, and tend to forget or ignore the content in the middle of a
sequence. Use this strategy to place your best point in the most appropriate location.

   A lengthy document that consists of paragraph after paragraph can become monotonous, making
reading a chore and obscuring pieces of information that need to stand out. To give the document visual
variety and to emphasize key information, consider the following strategies:

1. Bullets (·)
2. Numbers (1,2,3 or I, II, III)
3. Boldface
4. Italics
5. Underlining
6. CAPITALIZATION

Remember, however, that using all caps (all capitals) for body text (as opposed to headings) is often
considered rude, like shouting, particularly in electronic communications.

Visual Aids

If a visual aids, such as graphics, tables, and images can help you make your point better, then include them.
When including visual aids take care to make sure that the verbal and visual messages complement each
other. The visual should illustrate the text, and should be placed near the words so that the relationship is
immediately clear (e.g. "Figure 1 shows our major steps). Sometimes during editing, a photograph will get
pushed to the next page, leaving the relevant text behind and creating discontinuity. This creates a barrier
for your reader, so avoid it if possible.

APPLIED EXERCISE

Using your editing skills, find and correct the errors in the following paragraph:
   I never wanted to bacome a writer, but when I decidedon a career in sales, I found out that being able to

write was a skill that would help me. So much of my daily work involved Writing that I sometimes thought
i'd fallen asleep and woken up in someone else's life. Messages, about actual sales, were the least of it. In
order to attract customers, I have to send notes to people I already knew, asking them for sales leads. Then
when I got a lead, I'ld write to the contact asking for a few munutes of their time.If I got to meet with them
or even have a phote conversation, my next task was to write them a thank--you not. Oh, and the reports-I
was always filing out reports; for my sales manager, tracking my progress with each customer and each lead.
If someone had tell me how much writing sails would involve, I think I would of paid more attention to my
writing courses en school.

SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE

This chapter is adapted from Business Communication for Success.

This chapter details specific writing aspects to consider which
can improve writing. You might find this content useful as you
and your teammates create a writing checklist.

Commas

The comma is probably the most versatile of all punctuation marks. This means you as a writer can use
your judgment in many cases as to whether you need a comma or not. It also means that the possible errors
involving commas are many. Commas are necessary some of the time, but careless writers often place a
comma in a sentence where it is simply not needed.

   Commas are used to separate two independent clauses joined by a conjunction like "but," "and," and
"or."

 Example
 The advertising department is effective, but don't expect miracles in this business climate.

Commas are not used simply to join two independent clauses. This is known as the comma splice error, and
the way to correct it is to insert a conjunction after the comma.

 Examples
 The advertising department is effective, the sales department needs to produce more results.
 The advertising department is effective, but the sales department needs to produce more results.

Commas are used for introductory phrases and to offset clauses that are not essential to the sentence. If the
meaning would remain intact without the phrase, it is considered nonessential.

 Examples
 After the summary of this year's sales, the sales department had good reason to celebrate.
 The sales department, last year's winner of the most productive award, celebrated their stellar sales success this year.
 The sales department celebrated their stellar sales success this year.

Commas are used to offset words that help create unity across a sentence like "however" and "therefore."
104 | SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE

 Examples
 The sales department discovered, however, that the forecast for next year is challenging.
 However, the sales department discovered that the forecast for next year is challenging.

Commas are often used to separate more than one adjective modifying a noun.

 Example
 The sales department discovered the troublesome, challenging forecast for next year.

Commas are used to separate addresses, dates, and titles; they are also used in dialogue sequences.

 Examples
 John is from Ancud, Chile.
 Katy was born on August 2, 2002.
 Mackenzie McLean, D. V., is an excellent veterinarian.
 Lisa said, "When writing, omit needless words."

Semicolons

Semicolons have two uses. First, they indicate relationships among groups of items in a series when the
individual items are separated by commas. Second, a semicolon can be used to join two independent clauses;
this is another way of avoiding the comma splice error mentioned above. Using a semicolon this way is
often effective if the meaning of the two independent clauses is linked in some way, such as a cause-effect
relationship.

 Examples
 Merchandise on order includes women's wear such as sweaters, skirts, and blouses; men's wear such as shirts, jackets,
 and slacks; and outwear such as coats, parkas, and hats.
 The sales campaign was successful; without its contributions our bottom line would have been dismal indeed.

Apostrophes

The apostrophe, like the semicolon, has two uses: it replaces letters omitted in a contraction, and it often
indicates the possessive.

   Because contractions are associated with an informal style, they may not be appropriate for some
professional writing. The business writer will--as always--evaluate the expectations and audience of the
given assignment.

 Examples
 It's great news that sales were up. It is also good news that we've managed to reduce our advertising costs.

When you indicate possession, pay attention to the placement of the apostrophe. Nouns commonly receive
                                     SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE | 105

"'s" when they are made possessive. But plurals that end in "s" receive a hanging apostrophe when they are
made possessive, and the word "it" forms the possessive ("its") with no apostrophe at all.

 Examples
 Mackenzie's sheep are ready to be sheared.
 The parents' meeting is scheduled for Thursday.
 We are willing to adopt a dog that has already had its shots.

Grammar

Learning to use good, correct standard English grammar is more of a practice than an event, or even a
process. Grammar involves the written construction of meaning from words and involves customs that
evolve and adapt to usage over time. Because grammar is always evolving, none of us can sit back and rest
assured that we "know" how to write with proper grammar. Instead, it is important to write and revise with
close attention to grammar, keeping in mind that grammatical errors can undermine your credibility, reflect
poorly on your employer, and cause misunderstandings.

   Jean Wyrick has provided a list of common errors in grammar to watch out for, which we have adapted
here for easy reference. Wyrick, J. (2008). Steps to writing well (10th ed.). Boston, MA: Thomson
Wadsworth. In each case, the error is in italics and the [correct form] is italicized within square
bracket below.

Subject-Verb Agreement

The subject and verb should agree on the number under consideration. In faulty writing, a singular subject
is sometimes mismatched with a plural verb form, or vice versa.

 Examples
 Sales have not been consistent and they doesn't [do not] reflect your hard work and effort.
 The president appreciates your hard work and wish [wishes] to thank you.

Verb Tense

Verb tense refers to the point in time where action occurs. The most common tenses are past, present, and
future. There is nothing wrong with mixing tenses in a sentence if the action is intended to take place at
different times. In faulty or careless writing, however, they are often mismatched illogically.

 Examples
 Sharon was under pressure to finish the report, so she uses [used] a shortcut to paste in the sales figures.
 The sales department holds a status meeting every week, and last week's meeting will be [was] at the Garden Inn.

Split Infinitive

The infinitive form of verb is one without a reference to time, and in its standard form it includes the
106 | SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE

auxiliary word "to," as in "to write is to revise." It has been customary to keep the "to" next to the verb; to
place an adverb between them is known as splitting the infinitive. Some modern writers do this all the time
(for example, "to boldly go..."), and since all grammar is essentially a set of customs that govern the written
word, you will need to understand what the custom is where you work. If you are working with colleagues
trained across the last fifty years, they may find split infinitives annoying. For this reason, it's often best to
avoid splitting an infinitive wherever you can do so without distorting the meaning of the sentence.

 Examples
 The Marketing Department needs assistance to accurately understand our readers [to understand our readers
 accurately].
 David pondered how to best revise [how best to revise] the sentence.

Double Negative

A double negative uses two negatives to communicate a single idea, duplicating the negation. In some
languages, such as Spanish, when the main action in the sentence is negative, it is correct to express the other
elements in the sentence negatively as well. However, in English, this is incorrect. In addition to sounding
wrong (you can often hear the error if you read the sentence out loud), a double negative in English causes
an error in logic, because two negatives cancel each other out and yield a positive. In fact, the wording of
ballot measures is often criticized for confusing voters with double negatives.

 Examples
 John doesn't need no [any] assistance with his sales presentation. [Or John needs no assistance with his sales
 presentation.]
 Jeri could not find no [any] reason to approve the request. [Or Jeri could find no reason to approve the request.]

Irregular Verbs

Most verbs represent the past with the addition of the suffix "ed," as in "ask" becomes "asked." Irregular
verbs change a vowel or convert to another word when representing the past tense. Consider the irregular
verb "to go"; the past tense is "went," not "goed."

 Examples
 The need arised [arose] to seek additional funding.
 Katy leaped [leapt] onto the stage to introduce the presentation.

Commas in a Series

A comma is used to separate the items in a series, but in some writing styles the comma is omitted between
the final two items of the series, where the conjunction joins the last and next-to-last items. The comma in
this position is known as the "serial comma." The serial comma is typically required in academic writing and
typically omitted in journalism. Other writers omit the serial comma if the final two items in the series have
a closer logical connection than the other items. In business writing, you may use it or omit it according to
the prevailing style in your organization or industry. Know your audience and be aware of the rule.
                                     SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE | 107

 Examples
 Lisa is an amazing wife, mother, teacher, gardener, and editor.
 Lisa is an amazing wife, mother teacher, gardener and editor.
 Lisa is an amazing teacher, editor, gardener, wife and mother.

Faulty Comparisons

When comparing two objects by degree, there should be no mention of "est," as in "biggest" as all you can
really say is that one is bigger than the other. If you are comparing three or more objects, then "est" will
accurately communicate which is the "biggest" of them all.

 Examples
 Between the twins, Mackenzie is the fastest [faster] of the two.
 Among our three children, Mackenzie is the tallest.

Dangling Modifiers

Modifiers describe a subject in a sentence or indicate how or when the subject carried out the action. If the
subject is omitted, the modifier intended for the subject is left dangling or hanging out on its own without
a clear relationship to the sentence. Who is doing the seeing in the first sentence?

 Examples
 Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, celebrations were in order.
 Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, we decided that celebrations were in order.

Misplaced Modifiers

Modifiers that are misplaced are not lost, they are simply in the wrong place. Their unfortunate location is
often far from the word or words they describe, making it easy for readers to misinterpret the sentence.

 Examples
 Trying to avoid the deer, the tree hit my car.
 My car hit the tree when I tried to avoid a deer in the road.

KEY TAKEAWAY

By revising for format, facts, names, spelling, punctuation, and grammar, you can increase your chances of
correcting many common errors in your writing.

Style Revisions

You know the difference between cloudy and clear water, but can you tell when your writing is cloudy,
108 | SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE

when meaning is hidden in shadows, when the message you are trying to communicate is obscured by the
style you use to present it? Water filtration involves removing particulates, harmful inorganic and organic
materials, and clarifying the water. In the same way, the revision process requires filtration. You may come
across word choices you thought were appropriate at the time or notice words you thought you wrote but
are absent, and the revision process will start to produce results. Some words and sentence constructions
will be harmful to the effective delivery and require attention. Some transitions fail to show the connections
between thoughts and need to be changed.

   Another way of conceptualizing the revision process in general and the clarifying process specifically
is the common reference to a diamond in the rough. Like muddy water, diamonds do not come to have
significant value until they have had their rough edges removed, have received expert polish, and been
evaluated for clarity. Your attention to this important process will bring the value quotient of your writing
up as it begins to more accurately communicate intended meaning. As we've discussed before, now is not
the time to lose momentum. Just the opposite, now is the time to make your writing shine.

   Here we will discuss several strategies to help clarify your writing style. If you have made wise word
choices, the then next step to clarifying your document is to take it sentence by sentence. Each sentence
should stand on its own, but each sentence is also interdependent on all other sentences in your document.
These strategies will require significant attention to detail and an awareness of grammar that might not be
your area of strength, but the more you practice them the more they will become good habits that will
enhance your writing.

Break Up Long Sentences

By revising long sentences you can often increase the overall clarity of your document. To do this, let's
start off with one strategy that will produce immediate results. Count the number of conjunctions in your
document. Word processing programs will often perform a search for a specific a word and for our use,
"and" will do just fine. Simple sentences often become compound and complex through the use of the word
"and." The further the subject, the action, and the modifiers or descriptions are from one another is directly
related to the complexity of the sentence, increasing the probability of reader error and misunderstandings.
Look for the word "and" and evaluate whether the sentence has two complete thoughts or ideas. Does it try
to join two dissimilar ideas or ones better off on their own?

   In prose, and your expository writing classes, you may have learned that complex sentences can
communicate emotions, settings, and scenes that evoke a sense of place and time with your reading
audience. In business writing, our goals aim more toward precision and the elimination of error; a good
business document won't read like a college essay. A professor may have advised you to avoid short, choppy
writing. Are we asking you to do something along those lines? No. Choppy writing is hard to follow, but
simple, clear writing does the job with a minimum of fuss and without decoration.

   But we would also qualify its use: when you have two long and awkward independent clauses that form
an unwieldy sentence, it may indeed be better to divide the clauses into two independent sentences. Your
skill as a business writer is required to balance the needs of the sentence to communicate meaning with your
understanding of audience expectations, and clarity often involves concise sentences.

Revise Big Words and Long Phrases

Big words can clutter your writing with needless jargon that may be a barrier to many readers. Even if you
know your audience has significant education and training in a field, you may need to include definitions
and examples as effective strategies to communicate meaning. Don't confuse simple writing with simplistic
                                     SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE | 109

writing. Your task will almost certainly not require an elementary approach for new readers, but it may
very well require attention to words and the degree to which they contribute to, or detract from, the
communication of your intended message. Long noun sequences, often used as descriptive phrases, can be
one example of how writing can reduce clarity. If you need to describe a noun, use a phrase that modifies
the noun clearly, with commas to offset for example, to enhance clarity.

   Another long phrase to watch out for is often located in the introduction. Long preambles can make the
sentence awkward and will require revision. Sentences that start with "It is" or "There are" can often be
shortened or made clearer through revision.

Evaluate Long Prepositional Phrases

A prepositional phrase is a phrase composed of a preposition (a "where" word; a word that indicates
location) and its object, which may be a noun, a pronoun, or a clause. Some examples of simple
prepositional phrases include "with Tom," "before me," and "inside the building security perimeter."

   Prepositional phrases are necessary--it would be difficult to write without them--but some add to
the bottom line word count without adding much to the sentence. Bureaucratic writing often uses this
technique in an attempt to make a sentence sound important, but the effort usually has the undesirable dual
effects of obscuring meaning and sounding pompous.

 Examples
 The 1040 Form will in all certainty serve the majority of our customers.
 The 1040 Form will certainly serve the majority of our customers.

The revision places an adverb in place of a long prepositional phrase and allows for a reduction in the word
count while strengthening the sentence.

Delete Repetitious Words

Some level of repetition is to be expected and can be beneficial. It is also important to be consistent in
your use of words when precise terminology is appropriate. However, needless repetition can make your
document less than vigorous and discourage readers. For example, use of the word "said" when attributing
dialogue is acceptable a couple of times, but if it is the only word you use, it will lose its impact quickly.
People can "indicate," "point out," "share," and "mention" as easily as they can "say" words or phrases.
Synonyms are useful in avoiding the boredom of repetition.

Eliminate Archaic Expressions or References

Some writing has been ritualized to the point of cliché and has lost its impact. For example, consider
"Heretofore, we have discussed the goal of omitting needless words." Heretofore is an outdated word that
could easily be cut from the previous sentence. Another example is "as per your request for documents
that emphasize clarity and reduce reader error." Feel free to eliminate as per your request from your word
choices.

   Similar to outdated words and phrases, some references are equally outdated. While it is important to
recognize leaders in a field, and this text does include references to pioneers in the field of communication,
it also focuses on current research and concepts. Without additional clarification and examples, readers
110 | SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE

may not understand references to an author long since passed even though he or she made an important
contribution to the field. For example, Shannon and Weaver pioneered the linear model of communication
that revolutionized our understanding of interaction and contributed to computer interfaces as we know
them today.McLean, S. (2005). The basics of interpersonal communication. Boston, MA: Allyn &
Bacon. However, if we mention them without explaining how their work relates to our current context, we
may lose our readers.

Avoid Fillers

Like, you know, like, you know what I mean, ahh, umm, and all the fillers you may use or hear in oral
communication have, well, little or no place in the written representation of the spoken word. Review your
writing for extra words that serve the written equivalent of "like" and omit them. They do not serve you as
an author, and do not serve the reading audience.

Eliminate Slang

Many college professors can give examples of e-mails they have received from students that use all the
modern characteristics of instant message and text abbreviation combined with a complete disregard for
any norms of grammar or spelling, resulting in nearly incomprehensible messages. If your goal is to be
professional, and the audience expectations do not include the use of slang, then it is inappropriate to
include it in your document. Eliminate slang as you would a jargon term that serves as a barrier to
understanding meaning. Not everyone will understand your slang word no more than they would a highly
specialized term, and it will defeat your purpose. Norms for capitalization and punctuation that are
routinely abandoned in efficient text messages or tweets are necessary and required in professional
documents. Finally, there is no place in reputable business writing for offensive slang or profanity.

Evaluate Clichés

Clichés are words or phrases that through their overuse have lost their impact. That definition does not
imply they have lost their meaning, and sometimes a well-placed cliché can communicate a message
effectively. "Actions speak louder than words" is a cliché, but its five words speak volumes that many of
your readers will recognize. This appeal to familiarity can be an effective strategy to communicate, but use
it carefully. Excessive reliance on clichés will make your writing trite, while eliminating them altogether may
not serve you well either. As an effective business writer, you will need to evaluate your use of clichés for
their impact versus detraction from your message.

Emphasize Precise Words

Concrete words that are immediately available to your audience are often more effective than abstract terms
that require definitions, examples, and qualifications. All these strategies have their place, but excessive
use of abstractions will make your document less than precise, requiring additional clarification that can
translate to work for you as the author and, more importantly, for your readers. Qualifiers deserve special
mention here. Some instructors may indicate that words like "may," "seems," or "apparently" make your
writing weak. Words are just words and it is how we use them that creates meaning. Some qualifiers are
necessary, particularly if the document serves as record or may be the point of discussion in a legal issue. In
                                      SUPPLEMENTAL WRITING ADVICE | 111

other cases direct language is required, and qualifiers must be eliminated. Too many qualifiers can weaken
your writing, but too few can expose you to liability. As a business writer, your understanding of audience
expectations and assignment requirements will guide you to the judicious use of qualifiers.

Evaluate Parallel Construction

When you are writing in a series or have more than one idea to express, it is important to present them in
similar ways to preserve and promote unity across your document. Parallel construction refers to the use
of same grammatical pattern; it can be applied to words, phrases, and sentences. For example, "We found
the seminar interesting, entertaining, and inspiring" is a sentence with parallel construction, whereas "We
found the seminar interesting, entertaining, and it inspired us" is not. If your sentences do not seem to flow
well, particularly when you read them out loud, look for misplaced parallels and change them to make the
construction truly parallel.

Obscured Verbs

Business writing should be clear and concise. If the meaning is obscured, then revision is required. One
common problem is the conversion of verbs into nouns with the addition of suffixes like: -ant,-ent, -ion,
-tion, -sion, -ence, -ance, and ing. Instead of hiding meaning within the phrase "through the consolidation
of," consider whether to use the verb forms "consolidated" or "consolidating." Similarly, instead of "the
inclusion of," consider using "including," which will likely make the sentence more active and vigorous.

The "Is It Professional?" Test

Finally, when revising your document with an attention to detail, you simply need to ask the question: is
it professional? If a document is too emphatic, it may seem like an attempt at cheerleading. If it uses too
much jargon, it may be appropriate for "nerds" but may limit access to the information by a nontechnical
audience. If the document appears too simplistic, it may seem to be "talking down" to the audience, treating
the readers more like children than adults. Does your document represent you and your organization in a
professional manner? Will you be proud of the work a year from now? Does it accomplish its mission, stated
objectives, and the audience's expectations? Business writing is not expository, wordy, or decorative, and
the presence of these traits may obscure meaning. Business writing is professional, respectful, and clearly
communicates a message with minimal breakdown.

PERSUASIVE PRESENTATIONS

Content in this chapter is adapted from: Business Communication for
Success and Speak Out, Call in: Public Speaking as Advocacy

Food for thought
   We are more easily persuaded, in general, by the reasons that we ourselves discovers than by those which

are given to us by others. -Pascal
   For every sale you miss because you're too enthusiastic, you will miss a hundred because you're not

enthusiastic enough. -Zig Ziglar

Getting Started

No doubt there has been a time when you wanted something from your parents, your supervisor, or your
friends, and you thought about how you were going to present your request. But do you think about
how often people--including people you have never met and never will meet--want something from you?
When you watch television, advertisements reach out for your attention, whether you watch them or not.
When you use the Internet, pop-up advertisements often appear. Living in the United States, and many
parts of the world, means that you have been surrounded, even inundated, by persuasive messages. Our
communication ecosystem affects how we view the world:

   Consider these facts:

 · By age eighteen, the average American teenager will witness on television 200,000 acts of violence,
      including 40,000 murders (Huston et al., 1992).

 · The average person sees between four hundred and six hundred ads per day--that is forty million to
      fifty million by the time he or she is sixty years old. One of every eleven commercials has a direct
      message about beauty (Raimondo, 2010).

 · By age eighteen, the average American teenager will have spent more time watching
      television--25,000 hours--than learning in a classroom (Ship, 2005).

 · Forty percent of nine- and ten-year-old girls have tried to lose weight, according to an ongoing study
      funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (Body image and nutrition: Fast facts,
      2009).

 · Identification with television stars (for girls and boys), models (girls), or athletes (boys) positively
      correlated with body dissatisfaction (Hofschire & Greenberg, 2002).

 · At age thirteen, 53 percent of American girls are "unhappy with their bodies." This grows to 78
      percent by the time they reach seventeen (Brumber, 1997).

 · #Fitspiration and #Thinspiration images on Instagram promote decreased self-esteem and self-
      perceptions among college age women (Chansiri & Wongphothiphan, 2021).

 · Usage of mobile dating apps relates to and self-perceived masculinity, internalized homonegativity,
      and body dissatisfaction among men who have sex with men (Miller & Behm-Morawitz, 2020).
114 | PERSUASIVE PRESENTATIONS

The communication ecosystem has messages in narrative form, in stories, in hashtags, and in political
speeches. When the CDC wanted to stop the spread of COVID-19 they put out an aggressive vaccination
campaign. Your local city council often involves dialogue, and persuasive speeches, to determine zoning
issues, resource allocation, and even spending priorities. You have learned many of the techniques by trial
and error and through imitation. If you ever wanted the keys to your parents' car for a special occasion, you
used the principles of persuasion to reach your goal.

What Is Persuasion?

Persuasion is an act or process of presenting arguments to move, motivate, or change your audience.
Aristotle taught that rhetoric, or the art of public speaking, involves the faculty of observing in any given
case the available means of persuasion (Covino & Jolliffe, 1995). In the case of President Obama, he may
have appealed to your sense of duty and national values. In persuading your parents to lend you the car keys,
you may have asked one parent instead of the other, calculating the probable response of each parent and
electing to approach the one who was more likely to adopt your position (and give you the keys). Persuasion
can be implicit or explicit and can have both positive and negative effects. In this chapter we'll discuss the
importance of ethics when presenting your audience with arguments in order to motivate them to adopt
your view, consider your points, or change their behavior.

   Motivation is distinct from persuasion in that it involves the force, stimulus, or influence to bring about
change. Persuasion is the process, and motivation is the compelling stimulus that encourages your audience
to change their beliefs or behavior, to adopt your position, or to consider your arguments. Why think of
yourself as fat or thin? Why should you choose to spay or neuter your pet? Messages about what is beautiful,
or what is the right thing to do in terms of your pet, involve persuasion, and the motivation compels you to
do something.

   Another way to relate to motivation also can be drawn from the mass media. Perhaps you have watched
programs like Law and Order, Cold Case, or CSI where the police detectives have many of the facts of the
case, but they search for motive. They want to establish motive in the case to provide the proverbial "missing
piece of the puzzle." They want to know why someone would act in a certain manner. You'll be asking
your audience to consider your position and provide both persuasive arguments and motivation for them to
contemplate. You may have heard a speech where the speaker tried to persuade you, tried to motivate you to
change, and you resisted the message. Use this perspective to your advantage and consider why an audience
should be motivated, and you may find the most compelling examples or points. Relying on positions like
"I believe it, so you should too," "Trust me, I know what is right," or "It's the right thing to do" may not
be explicitly stated but may be used with limited effectiveness. Why should the audience believe, trust, or
consider the position "right?" Keep an audience-centered perspective as you consider your persuasive speech
to increase your effectiveness.

   You may think initially that many people in your audience would naturally support your position in favor
of spaying or neutering your pet. After careful consideration and audience analysis, however, you may find
that people are more divergent in their views. Some audience members may already agree with your view,
but others may be hostile to the idea for various reasons. Some people may be neutral on the topic and look
to you to consider the salient arguments. Your audience will have a range of opinions, attitudes, and beliefs
across a range from hostile to agreement.

   Rather than view this speech as a means to get everyone to agree with you, look at the concept
of measurable gain, a system of assessing the extent to which audience members respond to a persuasive
message. You may reinforce existing beliefs in the members of the audience that agree with you and do a fine
job of persuasion. You may also get hostile members of the audience to consider one of your arguments, and
                                            PERSUASIVE PRESENTATIONS | 115

move from a hostile position to one that is more neutral or ambivalent. The goal in each case is to move the
audience members toward your position. Some change may be small but measurable, and that is considered
gain. The next time a hostile audience member considers the issue, they may be more open to it. Figure 1 is
a useful diagram to illustrate the concept of measurable gain.

Figure 1 Measurable Gain

   Edward Hall also underlines this point when discussing the importance of context. The situation in
which a conversation occurs provides a lot of meaning and understanding for the participants. This ability
to understand motivation and context is key to good communication, and one we will examine throughout
this chapter.

Meeting the Listener's Basic Needs

This section explores why we communicate, illustrating how meeting the listener's basic needs is central to
effective communication. It's normal for the audience to consider why you are persuading them, and there
is significant support for the notion that by meeting the audience's basic needs, whether they are a customer,
colleague, or supervisor, you will more effectively persuade them to consider your position.

   Not all oral presentations involve taking a position, or overt persuasion, but all focus on the inherent
relationships and basic needs within the business context. Getting someone to listen to what you have to
say involves a measure of persuasion, and getting that person to act on it might require considerable skill.
Whether you are persuading a customer to try a new product or service, or informing a supplier that you
need additional merchandise, the relationship is central to your communication. The emphasis inherent in
our next two discussions is that we all share this common ground, and by understanding that we share basic
needs, we can better negotiate meaning and achieve understanding.

   Table 1 presents some reasons for engaging in communication. As you can see, the final item in the table
indicates that we communicate in order to meet our needs.

   Table 1 Reasons for Engaging in Communication

Review          Why We Engage in Communication

Gain            We engage in communication to gain information. This information can involve directions to
Information     an unknown location, or a better understanding about another person through observation or
                self-disclosure.
Understand
Communication   We also want to understand the context in which we communication, discerning the range
Contexts        between impersonal and intimate, to better anticipate how to communicate effectively in each
                setting.
Understand Our
Identity        Through engaging in communication, we come to perceive ourselves, our roles, and our
                relationships with others.
Meet Our Needs
                We meet our needs through communication.

Maslow's Hierarchy

If you have taken courses in anthropology, philosophy, psychology, or perhaps sociology in the past, you

may have seen Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Figure 3). Psychologist Abraham Maslow studied with the

Blackfoot Native American's in the 1930's and borrowed their Tipi model of understanding human

development to create his hierarchy of needs (Taylor, 2019). provides seven basic categories for human

needs, and arranges them in order of priority, from the most basic to the most advanced.

                                                  In this figure, we can see that we need energy,

                                                  water, and air to live. Without any of these three

                                                  basic elements, which meet our physiological

                                                  needs (1), we cannot survive. We need to meet

                                                  them before anything else, and will often sacrifice

                                                  everything else to get them. Once we have what we

                                                  need to live, we seek safety (2). A defensible place,

                                                  protecting your supply lines for your most basic

                                                  needs, could be your home. For some, however,

                                                  home is a dangerous place that compromises their

                                                  safety. Children and victims of domestic violence

                                                  need shelter to meet this need. In order to leave a

                                                  hostile living environment, people may place the

Maslow's Expanded Hierarchy of Needs Credit:      well-being and safety of another over their own
Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/          needs, in effect placing themselves at risk. An
Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs                     animal would fight for its own survival above all

                                                  else, but humans can and do acts of heroism that

directly contradict their own self-interest. Our own basic needs motivate us, but sometimes the basic needs

of others are more important to us than our own.

We seek affection from others once we have the basics to live and feel safe from immediate danger. We

look for a sense of love and belonging (3). All needs in Maslow's model build on the foundation of

the previous needs, and the third level reinforces our need to be a part of a family, community, or group.

This is an important step that directly relates to business communication. If a person feels safe at your

place of business, they are more likely to be open to communication. Communication is the foundation of

the business relationship, and without it, you will fail. If they feel on edge, or that they might be pushed

around, made to feel stupid, or even unwanted, they will leave and your business will disappear. On the

other hand, if you make them feel welcome, provide multiple ways for them to learn, educate themselves,

and ask questions in a safe environment, you will form relationships that transcend business and invite

success.
                                            PERSUASIVE PRESENTATIONS | 117

   Once we have been integrated in a group, we begin to assert our sense of self and self-respect, addressing
our need for self-esteem (4). Self-esteem is essentially how we feel about ourselves. Imagine you had taken
up biking, but your first task was to climb a steep hill. Afterwards you may think "biking is not for me"
or feel defeated. Your feelings of self-worth tied to experiences capture different facets of your self-esteem.
But, self-esteem describes the collection of several experiences which make up your feelings about your
own ability and worth. Self-esteem reinforces safety and familiarity, belonging to a group or perceiving a
trustworthy support system, and the freedom to make mistakes.

   The top levels of Maslow's hierarchy are called growth needs (5 - 8). Maslow discusses the next
level of needs in terms of how we feel about ourselves and our ability to assert control and influence
over our lives. Once we are part of a group and have begun to assert ourselves, we start to feel as if we
have reached our potential and are actively making a difference in our own world. Maslow calls this self-
actualization (5). Self-actualization can involve reaching your full potential, feeling accepted for who you
are, and perceiving a degree of control or empowerment in your environment. It may mean the freedom
to go beyond building the bird house to the tree house, and to design it yourself as an example of self-
expression.

   As we progress across these levels, our basic human curiosity about the world around us emerges. When
we have our basic needs met, we do not need to fear losing our place in a group or access to resources. We
are free to explore and play, discovering the world around us. Our need to know motivates us to grow and
learn.

   Maslow's hierarchy demonstrate how our most basic needs are quite specific, and as we progress through
the levels, the level of abstraction increases until ultimately we feel more comfortable engaging in more
abstract and personally fulfilling needs. As we increase our degree of interconnectedness with others, we
become interdependent and, at the same time, begin to express independence and individuality. As a
speaker, you ought to consider where your message will appeal to the audience. If you can make it about
basic needs, it might be motivational. If you can connect to growth, fulfillment, curiosity, etc. you may
present a more appealing message to the audience.

   Your audience will share with you a need for control. You can help meet this need by constructing your
speech with an effective introduction, references to points you've discussed, and a clear conclusion. The
introduction will set up audience expectations of points you will consider, and allow the audience to see
briefly what is coming. Your internal summaries, signposts, and support of your main points all serve to
remind the audience what you've discussed and what you will discuss. Finally, your conclusion answers the
inherent question, "Did the speaker actually talk about what they said they were going to talk about?" and
affirms to the audience that you have fulfilled your objectives.

Speaking Ethically and Avoiding Fallacies

What comes to mind when you think of speaking to persuade? Perhaps the idea of persuasion may bring
to mind propaganda and issues of manipulation, deception, intentional bias, bribery, and even coercion.
Each element relates to persuasion, but in distinct ways. In a democratic society, we support free and open
discussion and invite deliberation and debate when considering change. Each of these elements also has a
negative connotation associated with it. Deceiving your audience, bribing a judge, or coercing people to do
something against their wishes are wrong because these tactics violate our sense of fairness, freedom, and
ethics.
118 | PERSUASIVE PRESENTATIONS

   Manipulation involves the management of             A silly example of a logical fallacy comparing right

insecurities or emotional appeals to one's own         2Xi9iif
advantage. Your audience expects you to treat them
with respect, and deliberately manipulating them
by means of fear, guilt, duty, or a relationship is
unethical. In the same way, deception involves the
use of lies, partial truths, or the omission of
relevant information to mislead your audience. No
one likes to be lied to, or made to believe something
that is not true.

   As Martin Luther King Jr. stated in his advocacy
of nonviolent resistance, two wrongs do not make
a right. They are just two wrongs and violate the
ethics that contribute to community and healthy
relationships. Being ethical is intimately related to
persuasion, so speakers should be concerned with
ethics.

Eleven Points for Speaking
Ethically

In his book Ethics in Human Communication, Richard Johannesen (1996) offers eleven points to consider
when speaking to persuade. His main points reiterate many of the points across this chapter and should be
kept in mind as you prepare, and present, your persuasive message.

   Do NOT:

· use false, fabricated, misrepresented, distorted or irrelevant evidence to support arguments or claims.
· intentionally use unsupported, misleading, or illogical reasoning.
· represent yourself as informed or an "expert" on a subject when you are not.
· use irrelevant appeals to divert attention from the issue at hand.
· ask your audience to link your idea or proposal to emotion-laden values, motives, or goals to which it

    is actually not related.
· deceive your audience by concealing your real purpose, by concealing self-interest, by concealing the

    group you represent, or by concealing your position as an advocate of a viewpoint.
· distort, hide, or misrepresent the number, scope, intensity, or undesirable features of consequences or

    effects.
· use "emotional appeals" that lack a supporting basis of evidence or reasoning.
· oversimplify complex, gradation-laden situations into simplistic, two-valued, either-or, polar views or

    choices.
· pretend certainty where tentativeness and degrees of probability would be more accurate.
· advocate something which you yourself do not believe in.

Aristotle said the mark of a good person, well spoken was a clear command of the faculty of observing in
any given case the available means of persuasion. He discussed the idea of perceiving the many points of
                                           PERSUASIVE PRESENTATIONS | 119

view related to a topic, and their thoughtful consideration. While it's important to be able to perceive the
complexity of a case, you are not asked to be a lawyer defending a client.

   In your speech to persuade, consider honesty and integrity as you assemble your arguments. Your
audience will appreciate your thoughtful consideration of more than one view, your understanding of the
complexity, and you will build your ethos, or credibility, as you present. Be careful not to stretch the facts,
or assemble them only to prove yourself, and instead prove the argument on its own merits. Deception,
coercion, intentional bias, manipulation and bribery have no place in your speech to persuade.

Avoiding Fallacies

Fallacies are another way of saying false logic. These rhetorical tricks deceive your audience with their style,
drama, or pattern, but add little to your speech in terms of substance and can actually detract from your
effectiveness. There are several techniques or "tricks" that allow the speaker to rely on style without offering
substantive argument, to obscure the central message, or twist the facts to their own gain. Here we will
examine the eight classical fallacies. You may note that some of them relate to the ethical cautions listed
earlier in this section. Eight common fallacies are presented in Table 5. Learn to recognize these fallacies so
they can't be used against you, and so that you can avoid using them with your audience.

Organize your thoughts and practice (as a group)

Have you ever organized a garage sale? The first step, before putting up signs or pricing items, is to go

through your closets and garage and create "piles" of items that you want to sell: children's items, tools,

kitchen items, furniture, trash, etc. Researchers have found that "chunking" information, that is, the way it

is grouped, is vital to audience understanding, learning, and retention of information (Beighly, 1954; Bodeia

et al., 2006; Daniels & Whitman, 1981).

                                                         As we listen, we have limits as to how many

                                                         categories of information we can keep in mind. In

                                                         public speaking, use approximately 3 categories to

                                                         group your information. 2-3 main points - or

                                                         groups - is safe territory, and you should avoiding

                                                         having more than 5 main points for an audience to

                                                         track.

                                                         So, how do you group content or find

LGBTQ+ Rights Advocacy Group Credit: tedeytan            categories. Well, if you're presenting in a team this
https://bit.ly/2VJDX78                                   is a social process. Start talking to each other about

                                                         how you want to organize the content, who would

like to say what, and how you can put it all into a logical order that will resonate with your audience. Use

your research and your brainstorming tactics! As you research, look at the articles and websites you read and

say, "That information relates to what I read over here" and, "That statistic fits under the idea of . . ." You

are looking for similarities and patterns. Think back to the yard sale example - you would group according

to customer interest and the purpose of each item. As you learn more about your topic and expand your

expertise, the patterns and groups will become clearer.

Once you locate a pattern, that information can likely be grouped into your speech's main points. Return

to your central idea or thesis and determine what groups are more suitable to support your specific purpose.

If you continue to find more groups, you may want to limit and narrow your topic down further.

Finally, because your audience will understand you better and perceive you as organized, you will gain

more credibility as a speaker if you are organized, assuming you also have credible information and

acceptable delivery (Slagell, 2013; Sharp & McClung, 1966).

Pro-Tip: Grouping Content Helps Your Writing! Yun, Costantini, and Billingsley (2012) found a side

benefit to learning to be an organized public speaker: your writing skills will improve, specifically your

organization and sentence structure. Working on your organization will increase your critical thinking skills

all around.

A motivated sequence for speaking. One easy way to organize your ideas is as a five-step motivational

checklist. Your goal as a speaking group is to:

1. Get their attention
2. Identify the need (i.e., Problem)
3. Satisfy the need (i.e., Solution to the problem)
4. Present a vision or solution
5. Offer a concrete call to action.

This simple organizational pattern can help you focus on the basic elements of a persuasive message when
time is short and your performance is critical.

PRACTICE!!!!

The first time you make your argument out loud should NOT be the time your public presentation.
Dwyer and Davidson (2012) report that the highest ranked fear among American college students is
public speaking (just above financial problems and death!) Dwyer and Davidson (2012) remind readers,
"High PSA [public speaking anxiety] has been associated with poor speech preparation, poor speech
decision-making and negative affect and effect in performance" (p. 100). So, what does this mean for your
team? First, know that your team will be hesitant to practice in advance (which leads to poor decision-
making, negative feelings, and worse performance). Second, the inverse is also true-the more you and
your teammates practice, the better decisions you will make, the better you will feel, and the better your
persuasive presentation. In short, you need to practice as a team if you expect to present a compelling and
persuasive argument. If your team does not practice in advance you are likely to fumble the presentation,
repeat content, and leave a poor impression. Practice!!! References

GROUPS AND MEETINGS

Meetings are a part of how groups get work done. Some view meetings as boring, pointless, and futile
exercises, while others see them as opportunities to exchange information and produce results. A
combination of preparation and execution makes all the difference. Remember, too, that meetings do
not have to take place in a physical space where the participants meet face to face. Instead, a number of
technological tools make it possible to hold virtual meetings in which the participants are half a world away
from one another. Virtual meetings are formally arranged gatherings where participants, located in distinct
geographic locations, come together via the Internet.

Preparation

A meeting, like a problem-solving group, needs a

clear purpose statement. The specific goal for the

specific meeting will clearly relate to the overall

goal of the group or committee. Determining your

purpose is central to an effective meeting and

getting together just to get together is called a party,

not a meeting. Do not schedule a meeting just

because you met at the same time last month or            Meetings?! Source: http://www.codinghorror.com/
because it is a standing committee. Members will          blog/2012/02/
resent the intrusion into their schedules and             meetings-where-work-goes-to-die.html

quickly perceive the lack of purpose.

Similarly, if the need for a meeting arises, do not rush into it without planning. A poorly planned meeting

announced at the last minute is sure to be less than effective. People may be unable to change their schedules,

may fail to attend, or may impede the progress and discussion of the group because of their absence. Those

who attend may feel hindered because they needed more time to prepare and present comprehensive results

to the group or committee.

DECIDING HOW TO MEET

If a meeting is necessary, and a clear purpose can be articulated, then you'll need to decide how and where
to meet. Distance is no longer an obstacle to participation, as we will see later in this section when we
explore some of the technologies for virtual meetings. However, there are many advantages to meeting in
person. People communicate not just with words but also with their body language--facial expressions,
hand gestures, head nodding or head shaking, and posture. These subtleties of communication can be key
to determining how group members really feel about an issue or question. Meeting in real time can be
important, too, as all group members have the benefit of receiving new information at the same time. For
purposes of our present discussion, we will focus on meetings taking place face to face in real time. Later in
this chapter, we will discuss virtual meetings.

                                                                to each point. Somewhere on the agenda the start

                                                                always a good idea to leave time at the end for
questions and additional points that individual members may want to share. If the meeting has an
emotional point or theme, will require significant deliberation or change, or the news is negative, plan for
additional time for discussion, clarification, and recycling of conversations as the participants process the
information.

INVITING MEETING PARTICIPANTS

If you are planning an intense work session, you need to consider the number of possible interactions
among the participants and limit them. Smaller groups are generally more productive. If you are gathering
to present information or to motivate the sales staff, a large audience, where little interaction is expected, is
appropriate. Each member has a role, and attention to how and why they are interacting will produce the
best results. Review the stages of group formation in view of the idea that a meeting is a short-term group.
You can anticipate a "forming" stage, and if roles are not clear, there may be a bit of "storming" before the
group establishes norms and becomes productive. Adding additional participants for no clear reason will
only make the process more complex and may produce negative results.

   Inviting the participants via e-mail has become increasingly common across business and industry.
Software programs like Microsoft Outlook allow you to initiate a meeting request and receive an "accept"
or "decline" response that makes the invitation process organized and straightforward. Further, increasingly
services like Calendly can integrate meeting participant's calendars, and can even email participants a link
to a virtual meeting or schedule a room. Reliance on a software program, however, may not be enough to
encourage and ensure participation. A reminder on the individual's computer may go off fifteen minutes
prior to the meeting, but if they are away from their computer or if Outlook is not running, the reminder
will go unseen and unheard. A reminder e-mail on the day of the meeting, often early in the morning, can
serve as a personal effort to highlight the activities of the day.

IDENTIFYING AN APPROPRIATE MEETING SPACE

Seating arrangements in meetings have been a recent topic of discussion. Generally, a table that is square,
rectangular, or U-shaped has a fixed point at which the attention is directed, often referred to as the head
                                                   GROUPS AND MEETINGS | 125

of the table. This space is often associated with power, status, and hierarchy and may play an important
role in the flow of interactions across the meeting. If information is to be distributed and presented from
administration to managers, for example, a table with a clear focal point for the head or CEO may be
indicated. Tables that are round, or tables arranged in a circular pattern, allow for a more egalitarian
model of interaction, reducing the hierarchical aspects while reinforcing the clear line of sight among all
participants. If a meeting requires intense interaction and collaboration, generally a round table or a circular
pattern is indicated.

One of the important decisions to make in planning for a meeting is the space in which you will hold it
and the arrangements of that space. For example, different types of tables facilitate different kinds of
interactions during the meeting. (Credit: Christina@WOCinTechChat/Unsplash)

Some meetings do not call for a table, but rather rows of seats all facing toward the speaker; you probably
recognize this arrangement from many class lectures you have attended. For relatively formal meetings in
which information is being delivered to a large number of listeners and little interaction is desired, seating
in rows is an efficient use of space.

   If you are the person responsible for the room reservation, confirm the reservation a week before the
meeting and again the day before the meeting. Redundancy in the confirmation process can help
eliminate double-booking a room, where two meetings are scheduled at the same time. If technology is
required at the meeting, such as a microphone, conference telephone, or laptop and projector, make sure
you confirm their reservation at the same time as you confirm the meeting room reservation. Always
personally inspect the room and test these systems prior to the meeting. There is nothing more embarrassing
than introducing a high-profile speaker, such as the company president, and then finding that the
PowerPoint software or projector is not working properly.

FACILITATING AN EFFECTIVE MEETING

Facilitating a meeting requires care, vigilance, flexibility, resilience, humility, and humor. In a way, to
126 | GROUPS AND MEETINGS

run a meeting effectively calls someone to act the way a skilled athletic coach does, watching the action,
calling plays, and encouraging good performance. Furthermore, you need to monitor the interaction of
everyone around you and "call the plays" based on a game plan that you and your fellow group members
have presumably agreed upon in advance. Finally, like a coach, you sometimes need to call
timeouts--breaks--when people are weary or the action is starting to get raggedy or undisciplined.

MEETING CHECKLIST FOR PARTICIPANTS

Mary Ellen Guffey (2017) provides a useful participant checklist that is adapted here for our use:

 · Arrive on time and stay until the meeting adjourns (unless there are prior arrangements)
 · Leave the meeting only for established breaks or emergencies
 · Be prepared and have everything you need on hand
 · Turn off cell phones and personal digital assistants
 · Follow the established protocol for turn taking
 · Respect time limits
 · Demonstrate professionalism in your verbal and nonverbal interactions
 · Communicate interest and stay engaged in the discussion
 · Avoid tangents and side discussions
 · Respect space and don't place your notebook or papers all around you
 · Clean up after yourself
 · Engage in polite conversation after the conclusion

Perils of Poor Facilitation

Unfortunately, many people lack the skills to effectively facilitate a meeting. As a result, a variety of negative
results can take place as they fail to act capably as meeting facilitators. Here are some signs to watch for:

 · An argument starts about an established fact.
 · Opinions are introduced as if they were truths.
 · People intimidate others with real or imaginary "knowledge."
 · People overwhelm each other with too many proposals for the time available to consider them.
 · People become angry for no good reason.
 · People promote their own visions at the expense of everyone else's.
 · People demand or offer much more information than is needed.
 · Discussion becomes circular; people repeat themselves without making any progress toward

      conclusions.

Guidelines for Facilitating a Meeting

Many authorities have recommended actions and attitudes which can help you facilitate a meeting well
(Barge, 1991; Lumsden & Lumsden 2004; Parker & Hoffman, 2006). Here are several such suggestions,
taken partly from these writers' works and partly from the authors' experiences as facilitators and
participants in meetings over the years:

1. Start promptly: Some time, calculate the cost to your group--even at minimum-wage rates--for the
                                                  GROUPS AND MEETINGS | 127

     minutes its members sit around waiting for meetings to begin. You may occasionally be delayed for
     good reasons, but if you're chronically late you'll eventually aggravate folks who've arrived on
     time--the very ones whose professionalism you'd particularly like to reinforce and praise.
     Consistently starting on time may even boost morale: "Early in, early out" will probably appeal to
     most of a group's members, since they are likely to have other things they need to do as soon as a
     meeting ends.
2. Begin with something positive: Face it: no matter what you do, many people in your group would
     probably rather be somewhere else than in a meeting. If you'd like them to overcome this familiar
     aversion and get pumped up about what you'll be doing in a meeting, therefore, you might emulate
     the practice of City Year, a Boston-based nonprofit international service organization. City Year
     begins its meetings by inviting members to describe from their own recent life experiences an example
     of what Robert F. Kennedy referred to as a "ripple of hope" (Grossman, 1998). This could be a good
     deed they've seen someone do for someone else, a news item about a decline in the crime rate, or
     perhaps even a loving note they've received from a child or other family member. Sharing with their
     fellow group members such examples of altruism, love, or community improvement focuses and
     motivates City Year members by reminding them in specific, personal terms of why their meetings
     can be truly worthwhile.
3. Tend to housekeeping details: People's productivity depends in part on their biological state. Once
     you convene your meeting, announce or remind the group members of where they can find
     restrooms, water fountains, vending machines, and any other amenities that may contribute to their
     physical comfort.
4. Make sure people understand their roles. At the start of the meeting, review what you understand is
     going to happen and ask for confirmation of what you think people are expected to do in the time
     you're going to be spending together. Calling on someone to make a report if he or she isn't aware it's
     required can be embarrassing for both you and that person.
5. Keep to your agenda. Social time makes people happy and relieves stress. Most group meetings,
     however, should not consist primarily of social time. You may want to designate someone in the
     group to watch for departures from the agenda and courteously direct people back on task. Either
     you or the that person might want to periodically provide "signposts" indicating where you are in
     your process, too, such as "It looks like we've got 25 minutes left in our meeting, and we haven't
     discussed yet who's going to be working on the report to give to Mary." If your meetings habitually
     exceed the time you allot for them, consider either budgeting more time or, if you want to stick to
     your guns, setting a kitchen timer to ring when you've reached the point when you've said you'll quit.
     The co-founder of one technology firm, Jeff Atwood, put together a list of rules for his company's
     meetings which included this one: "No meeting should ever be more than an hour, under penalty of
     death" (Milian, 2012). Similarly, the library staff at one college in the Midwest conducts all their
     meetings standing up in a circle, which encourages brevity and efficiency.
6. Guide, don't dictate: If you're in charge of the meeting, that doesn't mean you're responsible for
     everything people say in it, nor does it mean you have to personally comment on every idea or
     proposal that comes up. Let the other members of the group carry the content as long as they're not
     straying from the process you feel needs to be followed. You may see that some people regularly
     dominate discussion in your group's meetings and that others are perhaps slower to talk despite
     having important contributions to make. One way to deal with these disparities is by providing the
     group with a "talking stick" and specifying that people must hold it in their hands in order to speak.
     You could also invoke the NOSTUESOrule with respect to the talking stick, which says that "No
     One Speaks Twice Until Everybody Speaks Once."
7. Pay attention to nonverbal communication. As a meeting progresses, people's physical and emotional
128 | GROUPS AND MEETINGS

       states are likely to change. As the facilitator, you should do your best to identify such change and
       accommodate it within the structures and processes your group has established for itself. When
       people do something as simple as crossing their arms in front of them, for instance, they might be
       signaling that they're closed to what others are saying--or they might just be trying to stay warm in a
       room that feels too cold to them. When one person in the meeting has the floor and is talking, it's a
       good idea to watch how the rest of the group seems to be responding. You may notice clues
       indicating that people are pleased and receptive, or that they're uninterested, skeptical, or even itching
       to respond negatively. You may want to do a perception check to see if you're interpreting nonverbal
       cues accurately. For instance, you might say, "Terry, could we pause here a bit? I get the impression
       that people might have some questions for you." As an alternative, you might address the whole
       group and ask "Does anyone have questions for Terry at this point?"
 8. Capture and assign action items. Unless they are held purely to communicate information, or for
       other special purposes, most meetings result in action items, tasks, and other assignments for one or
       more participants. Sometimes these items arise unexpectedly because someone comes up with a great
       new idea and volunteers or is assigned to pursue it after the discussion ends. Be on the alert for these
       elements of a meeting.
 9. Avoid sarcasm and cynicism. Encourage humor and merriment. If your agenda includes some
       challenging items, try to start out with "quick wins" to warm the mood of the group.
10. Take breaks regularly, even when you think you don't need them. If you've ever gone on a long hike
       on a beautiful day, you may have decided to continue a mile or two beyond your original intended
       destination because the scenery was beautiful and you were feeling spunky. If you're like the authors,
       though, you probably regretted "going the extra mile" later because it meant you had to go back that
       mile plus all the rest of the way you'd come. Something similar can arise in a meeting. People
       sometimes feel full of energy and clamor to keep a lively discussion going past the time scheduled for
       a break, but they may not realize that they're tiring and losing focus until someone says or does
       something ill-advised. Taking even five-minute breathers at set intervals can help group members
       remain physically refreshed over the long haul.
11. Show respect for everyone. Seek consensus. Avoid groupthink by encouraging a free and full airing
       of opinions. Observe the Golden Rule. Listen sincerely to everyone, but avoid giving a small minority
       so much clout that in disputed matters "99-to-1 is a tie." Keep disagreements agreeable. If you must
       criticize, criticize positions, not people. There is never a need to comment on people's identities when
       you are in a disagreement (i.e., sex, race, sexual orientation, etc.) If someone's behavior shows a
       pattern of consistently irritating others or disrupting the flow of your group's meetings, talk to the
       person privately and express your concern in a polite but clear fashion. Be specific in stating what you
       expect the person to do or stop doing, and keep an open mind to whatever response you receive.
12. Expect the unexpected. Do your best to anticipate and prepare for confrontations and conflicts. If
       you didn't already make time to do so earlier, take a minute just before the start of the meeting to
       mark items on your agenda which you think might turn out to be especially contentious or time-
       consuming. When unexpected disagreements occur during the meeting allow for dialogue and
       embrace other meeting suggestions (e.g., respect one another, take breaks when needed, avoid
       sarcasm, etc.). At the extreme, if an unexpected disagreement emerges which might derail the rest of
       the meeting, table the contentious item, invite outside task that might help the group reach a
       resolution, and place the issue on the agenda for a future meeting.
13. Conduct multiple assessments of the meeting. Formative assessment takes place during an activity
       and allows people to modify their behavior in response to its results. Why not perform a brief interim
       evaluation during every meeting in which you ask, for instance, "If we were to end this meeting right
       now, where would it be, and if we need to make changes now in what's happening in our meeting,
                                                   GROUPS AND MEETINGS | 129

       what should they be?" Summative assessment is implemented at the end of an activity. When you
       finish a meeting, for example, you might check to see how well people feel that the gathering met its
       intended goals. If you want something in writing, you might distribute a half sheet of paper to each
       person asking "What was best about our meeting?" and "What might have made this meeting
       better?" Or you could write two columns on a whiteboard, one with a plus and the other with a
       minus, and ask people orally to identify items they think belong in each category. If you feel a less
       formal check-up is sufficient, you might just go around the table or room and ask every person for
       one word that captures how she or he feels.
14. Think (and talk) ahead. If you didn't write it on your agenda--which would have been a good idea,
       most likely--remind group members, before the meeting breaks up, of where and when their next
       gathering is to take place.

POST-Meeting Communication

 Once the meeting has accomplished its goals in the established time frame, it is time to facilitate the
 transition to a conclusion. Many meeting facilitators conclude by summarizing what has been discussed or
 decided, and what actions the group members are to take as a result of the meeting. If there is a clear purpose
 for holding a subsequent meeting, discuss the time and date, and specifically note assignments for next time.
 This information is also recorded in meeting minutes.

    Minutes are a written document that serves to record the interaction and can provide an opportunity for
 clarification. Minutes often appear as the agenda with notes in relation to actions taken during the meeting
 or specific indications of who is responsible for what before the next meeting. In many organizations,
 minutes of the meeting are tentative, like a rough draft, until they are approved by the members of the
 group or committee. Normally minutes are sent within a week of the meeting if it is a monthly event, and
 more quickly if the need to meet more frequently has been determined. If your group or organization does
 not call for minutes, you can still benefit by reviewing your notes after a meeting and comparing them with
 those of others to make sure you understood what was discussed and did not miss--or misinterpret--any
 key information.

Using Technology to Facilitate Meetings

 Given the widespread availability and increasingly low cost of electronic communication, technologies that
 once served to bring people together across continents and time zones are now also serving people in the
 same geographic area. Rather than traveling (by plane, car, or even elevator within the same building) to
 a central point for a face-to-face interaction, busy and cost-conscious professionals often choose to see
 and hear each other via one of many different electronic interface technologies (e.g., Teams, Skype, Zoom,
 WebEx, etc.). It is important to be aware of the dimensions of nonverbal communication that are lost in a
 virtual meeting compared to an in-person meeting. Nevertheless, these technologies are a boon to today's
 business organizations, and knowing how to use them is a key skill for all job seekers. We will discuss the
 technologies by category, beginning with audio-only, then audio-visual, and finally social media.

Audio-Only Interactions

 The simplest form of audio-only interaction is, of course, a telephone call. Chances are that you have
 been using the phone all your life, yet did you know that some executives hire professional voice coaches
130 | GROUPS AND MEETINGS

to help them increase their effectiveness in phone communication? When you stop to think about it,
we use a great many audio-only modes of communication, ranging from phone calls and voice-activated
telephone menus to radio interviews, public address systems, dictation recording systems, and computer
voice recognition technology. The importance of audio communication in the business world has increased
with the availability of conference calls, Web conferences, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)
communications.

   Your voice has qualities that cannot be communicated in written form, and you can use these qualities to
your advantage as you interact with colleagues. Your tone, quality, volume, pitch, and other vocal qualities
affect how your message will be received. If you are sending a general informative message to all employees,
an e-mail may serve you well, but if you are congratulating one employee on receiving an industry award,
your voice as the channel carries your enthusiasm.

   Take care to pay attention to your pronunciation of words, stating them correctly in normal ways, and
avoiding words that you are not comfortable with as you may mispronounce them. Mispronunciation can
have a negative impact on your reputation or perceived credibility. Instead of using complicated words that
may cause you to stumble, choose a simple phrase if you can, or learn to pronounce the word correctly
before you use it in a formal interactive setting.

Audio-Visual Interactions

Rather than call each other, we often call and interact in both audio and visual ways via the Internet. There
are several ways to interface via audio and video, and new technologies in this area are being invented all
the time. For example, platforms like Zoom or WebEx allow participants to see and hear each other across
time and distance with one-on-one calls and video conferencing. This form of audio-visual communication
is quickly becoming a low- or no-cost business tool for interaction.

                                                                                                               On the Internet, a
                                                                                                               majority of our
                                                                                                               interactions take
                                                                                                               place
                                                                                                               audio-visually,
                                                                                                               using platforms
                                                                                                               such as Skype or
                                                                                                               Zoom. (Credit:

                                                                                                               Montgomery/Zoo
                                                                                                               m Call with
                                                                                                               Coffee/Unsplash).

If you are going to interact via audio and visual signals, make sure you are prepared. Appropriate dress,
setting, and attitude are all required. Pay close attention to your surroundings and what will be visible to
others. The integration of a visual signal to the traditional phone call means that nonverbal gestures can
now be observed in real time and can both aid and detract from the message.
                                                   GROUPS AND MEETINGS | 131

   If you are unfamiliar with the technology, practice with it before your actual business interaction. Try
out the features with a friend and know where to find and access the information. If the call doesn't go as
planned, or the signal isn't what you expected or experienced in the past, keep a good attitude and try again.

   Recent evidence suggests that audio-video meetings can be more exhausting. This is because members
work hard to focus on their own and others non-verbal cues (Fosslien & Duffy, 2020). So, while there are
many benefits to `cameras on' it may also be useful to have meetings with `cameras off' or `cameras optional.'
This high-intensity exhaustion even has its own concept: Zoom Fatigue.. Fosslien and Duffy (2020) offer
five tips to avoid Zoom fatigure:

1. Build in breaks
2. Reduce onscreen stimuli-avoid multitasking and close extra windows/applications
3. Make virtual social events opt-in
4. Switch to phone calls or email
5. For external calls, avoid defaulting to video, especially if you don't know each other well

Whether the meeting is virtual, face-to-face, or over the phone many of the same principles still apply. As a
meeting organizer you need to have an agenda, invite only those who are needed to accomplish the meeting
goals, be clear about who is doing what, and prepare for (valuable) deliberation.

TIPS FOR VIRTUAL MEETINGS

Here are some further tips and suggestions for leading or participating in virtual meetings, each based on
the unique features of such gatherings:

1. Get all the participants in an audio meeting to say something brief at the start of the meeting so that
      everyone becomes familiar with everyone else's voice.

2. Remind people of the purpose of the meeting and of the key outcome(s) you hope to achieve
      together.

3. Listen/watch for people who aren't participating and ask them periodically if they have thoughts or
      suggestions to add to the discussion.

4. Summarize the status of the meeting from time to time.
5. Because you may not have nonverbal cues to refer to, ask other members to clarify their meanings and

      intentions if you're not sure their words alone convey all you need to know.
6. If you know you're going to have to leave a meeting before it ends, inform the organizer in advance.

      Sign off publicly, but quickly, when you leave rather than just hanging up on the meeting connection.

GANTT CHARTS

A Gantt chart showing three kinds of schedule dependencies (in red) and percent complete indications.

Introduction

A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to be
performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis.The width of the horizontal
bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates
of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements
constitute the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency
relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-
complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown in the graphic above. There is not one correct
way to create a Gantt chart, but the chart should include clear dates and separate major milestones in
the project. Gantt charts represent a commitment to a timeline for the project by a team. This also means
that creating a Gantt chart involves some estimation about how long each project will take and create a
structure for the team to follow in order to reach their goals. Gantt charts are usually created initially using
an early start time approach, where each task is scheduled to start immediately when its prerequisites are
complete. This method maximizes the float time available for all tasks. Gantt charts are "one of the most
widely used management tools for project scheduling and control" In the following table there are seven
134 | GANTT CHART

tasks, labeled a through g. Some tasks can be done concurrently (a and b) while others cannot be done until
their predecessor task is complete (c and d cannot begin until a is complete; a dependency relationship).
Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (O), the most likely or normal
time estimate (M), and the pessimistic time estimate (P). The expected time (TE) is estimated.

                      Time estimates

Activity Predecessor                                 Expected time (TE)

                      Opt. (O) Normal (M) Pess. (P)

a  --                 2  4            6              4.00

b  --                 3  5            9              5.33

c  a                  4  5            7              5.17

d  a                  4  6            10             6.33

e  b, c               4  5            7              5.17

f  d                  3  4            8              4.50

g  e                  3  5            8              5.17

Once estimates and dependencies are understood, a team can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.
Below are several examples of Gantt Charts.

   A Gantt chart created using Microsoft Project (MSP). Note (1) the dependency relationships are in
red, (2) the float time is represented by black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday
and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are
longer if they cut through a weekend.

   A Gantt chart is essentially a tool for project management. According to an article on Asanda.com (a
company specializing in project management software), the Gantt Chart typically includes the following
pieces of information:

 · When the project is due
 · When to start and finish each task
 · How long each task takes
 · Who is responsible for each task
 · Which tasks depend on others
 · How each task is categorized or grouped

ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

The following content comes from Organizational Behavior

Just like individuals, you can think of teams and organizations as having their own personalities, more
typically known as organizational or team cultures. The opening case illustrates that Nordstrom is a
retailer with the foremost value of making customers happy. At Nordstrom, when a customer is unhappy,
employees are expected to identify what would make the person satisfied, and then act on it, without
necessarily checking with a superior or consulting a lengthy policy book. If they do not, they receive peer
pressure and may be made to feel that they let the company down. In other words, this organization seems
to have successfully created a service culture. Understanding how organizational and team culture is created,
communicated, and changed will help you be more effective in your organizational life.

     Example: Building a Customer Service Culture: The Case of Nordstrom

                                      Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN) is a Seattle-

                                      based department store rivaling the likes of

                                      Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and

                                      Bloomingdale's. Nordstrom is a Hall of Fame

                                      member of Fortune magazine's "100 Best

                                      Companies to Work For" list, including being

                                      ranked 34th in 2008. Nordstrom is known for

                                      its quality apparel, upscale environment, and

                                      generous employee rewards. However, what

                                      Nordstrom is most famous for is its delivery

                                      norms of the retail industry. Stories about

Nordstrom service abound. For example, according to one story the company confirms, in 1975

Nordstrom moved into a new location that had formerly been a tire store. A customer brought a

set of tires into the store to return them. Without a word about the mix-up, the tires were

accepted, and the customer was fully refunded the purchase price. In a different story, a

customer tried on several pairs of shoes but failed to find the right combination of size and color.

As she was about to leave, the clerk called other Nordstrom stores but could only locate the

right pair at Macy's, a nearby competitor. The clerk had Macy's shipped the shoes to the

customer's home at Nordstrom's expense. In a third story, a customer describes wandering into

a Portland, Oregon, Nordstrom looking for an Armani tuxedo for his daughter's wedding. The

sales associate took his measurements just in case one was found. The next day, the customer

got a phone call, informing him that the tux was available. When pressed, she revealed that

using her connections she found one in New York, had it put on a truck destined to Chicago, and
138 | ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

     dispatched someone to meet the truck in Chicago at a rest stop. The next day she shipped the
     tux to the customer's address, and the customer found that the tux had already been altered for
     his measurements and was ready to wear. What is even more impressive about this story is that
     Nordstrom does not sell Armani tuxedos.
     How does Nordstrom persist in creating these stories? If you guessed that they have a large
     number of rules and regulations designed to emphasize quality in customer service, you'd be
     wrong. In fact, the company gives employees a 5½-inch by 7½-inch card as the employee
     handbook. On one side of the card, the company welcomes employees to Nordstrom and states
     that their number one goal is to provide outstanding customer service, and for this they have
     only one rule. On the other side of the card, the single rule is stated: "Use good judgment in all
     situations." By leaving it in the hands of Nordstrom associates, the company seems to have
     empowered employees who deliver customer service heroics every day.

    Discussion Questions

        1. Describe Nordstrom's organizational culture.
       2. Despite the low wages and long hours that are typical of retail employment, Nordstrom

             still has the ability to motivate its staff to exhibit exemplary customer service. How might
             this be explained?
       3. What suggestions would you give Nordstrom for maintaining and evolving the
             organizational culture that has contributed to its success?
       4. What type of organizational culture do you view as most important?
       5. What attributes of Nordstrom's culture do you find most appealing?

 What Is Organizational Culture?

   Organizational culture refers to a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that show
employees what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior (Chatman & Eunyoung, 2003; Kerr & Slocum,
2005). These values have a strong influence on employee behavior as well as organizational performance.
In fact, the term organizational culture was made popular in the 1980s when Peters and Waterman's best-
selling book In Search of Excellence made the argument that company success could be attributed to an
organizational culture that was decisive, customer-oriented, empowering, and people-oriented. Since then,
organizational culture has become the subject of numerous research studies, books, and articles. However,
organizational culture is still a relatively new concept. In contrast to a topic such as leadership, which
has a history spanning several centuries, organizational culture is a young but fast-growing area within
organizational behavior.

   Geertz (1973) discussed culture as "webs of significance" that people, as symbolic creatures, have
collectively spun (pp. 5-6). Pacanowsky and O'Donnell-Trujillo (1983) proposed that researchers should
                                              ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE | 139

start focusing on the act of spinning the web. If we focus only on cultural webs, researchers cannot wholly
grasp organizational culture, we miss the vital aspect of our agency and contribute to those webs.

   Culture is by and large invisible to individuals. Even though it affects all employee behaviors, thinking,
and behavioral patterns, individuals tend to become more aware of their organization's culture when
they have the opportunity to compare it to other organizations or teams. If you have worked in multiple
organizations, you can attest to this. Maybe the first organization you worked in was a place where
employees dressed formally. It was completely inappropriate to question your boss in a meeting; such
behaviors would only be acceptable in private. It was important to check your e-mail at night as well as
during weekends or else you would face questions on Monday about where you were and whether you
were sick. Contrast this company to a second organization where employees dress more casually. You are
encouraged to raise issues and question your boss or peers, even in front of clients. What is more important
is not to maintain impressions but to arrive at the best solution to any problem. It is widely known that
family life is very important, so it is acceptable to leave work a bit early to go to a family event. Additionally,
you are not expected to do work at night or over the weekends unless there is a deadline. These two
hypothetical organizations illustrate that organizations have different cultures, and culture dictates what is
right and what is acceptable behavior as well as what is wrong and unacceptable.

Why Does Organizational Culture Matter?

An organization or team's culture may be one of its strongest assets, as well as its biggest liability. In fact,
it has been argued that organizations that have a rare and hard-to-imitate organizational culture benefit
from it as a competitive advantage (Barney, 1986). In a survey conducted by the management consulting
firm Bain & Company in 2007, worldwide business leaders identified corporate culture as important as
corporate strategy for business success (Why culture can mean life or death, 2007). This comes as no
surprise to many leaders of successful businesses, who are quick to attribute their company's success to their
organization's culture.

   Culture represents shared values within the organization or team and is often related to increased
performance. Researchers found a relationship between organizational cultures and company performance,
with respect to success indicators such as revenues, sales volume, market share, and stock prices (Kotter &
Heskett, 1992; Marcoulides & Heck, 1993). At the same time, it is important to have a culture that fits
with the demands of the company's environment. To the extent shared values are proper for the company
in question, company performance may benefit from culture (Arogyaswamy & Byles, 1987). For example,
if a company is in the high-tech industry, having a culture that encourages innovativeness and adaptability
will support its performance. However, if a company in the same industry has a culture characterized
by stability, a high respect for tradition, and a strong preference for upholding rules and procedures, the
company may suffer as a result of its culture. In other words, just as having the "right" culture may be a
competitive advantage for an organization, having the "wrong" culture may lead to performance difficulties,
may be responsible for organizational failure, and may act as a barrier preventing the company from
changing and taking risks.

   Finally, organizational culture is an effective control mechanism for dictating employee behavior. Culture
is in fact a more powerful way of controlling and managing employee behaviors than organizational rules
and regulations. Norms are more powerful than rules. When problems are unique, rules tend to be less
helpful. Instead, creating a culture of customer service achieves the same result by encouraging employees
to think like customers, knowing that the company priorities in this case are clear: Keeping the customer
happy is preferable to other concerns such as saving the cost of a refund.

Levels of Organizational Culture

Organizational culture consists of some aspects that are relatively more visible, as well as aspects that

may lie below one's conscious awareness. Organizational culture can be thought of as consisting of three

interrelated levels (Schein, 1992).

                                                     At the deepest level, below our awareness lie

                                                     basic assumptions. Assumptions are taken for

                                                     granted, and they reflect beliefs about human

                                                     nature and reality. At the second level, values exist.

                                                     Values are shared principles, standards, and goals.

                                                     Finally, at the surface we have artifacts, or visible,

                                                     tangible aspects of organizational culture. For

spaces and gathering areas equipped with pool tables, and frequent company picnics in the workplace. For

example, Alcoa Inc. designed their headquarters to reflect the values of making people more visible and

accessible and to promote collaboration (Stegmeier, 2008). In other words, understanding the

organization's culture may start from observing its artifacts: the physical environment, employee

interactions, company policies, reward systems, and other observable characteristics. When you are

interviewing for a position, observing the physical environment, how people dress, where they relax, and

how they talk to others is definitely a good start to understanding the company's culture.

                                                     However, simply looking at tangible aspects is

                                                     unlikely to give a full picture of the organization.

Characteristics of Organizational Culture

Strength of Culture

A strong culture is one that is shared by organizational members (Arogyaswamy & Byles, 1987; Chatman

& Eunyoung, 2003). In other words, if most employees in the organization show consensus regarding the

values of the company, the company show signs of a strong culture. A culture's content is more likely to

affect the way employees think and behave when the culture in question is strong. For example, cultural

values emphasizing customer service will lead to higher quality customer service if there is widespread

agreement among employees on the importance of customer service-related values (Schneider et al., 2002).

A strong culture may act as an asset or liability

for the organization, depending on the types of

values that are shared. For example, imagine a

company with a culture that is strongly outcome

oriented. If this value system matches the

organizational environment, the company

outperforms its competitors. On the other hand, a

strong outcome-oriented culture coupled with

unethical behaviors and an obsession with

quantitative performance indicators may be

detrimental to an organization's effectiveness. An

extreme example of this dysfunctional type of

strong culture is Enron.

A strong culture may sometimes outperform a

weak culture because of the consistency of           Walt Disney created a strong culture at his
expectations. In a strong culture, members know      company, which has evolved since the company's

behaviors. Research shows that strong cultures

lead to more stable corporate performance in stable environments. However, in volatile environments, the

advantages of culture strength disappear (Sorensen 2002).

One limitation of a strong culture is the difficulty of changing a strong culture. If an organization with

widely shared beliefs decides to adopt a different set of values, unlearning the old values and learning the

new ones will be a challenge, because employees will need to adopt new ways of thinking, behaving, and

responding to critical events. For example, the Home Depot Inc. had a decentralized, autonomous culture

where many business decisions were made using "gut feeling" while ignoring the available data. When

Robert Nardelli became CEO of the company in 2000, he decided to change its culture, starting with

centralizing many of the decisions that were previously left to individual stores. This initiative met with

substantial resistance, and many high-level employees left during his first year. Despite getting financial

results such as doubling the sales of the company, many of the changes he made were criticized. He left the

company in January 2007 (Charan, 2006; Herman & Wernle, 2007).

A strong culture may also be a liability during a merger. During mergers and acquisitions, companies

inevitably experience a clash of cultures, as well as a clash of structures and operating systems. Culture

clash becomes more problematic if both parties have unique and strong cultures. For example, during the

merger of Daimler AG with Chrysler Motors LLC to create DaimlerChrysler AG, the differing strong

cultures of each company acted as a barrier to effective integration. Daimler had a strong engineering culture
142 | ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

that was more hierarchical and emphasized routinely working long hours. Daimler employees were used to
being part of an elite organization, evidenced by flying first class on all business trips. On the other hand,
Chrysler had a sales culture where employees and managers were used to autonomy, working shorter hours,
and adhering to budget limits that meant only the elite flew first class. The different ways of thinking and
behaving in these two companies introduced a number of unanticipated problems during the integration
process (Badrtalei & Bates, 2007; Bower, 2001). Differences in culture may be part of the reason that, in the
end, the merger didn't work out.

Do Organizations Have a Single Culture?

So far, we have assumed that a company has a single culture that is shared throughout the organization.
However, you may have realized that this is an oversimplification. In reality there might be multiple cultures
within any given organization-and teams form meaningful cultures. For example, people working on the
sales floor may experience a different culture from that experienced by people working in the warehouse.
A culture that emerges within different departments, branches, teams, or geographic locations is called a
subculture. Subcultures may arise from the personal characteristics of employees and managers, as well
as the different conditions under which work is performed. Within the same organization, marketing
and manufacturing departments often have different cultures such that the marketing department may
emphasize innovativeness, whereas the manufacturing department may have a shared emphasis on detail
orientation.

   In an interesting study, researchers uncovered five different subcultures within a single police
organization. These subcultures differed depending on the level of danger involved and the type of
background experience the individuals held, including "crime-fighting street professionals" who did what
their job required without rigidly following protocol and "anti-military social workers" who felt that most
problems could be resolved by talking to the parties involved (Jermier et al., 1991). Research has shown
that employee perceptions regarding subcultures were related to employee commitment to the organization
(Lok et al., 2005). Therefore, in addition to understanding the broader organization's values, managers
will need to make an effort to understand subculture values to see its impact on workforce behavior and
attitudes. Moreover, as an employee, you need to understand the type of subculture in the department
where you will work in addition to understanding the company's overall culture.

   Sometimes, a subculture may take the form of a counterculture, or shared values and beliefs that
are in direct opposition to the values of the broader organizational culture (Kerr & Slocum, 2005).
Countercultures are often shaped around a charismatic leader. For example, within a large bureaucratic
organization, an enclave of innovativeness and risk taking may emerge within a single department. A
counterculture may be tolerated by the organization as long as it is bringing in results and contributing
positively to the effectiveness of the organization. However, its existence may be perceived as a threat to the
broader organizational culture. In some cases this may lead to actions that would take away the autonomy
of the managers and eliminate the counterculture.

Creating and Maintaining Organizational Culture

How Are Cultures Created?

Where do cultures come from? Understanding this question is important so that you know how they can be
                                              ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE | 143

changed. An organization or team's culture is shaped as the organization or team faces external and internal
challenges and learns how to deal with them. When the organization's way of doing business provides
a successful adaptation to environmental challenges and ensures success, those values are retained. These
values and ways of doing business are taught to new members as the way to do business (Schein, 1992).

Culture Creation and Maintenance
The factors that are most important in the creation of an organization's culture include founders' values,
preferences, and industry demands.

How Are Cultures Maintained?

As a company matures, its cultural values are refined and strengthened. The early values of a company's
culture exert influence over its future values. It is possible to think of organizational culture as an organism
that protects itself from external forces. Organizational culture determines what types of people are hired
by an organization and what types are left out. Moreover, once new employees are hired, the company
assimilates new employees and teaches them the way things are done in the organization. We call this
processes onboarding.. Below examine the role of leaders and reward systems in shaping and maintaining
an organization's culture. It is important to remember two points: The process of culture creation is in fact
more complex and less clean than the name implies. Additionally, the influence of each factor on culture
creation is reciprocal. For example, just as leaders may influence what type of values the company has, the
culture may also determine what types of behaviors leaders demonstrate.

    You've Got a New Job! Now How Do You Get on Board?

        · Gather information. Try to find as much about the company and the job as you can before
             your first day. After you start working, be a good observer, gather information, and read
             as much as you can to understand your job and the company. Examine how people are
             interacting, how they dress, and how they act to avoid behaviors that might indicate to
             others that you are a misfit.

        · Manage your first impression. First impressions may endure, so make sure that you dress
             appropriately, are friendly, and communicate your excitement to be a part of the team. Be
             on your best behavior!

        · Invest in relationship development. The relationships you develop with your manager and
             with coworkers will be essential for you to adjust to your new job. Take the time to strike
             up conversations with them. If there are work functions during your early days, make
             sure not to miss them!

        · Seek feedback. Ask your manager or coworkers how well you are doing and whether you
             are meeting expectations. Listen to what they are telling you and also listen to what they
             are not saying. Then, make sure to act upon any suggestions for improvement. Be aware
             that after seeking feedback, you may create a negative impression if you consistently
             ignore the feedback you receive.

        · Show success early on. In order to gain the trust of your new manager and colleagues,
             you may want to establish a history of success early. Volunteer for high-profile projects
             where you will be able to demonstrate your skills. Alternatively, volunteer for projects
             that may serve as learning opportunities or that may put you in touch with the key
             people in the company.

Leadership

Leaders are instrumental in creating and changing an organization's culture. There is a direct
correspondence between a leader's style and an organization's culture. For example, when leaders motivate
employees through inspiration, corporate culture tends to be more supportive and people oriented. When
leaders motivate by making rewards contingent on performance, the corporate culture tends to be more
performance oriented and competitive (Sarros et al., 2002). In these and many other ways, what leaders do
directly influences the cultures their organizations have.

   Part of the leader's influence over culture is through role modeling. Many studies have suggested that
leader behavior, the consistency between organizational policy and leader actions, and leader role modeling
determine the degree to which the organization's culture emphasizes ethics (Driscoll & McKee, 2007). The
leader's own behaviors will signal to employees what is acceptable behavior and what is unacceptable. In
an organization in which high-level managers make the effort to involve others in decision making and
                                              ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE | 145

seek opinions of others, a team-oriented culture is more likely to evolve. By acting as role models, leaders
send signals to the organization about the norms and values that are expected to guide the actions of
organizational members.

   Leaders also shape culture by their reactions to the actions of others around them. For example, do they
praise a job well done, or do they praise a favored employee regardless of what was accomplished? How do
they react when someone admits to making an honest mistake? What are their priorities? In meetings, what
types of questions do they ask? Do they want to know what caused accidents so that they can be prevented,
or do they seem more concerned about how much money was lost as a result of an accident? Do they seem
outraged when an employee is disrespectful to a coworker, or does their reaction depend on whether they
like the harasser? Through their day-to-day actions, leaders shape and maintain an organization's culture.

Reward Systems

Finally, the company culture is shaped by the type of reward systems used in the organization, and the
kinds of behaviors and outcomes it chooses to reward and punish. One relevant element of the reward
system is whether the organization rewards behaviors or results. Some companies have reward systems that
emphasize intangible elements of performance as well as more easily observable metrics. In these companies,
supervisors and peers may evaluate an employee's performance by assessing the person's behaviors as well
as the results. In such companies, we may expect a culture that is relatively people or team oriented, and
employees act as part of a family (Kerr & Slocum, 2005). On the other hand, in companies that purely
reward goal achievement, there is a focus on measuring only the results without much regard to the process.
In these companies, we might observe outcome-oriented and competitive cultures. Another categorization
of reward systems might be whether the organization uses rankings or ratings. In a company where the
reward system pits members against one another, where employees are ranked against each other and the
lower performers receive long-term or short-term punishments, it would be hard to develop a culture of
people orientation and may lead to a competitive culture. On the other hand, evaluation systems that
reward employee behavior by comparing them to absolute standards as opposed to comparing employees
to each other may pave the way to a team-oriented culture. Whether the organization rewards performance
or seniority would also make a difference in culture. When promotions are based on seniority, it would be
difficult to establish a culture of outcome orientation. Finally, the types of behaviors that are rewarded or
ignored set the tone for the culture. Service-oriented cultures reward, recognize, and publicize exceptional
service on the part of their employees. In safety cultures, safety metrics are emphasized and the organization
is proud of its low accident ratings. What behaviors are rewarded, which ones are punished, and which are
ignored will determine how a company's culture evolves.

Visual Elements of Organizational Culture

How do you find out about a company's culture? We emphasized earlier that culture influences the way
members of the organization think, behave, and interact with one another. Thus, one way of finding out
about a company's culture is by observing employees or interviewing them. At the same time, culture
manifests itself in some visible aspects of the organization's environment. In this section, we discuss five
ways in which culture shows itself to observers and employees.

Mission Statement

A mission statement is a statement of purpose, describing who the company is and what it does. Many
146 | ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

companies have mission statements, but they do not always reflect the company's values and its purpose. An
effective mission statement is well known by employees, is transmitted to all employees starting from their
first day at work, and influences employee behavior.

   Not all mission statements are effective, many are written by public relations specialists focus on external
audiences, such statements may not affect how employees act or behave. In fact, some mission statements
reflect who the company wants to be as opposed to who they actually are. If the mission statement does
not affect employee behavior on a day-to-day basis, it has little usefulness as a tool for understanding the
company's culture. An oft-cited example of a mission statement that had little impact on how a company
operates belongs to Enron. Their missions and values statement began, "As a partner in the communities
in which we operate, Enron believes it has a responsibility to conduct itself according to certain basic
principles." Their values statement included such ironic declarations as "We do not tolerate abusive or
disrespectful treatment. Ruthlessness, callousness and arrogance don't belong here" (Kunen, 2002).

   A mission statement that is taken seriously and widely communicated may provide insights into the
corporate culture. For example, the Mayo Clinic's mission statement is "The needs of the patient come
first." This mission statement evolved from the founders who are quoted as saying, "The best interest of
the patient is the only interest to be considered." Mayo Clinics have a corporate culture that puts patients
first. For example, no incentives are given to physicians based on the number of patients they see. Because
doctors are salaried, they have no interest in retaining a patient for themselves and they refer the patient to
other doctors when needed (Jarnagin & Slocum, 2007).

Rituals

Rituals refer to repetitive activities within an
organization that have symbolic meaning (Anand,
2005). Usually rituals have their roots in the
history of a company's culture. They create
camaraderie and a sense of belonging among
employees. They also serve to teach employees
corporate values and create identification with the
organization. For example, at the cosmetics firm
Mary Kay Inc., employees attend award ceremonies Visual Elements of Culture
recognizing their top salespeople with an award of
a new car--traditionally a pink Cadillac. These ceremonies are conducted in large auditoriums where
participants wear elaborate evening gowns and sing company songs that create emotional excitement.
During this ritual, employees feel a connection to the company culture and its values, such as self-
determination, will power, and enthusiasm (Jarnagin & Slocum, 2007). Another example of rituals is the
Saturday morning meetings of Wal-Mart. This ritual was first created by the company founder Sam Walton,
who used these meetings to discuss which products and practices were doing well and which required
adjustment. He was able to use this information to make changes in Wal-Mart's stores before the start of the
week, which gave him a competitive advantage over rival stores who would make their adjustments based on
weekly sales figures during the middle of the following week. Today, hundreds of Wal-Mart associates attend
the Saturday morning meetings in the Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters. The meetings, which run from
7:00 to 9:30 a.m., start and end with the Wal-Mart cheer; the agenda includes a discussion of weekly sales
figures and merchandising tactics. As a ritual, the meetings help maintain a small-company atmosphere,
ensure employee involvement and accountability, communicate a performance orientation, and
demonstrate taking quick action (Schlender, 2005; Wal around the world, 2001).
                    ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE | 147

Rules and Policies

Another way in which an observer may find out about a company's culture is to examine its rules and
policies. Companies create rules to determine acceptable and unacceptable behavior, and thus the rules that
exist in a company will signal the type of values it has. Policies about issues such as decision making, human
resources, and employee privacy reveal what the company values and emphasizes. For example, a company
that has a policy such as "all pricing decisions of merchandise will be made at corporate headquarters"
is likely to have a centralized culture that is hierarchical, as opposed to decentralized and empowering.
Similarly, a company that extends benefits to both part-time and full-time employees, as well as to spouses
and domestic partners, signals to employees and observers that it cares about its employees and shows
concern for their well-being. By offering employees flexible work hours, sabbaticals, and telecommuting
opportunities, a company may communicate its emphasis on work-life balance. The presence or absence
of policies on sensitive issues such as English-only rules, bullying or unfair treatment of others, workplace
surveillance, open-door policies, sexual harassment, workplace romances, and corporate social responsibility
all provide pieces of the puzzle that make up a company's culture.

Physical Layout

A company's building, including the layout of employee offices and other work spaces, communicates
important messages about a company's culture. The building architecture may indicate the core values of
an organization's culture. For example, visitors walking into the Nike Inc. campus in Beaverton, Oregon,
can witness firsthand some of the distinguishing characteristics of the company's culture. The campus is set
on 74 acres and boasts an artificial lake, walking trails, soccer fields, and cutting-edge fitness centers. The
campus functions as a symbol of Nike's values such as energy, physical fitness, an emphasis on quality, and
a competitive orientation. In addition, at fitness centers on the Nike headquarters, only those wearing Nike
shoes and apparel are allowed in. This sends a strong signal that loyalty is expected. The company's devotion
to athletes and their winning spirits is manifested in campus buildings named after famous athletes, photos
of athletes hanging on the walls, and honorary statues dotting the campus (Capowski, 1993; Collins &
Porras, 1996; Labich & Carvell, 1995; Mitchell, 2002). A very different tone awaits visitors to Wal-Mart
headquarters, where managers have gray and windowless offices (Berner, 2007). By putting its managers in
small offices and avoiding outward signs of flashiness, Wal-Mart does a good job of highlighting its values of
economy.

Stories

Perhaps the most colorful and effective way in which organizations communicate their culture to new
employees and organizational members is through the skillful use of stories. A story can highlight a critical
event an organization faced and the collective response to it, or can emphasize a heroic effort of a single
employee illustrating the company's values. The stories usually engage employee emotions and generate
employee identification with the company or the heroes of the tale. A compelling story may be a key
mechanism through which managers motivate employees by giving their behavior direction and energizing
them toward a certain goal (Beslin, 2007). Moreover, stories shared with new employees communicate the
company's history, its values and priorities, and serve the purpose of creating a bond between the new
employee and the organization.

   For example, you may already be familiar with the story of how a scientist at 3M invented Post-it notes.
Arthur Fry, a 3M scientist, was using slips of paper to mark the pages of hymns in his church choir, but
148 | ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

they kept falling off. He remembered a super-weak adhesive that had been invented in 3M's labs, and he
coated the markers with this adhesive. Thus, the Post-it notes were born. However, marketing surveys for
the interest in such a product were weak, and the distributors were not convinced that it had a market.
Instead of giving up, Fry distributed samples of the small yellow sticky notes to secretaries throughout his
company. Once they tried them, people loved them and asked for more. Word spread, and this led to the
ultimate success of the product. As you can see, this story does a great job of describing the core values of a
3M employee: Being innovative by finding unexpected uses for objects, persevering, and being proactive in
the face of negative feedback (Higgins & McAllester, 2002).

     Exploration Activity

    As a Job Candidate, How Would You Find Out If You Are a Good Fit?

        · Do your research. Talking to friends and family members who are familiar with the
             company, doing an online search for news articles about the company, browsing the
             company's Web site, and reading their mission statement would be a good start.

        · Observe the physical environment. Do people work in cubicles or in offices? What is the
             dress code? What is the building structure? Do employees look happy, tired, or stressed?
             The answers to these questions are all pieces of the puzzle.

        · Read between the lines. For example, the absence of a lengthy employee handbook or
             detailed procedures might mean that the company is more flexible and less bureaucratic.

        · How are you treated? The recruitment process is your first connection to the company.
             Were you treated with respect? Do they maintain contact with you, or are you being
             ignored for long stretches at a time?

        · Ask questions. What happened to the previous incumbent of this job? What does it take
             to be successful in this firm? What would their ideal candidate for the job look like? The
             answers to these questions will reveal a lot about the way they do business.

        · Listen to your gut. Your feelings about the place in general, and your future manager and
             coworkers in particular, are important signs that you should not ignore.

Creating Culture Change

How Do Cultures Change?

Culture is the DNA of a company and team, and is resistant to change efforts. Unfortunately, many
organizations may not even realize that their current culture constitutes a barrier against organizational
                                             ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE | 149

productivity and performance. Changing company culture may be the key to the company turnaround
when there is a mismatch between an organization's values and the demands of its environment.

   Certain conditions may help with culture change. For example, if an organization is experiencing
failure in the short run or is under threat of bankruptcy or an imminent loss of market share, it would
be easier to convince managers and employees that culture change is necessary. A company can use such
downturns to generate employee commitment to the change effort. However, if the organization has been
successful in the past, and if employees do not perceive an urgency necessitating culture change, the change
effort will be more challenging. Sometimes the external environment may force an organization to undergo
culture change.

   Mergers and acquisitions are another example of an event that changes a company's culture. In fact, the
ability of the two merging companies to harmonize their corporate cultures is often what makes or breaks
a merger effort. When Ben & Jerry's was acquired by Unilever, Ben & Jerry's had to change parts of its
culture while attempting to retain some of its unique aspects. Corporate social responsibility, creativity, and
fun remained as parts of the culture. In fact, when Unilever appointed a veteran French executive as the
CEO of Ben & Jerry's in 2000, he was greeted by an Eiffel tower made out of ice cream pints, Edith Piaf
songs, and employees wearing berets and dark glasses. At the same time, the company had to become more
performance oriented in response to the acquisition. All employees had to keep an eye on the bottom line.
For this purpose, they took an accounting and finance course for which they had to operate a lemonade
stand (Kiger, 2005). Achieving culture change is challenging, and many companies ultimately fail in this
mission.

   Research and case studies of companies that successfully changed their culture indicate that the following
six steps increase the chances of success (Schein, 1990). 1) Create a sense of urgency, 2) Change leaders and
other key players, 3) Role model, 4) Train, 5) Change the reward system, and 6) Create new stories and
symbols. Each of these steps involves much work-culture change is a difficult but potentially rewarding
process.

    EXPLORATION ACTIVITY

    Two Performance Appraisal Interviews

     Janet's Performance Evaluation: "Janet, thanks for coming in. As you know, it's that time of
     year again. I've been going over this performance appraisal form and have written in my
     evaluation. I'd like you to look it over and then sign it."
     Janet looked over her ratings, which were nearly all in the "satisfactory" range. Even the
     category of dependability was marked "satisfactory"; yet, it was Janet who came in on three
     different occasions to cover for workers in her group who were absent for one reason or
     another. Janet mentioned this issue to her boss, Ken.
     "Well, Janet, you're right and that's exactly what I expect of my employees. You know this is
     your first year here and you can't expect to reach the top in one jump. But I like your style and if
     you keep it up, who knows how far you'll go."
     Twenty-four minutes after the interview began, Janet left, bewildered and disappointed. She
156 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

     had worked hard during her first year; in fact, she had gone the extra mile on a few occasions,
     and now she was more confused than ever about what was expected of her and what
     constituted good performance. "Maybe it just doesn't pay to work hard."
     Ron's Performance Evaluation: Two weeks before their scheduled interview, Mary asked Ron
     to review his goals and accomplishments for the last six months and to note any major changes
     in his job that had taken place during that period. In the meantime, Mary pulled out the file in
     which she had periodically recorded both positive and negative specific incidents over the last
     six months concerning Ron's performance. She also reviewed the goals they had jointly set at
     the end of the last review and thought carefully about not only the possible goals for the next
     six months but longer-term development needs and goals that might be appropriate for Ron.
     On the day of the interview, both Mary and Ron came well prepared to review the past six
     months as well as to think about and plan for the next performance period and beyond. The
     interview took nearly two hours. After candidly discussing Ron's past performance and the
     extent to which both sides felt he had or had not accomplished the goals for that period, they
     began to focus on what should be accomplished in the future. The discussion caused both sides
     to make changes in their original evaluations and ideas about targets for the future. When it
     was over, Ron left more motivated than before and confident that even though he had areas in
     which he could improve, he had a bright future ahead of him if he continued to be motivated
     and work hard.

Performance Appraisal Systems

Performance appraisals are one of the most important and often one of the most mishandled aspects of
management. Typically, we think of performance appraisals as involving a boss evaluating a subordinate.
However, performance appraisals increasingly involve subordinates appraising bosses through a feedback
process known as 360-degree feedback, where clients, colleagues, and supervisors all appraise the person
being evaluated (Johnson, 2018).

   Whether appraisals are done by subordinates, peers, customers, or superiors, the process itself is vital
to the lifeblood of the organization. Performance appraisal systems provide a means of systematically
evaluating employees across various performance dimensions to ensure that organizations are getting what
they pay for. They provide valuable feedback to employees and managers, and they assist in identifying
promotable people as well as problems. However, such appraisals are meaningless unless they are
accompanied by an effective feedback system that ensures that the employee gets the right messages
concerning performance.

   Reward systems represent a powerful motivational force in organizations, but this is true only when the
system is fair and tied to performance. Because a variety of approaches to appraising performance exists,
managers should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each. In turn, an understanding of reward
systems will help managers select the system best suited to the needs and goals of the organization.

   A key management responsibility has always been to oversee and develop subordinates. In fact, it has
been said that every manager is a human resource manager. Nowhere is this truer than with regard to
evaluating and rewarding subordinates. Managers are consistently involved with employee training and
                                            PERFORMANCE EVALUATION | 157

development, monitoring employee performance, providing job-related feedback, and administering
rewards.

   In this chapter, we examine three interrelated aspects of the performance appraisal and reward process.
As Figure 2 shows, this process moves from evaluating employee performance to providing adequate and
constructive feedback to determining discretionary rewards. Where effort and performance are properly
evaluated and rewarded, we would expect to see more stable and consistent job performance. On the other
hand, where such performance is only evaluated intermittently or where the appraisal and review process is
poorly done, we would generally see less consistent performance. We begin our discussion with a look at the
nature of appraisals. We begin by examining three aspects of performance appraisal systems: (1) the uses of
performance appraisals, (2) problems found in performance appraisals, and (3) methods for reducing errors
in the appraisal system.

Uses of Performance Appraisals

In most work organizations, performance appraisals are used for a variety of reasons. These reasons range
from improving employee productivity to developing the employees themselves. This diversity of uses is
well documented in a study of why companies use performance appraisals. Traditionally, compensation and
performance feedback have been the most prominent reasons organizations use performance appraisals.

   Feedback to employees. Performance appraisals provide feedback to employees about quantity and
quality of job performance. Without this information, employees have little knowledge of how well they are
doing their jobs and how they might improve their work.

   Self-development. Performance appraisals can also serve as an aid to employee self-development.
Individuals learn about their strengths and weaknesses as seen by others and can initiate self-improvement
programs (see discussion on behavioral self-management programs).

   Reward systems. In addition, appraisals may form the bases of organizational reward
systems--particularly merit-based compensation plans.

   Personnel decisions. Performance appraisals serve personnel-related functions as well. In making
personnel decisions, such as those relating to promotions, transfers, and terminations, they can be quite
useful. Employers can make choices on the basis of information about individual talents and shortcomings.
In addition, appraisal systems help management evaluate the effectiveness of its selection and placement
functions. If newly hired employees generally perform poorly, managers should consider whether the right
kind of people are being hired in the first place.

   Training and development. Finally, appraisals can help managers identify areas in which employees
lack critical skills for either immediate or future performance. In these situations, new or revised training
programs can be established to further develop the company's human resources.

   It is apparent that performance appraisal systems serve a variety of functions in organizations. In light
of the importance of these functions, it is imperative that the accuracy and fairness of the appraisal be
paramount considerations in the evaluation of a system. Many performance appraisal systems exist. It is the
manager's job to select the technique or combination of techniques that best serves the particular needs
158 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

(and constraints) of the organization. Before considering these various techniques, let us look at some of the
more prominent problems and sources of error that are common to several of them.

Problems with Performance Appraisals

A number of problems can be identified that pose a threat to the value of appraisal techniques. Most of
these problems deal with the related issues of the validity and reliability of the instruments or techniques
themselves. Validity is the extent to which an instrument actually measures what it intends to measure,
whereas reliability is the extent to which the instrument consistently yields the same results each time it is
used. Ideally, a good performance appraisal system will exhibit high levels of both validity and reliability. If
not, serious questions must be raised concerning the utility (and possibly the legality) of the system.

   It is possible to identify several common sources of error in performance appraisal systems. These
include: (1) central tendency error, (2) strictness or leniency error, (3) halo effect, (4) recency error, and (5)
personal biases.

   Central Tendency Error. It has often been found that supervisors rate most of their employees within a
narrow range. Regardless of how people actually perform, the rater fails to distinguish significant differences
among group members and lumps everyone together in an "average" category. This is called central
tendency error and is shown in Figure 3. In short, the central tendency error is the failure to recognize
either very good or very poor performers.

Figure 3 Examples of Strictness, Central Tendency, and Leniency Errors (Attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)

Strictness or Leniency Error. A related rating problem exists when a supervisor is overly strict or overly
lenient in evaluations (see Figure 3). In college classrooms, we hear of professors who are "tough graders"
or, conversely, "easy A's." Similar situations exist in the workplace, where some supervisors see most
subordinates as not measuring up to their high standards, whereas other supervisors see most subordinates
as deserving of a high rating. As with central tendency error, strictness error and leniency error fail to
distinguish adequately between good and bad performers and instead relegate almost everyone to the same
or related categories.

   Halo Effect. The halo effect exists where a supervisor assigns the same rating to each factor being
evaluated for an individual. For example, an employee rated above average on quantity of performance
may also be rated above average on quality of performance, interpersonal competence, attendance, and
                                            PERFORMANCE EVALUATION | 159

promotion readiness. In other words, the supervisor cannot effectively differentiate between relatively
discrete categories and instead gives a global rating.

   These types of bias are based on our perceptions of others. The halo effect occurs when managers have
an overly positive view of a particular employee. This can impact the objectivity of reviews, with managers
consistently giving an employee high ratings and failing to recognize areas for improvement.

   Whether positive or negative, we also have a natural tendency to confirm our preconceived beliefs about
people in the way we interpret or recall performance, which is known as confirmatory bias.

   For example, a manager may have a preconception that her male report is more assertive. This could cause
her to recall instances more easily in which her report asserted his position during a meeting. On the other
hand, she may perceive her female report to be less assertive, predisposing her to forget when the report
suggested an effective strategy or was successful in a tough negotiation.

   The halo effect is often a consequence of people having a similarity bias for certain types of people.
We naturally tend to favor and trust people who are similar to us. Whether it's people who also have a
penchant for golf or people who remind us of a younger version of ourselves, favoritism that results from
a similarity bias can give certain employees an unfair advantage over others. This can impact a team to the
point that those employees may receive more coaching, better reviews and, as a result, more opportunities
for advancement.

   Recency Error. Oftentimes evaluators focus on an employee's most recent behavior in the evaluation
process. This is known as the recency error. That is, in an annual evaluation, a supervisor may give undue
emphasis to performance during the past months--or even weeks--and ignore performance levels prior
to this. This practice, if known to employees, leads to a situation where employees may "float" for the
initial months of the evaluation period and then overexert themselves in the last few months or weeks prior
to evaluation. This practice leads to uneven performance and contributes to the attitude of "playing the
game."

   Personal Biases. Finally, it is not uncommon to find situations in which supervisors allow their own
personal biases to influence their appraisals. Such biases include like or dislike for someone, as well as racial
and sexual biases. Personal biases can interfere with the fairness and accuracy of an evaluation and are illegal
in many situations.

Reducing Errors in Performance Appraisals

A number of suggestions have been advanced recently to minimize the effects of various biases and errors
on the performance appraisal process.4 When errors are reduced, more accurate information is available for
personnel decisions and personal development. These methods for reducing error include

 · ensuring that each dimension or factor on a performance appraisal form represents a single job
      activity instead of a group of job activities.

 · avoiding terms such as average, because different evaluators define the term differently.
 · ensuring that raters observe subordinates on a regular basis throughout the evaluation period. It is

      even helpful if the rater takes notes for future reference.
 · keeping the number of persons evaluated by one rater to a reasonable number. When one person

      must evaluate many subordinates, it becomes difficult to discriminate. Rating fatigue increases with
      the number of people rated.
 · ensuring that the dimensions used are clearly stated, meaningful, and relevant to good job
      performance.
 · training raters so they can recognize various sources of error and understand the rationale underlying
      the evaluation process.
160 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Using mechanisms like these, better employee ratings that can have greater meaning both for the individual
employee and the organization will result.

   Techniques of Performance Appraisal
   Organizations use numerous methods to evaluate personnel. We will summarize several popular
techniques. Although countless variations on these themes can be found, the basic methods presented
provide a good summary of the commonly available techniques. Following this review, we will consider
the various strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Six techniques are reviewed here: (1) graphic
rating scales, (2) critical incident technique, (3) behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS), (4)
behavioral observation scales, and (5) management by objectives.

Graphic Rating Scales

Certainly, the most popular method of evaluation used in organizations today is the graphic rating scale.
One study found that 57 percent of the organizations surveyed used rating scales, and another study found
the figure to be 65 percent. Although this method appears in many formats, the supervisor or rater is
typically presented with a printed or online form that contains both the employee's name and several
evaluation dimensions (quantity of work, quality of work, knowledge of job, attendance). The rater is then
asked to rate the employee by assigning a number or rating on each of the dimensions. An example of a
graphic rating scale is shown in Table 1.

   By using this method, if we assume that evaluator biases can be minimized, it is possible to compare

employees objectively. It is also possible to examine the relative strengths and weaknesses of a single
employee by comparing scores on the various dimensions.

   However, one of the most serious drawbacks of this technique is its openness to central tendency,
strictness, and leniency errors. It is possible to rate almost everyone in the middle of the scale or, conversely,
at one end of the scale. In order to control for this, some companies have assigned required percentage
distributions to the various scale points. Supervisors may be allowed to rate only 10 percent of their people
outstanding and are required to rate 10 percent unsatisfactory, perhaps assigning 20 percent, 40 percent,
and 20 percent to the remaining middle categories. By doing this, a distribution is forced within each
department. However, this procedure may penalize a group of truly outstanding performers or reward a
group of poor ones.
162 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Critical Incident Technique

With the critical incident technique of performance appraisal, supervisors record incidents, or examples,
of each subordinate's behavior that led to either unusual success or unusual failure on some aspect of
the job. These incidents are recorded in a daily or weekly log under predesignated categories (planning,
decision-making, interpersonal relations, report writing). The final performance rating consists of a series
of descriptive paragraphs or notes about various aspects of an employee's performance (see Table 2).

   The critical incident method provides useful information for appraisal interviews, and managers and

subordinates can discuss specific incidents. Good qualitative information is generated. However, because
little quantitative data emerge, it is difficult to use this technique for promotion or salary decisions. The
164 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

qualitative output here has led some companies to combine the critical incident technique with one of the
quantitative techniques, such as the rating scale, to provide different kinds of feedback to the employees.

Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales

An appraisal system that has received increasing attention in recent years is the behaviorally anchored
rating scale (BARS). This system requires considerable work prior to evaluation but, if the work is
carefully done, can lead to highly accurate ratings with high inter-rater reliability. Specifically, the BARS
technique begins by selecting a job that can be described in observable behaviors. Managers and personnel
specialists then identify these behaviors as they relate to superior or inferior performance.

   An example of this is shown in Figure 4, where the BARS technique has been applied to the job
of college professor. As shown, as one moves from extremely poor performance to extremely good
performance, the performance descriptions, or behavioral anchors, increase. Oftentimes, six to ten scales
are used to describe performance on the job. Figure 4 evaluates the professor's organizational skills. Other
scales could relate to the professor's teaching effectiveness, knowledge of the material, availability to
students, and fairness in grading. Once these scales are determined, the evaluator has only to check the
category that describes what she observes on the job, and the employee's rating is simultaneously
determined. The BARS technique has several purported advantages. In particular, many of the sources of
error discussed earlier (central tendency, leniency, halo) should be significantly reduced because raters are
considering verbal descriptions of specific behaviors instead of general categories of behaviors, such as those
used in graphic rating scales. In addition, the technique focuses on job-related behaviors and ignores less
relevant issues such as the subordinate's personality, race, or gender. This technique should also lead to
employees being less defensive during performance appraisals, because the focus of the discussion would be
actual measured behaviors, not the person. Finally, BARS can aid in employee training and development by
identifying those domains needing most attention.

On the negative side, as noted above, considerable time and effort in designing the forms are required before
the actual rating. Because a separate BARS is required for each distinct job, it is only cost-efficient for
common jobs. Finally, because the technique relies on observable behaviors, it may have little applicability
for such jobs in such areas as research science (and sometimes management), where much of the work is
mental and relevant observable behaviors are difficult to obtain.

Behavioral Observation Scales

The behavioral observation scale (BOS) is similar to BARS in that both focus on identifying observable
behaviors as they relate to performance. It is, however, less demanding of the evaluator. Typically, the
evaluator is asked to rate each behavior on a scale from 1 to 5 to indicate the frequency with which the
employee exhibits the behavior. Evaluation of an employee's performance on a particular dimension is
derived by summing the frequency ratings for the behaviors in each dimension.

   For example, in Table 3 we can see an example of a form to evaluate a manager's ability to overcome
resistance to change. The rater simply has to circle the appropriate numbers describing observed behaviors
and get a summary rating by adding the results. The BOS technique is easier to construct than the BARS
and makes the evaluator's job somewhat simpler. Even so, this is a relatively new technique that is only now
receiving some support in industry.

Management by Objectives

A popular technique for evaluating employees who are involved in jobs that have clear quantitative output
is management by objectives (MBO). Although the concept of MBO encompasses much more than just
the appraisal process (incorporating an organization-wide motivation, performance, and control system),
we will focus here on its narrower application to evaluating employee performance. MBO is closely related
to the goal-setting theory of motivation.

   Under MBO, individual employees work with their supervisor to establish goals and objectives for which
they will be responsible during the coming year. These goals are stated in clear language and relate to tasks
166 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

that are within the domain of the employee. An example of these goals for a sales representative is shown
in Table 4. Following a specified period of time, the employee's performance is compared to the preset goals
to determine the extent to which the goals have been met or exceeded.

2. Number of new customers contacted 10         10           100%

3. Number of customer complaints  5             10           50%

4. Sales of product #1            10,000 units 11,000 units  110%

5. Sales of product #2            15,000 units 14,000 units  93%

6. Sales of product #3            25,000 units 30,000 units  120%

Table 4 (Attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)
   Several advantages of MBO have been observed. These include the ability to do better planning;

improved motivation, because of knowledge of results; fairer evaluations, done on the basis of results rather
than personality; improved commitment through participation; and improved supervisory skills in such
areas as listening, counseling, and evaluating. On the negative side, however, MBO has been criticized
because it emphasizes quantitative goals at the expense of qualitative goals and often creates too much
paperwork. It is difficult to compare performance levels among employees because most are responsible for
different goals. Sometimes the implementation of MBO goals are autocratic and therefore ineffective or
even counterproductive. As discussed in the study of motivation, goals must be accepted to be effective.
Finally, in order to be successful, MBO implementation must have constant attention and support from
top management; MBO does not run itself. In the absence of this support, the technique loses legitimacy
and often falls into disrepair.

ETHICS IN PRACTICE

Tesla's Performance Review

At Tesla, the automotive giant, the standards are set extremely high for their employees. In
2017, Tesla conducted its annual performance reviews as it does each year. Due to the review
process, the company sees both voluntary and involuntary departures. During the review
process, the managers discuss "results that were achieved, as well as how those results were
achieved" with their employees. Tesla also has a performance recognition and compensation
program that includes equity rewards as well as promotions in some cases, along with the
constructive feedback.

The departure of employees during the review period is not unique to Tesla; however, in 2017
there was a large exodus of approximately 700 employees following their employee reviews.
                                        PERFORMANCE EVALUATION | 167

Elon Musk, who recently has stepped down from the role of chairman and has been under
scrutiny for his behavior, saw the media coverage of this news as "ridiculous."
"You have two boxes of equal ability, and one's much smaller, the big guy's going to crush the
little guy, obviously," states Musk. "So, the little guy better have a heck of a lot more skill or he's
going to get clobbered. So that is why our standards are high . . . if they're not high, we will die."
Overall, approximately 17 percent of their employees were promoted, almost half in
manufacturing. As Tesla continues to grow and develop new vehicles, it is consistently pushing
the boundaries and pushing its employees to new limits. Performance reviews are of the highest
importance for Tesla's business to succeed; the company needs the best people with the best
skills. It is constantly growing and attempting to "suck the labor pool dry" to fill positions at
many of its locations and factories.

Comparison of Appraisal Techniques

It is important to consider which appraisal technique or set of techniques may be most appropriate for a
given situation. Although there is no simple answer to this question, we can consider the various strengths
and weaknesses of each technique. This is done in Table 6. It is important to keep in mind that the
appropriateness of a particular appraisal technique is in part a function of the purpose for the appraisal. For
example, if the purpose of the appraisal is to identify high potential executives, then assessment centers are
more appropriate than rating scales.

   As would be expected, the easiest and least expensive techniques are also the least accurate. They are

also the least useful for purposes of personnel decisions and employee development. Once again, it appears
that managers and organizations get what they pay for. If performance appraisals represent an important
aspect of organizational life, clearly the more sophisticated--and more time-consuming--techniques are
168 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

preferable. If, on the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate employees quickly and with few resources,
techniques such as the graphic rating scale may be more appropriate. Managers must make cost-benefit
decisions about the price (in time and money) they are willing to pay for a quality performance appraisal
system.

Feedback

As previously noted, feedback represents a critical variable in determining the success or failure of the goal-
setting process. The same applies to the performance appraisal process. Without effective knowledge of
results, the motivational impact of the appraisal process is lost. To better understand how feedback in work
settings affects employee behavior, consider the model shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Effects of Feedback on Job Performance (Attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)

Feedback comes from many sources, including the task at hand, the supervisor, coworkers, and oneself. This
input is then cognitively evaluated by the employee, who considers such factors as the perceived accuracy of
the feedback (e.g., does the employee consider the information to be correct?); the credibility of the
source of the feedback (e.g., does the employee trust the supervisor's opinion?); the employee's opinion
concerning the fairness of the evaluation-process; the extent to which the feedback met the
employee's expectations (e.g., does the employee think she could have done better?); and
the reasonableness of the performance standards.

   If one or more of these evaluations prove negative (for example, the employee believes she is being
unfairly evaluated), the credibility of the feedback is dismissed, and the employee may increase her resistance
to task effort. On the other hand, where the feedback is accepted, it reinforces the employee's direction,
effort on the task, and persistence on the task. Thus, although feedback is essential, it is the nature and
quality of the feedback that ultimately determines employee response.

Reward Systems in Organizations

After a company has designed and implemented a systematic performance appraisal system and provided
adequate feedback to employees, the next step is to consider how to tie available corporate rewards to the
outcomes of the appraisal. Behavioral research consistently demonstrates that performance levels are highest
when rewards are contingent upon performance. Thus, in this section, we will examine five aspects of
                                            PERFORMANCE EVALUATION | 169

reward systems in organizations: (1) functions served by reward systems, (2) bases for reward distribution,
(3) intrinsic versus extrinsic rewards, (4) the relationship between money and motivation and, finally, (5)
pay secrecy.

Functions of Reward Systems

Reward systems in organizations are used for a variety of reasons. It is generally agreed that reward systems
influence the following:

 · Job effort and performance. Following expectancy theory, employees' effort and performance
      would be expected to increase when they felt that rewards were contingent upon good performance.
      Hence, reward systems serve a very basic motivational function.

 · Attendance and retention. Reward systems have also been shown to influence an employee's
      decision to come to work or to remain with the organization. This was discussed in the previous
      chapter.

 · Employee commitment to the organization. It has been found that reward systems in no small
      way influence employee commitment to the organization, primarily through the exchange process.
      That is, employees develop ties with organizations when they perceive that the organization is
      interested in their welfare and willing to protect their interests. This exchange process is shown in
      Figure 6 To the extent that employee needs and goals are met by the company, we would expect
      commitment to increase.

 · Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction has also been shown to be related to rewards, as discussed in the
      previous chapter. Edward E. Lawler, a well-known researcher on employee compensation, has
      identified four conclusions concerning the relationship between rewards and satisfaction: (1)
      satisfaction with a reward is a function of both how much is received and how much the individual
      feels should have been received; (2) satisfaction is influenced by comparisons with what happens to
      others, especially one's coworkers; (3) people differ with respect to the rewards they value; and (4)
      some rewards are satisfying because they lead to other rewards.

 · Occupational and organizational choice. Finally, the selection of an occupation by an individual,
      as well as the decision to join a particular organization within that occupation, are influenced by the
      rewards that are thought to be available in the occupation or organization. To prove this, simply look
      at the classified section of your local newspaper and notice how many jobs highlight beginning
      salaries.
170 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

University, OpenStax, under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)

Reward systems in organizations have far-reaching consequences for both individual satisfaction and
organizational effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are many instances where reward systems have been
distorted to punish good performance or inhibit creativity. Consider, for example, the Greyhound Bus
Company driver who was suspended for 10 days without pay for breaking a company rule against using
a CB radio on his bus. The bus driver had used the radio to alert police that his bus, with 32 passengers
on board, was being hijacked by an armed man. The police arrested the hijacker, and the bus driver was
suspended for breaking company rules. Such incidents hardly encourage employees to focus their efforts on
responsible performance.

Bases for Reward Distribution

A common reality in many contemporary work organizations is the inequity that exists in the distribution
of available rewards. One often sees little correlation between those who perform well and those who receive
the greatest rewards. At the extreme, it is hard to understand how a company could pay its president $10 to
$20 million per year (as many large corporations do) while it pays its secretaries and clerks less than $20,000.
Each works approximately 40 hours per week, and both are important for organizational performance. Is it
really possible that the president is 1,000 times more important than the secretary, as the salary differential
suggests?

   How do organizations decide on the distribution of available rewards? These are questions of justice in
organizations. Justice or fairness refers refers to the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which
may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the
justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts. There are three basic forms
of organizational justice: distributive, procedural, and interactional. Distributive justice is conceptualized
as the fairness associated with decision outcomes and distribution of resources. The outcomes or resources
distributed may be tangible (e.g., pay) or intangible (e.g., praise). Perceptions of distributive justice can be
                                             PERFORMANCE EVALUATION | 171

fostered when outcomes are perceived to be equally applied. Distributive justice may involve one or more of
three different rationales for how resources are distributed: equity, equality and need. Equity focuses more
on rewarding employees based on their contribution, and thus can be can be viewed as capitalist justice:
the ratio of one's inputs to one's outcomes. Equality on the other hand provides each employee with the
same compensation. Finally, need is providing a benefit based on one's personal requirement. Procedural
justiceis defined as the fairness of the processes that lead to outcomes. When individuals feel that they have
a voice in the process or that the process involves characteristics such as consistency, accuracy, ethicality, and
lack of bias then procedural justice is enhanced. Procedural justice is the appropriateness of the allocation
process. It includes six main points which are consistency, lack of bias, accuracy, representation of all
concerned, correction and ethics. Procedural justice seems to be essential to maintaining institutional
legitimacy. What is more interesting is that procedural justice affects what workers believe about the
organization as a whole. Interactional justice refers to the treatment that an individual receives as decisions
are made and can be promoted by providing explanations for decisions and delivering the news with
sensitivity and respect. Interactional justice focuses on who gets attention and when. It includes
interpersonal relationships and access to information. All three forms of justice are perceptual, that is they
are tied to what people think and feel is happening around them. Thus, justice is one important tool leaders
have to motivate the members of their groups.

Extrinsic and Intrinsic Rewards

The variety of rewards that employees can receive in exchange for their contributions of time and effort can
be classified as either extrinsic or intrinsic rewards. Extrinsic rewards are external to the work itself. They
are administered externally--that is, by someone else (usually management). Examples of extrinsic rewards
include wages and salary, fringe benefits, promotions, and recognition and praise from others.

   On the other hand,intrinsic rewards represent those rewards that are related directly to performing the
job. In this sense, they are often described as "self-administered" rewards, because engaging in the task itself
leads to their receipt. Examples of intrinsic rewards include feelings of task accomplishment, autonomy, and
personal growth and development that come from the job.

   In the literature on employee motivation, there is considerable controversy concerning the possible
interrelationship of these two kinds of reward. It has been argued (with some research support) that
extrinsic rewards tend to drive out the positive effects of some intrinsic rewards and can lead to unethical
behavior. Consider, for example, the child next door who begs you to let her help you wash your car. For
a young child, this task can carry considerable excitement (and intrinsic motivation). Now, consider what
happens on a Saturday afternoon when you need your car washed but the child has other options. What do
you do? You offer to pay her this time to help wash your car. What do you think will happen the next time
you ask the neighbor to help you wash the car for free? In other words, when extrinsic rewards such as pay
are tied closely to performance (called performance-reward contingency), intrinsic motivation--the desire
to do a task because you enjoy it--can decrease.

   Also, it is important to keep in mind that because extrinsic rewards are administered by sources external
to the individual, their effectiveness rests on accurate and fair monitoring, evaluating, and administration.
Implementation can be expensive, and the timing of performance and rewards may not always be close.
For example, you may perform well on a task, but unless there is a way for that to be noticed, evaluated,
recorded, and rewarded within a reasonable time frame, an extrinsic reward may not have a significant
impact. Intrinsic rewards are a function of self-monitoring, evaluation, and administration; consequently,
these rewards often are less costly and more effectively administered. For example, even if no one else notices
or rewards you for superior performance on a task, you can still reward yourself with a mental pat on the
172 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

back for a job well done or a sense of satisfaction for overcoming a challenge. The implications of this
finding will become apparent when exploring efforts to enrich employees' jobs.

Money and Motivation: A Closer Look

A recurring debate among managers focuses on the issue of whether money is a primary motivator. Some
argue that most behavior in organizational settings is motivated by money (or at least monetary factors),
whereas others argue that money is only one of many factors that motivate performance. Whichever group
is correct, we must recognize that money can have important motivational consequences for many people in
many situations. In fact, money serves several important functions in work settings. These include serving as
(1) a goal or incentive, (2) a source of satisfaction, (3) an instrument for gaining other desired outcomes, (4)
a standard of comparison for determining relative standing or worth, and (5) a conditional reinforcer where
its receipt is contingent upon a certain level of performance. Even so, experience tells us that the effectiveness
of pay as a motivator varies considerably. Sometimes there seems to be an almost direct relationship between
pay and effort, whereas at other times no such relationship is found. Why? Lawler suggests that certain
conditions must be present in order for pay to act as a strong motivator:

 · Trust levels between managers and subordinates must be high.
 · Individual performance must be able to be accurately measured.
 · Pay rewards to high performers must be substantially higher than those to poor performers.
 · Few, if any, negative consequences for good performance must be perceived.

Under these conditions, a climate or culture is created in which employees have reason to believe that
significant performance-reward contingencies truly exist. Given this perception (and assuming the reward
is valued), we would expect performance to be increased.

Individual and Group Incentive Plans

We now turn to an examination of various employee incentive programs used by organizations. First,
we consider the relative merits of individuals versus group incentive programs. Next, we focus on several
relatively new approaches to motivation and compensation. Finally, we suggest several guidelines for
effective incentive systems.

Individual versus Group Incentives

Companies usually have choices among various compensation plans and must make decisions about which
is most effective for its situation. Incentive systems in organizations are usually divided into two categories
on the basis of whether the unit of analysis--and the recipient of the reward--is the individual or a
group. Among individual incentive plans, several approaches can be identified, including merit-based
compensation (commonly known as merit compensation), piece-rate incentive programs (where people are
paid according to the quantity of output), bonus systems of various sorts, and commissions. In each case,
rewards are tied fairly directly to the performance level of the individual.

   Although individual incentive systems often lead to improved performance, some reservations have been
noted. In particular, these programs may at times lead to employees competing with one another, with
undesirable results. For instance, department store salespeople on commission may fight over customers,
thereby chasing the customers away. After all, customers don't care who they deal with, only that the service
is good. Second, these plans typically are resisted by unions, which prefer compensation to be based on
                                             PERFORMANCE EVALUATION | 173

 seniority or job classification. Third, where quality control systems are lax, individual incentives such as
 piece rates may lead employees to maximize units of output while sacrificing quality. And, finally, in order
 for these programs to be successful, an atmosphere of trust and cooperation is necessary.

    In order to overcome some of these shortcomings, many companies have turned to group or
 organizational incentive plans. Group incentive programs base at least some of an employee's rewards on
 group or organization performance. Hence, employees are encouraged to cooperate with one another and
 with the corporation so that all employees can benefit. Programs such as profit-sharing or gain-sharing plans
 (discussed below) are designed to tie the employees' future rewards and prosperity to that of the company
 and reduce the age-old antagonism between the two. The results are often dramatic.

GROUP & TEAM THEORY

This section overviews the important theories that guide group and team interaction.
15.

POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS

     Learning Objectives

        · Explain different conceptualizations of power
        · Describe the relationship between power and oppression
        · Discuss behaviors associated with high status in a group
        · Differentiate between the common power bases in groups
        · Discuss what it means to exercise power ethically

Given the complexity of group interaction, it's short-sighted to try to understand group communication
without looking at notions of power. Power influences how we interpret the messages of others and
determines the extent to which we feel we have the right to speak up and voice our concerns and opinions to
others. Power and status are key ways that people exercise influence within groups. In the storming phase of
group development, members are likely to engage in more obvious power struggles, but power is constantly
at work in our interactions within and outside our group whether we are fully conscious of it or not. In
this chapter, we will define power and discuss its relationship to systems of privilege and oppression and
to status within groups. We will also discuss the bases and tactics of power that can operate in groups and
teams, as well as the ethical use of power.

Defining Power

Take a moment to reflect on the different ways you think about power. What images come to mind for you
when you think of power? Are there different kinds of power? Are some people inherently more powerful
than others? Do you consider yourself to be a powerful person? We highlight three ways to understand
power as it relates to group and team communication. The word "power" literally means "to be able" and
has many implications.

   If you associate power with control or dominance, this refers to the notion of power as power-over.
According to Starhawk (1987), "power-over enables one individual or group to make the decisions that affect
others, and to enforce control" (p. 9). Control can and does take many forms in society. Starhawk explains
that,

                This power is wielded from the workplace, in the schools, in the courts, in the doctor's office. It
            may rule with weapons that are physical or by controlling the resources we need to live: money,
            food, medical care; or by controlling more subtle resources: information, approval, love. We are so
            accustomed to power-over, so steeped in its language and its implicit threats, that we often become
            aware of its functioning only when we see its extreme manifestations. (p. 9)
178 | POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS

   When we are in group situations and someone dominates the conversation, makes all of the decisions, or
controls the resources of the group such as money or equipment, this is power-over.

   Power-from-within refers to a more personal sense of strength or agency. Power-from-within manifests
itself when we can stand, walk, and speak "words that convey our needs and thoughts" (Starhawk, 1987, p.
10). In groups, this type of power "arises from our sense of connection, our bonding with other human
beings, and with the environment" (10). As Heider explains in The Tao of Leadership, "Since all creation is
a whole, separateness is an illusion. Like it or not, we are team players. Power comes through cooperation,
independence through service, and a greater self through selflessness" (77). If you think about your role in
groups, how have you influenced other group members? Your strategies indicate your sense of power-from-
within.

   Finally, groups manifest power-with, which is "the power of a strong individual in a group of equals, the
power not to command, but to suggest and be listened to, to begin something and see it happen" (Starhawk,
1987, p. 10). For this to be effective in a group or team, at least two qualities must be present among
members: (1) all group members must communicate respect and equality for one another, and (2) the leader
must not abuse power-with and attempt to turn it into power-over. Have you ever been involved in a group
where people did not treat each others as equals or with respect? How did you feel about the group? What
was the outcome? Could you have done anything to change that dynamic?

UNDERSTANDING POWER AND OPPRESSION

Power and oppression can be said to be mirror reflections of one another in a sense or two sides of the
same coin. Where you see power that causes harm, you will likely see oppression. Oppression is defined in
Merriam-Webster dictionary as: "Unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power especially by the imposition
of burdens; the condition of being weighed down; an act of pressing down; a sense of heaviness or
obstruction in the body or mind." This definition demonstrates the intensity of oppression, which also
shows how difficult such a challenge is to address or eradicate. Further, the word oppression comes from the
Latin root primere, which actually means "pressed down". Importantly, we can conclude that oppression is
the social act of placing severe restrictions on an individual, group, or institution.
                                        POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS | 179

   Oppression emerges as a result of power, with its roots in global colonialism and conquests. For example,
oppression as an action can deny certain groups jobs that pay living wages, can establish unequal education
(e.g., through a lack of adequate capital per student for resources), can deny affordable housing, and the list
goes on. You may be wondering why some groups live in poverty, reside in substandard housing, or simply
do not measure up to the dominant society in some facet. As discussed at a seminar at the Leaven Center
(2003), groups that do not have "power over" are those society classifies or labels as disenfranchised; they
are exploited and victimized in a variety of ways by agents of oppression and/or systems and institutions.
They are subjected to restrictions and seen as expendable and replaceable--particularly by agents of
oppression. This philosophy, in turn, minimizes the roles certain populations play in society. Sadly, agents
of oppression often deny that this injustice occurs and blames oppressive conditions on the behaviors and
actions of the oppressed group.

   Oppression subsequently becomes a system and patterns are adopted and perpetuated. Systems of
privilege and oppression discriminate or advantage based on perceived or real differences among people.
Privilege here refers to the benefits, advantages, and power that are gained based on perceived status or
membership in a dominant group. For example, Thai and Lien (2019) discuss diversity and highlight the
impact of white privilege as a major contributor to systems and patterns of oppression for non-privileged
individuals and groups.

   Additionally, socialization patterns help maintain systems of privilege and oppression. Members of
society learn through formal and informal educational environments that advance the ideologies of the
dominant group, and how they should act and what their role and place are in society. Power is thus
exercised in this instance but now is both psychologically and physically harmful. This process of
constructing knowledge is helpful to those who seek to control and oppress, through power, because
physical coercion may not last, but psychological ramifications can be perpetual, particularly without
intervention. As shared knowledge is sustained through social processes, and what we come to know and
believe is socially constructed, so it becomes ever more important to discuss dominant narratives of our
society and the meaning they lend to our culture, including as it relates to our interactions in groups and
teams.

   So what do systems of privilege and oppression mean for groups? Members in groups do not leave their
identities or social and cultural contexts at the door. Power and status in groups are still shaped by these
broader systems of privilege and oppression that are external to the group. This requires group members to
reflect on how these broader systems are shaping dynamics within the group and their own perceptions and
behaviors.

Relationship Between Power and Status

In a group, members with higher status are apt to command greater respect and possess more prestige and
power than those with lower status. Status can be defined as a person's perceived level of importance or
significance within a particular context.

   Our status is often tied to our identities and their perceived value within our social and cultural context.
Groups may confer status upon their members on the basis of their age, wealth, gender, race or ethnicity,
ability, physical stature, perceived intelligence, and/or other attributes. Status can also be granted through
title or position. In professional circles, for instance, having earned a "terminal" degree such as a Ph.D. or
M.D. usually generates a degree of status. The same holds true for the documented outcomes of schooling
or training in legal, engineering, or other professional fields. Likewise, people who've been honored for
achievements in any number of areas may bring status to a group by virtue of that recognition if it relates to
the nature and purpose of the group. Once a group has formed and begun to sort out its norms, it will also
build upon the initial status that people bring to it by further allocating status according to its own internal
 180 | POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS

 processes and practices. For instance, choosing a member to serve as an officer in a group generally conveys
 status to that person.

     Let's say you've either come into a group with high status or have been granted high status by the other
 members. What does this mean to you, and how are you apt to behave? Here are some predictions based
 on research from several sources (Beebe & Masterson, 2015; Borman, 1989; Brilhart & Galanes, 1997;
 Homans, 1992).

    12First, the volume and direction of your speech will differ from those of others in the group. You'll talk
 more than the low-status members do, and you'll communicate more with other high-status members than
 you will with lower-status individuals. In addition, you'll be more likely to speak to the whole group than
 will members with lower status.

     Second, some indicators of your participation will be particularly positive. Your activity level and self-
 regard will surpass those of lower-status group members. So will your level of satisfaction with your
 position. Furthermore, the rest of the group is less likely to ignore your statements and proposals than it is
 to disregard what lower-status individuals say.

     Finally, the content of your communication will probably be different from what your fellow members
 discuss. Because you may have access to special information about the group's activities and may be
 expected to shoulder specific responsibilities because of your position, you're apt to talk about topics which
 are relevant to the central purposes and direction of the group. Lower-status members, on the other hand,
 are likely to communicate more about other matters.

  Those with higher status may communicate differently than those with lower status in group contexts
  like meetings. (Credit: United States Mission Geneva/flickr/CC BY 2.0).

 There's no such thing as a "status neutral" group--one in which everyone always has the same status as
 everyone else. Differences in status within a group are inevitable and can be dangerous if not recognized
 and managed. For example, someone who gains status without possessing the skills or attributes required
 to use it well may cause real damage to other members of a group, or to a group as a whole. A high-status,
 low-ability person may develop an inflated self-image, begin to abuse power, or both. One of us worked for
 the new president of a college who acted as though his position entitled him to take whatever actions he
 wanted. In the process of interacting primarily with other high-status individuals who shared the majority
 of his viewpoints and goals, he overlooked or rejected concerns and complaints from people in other parts of

1.

                                        POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS | 181

the organization. Turmoil and dissension broke out. Morale plummeted. The president eventually suffered
votes of no confidence from his college's faculty, staff, and students and was forced to resign.

Bases of Power in Groups

Within groups, there are a number of different ways in which power can operate. French and Raven (1968)
identified five primary ways in which power can be exerted in social situations, including in groups and
teams. These are considered to be different bases of power.

Referent Power

In some cases, person B looks up to or admires person A, and, as a result, B follows A largely because of A's
personal qualities, characteristics, or reputation. In this case, A can use referent power to influence B.
Referent power has also been called charismatic power, because allegiance is based on interpersonal
attraction of one individual for another. Examples of referent power can be seen in advertising, where
companies use celebrities to recommend their products; it is hoped that the star appeal of the person will
rub off on the products. In work environments, junior managers often emulate senior managers and assume
unnecessarily subservient roles more because of personal admiration than because of respect for authority.

Expert Power

Expert power is demonstrated when person A gains power because A has knowledge or expertise relevant
to B. For instance, professors presumably have power in the classroom because of their mastery of a
particular subject matter. Other examples of expert power can be seen in staff specialists in organizations
(e.g., accountants, labor relations managers, management consultants, and corporate attorneys). In each
case, the individual has credibility in a particular--and narrow--area as a result of experience and expertise,
and this gives the individual power in that domain.

Legitimate Power

Legitimate power exists when person B submits to person A because B feels that A has a right to exert
power in a certain domain (Tjosvold, 1985). Legitimate power is really another name for authority. A
supervisor has a right, for instance, to assign work. Legitimate power differs from reward and coercive power
in that it depends on the official position a person holds, and not on his or her relationship with others.

Reward Power

Reward power exists when person A has power over person B because A controls rewards that B wants.
These rewards can cover a wide array of possibilities, including pay raises, promotions, desirable job
assignments, more responsibility, new equipment, and so forth. Research has indicated that reward power
often leads to increased job performance as employees see a strong performance-reward contingency (Shetty,
1978). However, in many organizations, supervisors and managers really do not control very many rewards.
For example, salary and promotion among most blue-collar workers is based on a labor contract, not a
performance appraisal.
182 | POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS

Coercive Power

Coercive power is based primarily on fear. Here, person A has power over person B because A can
administer some form of punishment to B. Thus, this kind of power is also referred to as punishment
power. As Kipnis (1976) points out, coercive power does not have to rest on the threat of violence.
"Individuals exercise coercive power through a reliance upon physical strength, verbal facility, or the ability
to grant or withhold emotional support from others. These bases provide the individual with the means
to physically harm, bully, humiliate, or deny love to others." Examples of coercive power in organizations
include the ability (actual or implied) to fire or demote people, transfer them to undesirable jobs or
locations, or strip them of valued perquisites. Indeed, it has been suggested that a good deal of
organizational behavior (such as prompt attendance, looking busy, avoiding whistle-blowing) can be
attributed to coercive, not reward, power. As Kipnis (1976) explains, "Of all the bases of power available to
man, the power to hurt others is possibly the most often used, most often condemned and most difficult to
control."

Consequences of Power

We have seen, then, that at least five bases of power can be identified. In each case, the power of the
individual rests on a particular attribute of the power holder, the follower, or their relationship. In some
cases (e.g., reward power), power rests in the superior; in others (e.g., referent power), power is given to the
superior by the subordinate. In all cases, the exercise of power involves subtle and sometimes threatening
interpersonal consequences for the parties involved. In fact, when power is exercised, individuals have several
ways in which to respond. These are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 (Credit: Rice University Openstax/Employee Reactions to Bases of Power/CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

If the subordinate accepts and identifies with the leader, their behavioral response will probably be one of
commitment. That is, the subordinate will be motivated to follow the wishes of the leader. This is most
likely to happen when the person in charge uses referent or expert power. Under these circumstances, the
follower believes in the leader's cause and will exert considerable energies to help the leader succeed.

   A second possible response is compliance. This occurs most frequently when the subordinate feels the
                                        POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS | 183

leader has either legitimate power or reward power. Under such circumstances, the follower will comply,
either because it is perceived as a duty or because a reward is expected; but commitment or enthusiasm
for the project is lacking. Finally, under conditions of coercive power, subordinates will more than likely
use resistance. Here, the subordinate sees little reason--either altruistic or material--for cooperating and
will often engage in a series of tactics to defeat the leader's efforts.

Power Dependencies

In any situation involving power, at least two persons (or groups) can be identified: (1) the person
attempting to influence others and (2) the target or targets of that influence. Until recently, attention
focused almost exclusively on how people tried to influence others. More recently attention been given to
how people try to nullify or moderate such influence attempts. In particular, we now recognize that the
extent to which influence attempts are successful is determined in large part by the power dependencies
of those on the receiving end of the influence attempts. In other words, all people are not subject to (or
dependent upon) the same bases of power. What causes some people to be vulnerable to power attempts?
At least three factors have been identified (Mitchell & Larson, 1988).

Subordinate's Values

To begin, person B's values can influence his susceptibility to influence. For example, if the outcomes
that A can influence are important to B, then B is more likely to be open to influence than if the outcomes
were unimportant. Hence, if an employee places a high value on money and believes the supervisor actually
controls pay raises, we would expect the employee to be highly susceptible to the supervisor's influence. We
hear comments about how young people don't really want to work hard anymore. Perhaps a reason for this
phenomenon is that some young people don't place a high value on those things (for example, money) that
traditionally have been used to influence behavior. In other words, such complaints may really be saying
that young people are more difficult to influence than they used to be.

Nature of Relationship

In addition, the nature of the relationship between A and B can be a factor in power dependence.
Are A and B peers or superior and subordinate? Is the job permanent or temporary? A person on a
temporary job, for example, may feel less need to acquiesce, because he won't be holding the position for
long. Moreover, if A and B are peers or good friends, the influence process is likely to be more delicate than
if they are superior and subordinate.

Counterpower

Finally, a third factor to consider in power dependencies is counterpower. The concept of counterpower
focuses on the extent to which B has other sources of power to buffer the effects of A's power. For example,
if B is unionized, the union's power may serve to negate A's influence attempts. The use of counterpower
can be clearly seen in a variety of situations where various coalitions attempt to bargain with one another
and check the power of their opponents.

   Figure 2 presents a rudimentary model that combines the concepts of bases of power with the notion of
power dependencies. As can be seen, A's bases of power interact with B's extent of power dependency to
184 | POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS

determine B's response to A's influence attempt. If A has significant power and B is highly dependent, we
would expect B to comply with A's wishes.

Figure 2 (Credit: Rice University Openstax/Typical Response Patterns in Dyadic Power Relationships/CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0).

If A has more modest power over B, but B is still largely power dependent, B may try to bargain with A.
Despite the fact that B would be bargaining from an unstable/weaker position, this strategy may serve
to protect B's interests better than outright compliance. For instance, if your boss asked you to work
overtime, you might attempt to strike a deal whereby you would get compensatory time off at a later date.
If successful, although you would not have decreased your working hours, at least you would not have
increased them. Where power distribution is more evenly divided, B may attempt to develop a cooperative
working relationship with A in which both parties gain from the exchange. An example of this position is a
labor contract negotiation where labor-management relations are characterized by a balance of power and a
good working relationship.

   If B has more power than A, B will more than likely reject A's influence attempt. B may even become
the aggressor and attempt to influence A. Finally, when B is not certain of the power relationships, he may
simply try to ignore A's efforts. In doing so, B will discover either that A does indeed have more power or
that A cannot muster the power to be successful. A good illustration of this last strategy can be seen in some
companies' responses to early governmental efforts to secure equal opportunities for minorities and women.
These companies simply ignored governmental efforts until new regulations forced compliance.

Uses of Power

As we look at our groups and teams as well as our organizations, it is easy to see manifestations of power
almost anywhere. In fact, there are a wide variety of power-based methods used to influence others. Here,
we will examine two aspects of the use of power: commonly used power tactics and the ethical use of power.

Common Power Tactics in Organizations

As noted above, many power tactics are available for use. However, as we will see, some are more ethical than
                                        POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS | 185

others. Here, we look at some of the more commonly used power tactics found in both business and public
organizations (Pfeffer, 2011) that also have relevance for groups.

Controlling Access to Information

Most decisions rest on the availability of relevant information, so persons controlling access to
information play a major role in decisions made. A good example of this is the common corporate practice
of pay secrecy. Only the personnel department and senior managers typically have salary information--and
power--for personnel decisions.

Controlling Access to Persons

Another related power tactic is the practice of controlling access to persons. A well-known factor contributing
to President Nixon's downfall was his isolation from others. His two senior advisers had complete control
over who saw the president. Similar criticisms were leveled against President Reagan.

Selective Use of Objective Criteria

Very few questions have one correct answer; instead, decisions must be made concerning the most
appropriate criteria for evaluating results. As such, significant power can be exercised by those who can
practice selective use of objective criteria that will lead to a decision favorable to themselves. According to
Herbert Simon, if an individual is permitted to select decision criteria, then that person needn't care who
actually makes the decision. Attempts to control objective decision criteria can be seen in faculty debates
in a university or college over who gets hired or promoted. One group tends to emphasize teaching and
will attempt to set criteria for employment dealing with teacher competence, subject area, interpersonal
relations, and so on. Another group may emphasize research and will try to set criteria related to number of
publications, reputation in the field, and so on.

Controlling the Agenda

One of the simplest ways to influence a decision is to ensure that it never comes up for consideration in the
first place. There are a variety of strategies used for controlling the agenda. Efforts may be made to order the
topics at a meeting in such a way that the undesired topic is last on the list. Failing this, opponents may
raise a number of objections or points of information concerning the topic that cannot be easily answered,
thereby tabling the topic until another day.

Using Outside Experts

Still another means to gain an advantage is using outside experts. The unit wishing to exercise power may
take the initiative and bring in experts from the field or experts known to be in sympathy with their
cause. Hence, when a dispute arises over spending more money on research versus actual production,
we would expect differing answers from outside research consultants and outside production consultants.
Most consultants have experienced situations in which their clients fed them information and biases they
hoped the consultant would repeat in a meeting.
186 | POWER IN TEAMS AND GROUPS

Bureaucratic Gamesmanship

In some situations, the organizations own policies and procedures provide ammunition for power plays, or
bureaucratic gamesmanship. For instance, a group may drag its feet on making changes in the workplace by
creating red tape, work slowdowns, or "work to rule." (Working to rule occurs when employees diligently
follow every work rule and policy statement to the letter; this typically results in the organization's grinding
to a halt as a result of the many and often conflicting rules and policy statements.) In this way, the group lets
it be known that the workflow will continue to slow down until they get their way.

Coalitions and Alliances

The final power tactic to be discussed here is that of coalitions and alliances. One unit can effectively
increase its power by forming an alliance with other groups that share similar interests. This technique is
often used when multiple labor unions in the same corporation join forces to gain contract concessions
for their workers. It can also be seen in the tendency of corporations within one industry to form trade
associations to lobby for their position. Although the various members of a coalition need not agree on
everything--indeed, they may be competitors--sufficient agreement on the problem under consideration
is necessary as a basis for action.

Ethical Use of Power

Several guidelines for the ethical use of power can be identified. These can be arranged according to our
previous discussion of the five bases of power, as shown in Table 1. As will be noted, several techniques are
available that accomplish their aims without compromising ethical standards. For example, a person using
reward power can verify compliance with work directives, ensure that all requests are both feasible and
reasonable, make only ethical or proper requests, offer rewards that are valued, and ensure that all rewards
for good performance are credible and reasonably attainable.

Even coercive power can be used without jeopardizing personal integrity. For example, a manager can make
sure that all employees know the rules and penalties for rule infractions, provide warnings before punishing,
administer punishments fairly and uniformly, and so forth. The point here is that people have at their
disposal numerous tactics that they can employ without abusing their power.

JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING

From the Noba Project. By Max H. Bazerman, Harvard
University

       Humans are not perfect decision makers. Not only are we not perfect, but we depart from
       perfection or rationality in systematic and predictable ways. The understanding of these
       systematic and predictable departures is core to the field of judgment and decision making.
       By understanding these limitations, we can also identify strategies for making better and
       more effective decisions.

     Learning Objectives

           · Understand the systematic biases that affect our judgment and decision making.
           · Develop strategies for making better decisions.
           · Experience some of the biases through sample decisions.

Introduction

Every day you have the opportunity to make countless decisions: should you eat dessert, cheat on a test, or
attend a sports event with your friends. If you reflect on your own history of choices you will realize that
they vary in quality; some are rational and some are not.

   In his Nobel Prize-winning work, psychologist Herbert Simon (1957; March & Simon, 1958) argued
that our decisions are bounded in their rationality. According to the bounded rationality framework,
human beings try to make rational decisions (such as weighing the costs and benefits of a choice) but our
cognitive limitations prevent us from being fully rational. Time and cost constraints limit the quantity and
quality of the information that is available to us. Moreover, we only retain a relatively small amount of
information in our usable memory. And limitations on intelligence and perceptions constrain the ability
of even very bright decision makers to accurately make the best choice based on the information that is
available.

   About 15 years after the publication of Simon's seminal work, Tversky and Kahneman
                                   JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING | 191

(1973, 1974; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) produced their own Nobel Prize-winning research, which
provided critical information about specific systematic and predictable biases, or mistakes, that influence
judgment (Kahneman received the prize after Tversky's death). The work of Simon, Tversky, and
Kahneman paved the way to our modern understanding of judgment and decision making. And their two
Nobel prizes signaled the broad acceptance of the field of behavioral decision research as a mature area of
intellectual study.

What Would a Rational Decision Look Like?

   People often have to use incomplete information and intuition to make even the most important of
   decisions. A fully rational decision requires a careful, systematic process. [Image: CC0 Public Domain,

Imagine that during your senior year in college, you apply to a number of doctoral programs, law schools,
or business schools (or another set of programs in whatever field most interests you). The good news is that
you receive many acceptance letters. So, how should you decide where to go? Bazerman and Moore (2013)
outline the following six steps that you should take to make a rational decision:
192 | JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING

                      (1) define the problem (i.e., selecting the right graduate program)
                      (2) identify the criteria necessary to judge the multiple options (location, prestige,
                      faculty, etc.)
                      (3) weight the criteria (rank them in terms of importance to you)
                      (4) generate alternatives (the schools that admitted you)
                      (5) rate each alternative on each criterion (rate each school on each criteria that
                      you identified
                      (6) compute the optimal decision. Acting rationally would require that you follow
                      these six steps in a fully rational manner.

   I strongly advise people to think through important decisions such as this in a manner similar to this
process. Unfortunately, we often don't. Many of us rely on our intuitions far more than we should. And
when we do try to think systematically, the way we enter data into such formal decision-making processes is
often biased.

   Fortunately, psychologists have learned a great deal about the biases that affect our thinking. This
knowledge about the systematic and predictable mistakes that even the best and the brightest make can help
you identify flaws in your thought processes and reach better decisions.

Biases in Our Decision Process

Simon's concept of bounded rationality taught us that judgment deviates from rationality, but it did not
tell us how judgment is biased. Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) research helped to diagnose the specific
systematic, directional biases that affect human judgment. These biases are created by the tendency to short-
circuit a rational decision process by relying on a number of simplifying strategies, or rules of thumb,
known as heuristics. Heuristics allow us to cope with the complex environment surrounding our
decisions. Unfortunately, they also lead to systematic and predictable biases.

   To highlight some of these biases please answer the following three quiz items:

     Exercises

   Problem 1 (adapted from Alpert & Raiffa, 1969):

     Listed below are 10 uncertain quantities. Do not look up any information on these items. For
     each, write down your best estimate of the quantity. Next, put a lower and upper bound around
     your estimate, such that you are 98 percent confident that your range surrounds the actual
                               JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING | 193

quantity. Respond to each of these items even if you admit to knowing very little about these
quantities.

  1. The first year the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
  2. The date the French celebrate "Bastille Day"
  3. The distance from the Earth to the Moon
  4. The height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa
  5. Number of students attending Oxford University (as of 2014)
  6. Number of people who have traveled to space (as of 2013)
  7. 2012-2013 annual budget for the University of Pennsylvania
 8. Average life expectancy in Bangladesh (as of 2012)
  9. World record for pull-ups in a 24-hour period
 10. Number of colleges and universities in the Boston metropolitan area

Exercises

Problem 2 (adapted from Joyce & Biddle, 1981):

We know that executive fraud occurs and that it has been associated with many recent financial
scandals. And, we know that many cases of management fraud go undetected even when
annual audits are performed. Do you think that the incidence of significant executive-level
management fraud is more than 10 in 1,000 firms (that is, 1 percent) audited by Big Four
accounting firms?

  1. Yes, more than 10 in 1,000 Big Four clients have significant executive-level management
        fraud.

  2. No, fewer than 10 in 1,000 Big Four clients have significant executive-level management
        fraud.

What is your estimate of the number of Big Four clients per 1,000 that have significant
executive-level management fraud? (Fill in the blank below with the appropriate number.)
________ in 1,000 Big Four clients have significant executive-level management fraud.

Exercises
194 | JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING

   Problem 3 (adapted from Tversky & Kahneman, 1981):

     Imagine that the United States is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual avian disease that is
     expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been
     proposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are
     as follows.

        1. Program A: If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.
       2. Program B: If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600 people will

             be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved.
     Which of the two programs would you favor?

Overconfidence

On the first problem, if you set your ranges so that you were justifiably 98 percent confident, you should
expect that approximately 9.8, or nine to 10, of your ranges would include the actual value. So, let's look at
the correct answers:
                                    JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING | 195

 Overconfidence is a natural part of most people's decision-making process and this can get us into
 trouble. Is it possible to overcome our faulty thinking? Perhaps. See the "Fixing Our Decisions" section
 below. [Image: Barn Images, https://goo.gl/IYzbDV, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]
 1. 1901
 2. 14th of July
 3. 384,403 km (238,857 mi)
 4. 56.67 m (183 ft)
 5. 22,384 (as of 2014)
 6. 536 people (as of 2013)
 7. $6.007 billion
 8. 70.3 years (as of 2012)
 9. 4,321
10. 52
 Count the number of your 98% ranges that actually surrounded the true quantities. If you surrounded
 nine to 10, you were appropriately confident in your judgments. But most readers surround only between
 three (30%) and seven (70%) of the correct answers, despite claiming 98% confidence that each range would
 surround the true value. As this problem shows, humans tend to be overconfident in their judgments.
196 | JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING

Anchoring

Regarding the second problem, people vary a great deal in their final assessment of the level of executive-level
management fraud, but most think that 10 out of 1,000 is too low. When I run this exercise in class, half of
the students respond to the question that I asked you to answer. The other half receive a similar problem,
but instead are asked whether the correct answer is higher or lower than 200 rather than 10. Most people
think that 200 is high. But, again, most people claim that this "anchor" does not affect their final estimate.
Yet, on average, people who are presented with the question that focuses on the number 10 (out of 1,000)
give answers that are about one-half the size of the estimates of those facing questions that use an anchor
of 200. When we are making decisions, any initial anchor that we face is likely to influence our judgments,
even if the anchor is arbitrary. That is, we insufficiently adjust our judgments away from the anchor.

Framing

Turning to Problem 3, most people choose Program A, which saves 200 lives for sure, over Program B. But,
again, if I was in front of a classroom, only half of my students would receive this problem. The other half
would have received the same set-up, but with the following two options:

1. Program C: If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die.
2. Program D: If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that no one will die and a two-

      thirds probability that 600 people will die.

Which of the two programs would you favor?
   Careful review of the two versions of this problem clarifies that they are objectively the same. Saving

200 people (Program A) means losing 400 people (Program C), and Programs B and D are also objectively
identical. Yet, in one of the most famous problems in judgment and decision making, most individuals
choose Program A in the first set and Program D in the second set (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). People
respond very differently to saving versus losing lives--even when the difference is based just on the
"framing" of the choices.

   The problem that I asked you to respond to was framed in terms of saving lives, and the implied reference
point was the worst outcome of 600 deaths. Most of us, when we make decisions that concern gains, are risk
averse; as a consequence, we lock in the possibility of saving 200 lives for sure. In the alternative version, the
problem is framed in terms of losses. Now the implicit reference point is the best outcome of no deaths due
to the avian disease. And in this case, most people are risk seeking when making decisions regarding losses.

   These are just three of the many biases that affect even the smartest among us. Other research shows that
we are biased in favor of information that is easy for our minds to retrieve, are insensitive to the importance
of base rates and sample sizes when we are making inferences, assume that random events will always
look random, search for information that confirms our expectations even when disconfirming information
would be more informative, claim a priori knowledge that didn't exist due to the hindsight bias, and are
subject to a host of other effects that continue to be developed in the literature (Bazerman & Moore, 2013).

Contemporary Developments

                                                     Bounded rationality served as the integrating

                                                     concept of the field of behavioral decision research

                                                     for 40 years. Then, in 2000, Thaler (2000)

                                                     suggested that decision making is bounded in two

                                                     ways not precisely captured by the concept of

                                                     bounded rationality. First, he argued that

                                                     our willpower is bounded and that, as a

                                                     consequence, we give greater weight to present

                                                     concerns than to future concerns. Our immediate

                                                     motivations are often inconsistent with our long-

                                                     term interests in a variety of ways, such as the

                                                     common failure to save adequately for retirement

                                                     or the difficulty many people have staying on a

                                                     diet. Second, Thaler suggested that our self-

The concept of bounded willpower may explain why     interest is bounded such that we care about the
many of us are better shoppers than savers. [Image:  outcomes of others. Sometimes we positively value
CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]            the outcomes of others--giving them more of a

                                                     commodity than is necessary out of a desire to be

fair, for example. And, in unfortunate contexts, we sometimes are willing to forgo our own benefits out of

a desire to harm others.

My colleagues and I have recently added two other important bounds to the list. Chugh et al. (2005) and
Banaji and Bhaskar (2000) introduced the concept of bounded ethicality, which refers to the notion that
our ethics are limited in ways we are not even aware of ourselves. Second, Chugh and Bazerman (2007)
developed the concept of bounded awareness to refer to the broad array of focusing failures that affect our
judgment, specifically the many ways in which we fail to notice obvious and important information that is
available to us.

   A final development is the application of judgment and decision-making research to the areas of
behavioral economics, behavioral finance, and behavioral marketing, among others. In each case, these
fields have been transformed by applying and extending research from the judgment and decision-making
literature.

Fixing Our Decisions

Ample evidence documents that even smart people are routinely impaired by biases. Early research
demonstrated, unfortunately, that awareness of these problems does little to reduce bias (Fischhoff, 1982).
The good news is that more recent research documents interventions that do help us overcome our faulty
thinking (Bazerman & Moore, 2013).

   One critical path to fixing our biases is provided in Stanovich and West's (2000) distinction
between System 1 and System 2 decision making. System 1 processing is our intuitive system, which is
typically fast, automatic, effortless, implicit, and emotional. System 2 refers to decision making that is
slower, conscious, effortful, explicit, and logical. The six logical steps of decision making outlined earlier
describe a System 2 process.

   Clearly, a complete System 2 process is not required for every decision we make. In most situations, our
198 | JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING

System 1 thinking is quite sufficient; it would be impractical, for example, to logically reason through every
choice we make while shopping for groceries. But, preferably, System 2 logic should influence our most
important decisions. Nonetheless, we use our System 1 processes for most decisions in life, relying on it even
when making important decisions.

   The key to reducing the effects of bias and improving our decisions is to transition from trusting our
intuitive System 1 thinking toward engaging more in deliberative System 2 thought. Unfortunately, the
busier and more rushed people are, the more they have on their minds, and the more likely they are to rely
on System 1 thinking (Chugh, 2004). The frantic pace of professional life suggests that executives often rely
on System 1 thinking (Chugh, 2004).

   Fortunately, it is possible to identify conditions where we rely on intuition at our peril and substitute
more deliberative thought. One fascinating example of this substitution comes from journalist Michael
Lewis' (2003) account of how Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, improved the
outcomes of the failing baseball team after recognizing that the intuition of baseball executives was limited
and systematically biased and that their intuitions had been incorporated into important decisions in ways
that created enormous mistakes. Lewis (2003) documents that baseball professionals tend to overgeneralize
from their personal experiences, be overly influenced by players' very recent performances, and overweigh
what they see with their own eyes, despite the fact that players' multiyear records provide far better data.
By substituting valid predictors of future performance (System 2 thinking), the Athletics were able to
outperform expectations given their very limited payroll.

Another important direction for improving

decisions comes from Thaler and Sunstein's (2008)

book Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health,

Wealth, and Happiness. Rather than setting out to

debias human judgment, Thaler and Sunstein

outline a strategy for how "decision architects" can

change environments in ways that account for

human bias and trigger better decisions as a result.

For example, Beshears et al. (2008) have shown that

simple changes to defaults can dramatically

improve people's decisions. They tackle the failure

of many people to save for retirement and show

that a simple change can significantly influence

enrollment in 401(k) programs. In most                Nudges can be used to help people make better
companies, when you start your job, you need to       decisions about saving for retirement. [Image: Tax

retirement savings plan. Many people take years       https://goo.gl/BRvSA7

before getting around to doing so. When, instead,

companies automatically enroll their employees in 401(k) programs and give them the opportunity to "opt

out," the net enrollment rate rises significantly. By changing defaults, we can counteract the human

tendency to live with the status quo.

Similarly, Johnson and Goldstein's (2003) cross-European organ donation study reveals that countries

that have opt-in organ donation policies, where the default is not to harvest people's organs without their

prior consent, sacrifice thousands of lives in comparison to opt-out policies, where the default is to harvest

organs. The United States and too many other countries require that citizens opt in to organ donation

through a proactive effort; as a consequence, consent rates range between 4.25%-44% across these countries.

In contrast, changing the decision architecture to an opt-out policy improves consent rates to 85.9% to
                                   JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING | 199

99.98%. Designing the donation system with knowledge of the power of defaults can dramatically change
donation rates without changing the options available to citizens. In contrast, a more intuitive strategy, such
as the one in place in the United States, inspires defaults that result in many unnecessary deaths.

CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP
CLIMATE

CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP CLIMATE

       Learning Objectives
           · Define group cohesion and group climate
           · Explain symbolic convergence theory and its relationship to group cohesion
           · Identify communication behaviors that contribute to supportive vs. defensive group
                climates

   Any time a group of people come together, new dynamics are put into place that differ from the
dynamics present in our typical dyadic interactions. The impressions we form about other people's
likeability and the way we think about a group's purpose are affected by the climate within a group that is
created by all members. In this chapter, we will define group cohesion and climate as well as discuss specific
communication behaviors that can contribute to supportive and defensive group climates.

DEFINING GROUP COHESION AND CLIMATE

When something is cohesive, it sticks together, and the cohesion within a group helps establish an overall
group climate. Group climate refers to the relatively enduring tone and quality of group interaction that is
experienced similarly by group members. To better understand cohesion and climate, we can examine two
types of cohesion: task and social.

   Task cohesion refers to the commitment of group members to the purpose and activities of the group.
Social cohesion refers to the attraction and liking among group members. Ideally, groups would have
an appropriate balance between these two types of cohesion relative to the group's purpose, with task-
oriented groups having higher task cohesion and relational-oriented groups having higher social cohesion.
Even the most task-focused groups need some degree of social cohesion, and vice versa, but the balance will
be determined by the purpose of the group and the individual members. For example, a team of workers
from the local car dealership may join a local summer softball league because they're good friends and love
the game. They may end up beating the team of faculty members from the community college who joined
the league just to get to know each other better and have an excuse to get together and drink beer in the
afternoon. In this example, the players from the car dealership exhibit high social and task cohesion, while
the faculty exhibit high social but low task cohesion.

                                                                                                               Cagle/Unsplash)

Cohesive groups have an appropriate balance between task and social cohesion.
   Cohesion benefits a group in many ways and can be assessed through specific group behaviors and

characteristics. Groups with an appropriate level of cohesiveness (Hargie, 2011):

 · set goals easily;
 · exhibit a high commitment to achieving the purpose of the group;
 · are more productive;
 · experience fewer attendance issues;
 · have group members who are willing to stick with the group during times of difficulty;
 · have satisfied group members who identify with, promote, and defend the group;
 · have members who are willing to listen to each other and offer support and constructive criticism;

      and
 · experience less anger and tension.

Appropriate levels of group cohesion usually create a positive group climate, since group climate is affected
by members' satisfaction with the group. Climate has also been described as group morale. Following are
some qualities that contribute to a positive group climate and morale (Marston & Hecht, 1988):

 · Participation. Group members feel better when they feel included in discussion and a part of the
      functioning of the group.

 · Messages. Confirming messages help build relational dimensions within a group, and clear,
      organized, and relevant messages help build task dimensions within a group.

 · Feedback. Positive, constructive, and relevant feedback contribute to group climate.
 · Equity. Aside from individual participation, group members also like to feel as if participation is

      managed equally within the group and that appropriate turn taking is used.
 · Clear and accepted roles. Group members like to know how status and hierarchy operate within a

      group. Knowing the roles isn't enough to lead to satisfaction, though--members must also be
      comfortable with and accept those roles.
 · Motivation. Member motivation is activated by perceived connection to and relevance of the
      group's goals or purpose.
204 | CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP CLIMATE

Group cohesion and climate is also demonstrated through symbolic convergence (Bormann, 1985).
Symbolic convergence refers to the sense of community or group consciousness that develops in a group
through non-task-related communication such as stories and jokes. The originator of symbolic convergence
theory, Ernest Bormann, claims that the sharing of group fantasies creates symbolic convergence. Fantasy,
in this sense, doesn't refer to fairy tales, sexual desire, or untrue things. In group communication group
fantasies are verbalized references to events outside the "here and now" of the group, including references
to the group's past, predictions for the future, or other communication about people or events outside the
group (Griffin, 2009). For example, as a graduate student, I spent a lot of time talking with others in our
small group about research, writing, and other things related to our classes and academia in general. Most
of this communication wouldn't lead to symbolic convergence or help establish the strong social bonds
that we developed as a group. Instead, it was our grad student "war stories" about excessive reading loads
and unreasonable paper requirements we had experienced in earlier years of grad school, horror stories
about absent or vindictive thesis advisors, and "you won't believe this" stories from the classes that we were
teaching that brought us together.

                                                                                                               (Credit: Priscilla
                                                                                                               Du Preez/
                                                                                                               Unsplash)

As symbolic convergence theory suggests, non-task-related communication such as stories, jokes or shared
experiences can actually be valuable for groups.

   In any group, you can tell when symbolic convergence is occurring by observing how people share such
fantasies and how group members react to them. If group members react positively and agree with or
appreciate the teller's effort or other group members are triggered to tell their own related stories, then
convergence is happening and cohesion and climate are being established. Over time, these fantasies build a
shared vision of the group and what it means to be a member that creates a shared group consciousness. By
reviewing and applying the concepts in this section, you can hopefully identify potential difficulties with
group cohesion and work to enhance cohesion when needed in order to create more positive group climates
and enhance your future group interactions.

SUPPORTIVE AND DEFENSIVE GROUP CLIMATES

Communication is key to developing positive group climates. This requires groups to attend to the
supportive and defensive communication behaviors taking place in their groups. Defensive
communication is defined as communication behavior which occurs when an individual perceives threat
                    CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP CLIMATE | 205

or anticipates threat in the group. Those who behaves defensively, even though they also gives some
attention to the common task, devote an appreciable portion of energy to defending themselves. Besides
talking about the topic, they think about how they appear to others, how they may be seen more favorably,
how they may win, dominate, impress or escape punishment, and/or how they may avoid or mitigate
a perceived attack. Such inner feelings and outward acts tend to create similarly defensive postures in
others; and, if unchecked, the ensuing circular response becomes increasingly destructive. Defensive
communication behavior, in short, engenders defensive listening, and this in turn produces postural, facial
and verbal cues which raise the defense level of the original communicator. Defense arousal prevents the
listener from concentrating upon the message. Not only do defensive communicators send off multiple
value, motive and affect cues, but also defensive recipients distort what they receive. As a person becomes
more and more defensive, he or she becomes less and less able to perceive accurately the motives, the values
and the emotions of the sender. Defensive behaviors have been correlated positively with losses in efficiency
in communication. The converse, moreover, also is true. The more "supportive" or defense-reductive the
climate, the less the receiver reads into the communication distorted loadings which arise from projections
of their own anxieties, motives and concerns. As defenses are reduced, the receivers become better able to
concentrate upon the structure, the content and the cognitive meanings of the message. Jack Gibb (1961)
developed six pairs of defensive and supportive communication categories presented below. Behavior
which a listener perceives as possessing any of the characteristics listed in the left-hand column arouses
defensiveness, whereas that which he interprets as having any of the qualities designated as supportive
reduces defensive feelings. The degree to which these reactions occur depends upon the person's level of
defensiveness and upon the general climate in the group at the time.

4. Neutrality       4. Empathy

5. Superiority      5. Equality

6. Certainty        6. Provisionalism

EVALUATION AND DESCRIPTION

Speech or other behavior which appears evaluative increases defensiveness. If by expression, manner of
speech, tone of voice or verbal content the sender seems to be evaluating or judging the listener, the receiver
goes on guard. Of course, other factors may inhibit the reaction. If the listener thought that the speaker
regarded him/her as an equal and was being open and spontaneous, for example, the evaluativeness in
a message would be neutralized and perhaps not even perceived. This same principle applies equally to
the other five categories of potentially defense-producing climates. These six sets are interactive. Because
our attitudes toward other persons are frequently, and often necessarily, evaluative, expressions which the
defensive person will regard as nonjudgmental are hard to frame. Even the simplest question usually conveys
the answer that the sender wishes or implies the response that would fit into his or her value system. A
mother, for example, immediately following an earth tremor that shook the house, sought for her small son
with the question, "Bobby, where are you?" The timid and plaintive "Mommy, I didn't do it" indicated
how Bobby's chronic mild defensiveness predisposed him to react with a projection of his own guilt and
206 | CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP CLIMATE

in the context of his chronic assumption that questions are full of accusation. Anyone who has attempted
to train professionals to use information-seeking speech with neutral affect appreciates how difficult it is
to teach a person to say even the simple "who did that?" without being seen as accusing. Speech is so
frequently judgmental that there is a reality base for the defensive interpretations which are so common.
When insecure, group members are particularly likely to place blame, to see others as fitting into categories
of good or bad, to make moral judgments of their colleagues and to question the value, motive and affect
loadings of the speech which they hear. Since value loadings imply a judgment of others, a belief that the
standards of the speaker differ from his or her own causes the listener to become defensive. Descriptive
speech, in contrast to that which is evaluative, tends to arouse a minimum of uneasiness. Speech acts in
which the listener perceives as genuine requests for information or as material with neutral loadings is
descriptive. Specifically, presentation of feelings, events, perceptions or processes which do not ask or imply
that the receiver change behavior or attitude are minimally defense producing.

CONTROL AND PROBLEM ORIENTATION

Speech which is used to control the listener evokes resistance. In most of our social interactions, someone
is trying to do something to someone else--to change an attitude, to influence behavior, or to restrict
the field of activity. The degree to which attempts to control produce defensiveness depends upon the
openness of the effort, for a suspicion that hidden motives exist heightens resistance. For this reason,
attempts of non-directive therapists and progressive educators to refrain from imposing a set of values, a
point of view or a problem solution upon the receivers meet with many barriers. Since the norm is control,
non-controllers must earn the perceptions that their efforts have no hidden motives. A bombardment of
persuasive "messages" in the fields of politics, education, special causes, advertising, religion, medicine,
industrial relations and guidance has bred cynical and paranoid responses in listeners. Implicit in all
attempts to alter another person is the assumption by the change agent that the person to be altered is
inadequate. That the speaker secretly views the listener as ignorant, unable to make his or her own decisions,
uninformed, immature, unwise, or possessed of wrong or inadequate attitudes is a subconscious perception
which gives the latter a valid base for defensive reactions.

STRATEGY AND SPONTANEITY

When the sender is perceived as engaged in a stratagem involving ambiguous and multiple motivations,
the receiver becomes defensive. No one wishes to be a guinea pig, a role player, or an impressed actor,
and no one likes to be the victim of some hidden motivation. That which is concealed, also, may appear
larger than it really is with the degree of defensiveness of the listener determining the perceived size of the
element. The intense reaction of the reading audience to the material in The Hidden Persuaders indicates
the prevalence of defensive reactions to multiple motivations behind strategy. Group members who are
seen as "taking a role" as feigning emotion, as toying with their colleagues, as withholding information
or as having special sources of data are especially resented. One participant once complained that another
was "using a listening technique" on him! A large part of the adverse reaction to much of the so-called
human relations training is a feeling against what are perceived as gimmicks and tricks to fool or to "involve"
people, to make a person think he or she is making their own decision, or to make the listener feel that the
sender is genuinely interested in him or her as a person. Particularly violent reactions occur when it appears
that someone is trying to make a stratagem appear spontaneous. One person reported a boss who incurred
resentment by habitually using the gimmick of "spontaneously" looking at his watch and saying "my gosh,
look at the time--I must run to an appointment." The belief was that the boss would create less irritation
                    CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP CLIMATE | 207

by honestly asking to be excused. The aversion to deceit may account for one's resistance to politicians who
are suspected of behind-the-scenes planning to get one's vote, to psychologists whose listening apparently
is motivated by more than the manifest or content-level interest in one's behavior, or the sophisticated,
smooth, or clever person whose one-upmanship is marked with guile. In training groups the role-flexible
person frequently is resented because his or her changes in behavior are perceived as strategic maneuvers.
In contrast, behavior that appears to be spontaneous and free of deception is defense reductive. If the
communicator is seen as having a clean id, as having uncomplicated motivations, as being straightforward
and honest, as behaving spontaneously in response to the situation, he or she is likely to arouse minimal
defensiveness.

NEUTRALITY AND EMPATHY

When neutrality in speech appears to the listener to indicate a lack of concern for his welfare, he becomes
defensive. Group members usually desire to be perceived as valued persons, as individuals with special
worth, and as objects of concern and affection. The clinical, detached, person-is-an-object-study attitude
on the part of many psychologist-trainers is resented by group members. Speech with low affect that
communicates little warmth or caring is in such contrast with the affect-laden speech in social situations that
it sometimes communicates rejection. Communication that conveys empathy for the feelings and respect
for the worth of the listener, however, is particularly supportive and defense reductive. Reassurance results
when a message indicates that the speaker identifies himself or herself with the listener's problems, shares
her feelings, and accepts her emotional reactions at face value. Abortive efforts to deny the legitimacy of the
receiver's emotions by assuring the receiver that she need not feel badly, that she should not feel rejected,
or that she is overly anxious, although often intended as support giving, may impress the listener as lack of
acceptance. The combination of understanding and empathizing with the other person's emotions with no
accompanying effort to change him or her is supportive at a high level. The importance of gestural behavior
cues in communicating empathy should be mentioned. Apparently spontaneous facial and bodily evidences
of concern are often interpreted as especially valid evidence of deep-level acceptance.

SUPERIORITY AND EQUALITY

When a person communicates to another that he or she feels superior in position, power, wealth,
intellectual ability, physical characteristics, or other ways, she or he arouses defensiveness. Here, as with
other sources of disturbance, whatever arouses feelings of inadequacy causes the listener to center upon the
affect loading of the statement rather than upon the cognitive elements. The receiver then reacts by not
hearing the message, by forgetting it, by competing with the sender, or by becoming jealous of him or her.
The person who is perceived as feeling superior communicates that he or she is not willing to enter into a
shared problem-solving relationship, that he or she probably does not desire feedback, that he or she does
not require help, and/or that he or she will be likely to try to reduce the power, the status, or the worth of
the receiver. Many ways exist for creating the atmosphere that the sender feels himself or herself equal to
the listener. Defenses are reduced when one perceives the sender as being willing to enter into participative
planning with mutual trust and respect. Differences in talent, ability, worth, appearance, status and power
often exist, but the low defense communicator seems to attach little importance to these distinctions.

CERTAINTY AND PROVISIONALISM

The effects of dogmatism in producing defensiveness are well known. Those who seem to know the
208 | CULTIVATING A SUPPORTIVE GROUP CLIMATE

answers, to require no additional data, and to regard themselves as teachers rather than as co-workers tend
to put others on guard. Moreover, listeners often perceive manifest expressions of certainty as connoting
inward feelings of inferiority. They see the dogmatic individual as needing to be right, as wanting to win an
argument rather than solve a problem and as seeing his or her ideas as truths to be defended. This kind of
behavior often is associated with acts which others regarded as attempts to exercise control. People who are
right seem to have low tolerance for members who are "wrong"--i.e., who do not agree with the sender.
One reduces the defensiveness of the listener when one communicates that one is willing to experiment with
one's own behavior, attitudes and ideas. The person who appears to be taking provisional attitudes, to be
investigating issues rather than taking sides on them, to be problem solving rather than doubting, and to be
willing to experiment and explore tends to communicate that the listener may have some control over the
shared quest or the investigation of the ideas. If a person is genuinely searching for information and data, he
or she does not resent help or company along the way.

STRUCTURATION THEORY

Structuration

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The theory of structuration is a social theory of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is
based in the analysis of both social structures and agency, without giving primacy to either. Structuration
proposes that structures (i.e., norms, rules, roles) interaction with agency (i.e., free will) to reproduce in
groups, teams, and organizations.

 Duality of structure

   Structure refers generally to "rules and resources" and more specifically to "the structuring properties
allowing the `binding' of time-space in social systems". These properties make it possible for similar social
practices to exist across time and space and that lend them "systemic" form. Agents--groups or
individuals--draw upon these structures to perform social actions through embedded memory,
called mental models. Mental models are the vehicle through which guide everyday social action.

   However, structure and agency are mutually influential. Structure is the result of these social practices.
Thus, Giddens (1979) conceives of the duality of structure as being:

      ...the essential recursiveness of social life, as constituted in social practices: structure is both medium and
      outcome of reproduction of practices. Structure enters simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and
      social practices, and `exists' in the generating moments of this constitution. (p. 5).

Giddens uses "the duality of structure" (i.e. material/ideational, micro/macro) to emphasize structure's
nature as both medium and outcome. Structures exist both internally within agents as mental models
that are the product of socialization and externally as the manifestation of social actions. Similarly, social
structures contain agents and/or are the product of past actions of agents. Giddens (1984) holds this
duality, alongside "structure" and "system," in addition to the concept of recursiveness, as the core of
structuration theory.

Cycle of structuration

The duality of structure is essentially a feedback-feedforward process whereby agents and structures
mutually enact social systems, and social systems in turn become part of that duality. Structuration thus
recognizes a social cycle. In examining social systems, structuration theory examines structure, modality,
and interaction. The structural modality (discussed below) of a structural system is the means by which
structures are translated into actions.

Interaction

Interaction is the agent's activity within the social system, space, and time. "It can be understood as the
fitful yet routinized occurrence of encounters, fading away in time and space, yet constantly reconstituted
within different areas of time-space" (Giddens, 1984, p. 86). Rules and norms can affect interaction. Frames
                                                 STRUCTURATION THEORY | 211

are "clusters of rules which help to constitute and regulate activities, defining them as activities of a certain
sort and as subject to a given range of sanctions" (Giddens, 1984, p. 87). Frames are necessary for agents
to feel "ontological security, the trust that everyday actions have some degree of predictability. Whenever
individuals interact in a specific context they address--without any difficulty and in many cases without
conscious acknowledgement--the question: "What is going on here?" Framing is the practice by which
agents make sense of what they are doing.

Routinization

Structuration theory is centrally concerned with order as "the transcending of time and space in human
social relationships" (Giddens, 1984, p. 87). Institutionalized action and routinization are foundational in
the establishment of social order and the reproduction of social systems. Routine persists in society, even
during social and political revolutions, where daily life is greatly deformed, "as Bettelheim demonstrates so
well, routines, including those of an obnoxious sort, are re-established" (Giddens, 1984, p. 87). Routine
interactions become institutionalized features of social systems via tradition, custom and/or habit, but this
is no easy societal task and it "is a major error to suppose that these phenomena need no explanation.

Explanation

      When I utter a sentence I draw upon various syntactical rules (sedimented in my practical consciousness of the
      language) in order to do so. These structural features of the language are the medium whereby I generate the
      utterance. But in producing a syntactically correct utterance I simultaneously contribute to the reproduction of
      the language as a whole. ...The relation between moment and totality for social theory... [involves] a dialectic
      of presence and absence which ties the most minor or trivial forms of social action to structural properties of the
      overall society, and to the coalescence of institutions over long stretches of historical time. (Giddens, 1984, p. 24)

Thus, even the smallest social actions contribute to the alteration or reproduction of social systems. Social
stability and order is not permanent; agents always possess a dialectic of control which allows them to
break away from normative actions. Depending on the social factors present, agents may cause shifts in
social structure.

   The cycle of structuration is not a defined sequence; it is rarely a direct succession of causal events.
Structures and agents are both internal and external to each other, mingling, interrupting, and continually
changing each other as feedbacks and feedforwards occur. Giddens (1984) stated, "The degree of
"systemness" is very variable. ...I take it to be one of the main features of structuration theory that the
extension and `closure' of societies across space and time is regarded as problematic" (Giddens, 1984, p.
165).

Structure and society

Structures are the "rules and resources" embedded in agents' mental models. Agents call upon their mental
models on which they are "knowledgeable" to perform social actions. "Knowledgeability" refers to what
agents know about what they do, and why they do it. Giddens divides these reproducing mental
models into three types:

 · Domination (power): Giddens also uses "resources" to refer to this type. "Authoritative resources"
      allow agents to control persons, whereas "allocative resources" allow agents to control material
      objects.

 · Signification (meaning): Giddens suggests that meaning is inferred through structures. Agents use
212 | STRUCTURATION THEORY

      existing experience to infer meaning. For example, Zanin and Piercy (2019) show that mental illness
      meaning comes from contextualized experience.
 · Legitimation (norms): Giddens sometimes uses "rules" to refer to either signification or
      legitimation. An agent draws upon these stocks of knowledge via memory to inform him or herself
      about the external context, conditions, and potential results of an action.

When an agent uses structures for social interactions, they are called modalities. Modalities emerge the
forms of facility (domination), interpretive scheme/communication (signification) and norms/sanctions
(legitimation).

   Thus, he distinguishes between overall "structures-within-knowledgeability" and the more limited and
task-specific "modalities" on which these agents subsequently draw when they interact.

   The duality of structures means that structures enter "simultaneously into the constitution of the
agent and social practices, and `exists' in the generating moments of this constitution" (Giddens, 1979,
p. 5). "Structures exist paradigmatically, as an absent set of differences, temporally "present" only in their
instantiation, in the constituting moments of social systems (Giddens, 1979, p. 64).

Agents and society

According to Giddens, agency is human action. Agency is critical to both the reproduction and the
transformation of society. Another way to explain this concept is by what Giddens (1991) calls the reflexive
monitoring of actions. Reflexive monitoring refers to agents' ability to monitor their actions and those
actions' settings and contexts. Monitoring is an essential characteristic of agency. Agents subsequently
rationalize, or evaluate, the success of those efforts. All humans engage in this process, and expect the same
from others. Through action, agents produce structures; through reflexive monitoring and rationalization,
they transform them. To act, agents must be motivated, knowledgeable, and able to rationalize the action;
further, agents must reflexively monitor the action.

   Agents, while bounded in structure, draw upon their knowledge of that structural context when they
act. However, actions are constrained by agents' inherent capabilities and their understandings of available
actions and external limitations. Practical consciousness and discursive consciousness inform these abilities.
Practical consciousness is the knowledgeability that an agent brings to the tasks required by everyday
life, which is so integrated as to be hardly noticed. Reflexive monitoring occurs at the level of practical
consciousness (Ilmonen, 2001). Discursive consciousness is the ability to verbally express knowledge.
Alongside practical and discursive consciousness, Giddens (1984) recognizes actors as having reflexive,
contextual knowledge, and that habitual, widespread use of knowledgeability makes structures become
institutionalized.

   Agents rationalize, and in doing so, link the agent and the agent's knowledgeability. As agents, people
coordinate ongoing projects, goals, and contexts while performing actions. This coordination is called
reflexive monitoring, and is connected to ethnomethodology's emphasis on agents' intrinsic sense of
accountability. According to Giddens (1984), reflexivity is comprised discursive consciousness (i.e., that
which is said) and practical consciousness (i.e., the activity, or what is done). Kaspersen (2000) explained
Giddens conceptualization of monitoring as what occurs as a result of routinized activity.

   The factors that can enable or constrain an agent, as well as how an agent uses structures, are known
as capability constraints include age, cognitive/physical limits on performing multiple tasks at once and
the physical impossibility of being in multiple places at once, available time and the relationship between
movement in space and movement in time.

   Location offers are a particular type of capability constraint. Examples include:
                                                 STRUCTURATION THEORY | 213

 · Locale
 · Regionalization: political or geographical zones, or rooms in a building
 · Presence: Do other actors participate in the action? (see co-presence); and more specifically
 · Physical presence: Are other actors physically nearby?

Agents are always able to engage in a dialectic of control, able to "intervene in the world or to refrain from
such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or state of affairs" (Giddens, 1979, p. 14).
In essence, agents experience inherent and contrasting amounts of autonomy and dependence; agents can
always either act or not (Stones, 2005).

Change

The existence of multiple structures implies that the knowledgeable agents whose actions produce systems
are capable of applying different schemas to contexts with differing resources, contrary to the conception
of a universal habitus (learned dispositions, skills and ways of acting). Sewell (1992) argues "Societies are
based on practices that derived from many distinct structures, which exist at different levels, operate in
different modalities, and are themselves based on widely varying types and quantities of resources. ...It is
never true that all of them are homologous" (p. 16).

   Originally from Pierre Bourdieu, transposable schemas can be "applied to a wide and not fully
predictable range of cases outside the context in which they were initially learned." That capacity "is
inherent in the knowledge of cultural schemas that characterizes all minimally competent members of
society" (Sewell, 1992, p. 17). Agents may modify schemas even though their use does not predictably
accumulate resources. For example, the effect of a joke is never quite certain, but a comedian may alter it
based on the amount of laughter it garners regardless of this variability. Agents may interpret a particular
resource according to different schemas. E.g., a commander could attribute his wealth to military prowess,
while others could see it as a blessing from the gods or a coincidental initial advantage. Structures often
overlap, confusing interpretation (e.g., the structure of capitalist society includes production from both
private property and worker solidarity).

Technology

This theory was adapted and augmented by researchers interested in the relationship
between technology and social structures, such as information technology in organizations. DeSanctis and
Poole (1994) proposed an "adaptive structuration theory" with respect to the emergence and use of group
decision support systems. In particular, they chose Giddens' notion of modalities to consider how
technology is used with respect to its "spirit". Appropriations are the immediate, visible actions that reveal
deeper structuration processes and are enacted with "moves". Appropriations may be faithful or unfaithful,
be instrumental and be used with various attitudes.

Group communication

Poole, Seibold, and McPhee (1996) wrote that group structuration theory, provides "a theory of group
interaction commensurate with the complexities of the phenomenon" (p. 116). The theory attempts to
integrate macrosocial theories and individuals or small groups, as well as how to avoid the binary
categorization of either stable or emergent groups.

   Waldeck et al. (2002) concluded that the theory needs to better predict outcomes, rather than merely
explaining them. Decision rules support decision-making, which produces a communication pattern that
214 | STRUCTURATION THEORY

can be directly observable. Thus, groups which develop stable routines for decision making (e.g., "What
could go wrong?" "What else should we consider?" "What are the pros and cons?") tend to come to better
decisions. The interplay of group member agency and structures which seek the best solutions facilitates
strong group structuration and better decision outcomes.

TEAMING WITH MACHINES

   Cameron W. Piercy

I bet you read the chapter title and thought: What? Machines? I am probably going to work in an office,
with people. That's likely, even during the pandemic, 64% of high school graduates want to work in offices
(Maurer, 2021). But, consider this about 25% of all U.S. homes and 1/3 of 18-29 year-olds have a smart
speaker in their home (and 54% of owners say `please' to their device, more on that later; Auxier, 2019).
As of writing, algorithmic calendar applications are on the rise seamlessly scheduling meetings (on Zoom,
Teams, or other mediated platforms of increasing `intelligence' in real time), by assessing both of our digital
calendars avoiding conflicts, and it will email us both a link. Software like this and even Google's proprietary
(that means it's their property and they don't have to explain how it works) algorithm affects how we do
our jobs. Further, whether you work in an office with people, on a factory floor, or whatever context you
are likely to team with machines as part of the future of work.

   Machines are already being used to teach courses (Abendschein et al., 2021a; C. Edwards et al., 2018),
as pets (A. Edwards et al., 2021), for eldercare (Chang & Sabanovi, 2015), and for many other purposes.
In each of these applications, complex machines or machines capable of abstracting principles to guide
function including algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine learning models, robots, and other forms,
are increasingly moving from tool to teammate. Don't believe me? Open and email and start typing--if
you are using a modern email client, it's very likely a machine is analyzing your writing as you write and
recommending how you finish the sentence. While this may seem novel, machine collaboration has been
steadily increasing for years. As I write this paragraph each misspelling (relatively) seamlessly autocorrects to
amend my spelling and grammar.

   So, what does all this mean? Why does `teaming with machines' matter? This chapter begins the
conversation, while inviting you to imagine the work you are already doing in teams and the work you will
be doing in teams that will likely include complex machines.

Problematizing Teaming
with Machines

Like much of this OER, I want to problematize
(that is to frame the potential issues and benefits)
the process of teaming with machines for you.
Sebo et al. (2020) put it clearly, the "literature
provides compelling evidence that people interact
differently with robots when they are alone than A smart speaker.
when they are with other people" (p. 176:4). There
are several key mechanisms which guide human behavior when working with complex machines: the
Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm and the MAIN (modality, agency, interactivity, and
navigability) model. The chapter ends by focusing on evidence of machines as members of teams.

Computers as Social Actors (CASA)

Though the design of a technology (e.g. level of interactivity, cues) affects how we interact with
technologies, people generally use human-human interaction scripts to interact with technologies (see,
Reeves & Nass, 1996; Lombard & Xu, 2021). In both novel and mundane situations, people form and act
on impressions of technology that are based on a longstanding psychological tendency towards
anthropomorphizing the physical world (Broadbent, 2017; Fortunati & Edwards, 2021). This tendency is
captured well in the computers as social actors or CASA paradigm, which claims we are not evolutionarily
adapted to machines and so we apply patterns of human interactions to machines (Reeves & Nass, 1996)
even those with extremely limited communication (e.g., industrial robots; Guzman, 2016).

                                                                   CASA is undergirded with three assumptions
                                                                (1) humans are social creatures and our brain is
                                                                adapted for and attuned to social interaction
                                                                (Banks, 2020); (2) humans are naturally
                                                                interdependent and cooperative (Brewer, 2004;
                                                                Tomasell, 2014); and (3) "humans have evolved to
                                                                develop the propensity for flexibility in using social
                                                                cues during communication and cooperation with
                                                                others" (Lombardi & Xu, 2021, p. 41). The CASA
                                                                paradigm argues human brains have developed to
                                                                be attuned to social interaction, so humans
                                                                generally use the same cognitive scripts to interact
with machines as they do with humans (Nowak et al, 2015; Reeves & Nass, 1996). This is not to say
interaction with machines are thoughtful; indeed, they are often mindless for both human and machine
communication partners (Gambino et al., 2020). However, this finding suggests that validated social theory
ought to apply well to new sociotechnical HMC relationships (de Graaf & Malle, 2019; Westerman et al.,
2020). The ubiquitous CASA findings, that people use overlearned behaviors to interact with machines as
they do with humans, invites scholars to translate theory to in situ work with machines. Thus, the CASA
paradigm serves as a powerful explanation guiding how humans evaluate machine communication partners.

The MAIN (modality, agency, interactivity, and navigability) Model

Sundar (2008) proposed the MAIN (modality, agency, interactivity, and navigability) model for assessing
credibility of information in complex online environment. MAIN argues that cues transmitted via
technological affordances prompt heuristic evaluations of information and yield credibility judgments.
Specifically, affordances refer to perceived capabilities of a technology. For example, Roomba's are known
for their ability to vacuum. But, you may also know their ability to spread dog poop around a house.
Similarly, Amazon's Echo devices are good at answering simple questions, playing games, and offering
shopping suggestions. Echo's can even be configured to turn on and off lights, open garage doors, monitor
for broken glass, or unlock house doors. But, they cannot provide a hug.

   Cues from technology can be as simple as consensus by users (e.g., likes on Facebook, upvotes on
Reddit) or as complex as conversations with Siri. MAIN focuses on four categories of affordances that
prompt evacuation and lead to credibility assessments of a given partner (both humans and machines).
Modality are the most structural of affordances--it refers to the text, audio, video, or other sensory form
of communication available in a given technology. For example, Zoom offers video, audio, and text-based
communication, whereas chat is limited to text, emojis, and gifs.

   Agency asks who or what is responsible for the message? Agency focuses on the source of action--be it
218 | TEAMING WITH MACHINES

algorithm, person, robot, or other source. For example, when you read a news article you might ask who or
what wrote this. Today, news articles are increasingly (and successfully) being writing by AI (see Guzman &
Lewis, 2020).

   Interactivity implies both interaction and activity--and focuses on a given technology's ability to
involve or engage the users. The easiest example might be comparing a simple 8-bit video game, like Pacman,
with a complex virtual environment available on Oculus or in Meta. At a different level, Dora the Explorer
is more interactive than Scooby Doo, because it invites viewers to respond to the media (Sundar, 2008). Like
the other MAIN components, interactivity affects how users assess credibility.

   The final cue in the MAIN model is navigability, which focuses on "interface features that suggest
transportation from one location to another" (Sundar, 2008, p. 88). Though Sundar does not spend
significant time on functionality as a category of navigability--I reflect on my own use of technology tools
that did or did not work so well to think about this affordance. Consider your frustration using a call system
that does not recognize your voice--or, in contrast, finding the perfect piece of information.

   Each affordance, in turn, prompts heuristics, or attentional shortcuts which guide evaluations, for the
technology and source of information. For example, when a post has many positive reactions (regardless of
content) we trust it, which is called the bandwagon heuristic. Evidence suggests that the number of likes
or retweets signals the bandwagon heuristic. Lin and Spence (2018) tested the bandwagon heuristic and
another heuristic, the identity heuristics of tweets. To test the identity heuristic, they changed the identity
of the person tweeting (stranger, student peer, or FDA expert). Their results validate the MAIN model for
perceptions credibility of the message--showing the expert was rated higher than a peer which was higher
than a stranger.

   As you can tell, heuristics are prompted easily (e.g., number of likes/retweets, identity of speaker). The
details of the many heuristic processes prompted by affordances is beyond the scope of this chapter. But,
Figure 1, reproduced directly from Sundar (2008, p. 91) shows the full MAIN model and how affordances
prompt heuristics which influence quality assessments and credibility judgements.

                                                                   So, why does MAIN matter? Well, every
                                                                machine has modality, agency, interactivity, and
                                                                navigability components. When you find yourself
                                                                liking, disliking, or feeling indifferent toward a
                                                                machine partner--you are engaging in quality
                                                                assessments and credibility judgments. These are
                                                                not the only or most important components of
                                                                interaction with machines, but they do affect our
                                                                interaction with machines.

                                     Team Composition and
                                     Machines

                                     Machines can serve many roles in HMC networks

                                     and may be more or less numerous than human

MAIN Model from Sundar, 2008, p. 91  counterparts (Tsarouchi et al., 2016). The

                                     composition of the human-machine team also

matters. Though research on mixed human-machine teams is only emerging, studies show that the more

non-human machines in a group the higher outgrouping by human and more human competition

(Fraune et al. 2019; Xu & Lombard, 2017). Further, when interacting with robots in a group humans report

more negative emotions and greater anxiety (Fraune et al., 2019). At the same time, evidence suggests that
                                                TEAMING WITH MACHINES | 219

workers are more willing to cede decision-making to robots when the robot is efficient (Gombolay et al.,
2015). Further, people prefer to use algorithms when they agree with existing beliefs (Mesbah et al. 2021)
and prefer to use search engines over asking peers (Oeldorf-Hirsch et al., 2014). Bots also elicits reduced
reciprocity evaluations (Prahl & van Swol, 2021).

   In an experiment which prompted users to select between options in collaboration with complex
computer agents, users were influenced by the computers. Specifically, Xu and Lombard (2017) found that
the more users perceived the computers as `close to human' the more likely they were to agree with the
computer. Further, when text of the computer program matched the color of the icon for the users text
(e.g., computer and user both display in blue text) the users were more likely to agree with the computer,
likely signaling a shared social identification with the machine.

   There is a large foundation of group decision support software (GDSS) by Scott Pool and Geraldine
DeSanctis among others (1990; 1994). GDSS is discussed elsewhere in the text, but this software was useful
in understanding how technology and people interact. MicBot is an excellent and succinct example of
how machines can alter human communication processes. Tennent, Shen, and Jung (2019) created MicBot
as a bot that moves the microphone between group members to facilitate more egalitarian conversation.
Specifically, Tennent et al. (2019) concluded MicBot "increased group engagement but also improved
problem solving performance" (p. 133). MicBot did just that--the bot is simple, but (as you have learned if
you have read other chapters), this systematic change can lead to large effects.

   The findings about the role of machines, bots,
AI, in teams and groups is still emerging. Sebo et al.
(2020) in their comprehensive literature review
offer a solid conclusion of the knowledge at the
time this chapter was written:

   In summary, the literature provides compelling
evidence that 1) robots cannot simply be
conceptualized as tools or infrastructure, but also
are not always viewed similarly to people, 2) people
interact differently with robots when they are
alone than when they are with other people, 3) that
a robot's behavior impacts how people interact
with each other, and 4) that while current findings
on group effects are consistent with theory on
human-only groups, it might be premature to MicBot created by Tennent, Shen, and Jung (2019)
assume that this is always the case given that most
research up to this point relied on anthropomorphic robotic systems. (p. 176: 19).

   Machines are more than tools, robots who are members of teams affect team dynamics both with the
machine and with fellow humans, and as novel technologies emerge we need to continue to attend to how
they affect our team and group interaction. Evidence shows that machines affect our communication with
one another and our communication with machines. Key theories like CASA tell us how people treat
machines, and explain why we are often polite to machines (Auxier, 2019).

EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS

John Arroyo: Springfield Sea Lions

John Arroyo is thrilled with his new position as general manager of the Springfield Sea Lions, a
minor league baseball team in. Arroyo has been a baseball fan all of his life, and now his diligent
work and his degree in sports management are paying off.

Arroyo knew he had a hard act to follow. The general manager whom John replaced, "T.J."
Grevin, was a much-loved old-timer who had been with the Sea Lions since their inception 14
years ago. John knew it would be difficult for whoever followed T.J., but he didn't realize how
ostracized and powerless he would feel. He tried a pep talk: "I'm the general manager--the CEO
of this ball club! In time, the staff will respect me." [Not a very good pep talk!]

After his first season ends, Arroyo is discouraged. Ticket and concession sales are down, and
some long-time employees are rumored to be thinking about leaving. If John doesn't turn things
around, he knows his tenure with the Sea Lions will be short.

Questions: Is John correct in assuming that the staff will learn to respect him in time? What can
John do to earn the loyalty of his staff and improve the ball club's performance?

Outcomes: During the winter, John thinks long and hard about how he can earn the respect of
the Sea Lions staff. Before the next season opener, John announces his plan: "So I can better
understand what your day is like, I'm going to spend one day in each of your shoes. I'm trading
places with each of you. I will be a ticket taker, a roving hot dog vendor, and a janitor. And I will
be a marketer, and an accountant--for a day. You in turn will have the day off so you can enjoy
the game from the general manager's box." The staff laughs and whistles appreciatively. Then
the Springfield mascot, Sparky the Sea Lion, speaks up: "Hey Mr. Arroyo, are you going to spend
a day in my flippers?" "You bet!" says John, laughing. The entire staff cheers.

John continues. "At the close of the season, we will honor a staff member with the T.J. Grevin
Award for outstanding contributions to the Sea Lions organization. T.J. was such a great guy, it's
only right that we honor him." The meeting ends, but John's staff linger to tell him how excited
they are about his ideas. Amidst the handshakes, he hopes that this year may be the best year
yet for the Sea Lions.

Sarah Elizabeth Roisland is the manager of a district claims office for a large insurance company.
Fourteen people work for her. The results of a recent attitude survey indicate that her
employees have extremely high job satisfaction and motivation. Conflict is rare in Sarah's office.
Furthermore, productivity measures place her group among the most productive in the entire
company. Her success has brought the company's vice president of human resources to her
office in an attempt to discover the secret to her success. Sarah's peers, superiors, and workers
all give the same answer: she is more than a good manager--she is an outstanding leader. She
continually gets high performance from her employees and does so in such a way that they
enjoy working for her.

There is no magic formula for becoming a good leader. There are, however, many identifiable
reasons why some people are better and more effective leaders. Leaders, especially effective
leaders, are not created by simply attending a one-day leadership workshop. Yet effective
leadership skills are not something most people are born with. You can become an effective
leader if you are willing to invest the time and energy to develop all of the "right stuff."

According to Louise Axon, director of content strategy, and her colleagues at Harvard Business
224 | LEADERSHIP

     Publishing, in seeking management talent, leadership is an urgently needed quality in all
     managerial roles.1 Good leaders and good leadership are rare. Harvard management professor
     John P. Kotter notes that "there is a leadership crisis in the U.S. today,"2 and the late USC
     Professor Warren Bennis states that many of our organizations are overmanaged and
     underled.3

The Nature of Leadership

1. What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?

The many definitions of leadership each have a different emphasis. Some definitions consider leadership

an act or behavior, such as initiating structure so group members know how to complete a task. Others

consider a leader to be the center or nucleus of group activity, an instrument of goal achievement who has

a certain personality, a form of persuasion and power, and the art of inducing compliance.4 Some look at

leadership in terms of the management of group processes. In this view, a good leader develops a vision for

the group, communicates that vision, 5 orchestrates the group's energy and activity toward goal attainment,

"[turns] a group of individuals into a team," and "[transforms] good intentions into positive actions."6

Leadership is frequently defined as a social (interpersonal) influence relationship between two or more

persons who depend on each other to attain certain mutual goals in a group situation.7 Effective leadership

helps individuals and groups achieve their goals by focusing on the group's maintenance needs (the need for

individuals to fit and work together by having, for example, shared norms) and task needs (the need for the

group to make progress toward attaining the goal that brought them together).

                                                       Leader versus Manager

                                                       The two dual concepts, leader and manager,

                                                       leadership and management, are not

                                                       interchangeable, nor are they redundant. The

                                                       differences between the two can, however, be

                                                       confusing. In many instances, to be a good

                                                       manager one needs to be an effective leader. Many

                                                       CEOs have been hired in the hope that their

                                                       leadership skills, their ability to formulate a vision

staying productive, and avoiding being the center of
attention.                                                First, we define the two concepts differently.

In Management and Organizational Behavior, we defined management as a process consisting of planning,

organizing, directing, and controlling. Here we define leadership as a social (interpersonal) influence

relationship between two or more people who are dependent on each another for goal attainment.

Second, managers and leaders are commonly differentiated in terms of the processes through which
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 225

they initially come to their position. Managers are generally appointed to their role. Even though many
organizations appoint people to positions of leadership, leadership per se is a relationship that revolves
around the followers' acceptance or rejection of the leader.8 Thus, leaders often emerge out of events that
unfold among members of a group.

   Third, managers and leaders often differ in terms of the types and sources of the power they exercise.
Managers commonly derive their power from the larger organization. Virtually all organizations legitimize
the use of certain "carrots and sticks" (rewards and punishments) as ways of securing the compliance of
their employees. In other words, by virtue of the position that a manager occupies (president, vice president,
department head, supervisor), certain "rights to act" (schedule production, contract to sell a product, hire
and fire) accompany the position and its place within the hierarchy of authority. Leaders can also secure
power and the ability to exercise influence using carrots and sticks; however, it is much more common
for leaders to derive power from followers' perception of their knowledge (expertise), their personality and
attractiveness, and the working relationship that has developed between leaders and followers.

   From the perspective of those who are under the leader's and manager's influence, the motivation to
comply often has a different base. The subordinate to a manager frequently complies because of the role
authority of the manager, and because of the carrots and sticks that managers have at their disposal. The
followers of a leader comply because they want to. Thus, leaders motivate primarily through intrinsic
processes, while managers motivate primarily through extrinsic processes.

   Finally, it is important to note that while managers may be successful in directing and supervising their
subordinates, they often succeed or fail because of their ability or inability to lead.9 As noted above, effective
leadership often calls for the ability to manage, and effective management often requires leadership.

   CONCEPT CHECK

1. What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?

The Leadership Process

1. What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?

Leadership is a process, a complex and dynamic exchange relationship built over time between leader and
follower and between leader and the group of followers who depend on each other to attain a mutually
desired goal.10 There are several key components to this "working relationship": the leader, the followers,
the context (situation), the leadership process per se, and the consequences (outcomes) (see Figure
3).11 Across time, each component interacts with and influences the other components, and whatever
consequences (such as leader-follower trust) are created influence future interactions. As any one of the
components changes, so too will leadership.12

The Leader

Leaders are people who take charge of or guide the activities of others. They are often seen as the focus or
orchestrater of group activity, the people who set the tone of the group so that it can move forward to attain
its goals. Leaders provide the group with what is required to fulfill its maintenance and task-related needs.
(Later in the chapter, we will return to the "leader as a person" as part of our discussion of the trait approach
to leadership.)

Gilbert, paid special tribute in the General Assembly Hall to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as a

                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 227

The Context

Situations make demands on a group and its members, and not all situations are the same. Context refers to
the situation that surrounds the leader and the followers. Situations are multidimensional. We discuss the
context as it pertains to leadership in greater detail later in this chapter, but for now let's look at it in terms
of the task and task environment that confront the group. Is the task structured or unstructured? Are the
goals of the group clear or ambiguous? Is there agreement or disagreement about goals? Is there a body of
knowledge that can guide task performance? Is the task boring? Frustrating? Intrinsically satisfying? Is the
environment complex or simple, stable or unstable? These factors create different contexts within which
leadership unfolds, and each factor places a different set of needs and demands on the leader and on the
followers.

The Process

The process of leadership is separate and distinct from the leader (the person who occupies a central role
in the group). The process is a complex, interactive, and dynamic working relationship between leader and
followers. This working relationship, built over time, is directed toward fulfilling the group's maintenance
and task needs. Part of the process consists of an exchange relationship between the leader and follower.
The leader provides a resource directed toward fulfilling the group's needs, and the group gives compliance,
recognition, and esteem to the leader. To the extent that leadership is the exercise of influence, part of
the leadership process is captured by the surrender of power by the followers and the exercise of influence
over the followers by the leader.19 Thus, the leader influences the followers and the followers influence
the leader, the context influences the leader and the followers, and both leader and followers influence the
context.

The Consequences

A number of outcomes or consequences of the leadership process unfold between leader, follower, and
situation. At the group level, two outcomes are important:

 · Have the group's maintenance needs been fulfilled? That is, do members of the group like and get
      along with one another, do they have a shared set of norms and values, and have they developed a
      good working relationship? Have individuals' needs been fulfilled as reflected in attendance,
      motivation, performance, satisfaction, citizenship, trust, and maintenance of the group membership?

 · Have the group's task needs been met? That is, there are also important consequences of the
      leadership process for individuals: attendance, motivation, performance, satisfaction, citizenship,
      trust, and maintenance of their group membership.

The leader-member exchange (LMX) theory of the leadership process focuses attention on
consequences associated with the leadership process. The theory views leadership as consisting of a number
of dyadic relationships linking the leader with a follower. A leader-follower relationship tends to develop
quickly and remains relatively stable over time. The quality of the relationship is reflected by the degree
of mutual trust, loyalty, support, respect, and obligation. High- and low-quality relationships between a
leader and each of his followers produce in and out groups among the followers. Members of the in group
come to be key players, and high-quality exchange relationships tend to be associated with higher levels
228 | LEADERSHIP

of performance, commitment, and satisfaction than are low-quality exchange relationships.20 Attitudinal
similarity and extroversion appear to be associated with a high-quality leader-member relationship.21

   The nature of the leadership process varies substantially depending on the leader, the followers, and the
situation and context. Thus, leadership is the function of an interaction between the leader, the follower,
and the context.

   The leadership context for the leader of a group of assembly line production workers differs from the
context for the leader of a self-managing production team and from the context confronted by the lead
scientists in a research laboratory. The leadership tactics that work in the first context might fail miserably
in the latter two.

     Examples

     CATCHING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT
     How a Start-Up Finds the Right Leader
     Start-ups, by their very nature, require innovation to bring new products and services to market.
     Along with establishing a new brand or product, the leader has to develop the relationships and
     processes that make a company succeed, or risk its early demise. While leading an established
     firm has its challenges, a start-up requires even more from a leader.
     How critical is leadership to a start-up? Ask the four cofounders of the now-defunct PYP (Pretty
     Young Professionals), a website founded as a source of information for young professional
     women. What began as four young professional women working on a new start-up ended with
     hurt feelings and threats of legal action. In 2010, Kathryn Minshew, Amanda Pouchot, Caroline
     Ghosn, and Alex Cavoulacos decided to create the website and Minshew was named CEO
     (Cohan 2011a). Lines blurred about Minshew's authority and the ultimate look, feel, and direction
     of the website. Ideals about shared leadership, where the company was going, and how it was
     going to get there ultimately got lost in the power shuffle. By June 2011, passwords were
     changed and legal actions began, and in August Minshew and Cavoulacos left altogether (Cohan
     2011b).
     When the legal haggling from PYP was over, Alex Cavoulacos and Kathryn Minshew, joined by
     Melissa McCreery, tried again. But this time, rather than hoping for the best, they put a
     leadership plan in place. Minshew was named CEO of the new start-up, The Daily Muse, with
     Cavoulacos as chief operating officer and McCreery as editor in chief. Rather than trusting to
     luck, the three cofounders based their team positions on strengths and personalities. Cavoulacos
     and McCreery agreed that Minshew's outgoing personality and confidence made her the proper
     choice as CEO (Casserly 2013).
     No single trait will guarantee that a person can lead a start-up from idea to greatness, but a
     survey of successful entrepreneurs does show some common traits. According to David
     Barbash, a partner at Boston-based law firm Posternak Blankstein & Lund LLP, personality is
     paramount: "You can have great technology but if you're not a great communicator it may die in
     the lab" (Casserly 2013 n.p.). A start-up needs a leader who is confident and willing, if not eager,
     to face the future. According to Michelle Randall, a principal of Enriching Leadership

     (Casserly 2013). Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and angel investor, says leaders have to be
     willing to make the hard decisions, even risking being the bad guy (Casserly 2013).
     Gary Vaynerchuk credits his success to six factors. Angel investor, social media marketer, and
     early social media adopter, Vaynerchuk leveraged YouTube in its early years to market wine from
     the family's liquor store, eventually increasing sales from $3 million to $60 million a year (Clifford
     2017). Gary believes good leaders recognize that they don't dictate to the market, but rather
     respond to where it is going. They have respect for and believe in other people, and have a
     strong work ethic, what Vaynerchuk called a "lunch pail work ethic": they are willing to put in
     long hours because they love the work, not the perks. He also stresses that he loves technology
     and doesn't fear it, is obsessed with the youth of today, and is optimistic about people and the
     future of humanity (Vaynerchuk 2017).
     Leading a startup requires more than simple management. It requires the right leader for the
     right company at the right time, which means matching the right management skills with the
     proper flexibility and drive to keep it all together and moving in the right direction.
     Why would start-up leaders need different leadership qualities than someone managing an
     established firm?

   CONCEPT CHECK

1. What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?

Leader Emergence

How do leaders influence and move their followers to action?
   Leaders hold a unique position in their groups, exercising influence and providing direction. Leonard

Bernstein was part of the symphony, but his role as the New York Philharmonic conductor differed
dramatically from that of the other symphony members. Besides conducting the orchestra, he created a
vision for the symphony. In this capacity, leadership can be seen as a differentiated role and the nucleus of
group activity.

   Organizations have two kinds of leaders: formal and informal. A formal leader is that individual who
is recognized by those outside the group as the official leader of the group. Often, the formal leader is
appointed by the organization to serve in a formal capacity as an agent of the organization. Jack Welch
was the formal leader of General Electric, and Leonard Bernstein was the formal leader of the symphony.
Practically all managers act as formal leaders as part of their assigned role. Organizations that use self-
managed work teams allow members of the team to select the individual who will serve as their team
leader. When this person's role is sanctioned by the formal organization, these team leaders become formal
leaders. Increasingly, leaders in organizations will be those who "best sell" their ideas on how to complete a
project--persuasiveness and inspiration are important ingredients in the leadership equation, especially in
high-involvement organizations.22

   Informal leaders, by contrast, are not assigned by the organization. The informal leader is that
individual whom members of the group acknowledge as their leader. Athletic teams often have informal
leaders, individuals who exert considerable influence on team members even though they hold no official,
formal leadership position. In fact, most work groups contain at least one informal leader. Just like formal
230 | LEADERSHIP

leaders, informal leaders can benefit or harm an organization depending on whether their influence
encourages group members to behave consistently with organizational goals.

   As we have noted, the terms leader and manager are not synonymous. Grace Hopper, retired U.S. Navy
admiral, draws a distinction between leading and managing: "You don't manage people, you manage things.
You lead people."23 Informal leaders often have considerable leverage over their colleagues. Traditionally, the
roles of informal leaders have not included the total set of management responsibilities because an informal
leader does not always exercise the functions of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling. However,
high-involvement organizations frequently encourage their formal and informal leaders to exercise the full
set of management roles. Many consider such actions necessary for self-managing work teams to succeed.
Informal leaders are acknowledged by the group, and the group willingly responds to their leadership.

   Paths to Leadership
   People come to leadership positions through two dynamics. In many instances, people are put into
positions of leadership by forces outside the group. University-based ROTC programs and military
academies (like West Point) formally groom people to be leaders. We refer to this person as the designated
leader (in this instance the designated and formal leader are the same person). Emergent leaders, on the
other hand, arise from the dynamics and processes that unfold within and among a group of individuals as
they endeavor to achieve a collective goal.
   A variety of processes help us understand how leaders emerge. Gerald Salancik and Jeffrey Pfeffer observe
that power to influence others flows to those individuals who possess the critical and scarce resources
(often knowledge and expertise) that a group needs to overcome a major problem.24 They note that
the dominant coalition and leadership in American corporations during the 1950s was among engineers,
because organizations were engaged in competition based on product design. The power base in many
organizations shifted to marketing as competition became a game of advertising aimed at differentiating
products in the consumer's mind. About 10-15 years ago, power and leadership once again shifted, this
time to people with finance and legal backgrounds, because the critical contingencies facing many
organizations were mergers, acquisitions, hostile takeovers, and creative financing. Thus, Salancik and
Pfeffer reason that power and thus leadership flow to those individuals who have the ability to help an
organization or group [overcome its critical contingencies]. As the challenges facing a group change, so too
may the flow of power and leadership.
   Many leaders emerge out of the needs of the situation. Different situations call for different
configurations of knowledge, skills, and abilities. A group often turns to the member who possesses the
knowledge, skills, and abilities that the group requires to achieve its goals.25 People surrender their power
to individuals whom they believe will make meaningful contributions to attaining group goals.26The
individual to whom power is surrendered is often a member of the group who is in good standing. As a
result of this member's contributions to the group's goals, he has accumulated idiosyncrasy credits (a form
of competency-based status). These credits give the individual a status that allows him to influence the
direction that the group takes as it works to achieve its goals.27
   It is important to recognize that the traits possessed by certain individuals contribute significantly to their
emergence as leaders. Research indicates that people are unlikely to follow individuals who, for example, do
not display drive, self-confidence, knowledge of the situation, honesty, and integrity.
   Leadership as an Exercise of Influence
   As we have noted, leadership is the exercise of influence over those who depend on one another for
attaining a mutual goal in a group setting. But how do leaders effectively exercise this influence? Social or
(interpersonal) influence is one's ability to effect a change in the motivation, attitudes, and/or behaviors of
others. Power, then, essentially answers the "how" question: How do leaders influence their followers? The
answer often is that a leader's social influence is the source of his power.
   French and Raven provide us with a useful typology that identifies the sources and types of power. As
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 231

a review those types of power are reward power, coercive power, referent power, expert power, and legitimate
power. 28

   As you know, not all forms of power are equally effective (see Figure 5), nor is a leader's total power base
the simple sum of the powers at his disposal. Different types of power elicit different forms of compliance:
Leaders who rely on coercive power often alienate followers who resist their influence attempts. Leaders
who rely on reward power develop followers who are very measured in their responses to [what?]; the use
of rewards often leads people to think in terms of "How much am I getting?" or "How much should I
give?" or "Am I breaking even?" The use of referent power produces identification with the leader and his
cause. The use of rationality, expert power, and/or moralistic appeal generally elicits commitment and the
internalization of the leader's goals.29

Figure 5 The Leader-Follower Power Relationship

Leaders who use referent and expert power commonly experience a favorable response in terms of follower
satisfaction and performance. Research suggests that rationality is the most effective influence tactic in
terms of its impact on follower commitment, motivation, performance, satisfaction, and group
effectiveness.30

   Reward and legitimate power (that is, relying on one's position to influence others) produce inconsistent
results. Sometimes these powers lead to follower performance and satisfaction, yet they also sometimes
fail. Coercive power can result in favorable performance, yet follower and resistance dissatisfaction are not
uncommon.

   Good leaders, whether formal or informal, develop many sources of power. Leaders who rely solely on
their legitimate power and authority seldom generate the influence necessary to help their organization and
its members succeed. In the process of building their power base, effective leaders have discovered that the
use of coercive power tends to dilute the effectiveness of other powers, while the development and use
of referent power tends to magnify the effectiveness of other forms of power. A compliment or reward
from a person we like generally has greater value than one from someone we dislike, and punishment from
someone we love (such as "tough love" from a parent) is less offensive than the pain inflicted by someone we
dislike.31

   In sum, one key to effective leadership, especially as it pertains to the exercise of social and interpersonal
influence, relates to the type of power employed by the leader. Overall leader effectiveness will be higher
when people follow because they want to follow. This is much more likely to happen when the leader's
influence flows out of intrinsic such as rationality, expertise, moralistic appeal, and/or referent power.

   Leadership is also about having a vision and communicating that vision to others in such a way that it
provides meaning for the follower.32 Language, ritual, drama, myths, symbolic constructions, and stories
232 | LEADERSHIP

are some of the tools leaders use to capture the attention of their "followers to be" to evoke emotion and to
manage the meaning "of the task (challenges) facing the group."33 These tools help the leader influence the
attitudes, motivation, and behavior of their followers.

Influence-Based Leadership Styles

Many writers and researchers have explored how leaders can use power to address the needs of various
situations. One view holds that in traditional organizations members expect to be told what to do and
are willing to follow highly structured directions. Individuals attracted to high-involvement organizations,
however, want to make their own decisions, expect their leaders to allow them to do so, and are willing to
accept and act on this responsibility. This suggests that a leader may use and employ power in a variety of
ways.

The Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum

In the 1950s, Tannenbaum and Schmidt created a continuum (see Figure 6) along which leadership styles
range from authoritarian to extremely high levels of worker freedom.34 Subsequent to Tannenbaum and
Schmidt's work, researchers adapted the continuum by categorizing leader power styles as autocratic (boss-
centered), participative (workers are consulted and involved), or free-rein(members are assigned the work
and decide on their own how to do it; the leader relinquishes the active assumption of the role of
leadership).35

W. H. Schmidt. May--June 1971. How to choose a leadership pattern. Harvard Business Review, 167.

Theory X and Theory Y Leaders

McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y posits two different sets of attitudes about the individual as an
organizational member.36 Theory X and Y thinking gives rise to two different styles of leadership.
The Theory X leader assumes that the average individual dislikes work and is incapable of exercising
adequate self-direction and self-control. As a consequence, they exert a highly controlling leadership style.
In contrast, Theory Y leaders believe that people have creative capacities, as well as both the ability and desire
to exercise self-direction and self-control. They typically allow organizational members significant amounts
of discretion in their jobs and encourage them to participate in departmental and organizational decision-
making. Theory Y leaders are much more likely to adopt involvement-oriented approaches to leadership
and organically designed organizations for their leadership group.
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 233

   Theory X and Theory Y thinking and leadership are not strictly an American phenomenon. Evidence
suggests that managers from different parts of the global community commonly hold the same view. A
study of 3,600 managers from 14 countries reveals that most of them held assumptions about human
nature that could best be classified as Theory X.37 Even though managers might publicly endorse the merits
of participatory management, most of them doubted their workers' capacities to exercise self-direction and
self-control and to contribute creatively.38

Directive/Permissive Leadership Styles

Contemplating the central role of problem-solving in management and leadership, Jan P. Muczyk and
Bernard C. Reimann of Cleveland State University offer an interesting perspective on four different
leadership styles (see Figure 7) that revolve around decision-making and implementation processes.39

Figure 7 Leadership Behavior and the Uses of Power Source: Modified from J. P. Muczyk and B. C.
Reimann. 1987. The case for directive leadership. Academy of Management Executive, 1:304.

A directive autocrat retains power, makes unilateral decisions, and closely supervises workers' activities. This
style of leadership is seen as appropriate when circumstances require quick decisions and organizational
members are new, inexperienced, or underqualified. A doctor in charge of a hastily constructed shelter for
victims of a tornado may use this style to command nonmedical volunteers.

   The permissive autocrat mixes his or her use of power by retaining decision-making power but permitting
organizational members to exercise discretion when executing those decisions. This leader behavior is
recommended when decision-making time is limited, when tasks are routine, or when organizational
members have sufficient expertise to determine appropriate role behaviors.

   Also sharing power is the directive democrat, who encourages participative decision-making but retains
the power to direct team members in the execution of their roles. This style is appropriate when followers
have valuable opinions and ideas, but one person needs to coordinate the execution of the ideas. A surgeon
might allow the entire surgical team to participate in developing a plan for a surgical procedure. Once
surgery begins, however, the surgeon is completely in charge.

   Finally, the permissive democrat shares power with group members, soliciting involvement in both
decision-making and execution. This style is appropriate when participation has both informational and
motivational value, when time permits group decision-making, when group members are capable of
improving decision quality, and when followers are capable of exercising self-management in their
performance of work.

   The permissive democratic approach to leadership is characteristic of leadership in high-involvement
organizations. Here, leaders act as facilitators, process consultants, network builders, conflict managers,
inspirationalists, coaches, teachers/mentors, and cheerleaders.40 Such is the role of Ralph Stayer, founder,
owner, and CEO of Johnsonville Foods. He defines himself as his company's philosopher. At Quad/

centers.

1. What are the trait perspectives on leadership?

Ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Chinese scholars were keenly interested in leaders and leadership.
Their writings portray leaders as heroes. Homer, in his poem The Odyssey, portrays Odysseus during and
after the Trojan War as a great leader who had vision and self-confidence. His son Telemachus, under the
tutelage of Mentor, developed his father's courage and leadership skills.41Out of such stories there emerged
the "great man" theory of leadership, and a starting point for the contemporary study of leadership.

   The great man theory of leadership states that some people are born with the necessary attributes
to be great leaders. Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc, Catherine the Great, Napoleon, and
Mahatma Gandhi are cited as naturally great leaders, born with a set of personal qualities that made
them effective leaders. Even today, the belief that truly great leaders are born is common. For example,
Kenneth Labich, writer for Fortune magazine, commented that "the best leaders seem to possess a God-
given spark."42

   During the early 1900s, scholars endeavored to understand leaders and leadership. They wanted to know,
from an organizational perspective, what characteristics leaders hold in common in the hope that people
with these characteristics could be identified, recruited, and placed in key organizational positions. This
gave rise to early research efforts and to what is referred to as the trait approach to leadership. Prompted
by the great man theory of leadership and the emerging interest in understanding what leadership is,
researchers focused on the leader--Who is a leader? What are the distinguishing characteristics of the great
and effective leaders? The great man theory of leadership holds that some people are born with a set of
personal qualities that make truly great leaders. Mahatma Gandhi is often cited as a naturally great leader.

   Leader Trait Research
   Ralph Stogdill, while on the faculty at The Ohio State University, pioneered our modern (late 20th
century) study of leadership.43Scholars taking the trait approach attempted to identify physiological
(appearance, height, and weight), demographic (age, education, and socioeconomic background),
personality (dominance, self-confidence, and aggressiveness), intellective (intelligence, decisiveness,
judgment, and knowledge), task-related (achievement drive, initiative, and persistence), and social
characteristics (sociability and cooperativeness) with leader emergence and leader effectiveness. After
reviewing several hundred studies of leader traits, Stogdill in 1974 described the successful leader this way:
   The [successful] leader is characterized by a strong drive for responsibility and task completion, vigor
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 235

and persistence in pursuit of goals, venturesomeness and originality in problem solving, drive to exercise
initiative in social situations, self-confidence and sense of personal identity, willingness to accept
consequences of decision and action, readiness to absorb interpersonal stress, willingness to tolerate
frustration and delay, ability to influence other person's behavior, and capacity to structure social
interaction systems to the purpose at hand.44

   The last three decades of the 20th century witnessed continued exploration of the relationship between
traits and both leader emergence and leader effectiveness. Edwin Locke from the University of Maryland
and a number of his research associates, in their recent review of the trait research, observed that successful
leaders possess a set of core characteristics that are different from those of other people.45 Although these
core traits do not solely determine whether a person will be a leader--or a successful leader--they are seen
as preconditions that endow people with leadership potential. Among the core traits identified are:

 · Drive--a high level of effort, including a strong desire for achievement as well as high levels of
      ambition, energy, tenacity, and initiative

 · Leadership motivation--an intense desire to lead others
 · Honesty and integrity--a commitment to the truth (nondeceit), where word and deed correspond
 · Self-confidence--an assurance in one's self, one's ideas, and one's ability
 · Cognitive ability--conceptually skilled, capable of exercising good judgment, having strong analytical

      abilities, possessing the capacity to think strategically and multidimensionally
 · Knowledge of the business--a high degree of understanding of the company, industry, and technical

      matters
 · Other traits--charisma, creativity/originality, and flexibility/adaptiveness46

While leaders may be "people with the right stuff," effective leadership requires more than simply possessing
the correct set of motives and traits. Knowledge, skills, ability, vision, strategy, and effective vision
implementation are all necessary for the person who has the "right stuff" to realize their leadership
potential.47 According to Locke, people endowed with these traits engage in behaviors that are associated
with leadership. As followers, people are attracted to and inclined to follow individuals who display, for
example, honesty and integrity, self-confidence, and the motivation to lead.

   Personality psychologists remind us that behavior is a result of an interaction between the person and
the situation--that is, Behavior = f [(Person) (Situation)]. To this, psychologist Walter Mischel adds the
important observation that personality tends to get expressed through an individual's behavior in "weak"
situations and to be suppressed in "strong" situations.48 A strong situation is one with strong behavioral
norms and rules, strong incentives, clear expectations, and rewards for a particular behavior. Our
characterization of the mechanistic organization with its well-defined hierarchy of authority, jobs, and
standard operating procedures exemplifies a strong situation. The organic social system exemplifies a weak
situation. From a leadership perspective, a person's traits play a stronger role in their leader behavior
and ultimately leader effectiveness when the situation permits the expression of their disposition. Thus,
personality traits prominently shape leader behavior in weak situations.

   Finally, about the validity of the "great person approach to leadership": Evidence accumulated to date
does not provide a strong base of support for the notion that leaders are born. Yet, the study of twins
at the University of Minnesota leaves open the possibility that part of the answer might be found in
our genes. Many personality traits and vocational interests (which might be related to one's interest in
assuming responsibility for others and the motivation to lead) have been found to be related to our "genetic
dispositions" as well as to our life experiences.49 Each core trait recently identified by Locke and his
associates traces a significant part of its existence to life experiences. Thus, a person is not born with self-
confidence. Self-confidence is developed, honesty and integrity are a matter of personal choice, motivation
236 | LEADERSHIP

to lead comes from within the individual and is within his control, and knowledge of the business can
be acquired. While cognitive ability does in part find its origin in the genes, it still needs to be developed.
Finally, drive, as a dispositional trait, may also have a genetic component, but it too can be self- and other-
encouraged. It goes without saying that none of these ingredients are acquired overnight.

Behavioral Approaches to Leadership

1. What are the behavioral perspectives on leadership?

The nearly four decades of research that focused on identifying the personal traits associated with the
emergence of leaders and leader effectiveness resulted in two observations. First, leader traits are
important--people who are endowed with the "right stuff" (drive, self-confidence, honesty, and integrity)
are more likely to emerge as leaders and to be effective leaders than individuals who do not possess these
characteristics. Second, traits are only a part of the story. Traits only account for part of why someone
becomes a leader and why they are (or are not) effective leaders.

   Still under the influence of the great man theory of leadership, researchers continued to focus on
the leader in an effort to understand leadership--who emerges and what constitutes effective leadership.
Researchers then began to reason that maybe the rest of the story could be understood by looking at what
it is that leaders do. Thus, we now turn our attention to leader behaviors and the behavioral approaches to
leadership.

   It is now common to think of effective leadership in terms of what leaders do. CEOs and management
consultants agree that effective leaders display trust in their employees, develop a vision, keep their cool,
encourage risk, bring expertise into the work setting, invite dissent, and focus everyone's attention on that
which is important.59 William Arruda, in a Fortune article, noted that "organizations with strong coaching
cultures report their revenue to be above average, compared to their peer group." Sixty-five percent of
employees "from strong coaching cultures rated themselves as highly engaged," compared to 13 percent
of employees worldwide."60Jonathan Anthony calls himself an intrapreneur and corporate disorganizer,
because same-old, same-old comms practices are dying in front of our eyes.61 Apple founder Steve Jobs
believed that the best leaders are coaches and team cheerleaders. Similar views have been frequently echoed
by management consultant Tom Peters.

   During the late 1940s, two major research programs--The Ohio State University and the University of
Michigan leadership studies--were launched to explore leadership from a behavioral perspective.

The Ohio State University Studies

A group of Ohio State University researchers, under the direction of Ralph Stogdill, began an extensive and
systematic series of studies to identify leader behaviors associated with effective group performance. Their
results identified two major sets of leader behaviors: consideration and initiating structure.

   Consideration is the "relationship-oriented" behavior of a leader. It is instrumental in creating and
maintaining good relationships (that is, addressing the group's maintenance needs) with organizational
members. Consideration behaviors include being supportive and friendly, representing people's interests,
communicating openly with group members, recognizing them, respecting their ideas, and sharing concern
for their feelings.

   Initiating structure involves "task-oriented" leader behaviors. It is instrumental in the efficient use
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 237

of resources to attain organizational goals, thereby addressing the group's task needs. Initiating structure
behaviors include scheduling work, deciding what is to be done (and how and when to do it), providing
direction to organizational members, planning, coordinating, problem-solving, maintaining standards of
performance, and encouraging the use of uniform procedures.

   After consideration and initiating structure behaviors were first identified, many leaders believed that
they had to behave one way or the other. If they initiated structure, they could not be considerate, and vice
versa. It did not take long, however, to recognize that leaders can simultaneously display any combination
of both behaviors.

   The Ohio State studies are important because they identified two critical categories of behavior that
distinguish one leader from another. Both consideration and initiating structure behavior can significantly
impact work attitudes and behaviors. Unfortunately, the effects of consideration and initiating structure are
not consistent from situation to situation.62 In some of the organizations studied, for example, high levels
of initiating structure increased performance. In other organizations, the amount of initiating structure
seemed to make little difference. Although most organizational members reported greater satisfaction when
leaders acted considerately, consideration behavior appeared to have no clear effect on performance.

   Initially, these mixed findings were disappointing to researchers and managers alike. It had been hoped
that a profile of the most effective leader behaviors could be identified so that leaders could be trained in the
best ways to behave. Research made clear, however, that there is no one best style of leader behavior for all
situations.

The University of Michigan Studies

At about the same time that the Ohio State studies were underway, researchers at the University of
Michigan also began to investigate leader behaviors. As at Ohio State, the Michigan researchers attempted
to identify behavioral elements that differentiated effective from ineffective leaders.63

   The two types of leader behavior that stand out in these studies are job centered and organizational
member centered. Job-centered behaviors are devoted to supervisory functions, such as planning, scheduling,
coordinating work activities, and providing the resources needed for task performance. Employee-member-
centered behaviors include consideration and support for organizational members. These dimensions of
behavior, of course, correspond closely to the dimensions of initiating structure and consideration
identified at Ohio State. The similarity of the findings from two independent groups of researchers added
to their credibility. As the Ohio State researchers had done, the Michigan researchers also found that any
combination of the two behaviors was possible.

   The studies at Michigan are significant because they reinforce the importance of leader behavior. They
also provide the basis for later theories that identify specific, effective matches of work situations and leader
behaviors. Subsequent research at Michigan and elsewhere has found additional behaviors associated with
effective leadership: support, work facilitation, goal emphasis, and interaction facilitation.64

   These four behaviors are important to the successful functioning of the group in that support and
interaction facilitation contribute to the group's maintenance needs, and goal emphasis and work
facilitation contribute to the group's task needs. The Michigan researchers also found that these four
behaviors do not need to be brought to the group by the leader. In essence, the leader's real job is to set the
tone and create the climate that ensure these critical behaviors are present.65

The Leadership Grid®

Much of the credit for disseminating knowledge about important leader behaviors must go to Robert
R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton, who developed a method for classifying styles of leadership compatible
with many of the ideas from the Ohio State and Michigan studies.66 In their classification scheme, concern
238 | LEADERSHIP

for results (production) emphasizes output, cost effectiveness, and (in for-profit organizations) a concern
for profits. Concern for people involves promoting working relationships and paying attention to issues
of importance to group members. As shown in Figure 9, the Leadership Grid® demonstrates that any
combination of these two leader concerns is possible, and five styles of leadership are highlighted here.

Figure 9 Blake and Mouton's Managerial Grid® Source: Adapted from R. McKee and B. Carlson.
1999. The Power to Change, p.16.
Blake and Mouton contend that the sound (contribute and commit) leader (a high concern for results
and people, or 9,9) style is universally the most effective.67 While the Leadership Grid® is appealing and
well structured, research to date suggests that there is no universally effective style of leadership (9,9 or
otherwise).68 There are, however, well-identified situations in which a 9,9 style is unlikely to be effective.
Organizational members of high-involvement organizations who have mastered their job duties require
little production-oriented leader behavior. Likewise, there is little time for people-oriented behavior during
an emergency. Finally, evidence suggests that the "high-high" style may be effective when the situation calls
for high levels of initiating structure. Under these conditions, the initiation of structure is more acceptable,
favorably affecting follower satisfaction and performance, when the leader is also experienced as warm,
supportive, and considerate.69

Situational (Contingency) Approaches to Leadership

1. What are the situational perspectives on leadership?

As early as 1948, Ralph Stogdill stated that "the qualities, characteristics, and skills required in a leader are
determined to a large extent by the demands of the situation in which he is to function as a leader."70 In
addition, it had been observed that two major leader behaviors, initiating structure and consideration,
didn't always lead to equally positive outcomes. That is, there are times when initiating structure results in
performance increases and follower satisfaction, and there are times when the results are just the opposite.
Contradictory findings such as this lead researchers to ask "Under what conditions are the results positive
in nature?" and "When and why are they negative at other times?" Obviously, situational differences and
key contingencies are at work.

   Several theories have been advanced to address this issue. These are Fiedler's contingency theory of
leadership, the path-goal theory of leader effectiveness, Hersey and Blanchard's life cycle theory, cognitive
resource theory, the decision tree, and the decision process theory.71 We explore two of the better-known
situational theories of leadership, Fred Fiedler's contingency model and Robert J. House's path-goal theory,
here. Victor Vroom, Phillip Yetton, and Arthur Jago's decision tree model also applies.

Fiedler's Contingency Model

One of the earliest, best-known, and most controversial situation-contingent leadership theories was set
forth by Fred E. Fiedler from the University of Washington.72 This theory is known as the contingency
theory of leadership. According to Fiedler, organizations attempting to achieve group effectiveness
through leadership must assess the leader according to an underlying trait, assess the situation faced by the
leader, and construct a proper match between the two.

The Leader's Trait

Leaders are asked about their least-preferred coworker (LPC), the person with whom they least like to
work. The most popular interpretation of the LPC score is that it reflects a leader's underlying disposition
toward others--for example: pleasant/unpleasant, cold/warm, friendly/unfriendly, and untrustworthy/
trustworthy. (You can examine your own LPC score by completing the LPC self-assessment on the
following page.)

   Fiedler states that leaders with high LPC scores are relationship oriented--they need to develop and
maintain close interpersonal relationships. They tend to evaluate their least-preferred coworkers in fairly
favorable terms. Task accomplishment is a secondary need to this type of leader and becomes important only
after the need for relationships is reasonably well satisfied. In contrast, leaders with low LPC scores tend to
evaluate the individuals with whom they least like to work fairly negatively. They are task-oriented people,
and only after tasks have been accomplished are low-LPC leaders likely to work on establishing good social
and interpersonal relations.

The Situational Factor

Some situations favor leaders more than others do. To Fiedler, situational favorableness is the degree to
which leaders have control and influence and therefore feel that they can determine the outcomes of a group
240 | LEADERSHIP

interaction.73 Several years later, Fiedler changed his situational factor from situational favorability to
situational control--where situational control essentially refers to the degree to which a leader can influence
the group process.74 Three factors work together to determine how favorable a situation is to a leader.
In order of importance, they are (1) leader-member relations--the degree of the group's acceptance of the
leader, their ability to work well together, and members' level of loyalty to the leader; (2) task structure--the
degree to which the task specifies a detailed, unambiguous goal and how to achieve it; and (3) position
power--a leader's direct ability to influence group members. The situation is most favorable for a leader
when the relationship between the leader and group members is good, when the task is highly structured,
and when the leader's position power is strong (cell 1 in Figure 10). The least-favorable situation occurs
under poor leader-member relations, an unstructured task, and weak position power (cell 8).

and M. M. Chemers. 1974. Leadership and effective management. Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman.

Leader-Situation Matches

Some combinations of leaders and situations work well; others do not. In search of the best combinations,
Fiedler examined a large number of leadership situations. He argued that most leaders have a relatively
unchangeable or dominant style, so organizations need to design job situations to fit the leader.75

   While the model has not been fully tested and tests have often produced mixed or contradictory
findings,76 Fiedler's research indicates that relationship-oriented (high-LPC) leaders are much more
effective under conditions of intermediate favorability than under either highly favorable or highly
unfavorable situations. Fiedler attributes the success of relationship-oriented leaders in situations with
intermediate favorability to the leader's nondirective, permissive attitude; a more directive attitude could
lead to anxiety in followers, conflict in the group, and a lack of cooperation.

   For highly favorable and unfavorable situations, task-oriented leaders (those with a low LPC) are very
effective. As tasks are accomplished, a task-oriented leader allows the group to perform its highly structured
tasks without imposing more task-directed behavior. The job gets done without the need for the leader's
direction. Under unfavorable conditions, task-oriented behaviors, such as setting goals, detailing work
methods, and guiding and controlling work behaviors, move the group toward task accomplishment.

   As might be expected, leaders with mid-range LPC scores can be more effective in a wider range of
situations than high- or low-LPC leaders.77 Under conditions of low favorability, for example, a middle-
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 241

LPC leader can be task oriented to achieve performance, but show consideration for and allow
organizational members to proceed on their own under conditions of high situational favorability.

   Controversy over the Theory
   Although Fiedler's theory often identifies appropriate leader-situation matches and has received broad
support, it is not without critics. Some note that it characterizes leaders through reference to their attitudes
or personality traits (LPC) while it explains the leader's effectiveness through their behaviors--those with a
particular trait will behave in a particular fashion. The theory fails to make the connection between the least-
preferred coworker attitude and subsequent behaviors. In addition, some tests of the model have produced
mixed or contradictory findings.78 Finally, what is the true meaning of the LPC score--exactly what is
being revealed by a person who sees their least-preferred coworker in positive or negative terms? Robert J.
House and Ram N. Aditya recently noted that, in spite of the criticisms, there has been substantial support
for Fiedler's theory.79

Path-Goal Theory

Robert J. House and Martin Evans, while on the faculty at the University of Toronto, developed a useful
leadership theory. Like Fiedler's, it asserts that the type of leadership needed to enhance organizational
effectiveness depends on the situation in which the leader is placed. Unlike Fiedler, however, House and
Evans focus on the leader's observable behavior. Thus, managers can either match the situation to the leader
or modify the leader's behavior to fit the situation.

   The model of leadership advanced by House and Evans is called the path-goal theory of
leadership because it suggests that an effective leader provides organizational members with a path to a
valued goal. According to House, the motivational function of the leader consists of increasing personal
payoffs to organizational members for work-goal attainment, and making the path to these payoffs easier
to travel by clarifying it, reducing roadblocks and pitfalls, and increasing the opportunities for personal
satisfaction en route.80

   Effective leaders therefore provide rewards that are valued by organizational members. These rewards
may be pay, recognition, promotions, or any other item that gives members an incentive to work hard to
achieve goals. Effective leaders also give clear instructions so that ambiguities about work are reduced and
followers understand how to do their jobs effectively. They provide coaching, guidance, and training so
that followers can perform the task expected of them. They also remove barriers to task accomplishment,
correcting shortages of materials, inoperative machinery, or interfering policies.

   An Appropriate Match
   According to the path-goal theory, the challenge facing leaders is basically twofold. First, they must
analyze situations and identify the most appropriate leadership style. For example, experienced employees
who work on a highly structured assembly line don't need a leader to spend much time telling them how
to do their jobs--they already know this. The leader of an archeological expedition, though, may need to
spend a great deal of time telling inexperienced laborers how to excavate and care for the relics they uncover.
   Second, leaders must be flexible enough to use different leadership styles as appropriate. To be effective,
leaders must engage in a wide variety of behaviors. Without an extensive repertoire of behaviors at their
disposal, a leader's effectiveness is limited.81 All team members will not, for example, have the same need
for autonomy. The leadership style that motivates organizational members with strong needs for autonomy
(participative leadership) is different from that which motivates and satisfies members with weaker
autonomy needs (directive leadership). The degree to which leadership behavior matches situational factors
will determine members' motivation, satisfaction, and performance (see Figure 11).82

Behavior Dimensions
   According to path-goal theory, there are four important dimensions of leader behavior, each of which is

suited to a particular set of situational demands.83

 · Supportive leadership--At times, effective leaders demonstrate concern for the well-being and
      personal needs of organizational members. Supportive leaders are friendly, approachable, and
      considerate to individuals in the workplace. Supportive leadership is especially effective when an
      organizational member is performing a boring, stressful, frustrating, tedious, or unpleasant task. If a
      task is difficult and a group member has low self-esteem, supportive leadership can reduce some of
      the person's anxiety, increase his confidence, and increase satisfaction and determination as well.

 · Directive leadership--At times, effective leaders set goals and performance expectations, let
      organizational members know what is expected, provide guidance, establish rules and procedures to
      guide work, and schedule and coordinate the activities of members. Directive leadership is called for
      when role ambiguity is high. Removing uncertainty and providing needed guidance can increase
      members' effort, job satisfaction, and job performance.

 · Participative leadership--At times, effective leaders consult with group members about job-related
      activities and consider their opinions and suggestions when making decisions. Participative leadership
      is effective when tasks are unstructured. Participative leadership is used to great effect when leaders
      need help in identifying work procedures and where followers have the expertise to provide this help.

 · Achievement-oriented leadership--At times, effective leaders set challenging goals, seek improvement
      in performance, emphasize excellence, and demonstrate confidence in organizational members'
      ability to attain high standards. Achievement-oriented leaders thus capitalize on members' needs for
      achievement and use goal-setting theory to great advantage.

Substitutes for and Neutralizers of Leadership

1. What does the concept "substitute for leadership" mean?

Several factors have been discovered that can substitute for or neutralize the effects of leader behavior
(see Table 1).89 Substitutes for leadership behavior can clarify role expectations, motivate organizational
members, or satisfy members (making it unnecessary for the leader to attempt to do so). In some cases,
these substitutes supplement the behavior of a leader. Sometimes it is a group member's characteristics that
make leadership less necessary, as when a master craftsperson or highly skilled worker performs up to his
or her own high standards without needing outside prompting. Sometimes the task's characteristics take
over, as when the work itself--solving an interesting problem or working on a familiar job--is intrinsically
satisfying. Sometimes the characteristics of the organization make leadership less necessary, as when work
rules are so clear and specific that workers know exactly what they must do without help from the leader
(see An Inside Look at flat management structure and the orchestra with no leader).

  5. Leader located apart from subordinates with only limited
  communication possible

   Neutralizers of leadership, on the other hand, are not helpful; they prevent leaders from acting as
they wish. A computer-paced assembly line, for example, prevents a leader from using initiating structure
244 | LEADERSHIP

behavior to pace the line. A union contract that specifies that workers be paid according to seniority
prevents a leader from dispensing merit-based pay. Sometimes, of course, neutralizers can be beneficial.
Union contracts, for example, clarify disciplinary proceedings and identify the responsibilities of both
management and labor. Leaders must be aware of the presence of neutralizers and their effects so that
they can eliminate troublesome neutralizers or take advantage of any potential benefits that accompany
them (such as the clarity of responsibilities provided by a union contract). If a leader's effectiveness is being
neutralized by a poor communication system, for example, the leader might try to remove the neutralizer by
developing (or convincing the organization to develop) a more effective system.

   Followers differ considerably in their focus of attention while at work, thereby affecting the effectiveness
of the act of leadership. Focus of attention is an employee's cognitive orientation while at work. It reflects
what and how strongly an individual thinks about various objects, events, or phenomena while physically
present at work. Focus of attention reflects an individual difference in that not all individuals have the same
cognitive orientation while at work--some think a great deal about their job, their coworkers, their leader,
or off-the-job factors, while others daydream.90 An employee's focus of attention has both "trait" and
"state" qualities. For example, there is a significant amount of minute-by-minute variation in an employee's
focus of attention (the "state" component), and there is reasonable consistency in the categories of events
that employees think about while they are at work (the "trait" component).

   Research suggests that the more followers focus on off-job (nonleader) factors, the less they will react
to the leader's behaviors. Thus, a strong focus on one's life "away from work" (for example, time with
family and friends) tends to neutralize the motivational, attitudinal, and/or behavioral effects associated
with any particular leader behavior. It has also been observed, however, that a strong focus on the leader,
either positive or negative, enhances the impact that the leader's behaviors have on followers.91

     Examples

     MANAGERIAL LEADERSHIP
     You Are Now the Leader
     Leading and managing are two very different things. Being a manager means something more
     than gaining authority or charge over former colleagues. With the title does come the power to
     affect company outcomes, but it also comes with something more: the power to shape the
     careers and personal growth of subordinates.
     According to Steve Keating, a senior manager at the Toro Company, it is important not to
     assume that being made a manager automatically makes you a leader. Rather, being a manager
     means having the opportunity to lead. Enterprises need managers to guide processes, but the
     employees--the people--need a leader. Keating believes that leaders need a mindset that
     emphasizes people, and the leader's job is to help the people in the organization to be
     successful. According to Keating, "If you don't care for people, you can't lead them" (Hakim 2017
     n.p.).
     For someone who has been promoted over his peers, ground rules are essential. "Promotion
     doesn't mean the end of friendship but it does change it," according to Keating. If a peer has
     been promoted, rather than grouse and give in to envy, it is important to step back and look at
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 245

     the new manager; take a hard look at why the peer was promoted and what skill or
     characteristic made you a less appealing fit for the position (Hakim 2017).
     Carol Walker, president of Prepared to Lead, a management consulting firm, advises new
     managers to develop a job philosophy. She urges new managers to develop a core philosophy
     that provides a guide to the day-to-day job of leading. She urges managers to build up the
     people they are leading and work as a "servant leader." The manager's perspective should be on
     employee growth and success. Leaders must bear in mind that employees don't work for the
     manager; they work for the organization--and for themselves. Managers coordinate this
     relationship; they are not the center of it. Work should not be assigned haphazardly, but with
     the employee's skills and growth in mind. "An employee who understands why she has been
     asked to do something is far more likely to assume true ownership for the assignment," Walker
     says (Yakowicz 2015 n.p.). A leader's agenda should be on employee success, not personal glory.
     Employees are more receptive when they recognize that their leader is working not for their
     own success, but for the employee's success.
     A survey from HighGround revealed one important item that most new managers and even
     many seasoned managers overlook: asking for feedback. Everyone has room for growth, even
     managers. Traditional management dictates a top-down style in which managers review
     subordinates. But many companies have found it beneficial to turn things around and ask
     employees, "How can I be a better manager?" Of course, this upward review only works if
     employees believe that their opinion will be heard. Managers need to carefully cultivate a
     rapport where employees don't fear reprisals for negative feedback. Listening to criticism from
     those you are leading builds trust and helps ensure that as a manager, you are providing the
     sort of leadership that employees need to be successful (Kauflin 2017). Showing respect and
     caring for employees by asking this simple question is inspiring--an important aspect of
     leadership itself. Whether asking for feedback or focusing on an employee's fit with a particular
     job description, a leader helps guide employees through the day-to-day, builds a positive
     culture, and helps employees improve their skills.

Transformational, Visionary, and Charismatic Leadership

1. What are the characteristics of transactional, transformational, and charismatic leadership?

Many organizations struggling with the need to manage chaos, to undergo a culture change, to empower
organizational members, and to restructure have looked for answers in "hiring the right leader." Many have
246 | LEADERSHIP

come to believe that the transformational, visionary, and charismatic leader represents the style of leadership
needed to move organizations through chaos.

The Transformational and Visionary Leader

Leaders who subscribe to the notion that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" are often described as transactional
leaders. They are extremely task oriented and instrumental in their approach, frequently looking for
incentives that will induce their followers into a desired course of action.92 These reciprocal exchanges
take place in the context of a mutually interdependent relationship between the leader and the follower,
frequently resulting in interpersonal bonding.93 The transactional leader moves a group toward task
accomplishment by initiating structure and by offering an incentive in exchange for desired behaviors.
The transformational leader, on the other hand, moves and changes (fixes) things "in a big way"! Unlike
transactional leaders, they don't cause change by offering inducements. Instead, they inspire others to
action through their personal values, vision, passion, and belief in and commitment to the
mission.94Through charisma (idealized influence), individualized consideration (a focus on the
development of the follower), intellectual stimulation (questioning assumptions and challenging the status
quo), and/or inspirational motivation (articulating an appealing vision), transformational leaders move
others to follow.

   The transformational leader is also referred to as a visionary leader. Visionary leaders are those who
influence others through an emotional and/or intellectual attraction to the leader's dreams of what "can
be." Vision links a present and future state, energizes and generates commitment, provides meaning for
action, and serves as a standard against which to assess performance.95 Evidence indicates that vision is
positively related to follower attitudes and performance.96 As pointed out by Warren Bennis, a vision is
effective only to the extent that the leader can communicate it in such a way that others come to internalize
it as their own.97

   As people, transformational leaders are engaging. They are characterized by extroversion, agreeableness,
and openness to experience.98 They energize others. They increase followers' awareness of the importance
of the designated outcome.99 They motivate individuals to transcend their own self-interest for the benefit
of the team and inspire organizational members to self-manage (become self-leaders).100 Transformational
leaders move people to focus on higher-order needs (self-esteem and self-actualization). When organizations
face a turbulent environment, intense competition, products that may die early, and the need to move fast,
managers cannot rely solely on organizational structure to guide organizational activity. In these situations,
transformational leadership can motivate followers to be fully engaged and inspired, to internalize the goals
and values of the organization, and to move forward with dogged determination!

   Transformational leadership is positively related to follower satisfaction, performance, and acts of
citizenship. These effects result from the fact that transformational leader behaviors elicit trust and
perceptions of procedural justice, which in turn favorably impact follower satisfaction and
performance.101 As R. Pillai, C. Schriesheim, and E. Williams note, "when followers perceive that they
can influence the outcomes of decisions that are important to them and that they are participants in an
equitable relationship with their leader, their perceptions of procedural justice [and trust] are likely to
be enhanced."102 Trust and experiences of organizational justice promote leader effectiveness, follower
satisfaction, motivation, performance, and citizenship behaviors.

Charismatic Leadership

Ronald Reagan, Jesse Jackson, and Queen Elizabeth I have something in common with Martin Luther
King Jr., Indira Gandhi, and Winston Churchill. The effectiveness of these leaders originates in part in
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 247

their charisma, a special magnetic charm and appeal that arouses loyalty and enthusiasm. Each exerted
considerable personal influence to bring about major events.

   It is difficult to differentiate the charismatic and the transformational leader. True transformational
leaders may achieve their results through the magnetism of their personality. In this case, the two types of
leaders are essentially one and the same, yet it is important to note that not all transformational leaders have
a personal "aura."

   Sociologist Max Weber evidenced an interest in charismatic leadership in the 1920s, calling charismatic
leaders people who possess legitimate power that arises from "exceptional sanctity, heroism, or exemplary
character."103 Charismatic leaders "single-handedly" effect changes even in very large organizations. Their
personality is a powerful force, and the relationship that they forge with their followers is extremely strong.

Figure 12 Travis Kalanick Travis Kalanick was a praised CEO of Uber who managed to increase the value
of the company to over $60 billion. He was forced to resign after taking a leave of absence and having
several key executives resign due to allegations of creating a hostile and unethical workplace.

   The charismatic leadership phenomenon involves a complex interplay between the attributes of the
leader and followers' needs, values, beliefs, and perceptions.104 At its extreme, leader-follower relationships
are characterized by followers' unquestioning acceptance; trust in the leader's beliefs; affection; willing
obedience to, emulation of, and identification with the leader; emotional involvement with his mission;
and feelings of self-efficacy directed toward the leader's mission.105 This can work to better the welfare
of individuals, such as when Lee Iacocca saved thousands of jobs through his dramatic turnaround of
a failing corporate giant, the Chrysler Corporation. It also can be disastrous, as when David Koresh led
dozens and dozens of men, women, and children to their fiery death in Waco, Texas. Individuals working
for charismatic leaders often have higher task performance, greater task satisfaction, and lower levels of
role conflict than those working for leaders with considerate or structuring behaviors.106 What are the
characteristics of these people who can exert such a strong influence over their followers? Charismatic
leaders have a strong need for power and the tendency to rely heavily on referent power as their primary
power base.107 Charismatic leaders also are extremely self-confident and convinced of the rightness of their
248 | LEADERSHIP

own beliefs and ideals. This self-confidence and strength of conviction make people trust the charismatic
leader's judgment, unconditionally following the leader's mission and directives for action.108 The result is
a strong bond between leader and followers, a bond built primarily around the leader's personality.

   Although there have been many effective charismatic leaders, those who succeed the most have coupled
their charismatic capabilities with behaviors consistent with the same leadership principles followed by
other effective leaders. Those who do not add these other dimensions still attract followers but do not meet
organizational goals as effectively as they could. They are (at least for a time) the pied pipers of the business
world, with lots of followers but no constructive direction.

     Examples

     ETHICS IN PRACTICE
     Uber's Need for an Ethical Leader
     Almost since its initial founding in 2009 as a luxury car service for the San Francisco area,
     controversy has followed Uber. Many complaints are against the tactics employed by the
     company's founder and former CEO, Travis Kalanick, but the effects are found throughout the
     business and its operations.
     In 2009, UberBlack was a "black car" service, a high-end driving service that cost more than a
     taxi but less than hiring a private driver for the night. It wasn't until 2012 that the company
     launched UberX, the taxi-esque service most people think of today when they say "Uber." The
     UberX service contracted with private drivers who provided rides in their personal vehicles. A
     customer would use Uber's smartphone app to request the ride, and a private driver would
     show up. Originally launched in San Francisco, the service spread quickly, and by 2017, Uber was
     in 633 cities. The service was hailed by many as innovative and the free market's answer to
     high-priced and sometimes unreliable taxi services. But Uber has not been without its critics,
     both inside and outside of the company.
     In 2013, as the UberX service spread, some UberBlack drivers protested at the company's
     headquarters complaining about poor company benefits and pay. They also claimed that
     competition from the newly launched UberX service was cutting into their sales and
     undermining job security. Kalanick rebuffed the protests, basically calling the complaints sour
     grapes: most of the protestors had been laid off earlier for poor service (Lawler 2013).
     Controversy also arose over the use of contract drivers rather than full-time employees.
     Contractors complained about a lack of benefits and low wages. Competitors, especially taxi
     services, complained that they were being unfairly undercut because Uber didn't have to abide
     by the same screening process and costs that traditional yellow taxi companies did. Some
     municipalities agreed, arguing further than Uber's lack of or insufficient screening of drivers put
     passengers at risk.
     Uber quickly generated a reputation as a bully and Kalanick as an unethical leader (Ann 2016).
     The company has been accused of covering up cases of sexual assault, and Kalanick himself has
     been quoted as calling the service "Boob-er," a reference to using the service to pick up women
     (Ann 2016). Uber has been criticized for its recruiting practices; in particular, it has been accused
     of bribing drivers working for competitors to switch over and drive for Uber (Ann 2016).The

     company was also caught making false driver requests for competing companies and then
     canceling the order. The effect was to waste the other driver's time and make it more difficult
     for customers to secure rides on the competing service (D'Orazio 2014). Susan J. Fowler, former
     site reliability engineer at Uber, went public with cases of outright sexual harassment within
     Uber (Fowler 2017). Former employees described Uber's corporate culture as an "a**hole culture"
     and a "`Hobbesian jungle' where you can never get ahead unless someone else dies." (Wong
     2017) One employee described a leadership that encouraged a company practice of developing
     incomplete solutions for the purpose of beating the competitor to market. Fowler went so far as
     to compare the experience to Game of Thrones, and other former employees even consider
     "making it" at Uber a black mark on a resume (Wong 2017).
     In terms of social acrimony and PR disasters, arguably caused or even encouraged by leadership,
     Uber's rise to notoriety has arguably been more bad than good. In June 2017, Kalanick made one
     too many headlines and agreed to step down as the company's CEO.
     Questions

        1. In the summer of 2017, Transport of London (TfL) began proceedings to revoke Uber's
             permit to operate in London. How do think Uber's poor corporate reputation may have
             been a factor in TfL's thinking?

       2. What steps do you think Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, needs to take to repair
             Uber's reputation?

       3. Despite Uber's apparent success in launching in multiple markets, it continues to post
             quarterly losses in the millions and shareholders effectively subsidize 59 percent of every
             ride (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-profitability/true-price-of-an-uber-ride-in-
             question-as-investors-assess-firms-value-idUSKCN1B3103). How is this an outworking of
             Uber's overall corporate culture?

Leadership Needs in the 21st Century

1. How do different approaches and styles of leadership impact what is needed now?

Frequent headlines in popular business magazines like Fortune and Business Week call our attention to a
major movement going on in the world of business. Organizations are being reengineered and restructured,
and network, virtual, and modular corporations are emerging. People talk about the transnational
organization, the boundaryless company, the post-hierarchical organization. By the end of the decade, the
organizations that we will be living in, working with, and competing against are likely to be vastly different
from what we know today.

   The transition will not be easy; uncertainty tends to breed resistance. We are driven by linear and rational
thinking, which leads us to believe that "we can get there from here" by making some incremental changes
250 | LEADERSHIP

in who we are and what we are currently doing. Existing paradigms frame our perceptions and guide our
thinking. Throwing away paradigms that have served us well in the past does not come easily.

   A look back tells most observers that the past decade has been characterized by rapid change, intense
competition, an explosion of new technologies, chaos, turbulence, and high levels of uncertainty. A quick
scan of today's business landscape suggests that this trend is not going away anytime soon. According
to Professor Jay A. Conger from Canada's McGill University, "In times of great transition, leadership
becomes critically important. Leaders, in essence, offer us a pathway of confidence and direction as we
move through seeming chaos. The magnitude of today's changes will demand not only more leadership,
but newer forms of leadership."109

   According to Conger, two major forces are defining for us the genius of the next generation of leaders.
The first force is the organization's external environment. Global competitiveness is creating some unique
leadership demands. The second force is the growing diversity in organizations' internal environments.
Diversity will significantly change the relationship between organizational members, work, and the
organization in challenging, difficult, and also very positive ways.

   What will the leaders of tomorrow be like? Professor Conger suggests that the effective leaders of the
21st century will have to be many things.110 They will have to be strategic opportunists; only organizational
visionaries will find strategic opportunities before competitors. They will have to be globally aware; with
80 percent of today's organizations facing significant foreign competition, knowledge of foreign markets,
global economics, and geopolitics is crucial. They will have to be capable of managing a highly decentralized
organization; movement toward the high-involvement organization will accelerate as the environmental
demands for organizational speed, flexibility, learning, and leanness increase. They will have be sensitive
to diversity; during the first few years of the 21st century, fewer than 10 percent of those entering the
workforce in North America will be white, Anglo-Saxon males, and the incoming women, minorities,
and immigrants will bring with them a very different set of needs and concerns. They will have to
be interpersonally competent; a highly diverse workforce will necessitate a leader who is extremely aware of
and sensitive to multicultural expectations and needs. They will have to be builders of an organizational
community; work and organizations will serve as a major source of need fulfillment, and in the process
leaders will be called on to help build this community in such a way that organizational members develop a
sense of ownership for the organization and its mission.

   Finally, it is important to note that leadership theory construction and empirical inquiry are an ongoing
endeavor. While the study of traits, behavior, and contingency models of leadership provide us with a
great deal of insight into leadership, the mosaic is far from complete. During the past 15 years, several new
theories of leadership have emerged; among them are leader-member exchange theory, implicit leadership
theory, neocharismatic theory, value-based theory of leadership, and visionary leadership,111 each of which
over time will add to our bank of knowledge about leaders and the leadership process.

   Leaders of the 21st-century organization have a monumental challenge awaiting them and a wealth
of self-enriching and fulfilling opportunities. The challenge and rewards awaiting effective leaders are
awesome!

Summary of Learning Outcomes

13.1 The Nature of Leadership
252 | LEADERSHIP

1. What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?

Leadership is a primary vehicle for fulfilling the directing function of management. Because of its
importance, theorists, researchers, and practitioners have devoted a tremendous amount of attention and
energy to unlocking the secrets of effective leadership. They have kept at this search for perhaps a greater
period of time than for any other single issue related to management.

   13.2 The Leadership Process

1. What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?

Organizations typically have both formal and informal leaders. Their leadership is effective for virtually
identical reasons. Leadership and management are not the same. Although effective leadership is a necessary
part of effective management, the overall management role is much larger than leadership alone. Managers
plan, organize, direct, and control. As leaders, they are engaged primarily in the directing function.

   13.3 Leader Emergence

1. How do leaders influence and move their followers to action?

There are many diverse perspectives on leadership. Some managers treat leadership primarily as an exercise
of power. Others believe that a particular belief and attitude structure makes for effective leaders. Still others
believe it is possible to identify a collection of leader traits that produces a leader who should be universally
effective in any leadership situation. Even today, many believe that a profile of behaviors can universally
guarantee successful leadership. Unfortunately, such simple solutions fall short of the reality.

   13.4 The Trait Approach to Leadership

1. What are the trait perspectives on leadership?

13.5 Behavioral Approaches to Leadership

1. What are the behavioral perspectives on leadership?

It is clear that effective leaders are endowed with the "right stuff," yet this "stuff" is only a precondition
to effective leadership. Leaders need to connect with their followers and bring the right configuration of
knowledge, skills, ability, vision, and strategy to the situational demands confronting the group.

   13.6 Situational (Contingency) Approaches to Leadership

1. What are the situational perspectives on leadership?

We now know that there is no one best way to be an effective leader in all circumstances. Leaders need
to recognize that how they choose to lead will affect the nature of their followers' compliance with their
influence tactics, and ultimately impacts motivation, satisfaction, performance, and group effectiveness.
In addition, the nature of the situation--contextual demands and characteristics of the follower--dictates
the type of leadership that is likely to be effective. Fiedler focuses on leader traits and argues that the
favorableness of the leadership situation dictates the type of leadership approach needed. He recommends
selecting leaders to match the situation or changing the situation to match the leader. Path-goal theory
focuses on leader behavior that can be adapted to the demands of a particular work environment and
organizational members' characteristics. Path-goal theorists believe both that leaders can be matched with
the situation and that the situation can be changed to match leaders. Together, these theories make clear
                                                                    LEADERSHIP | 253

that leadership is effective when the characteristics and behavior of the leader match the demands of the
situation.

   13.7 Substitutes for and Neutralizers of Leadership

1. What does the concept of "substitute for leadership" mean?

Characteristics of followers, tasks, and organizations can substitute for or neutralize many leader behaviors.
Leaders must remain aware of these factors, no matter which perspective on leadership they adopt. Such
awareness allows managers to use substitutes for, and neutralizers of, leadership to their benefit, rather than
be stymied by their presence.

   13.8 Transformational, Visionary, and Charismatic Leadership

1. What are the characteristics of transactional, transformational, and charismatic leadership?

In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in key leader traits and behaviors. As organizations face
increasing amounts of chaos in their external environments, searches for "the right leader" who can bring
about major organizational transformations has intensified. This search once again focuses our attention on
a set of "key" motives, knowledge, skills, and personality attributes. Emerging from this search has been the
identification of the charismatic and transformational leader.

   13.9 Leadership Needs in the 21st Century

1. How do different approaches and styles of leadership impact what is needed now?

Leadership in the high-involvement organization differs dramatically from that in the traditional and
control-oriented organization. Leaders external to the team have as one of their primary roles empowering
group members and the teams themselves to self-lead and self-manage. Leaders internal to the team are
peers; they work alongside and simultaneously facilitate planning, organizing, directing, controlling, and
the execution of the team's work.

   Although we know a great deal about the determinants of effective leadership, we have much to learn.
Each theory presented in this chapter is put into practice by managers every day. None provides the
complete answer to what makes leaders effective, but each has something important to offer.

   Finally, our understanding of leadership has many shortcomings and limitations. The existing literature
is largely based on observations from a Western industrialized context. The extent to which our theories of
leadership are bound by our culture, limiting generalization to other cultures, is largely unknown. Cross-
cultural leadership research will no doubt intensify as the global economy becomes an ever more dominant
force in the world.

 Group Skills Application Exercises

 1. Identify a charismatic leader and a leader with little charisma. What are the traits and skills that allow
       them to succeed in their roles? How can you incorporate the traits that allow them to be successful in
       their roles into the skills you will need to have in a leadership position?

 2. You have just taken a leadership position where 40 percent of the workforce telecommutes. You want
       to encourage teamwork and want to ensure that telecommuting is not hurting teamwork. What is
       your plan to discover how things are working and how to communicate your desire to have effective
       teamwork?

 3. You are at a meeting, and during the meeting someone on the team addresses their manager and
       points out a crucial mistake that could doom the project. The person says that their manager should
       have caught it and because of that should resign. As a leader of the group, how would you deal with
       the subordinate, the manager, and communication with the entire team?

CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE

From the Noba Project By Jerry M. Burger Santa Clara University

We often change our attitudes and behaviors to match the attitudes and behaviors of the people around
us. One reason for this conformity is a concern about what other people think of us. This process was
demonstrated in a classic study in which college students deliberately gave wrong answers to a simple visual
judgment task rather than go against the group. Another reason we conform to the norm is because other
people often have information we do not, and relying on norms can be a reasonable strategy when we are
uncertain about how we are supposed to act. Unfortunately, we frequently misperceive how the typical
person acts, which can contribute to problems such as the excessive binge drinking often seen in college
students. Obeying orders from an authority figure can sometimes lead to disturbing behavior. This danger
was illustrated in a famous study in which participants were instructed to administer painful electric shocks
to another person in what they believed to be a learning experiment. Despite vehement protests from the
person receiving the shocks, most participants continued the procedure when instructed to do so by the
experimenter. The findings raise questions about the power of blind obedience in deplorable situations
such as atrocities and genocide. They also raise concerns about the ethical treatment of participants in
psychology experiments.

Introduction

When he was a teenager, my son often enjoyed looking at photographs of me and my wife taken when we
were in high school. He laughed at the hairstyles, the clothing, and the kind of glasses people wore "back
then." And when he was through with his ridiculing, we would point out that no one is immune to fashions
and fads and that someday his children will probably be equally amused by his high school photographs and
the trends he found so normal at the time.

   Everyday observation confirms that we often adopt the actions and attitudes of the people around us.
Trends in clothing, music, foods, and entertainment are obvious. But our views on political issues, religious
questions, and lifestyles also reflect to some degree the attitudes of the people we interact with. Similarly,
decisions about behaviors such as smoking and drinking are influenced by whether the people we spend
time with engage in these activities. Psychologists refer to this widespread tendency to act and think like the
people around us as conformity.

Fashion trends serve as good, and sometimes embarrassing, examples of our own susceptibility to
conformity. [Image: bianca francesca, https://goo.gl/0roq35, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]

Conformity

Humans may possess an inherent tendency to imitate the actions of others. Even if people are unaware of
it, many will mimic the gestures, body posture, language, speech rate, and other behaviors of the people we
interact with. Researchers find that this mimicking increases the connection between people and allows our
interactions to flow more smoothly (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999).

   Beyond this automatic tendency to imitate others, psychologists have identified two primary reasons for
conformity. The first of these is normative influence. When normative influence is operating, people go
along with the crowd because they are concerned about what others think of them. We don't want to look
out of step or become the target of criticism just because we like different kinds of music or dress differently
than everyone else. Fitting in also brings rewards such as camaraderie and compliments.
          CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE | 257

   How powerful is normative influence? Consider a classic study conducted many years ago by Solomon
Asch (1956). The participants were male college students who were asked to engage in a seemingly simple
task. An experimenter standing several feet away held up a card that depicted one line on the left side and
three lines on the right side. The participant's job was to say aloud which of the three lines on the right was
the same length as the line on the left. Sixteen cards were presented one at a time, and the correct answer
on each was so obvious as to make the task a little boring. Except for one thing. The participant was not
alone. In fact, there were six other people in the room who also gave their answers to the line-judgment
task aloud. Moreover, although they pretended to be fellow participants, these other individuals were, in
fact, confederates working with the experimenter. The real participant was seated so that he always gave
his answer after hearing what five other "participants" said. Everything went smoothly until the third trial,
when inexplicably the first "participant" gave an obviously incorrect answer. The mistake might have been
amusing, except the second participant gave the same answer. As did the third, the fourth, and the fifth
participant. Suddenly the real participant was in a difficult situation. His eyes told him one thing, but five
out of five people apparently saw something else.

It's one thing to wear your hair a certain way or like

certain foods because everyone around you does.

But, would participants intentionally give a wrong

answer just to conform with the other

participants? The confederates uniformly gave

incorrect answers on 12 of the 16 trials, and 76

percent of the participants went along with the

norm at least once and also gave the wrong answer.

In total, they conformed with the group on one-

third of the 12 test trials. Although we might be

impressed that the majority of the time

participants answered honestly, most psychologists      Examples of the cards used in the Asch experiment.

other people might be thinking about them overpowered their desire to do the right thing.

Variations of Asch's procedures have been conducted numerous times (Bond, 2005; Bond & Smith,

1996). We now know that the findings are easily replicated, that there is an increase in conformity with

more confederates (up to about five), that teenagers are more prone to conforming than are adults, and

that people conform significantly less often when they believe the confederates will not hear their responses

(Berndt, 1979; Bond, 2005; Crutchfield, 1955; Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). This last finding is consistent

with the notion that participants change their answers because they are concerned about what others think

of them.

The other reason we sometimes go along with the crowd is that people are often a source of information.

Psychologists refer to this process as informational influence. Most of us, most of the time, are motivated

to do the right thing. If society deems that we put litter in a proper container, speak softly in libraries, and

tip our waiter, then that's what most of us will do. But sometimes it's not clear what society expects of us.

In these situations, we often rely on descriptive norms (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990). That is, we act

the way most people--or most people like us--act. This is not an unreasonable strategy. Other people often
258 | CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE

have information that we do not, especially when we find ourselves in new situations. If you have ever been
part of a conversation that went something like this,

      "Do you think we should?"
      "Sure. Everyone else is doing it.",

you have experienced the power of informational influence.

                                                       However, it's not always easy to obtain good

                                                       sometimes rely on a flawed notion of the norm

                                                       when deciding how we should behave. A good

                                                       problems is found in research on binge drinking

                                                       among college students. Excessive drinking is a

                                                       serious problem on many campuses (Mita, 2009).

                                                       There are many reasons why students binge drink,

                                                       but one of the most important is their perception

                                                       of the descriptive norm. How much students drink

                                                       is highly correlated with how much they believe

                                                       the average student drinks (Neighbors, Lee, Lewis,

                                                       miscalculation that creates a dangerous push

toward more and more excessive alcohol consumption. On the positive side, providing students with

accurate information about drinking norms has been found to reduce overindulgent drinking (Burger,

LaSalvia, Hendricks, Mehdipour, & Neudeck, 2011; Neighbors, Lee, Lewis, Fossos, & Walter, 2009).

Researchers have demonstrated the power of descriptive norms in a number of areas. Homeowners

reduced the amount of energy they used when they learned that they were consuming more energy than

their neighbors (Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, & Griskevicius, 2007). Undergraduates selected the

healthy food option when led to believe that other students had made this choice (Burger et al., 2010).

Hotel guests were more likely to reuse their towels when a hanger in the bathroom told them that this is

what most guests did (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). And more people began using the stairs

instead of the elevator when informed that the vast majority of people took the stairs to go up one or two

floors (Burger & Shelton, 2011).

Obedience

Sometimes decisions about how to act are not so easy. Sometimes we are directed by a more powerful person
to do things we may not want to do. Researchers who study obedience are interested in how people react
                                         CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE | 259

when given an order or command from someone in a position of authority. In many situations, obedience is
a good thing. We are taught at an early age to obey parents, teachers, and police officers. It's also important
to follow instructions from judges, firefighters, and lifeguards. And a military would fail to function if
soldiers stopped obeying orders from superiors. But, there is also a dark side to obedience. In the name
of "following orders" or "just doing my job," people can violate ethical principles and break laws. More
disturbingly, obedience often is at the heart of some of the worst of human behavior--massacres, atrocities,
and even genocide.

It was this unsettling side of obedience that led to some of the most famous and most controversial research
in the history of psychology. Stanley Milgram (1963, 1965, 1974) wanted to know why many German
citizens went along with the brutality of the Nazi leaders during the Holocaust. Milgram (1963) wrote,
"these inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person...but they could only be carried
out on a massive scale if a very large number of persons obeyed orders" (p. 371).

   To understand this obedience, Milgram conducted a series of laboratory investigations. In all but one
variation of the basic procedure, participants were men recruited from the community surrounding Yale
University, where the research was carried out. These citizens signed up for what they believed to be an
260 | CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE

experiment on learning and memory. In particular, they were told the research concerned the effects of
punishment on learning. Three people were involved in each session. One was the participant. Another was
the experimenter. The third was a confederate who pretended to be another participant.

   The experimenter explained that the study consisted of a memory test and that one of the men would be
the teacher and the other the learner. Through a rigged drawing, the real participant was always assigned the
teacher's role and the confederate was always the learner. The teacher watched as the learner was strapped
into a chair and had electrodes attached to his wrist. The teacher then moved to the room next door where
he was seated in front of a large metal box the experimenter identified as a "shock generator." The front of
the box displayed gauges and lights and, most noteworthy, a series of 30 levers across the bottom. Each lever
was labeled with a voltage figure, starting with 15 volts and moving up in 15-volt increments to 450 volts.
Labels also indicated the strength of the shocks, starting with "Slight Shock" and moving up to "Danger:
Severe Shock" toward the end. The last two levers were simply labeled "XXX" in red.

                                                                                                                 Source:

   The teacher administered a memory test to the learner in the next room through a microphone. The
learner responded to the multiple-choice items by pressing one of four buttons that were barely within
reach of his strapped-down hand. If the teacher saw the correct answer light up on his side of the wall, he
simply moved on to the next item. But if the learner got the item wrong, the teacher pressed one of the
shock levers and, thereby, delivered the learner's punishment. The teacher was instructed to start with the
15-volt lever and move up to the next highest shock for each successive wrong answer.

   In reality, the learner received no shocks. Mistakes were made intentionally, and the teacher was to
administer what he believed to be increasingly strong shocks. The purpose of the study was to see how far
the teacher would go before refusing to continue. The teacher's first hint that something was amiss came
after pressing the 75-volt lever and hearing through the wall the learner say "Ugh!" The learner's reactions
became stronger and louder with each lever press. At 150 volts, the learner yelled out, "Experimenter! That's
all. Get me out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart's starting to bother me now. Get me out of
here, please. My heart's starting to bother me. I refuse to go on. Let me out."
              CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE | 261

The experimenter's role was to encourage the

participant to continue. If at any time the teacher

asked to end the session, the experimenter

responded with phrases such as, "The experiment

requires that you continue," and "You have no

other choice, you must go on." The experimenter

ended the session only after the teacher stated four

successive times that he did not want to continue.

All the while, the learner's protests became more

intense with each shock. After 300 volts, the

learner refused to answer any more questions,

which led the experimenter to say that no answer

should be considered a wrong answer. After 330

volts, despite vehement protests from the learner

following previous shocks, the teacher heard only

silence, suggesting that the learner was now

physically unable to respond. If the teacher reached

450 volts--the end of the generator--the              Diagram of the Milgram Experiment in which the
experimenter told him to continue pressing the        "teacher" (T) was asked to deliver a (supposedly)
450 volt lever for each wrong answer. It was only     painful electric shock to the "learner"(L). Would this

times that the experimenter announced that the        [Image: Fred the Oyster, https://goo.gl/ZIbQz1, CC
study was over.                                       BY-SA 4.0, https://goo.gl/X3i0tq]

If you had been a participant in this research, what would you have done? Virtually everyone says he

or she would have stopped early in the process. And most people predict that very few if any participants

would keep pressing all the way to 450 volts. Yet in the basic procedure described here, 65 percent of the

participants continued to administer shocks to the very end of the session. These were not brutal, sadistic

men. They were ordinary citizens who nonetheless followed the experimenter's instructions to administer

what they believed to be excruciating if not dangerous electric shocks to an innocent person. The disturbing

implication from the findings is that, under the right circumstances, each of us may be capable of acting in

some very uncharacteristic and perhaps some very unsettling ways.

Milgram conducted many variations of this basic procedure to explore some of the factors that affect

obedience. He found that obedience rates decreased when the learner was in the same room as the

experimenter and declined even further when the teacher had to physically touch the learner to administer

the punishment. Participants also were less willing to continue the procedure after seeing other teachers

refuse to press the shock levers, and they were significantly less obedient when the instructions to continue

came from a person they believed to be another participant rather than from the experimenter. Finally,

Milgram found that women participants followed the experimenter's instructions at exactly the same rate

the men had.

Milgram's obedience research has been the subject of much controversy and discussion. Psychologists

continue to debate the extent to which Milgram's studies tell us something about atrocities in general and

about the behavior of German citizens during the Holocaust in particular (Miller, 2004). Certainly, there

are important features of that time and place that cannot be recreated in a laboratory, such as a pervasive

climate of prejudice and dehumanization. Another issue concerns the relevance of the findings. Some

people have argued that today we are more aware of the dangers of blind obedience than we were when

the research was conducted back in the 1960s. However, findings from partial and modified replications of
262 | CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE

Milgram's procedures conducted in recent years suggest that people respond to the situation today much
like they did a half a century ago (Burger, 2009).

If you had been "a teacher" in the Milgram experiment, would you have behaved differently than the
majority who delivered what they thought were massive 450-volt shocks? [Image: Sharon Drummond,
https://goo.gl/uQZGtZ, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]

Another point of controversy concerns the ethical treatment of research participants. Researchers have
an obligation to look out for the welfare of their participants. Yet, there is little doubt that many of
Milgram's participants experienced intense levels of stress as they went through the procedure. In his
defense, Milgram was not unconcerned about the effects of the experience on his participants. And in
follow-up questionnaires, the vast majority of his participants said they were pleased they had been part
of the research and thought similar experiments should be conducted in the future. Nonetheless, in part
because of Milgram's studies, guidelines and procedures were developed to protect research participants
from these kinds of experiences. Although Milgram's intriguing findings left us with many unanswered
questions, conducting a full replication of his experiment remains out of bounds by today's standards.

   Social psychologists are fond of saying that we are all influenced by the people around us more than we
recognize. Of course, each person is unique, and ultimately each of us makes choices about how we will and
will not act. But decades of research on conformity and obedience make it clear that we live in a social world
and that--for better or worse--much of what we do is a reflection of the people we encounter.

1. In what ways do you see normative influence operating among you and your peers? How difficult
                                         CONFORMITY AND OBEDIENCE | 263

      would it be to go against the norm? What would it take for you to not do something just because all
      your friends were doing it?
2. What are some examples of how informational influence helps us do the right thing? How can we use
      descriptive norm information to change problem behaviors?
3. Is conformity more likely or less likely to occur when interacting with other people through social
      media as compared to face-to-face encounters?
4. When is obedience to authority a good thing and when is it bad? What can be done to prevent people
      from obeying commands to engage in truly deplorable behavior such as atrocities and massacres?
5. In what ways do Milgram's experimental procedures fall outside the guidelines for research with
      human participants? Are there ways to conduct relevant research on obedience to authority without
      violating these guidelines?

WORKING IN DIVERSE TEAMS

     Learning Objectives

        · Describe how diversity can enhance decision-making and problem-solving
        · Identify challenges and best practices for working with multicultural teams
        · Discuss divergent cultural characteristics and list several examples of such characteristics

             in the culture(s) you identify with

Decision-making and problem-solving can be much more dynamic and successful when performed in a
diverse team environment. The multiple diverse perspectives can enhance both the understanding of the
problem and the quality of the solution. Yet, working in diverse teams can be challenging given different
identities, cultures, beliefs, and experiences. In this chapter, we will discuss the effects of team diversity on
group decision-making and problem-solving, identify best practices and challenges for working in and with
multicultural teams, and dig deeper into divergent cultural characteristics that teams may need to navigate.

Does Team Diversity Enhance Decision Making and
Problem Solving?

In the Harvard Business Review article "Why Diverse Teams are Smarter," David Rock and Heidi Grant
(2016) support the idea that increasing workplace diversity is a good business decision. A 2015 McKinsey
report on 366 public companies found that those in the top quartile for ethnic and racial diversity in
management were 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, and those in the top
quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to have returns above the industry mean. Similarly, in a
global analysis conducted by Credit Suisse, organizations with at least one female board member yielded
a higher return on equity and higher net income growth than those that did not have any women on the
board.

Teams made up of diverse members tend to perform better than teams of similar backgrounds. Here, the
Women of Color in Technology work on a project. The tech industry has been criticized for the lack of
diversity among its ranks, and groups like the Women of Color in Technology are looking to change that.

Additional research on diversity has shown that diverse teams are better at decision-making and problem-
solving because they tend to focus more on facts, per the Rock and Grant article. A study published
in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology showed that people from diverse backgrounds "might
actually alter the behavior of a group's social majority in ways that lead to improved and more accurate
group thinking." It turned out that in the study, the diverse panels raised more facts related to the case
than homogeneous panels and made fewer factual errors while discussing available evidence. Another study
noted in the article showed that diverse teams are "more likely to constantly reexamine facts and remain
objective. They may also encourage greater scrutiny of each member's actions, keeping their joint cognitive
resources sharp and vigilant. By breaking up workforce homogeneity, you can allow your employees to
become more aware of their own potential biases--entrenched ways of thinking that can otherwise blind
them to key information and even lead them to make errors in decision-making processes." In other words,
when people are among homogeneous and like-minded (non-diverse) teammates, the team is susceptible
to groupthink and may be reticent to think about opposing viewpoints since all team members are in
alignment. In a more diverse team with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, the opposing viewpoints
are more likely to come out and the team members feel obligated to research and address the questions that
have been raised. Again, this enables a richer discussion and a more in-depth fact-finding and exploration of
opposing ideas and viewpoints in order to solve problems.

   Diversity in teams also leads to greater innovation. A Boston Consulting Group article entitled "The
Mix that Matters: Innovation through Diversity" explains a study in which they sought to understand the
relationship between diversity in managers (all management levels) and innovation (Lorenzo et al., 2017).
The key findings of this study show that:

 · The positive relationship between management diversity and innovation is statistically
      significant--and thus companies with higher levels of diversity derive more revenue from new
268 | WORKING IN DIVERSE TEAMS

      products and services.
 · The innovation boost isn't limited to a single type of diversity. The presence of managers who are

      either female or are from other countries, industries, or companies can cause an increase in
      innovation.
 · Management diversity seems to have a particularly positive effect on innovation at complex
      companies--those that have multiple product lines or that operate in multiple industry segments.
 · To reach its potential, gender diversity needs to go beyond tokenism. In the study, innovation
      performance only increased significantly when the workforce included more than 20% women in
      management positions. Having a high percentage of female employees doesn't increase innovation if
      only a small number of women are managers.
 · At companies with diverse management teams, openness to contributions from lower-level workers
      and an environment in which employees feel free to speak their minds are crucial for fostering
      innovation.

When you consider the impact that diverse teams have on decision-making and problem-solving--through
the discussion and incorporation of new perspectives, ideas, and data--it is no wonder that the BCG study
shows greater innovation. Team leaders need to reflect upon these findings during the early stages of team
selection so that they can reap the benefits of having diverse voices and backgrounds.

Challenges and Best Practices for Working with
Multicultural Teams

As globalization has increased over the last decades, workplaces have felt the impact of working within
multicultural teams. The earlier section on team diversity outlined some of the highlights and benefits of
working on diverse teams, and a multicultural group certainly qualifies as diverse. However, there are some
key practices that are recommended to those who are leading multicultural teams so that they can parlay the
diversity into an advantage and not be derailed by it.

   People may assume that communication is the key factor that can derail multicultural teams, as
participants may have different languages and communication styles. In the Harvard Business Review article
"Managing Multicultural Teams," Brett et al. (2006) outline four key cultural differences that can cause
destructive conflicts in a team. The first difference is direct versus indirect communication, also known
as high-context vs. low-context communication. Some cultures are very direct and explicit in their
communication, while others are more indirect and ask questions rather than pointing our problems. This
difference can cause conflict because, at the extreme, the direct style may be considered offensive by some,
while the indirect style may be perceived as unproductive and passive-aggressive in team interactions.

   The second difference that multicultural teams may face is trouble with accents and fluency. When
team members don't speak the same language, there may be one language that dominates the group
interaction--and those who don't speak it may feel left out. The speakers of the primary language may
feel that those members don't contribute as much or are less competent. The next challenge is when there
are differing attitudes toward hierarchy. Some cultures are very respectful of the hierarchy and will treat
team members based on that hierarchy. Other cultures are more egalitarian and don't observe hierarchical
differences to the same degree. This may lead to clashes if some people feel that they are being disrespected
and not treated according to their status. The final difference that may challenge multicultural teams is
conflicting decision-making norms. Different cultures make decisions differently, and some will apply a
great deal of analysis and preparation beforehand. Those cultures that make decisions more quickly (and
                                           WORKING IN DIVERSE TEAMS | 269

need just enough information to make a decision) may be frustrated with the slow response and relatively
longer thought process.

   These cultural differences are good examples of how everyday team activities (decision-making,
communication, interaction among team members) may become points of contention for a multicultural
team if there isn't adequate understanding of everyone's culture. The authors propose that there are
several potential interventions to try if these conflicts arise. One simple intervention is adaptation, which
is working with or around differences. This is best used when team members are willing to acknowledge
the cultural differences and learn how to work with them. The next intervention technique is structural
intervention, or reorganizing to reduce friction on the team. This technique is best used if there are
unproductive subgroups or cliques within the team that need to be moved around. Managerial
intervention is the technique of making decisions by management and without team involvement. This
technique is one that should be used sparingly, as it essentially shows that the team needs guidance and can't
move forward without management getting involved. Finally, exit is an intervention of last resort, and is
the voluntary or involuntary removal of a team member. If the differences and challenges have proven to
be so great that an individual on the team can no longer work with the team productively, then it may be
necessary to remove the team member in question.

Developing Cultural Intelligence

There are some people who seem to be innately aware of and able to work with cultural differences on
teams and in their organizations. These individuals might be said to have cultural intelligence. Cultural
intelligence is a competency and a skill that enables individuals to function effectively in cross-cultural
environments. It develops as people become more aware of the influence of culture and more capable
of adapting their behavior to the norms of other cultures. In the IESE Insight article entitled "Cultural
Competence: Why It Matters and How You Can Acquire It," Lee and Liao (2015) assert that
"multicultural leaders may relate better to team members from different cultures and resolve conflicts more
easily. Their multiple talents can also be put to good use in international negotiations." Multicultural
leaders don't have a lot of "baggage" from any one culture, and so are sometimes perceived as being
culturally neutral. They are very good at handling diversity, which gives them a great advantage in their
relationships with teammates.

   In order to help people become better team members in a world that is increasingly multicultural,
there are a few best practices that the authors recommend for honing cross-cultural skills. The first is to
"broaden your mind"--expand your own cultural channels (travel, movies, books) and surround yourself
with people from other cultures. This helps to raise your own awareness of the cultural differences and
norms that you may encounter. Another best practice is to "develop your cross-cultural skills through
practice" and experiential learning. You may have the opportunity to work or travel abroad--but if you
don't, then getting to know some of your company's cross-cultural colleagues or foreign visitors will help
you to practice your skills. Serving on a cross-cultural project team and taking the time to get to know and
bond with your global colleagues is an excellent way to develop skills.

   Once you have a sense of the different cultures and have started to work on developing your cross-cultural
skills, another good practice is to "boost your cultural metacognition" and monitor your own behavior
in multicultural situations. When you are in a situation in which you are interacting with multicultural
individuals, you should test yourself and be aware of how you act and feel. Observe both your positive
and negative interactions with people, and learn from them. Developing "cognitive complexity" is the final
best practice for boosting multicultural skills. This is the most advanced, and it requires being able to view
situations from more than one cultural framework. In order to see things from another perspective, you
270 | WORKING IN DIVERSE TEAMS

need to have a strong sense of emotional intelligence, empathy, and sympathy, and be willing to engage in
honest communications.

   In the Harvard Business Review article "Cultural Intelligence," Earley and Mosakowski (2004) describe
three sources of cultural intelligence that teams should consider if they are serious about becoming more
adept in their cross-cultural skills and understanding. These sources, very simply, are head, body, and
heart. One first learns about the beliefs, customs, and taboos of foreign cultures via the head. Training
programs are based on providing this type of overview information--which is helpful, but obviously isn't
experiential. This is the cognitive component of cultural intelligence. The second source, the body, involves
more commitment and experimentation with the new culture. It is this physical component (demeanor,
eye contact, posture, accent) that shows a deeper level of understanding of the new culture and its physical
manifestations. The final source, the heart, deals with a person's own confidence in their ability to adapt
to and deal well with cultures outside of their own. Heart really speaks to one's own level of emotional
commitment and motivation to understand the new culture.

   The authors have created a quick assessment to diagnose cultural intelligence, based on these cognitive,
physical, and emotional/motivational measures (i.e., head, body, heart). Please refer to the table below for a
short diagnostic that allows you to assess your cultural intelligence.

Assessing Your Cultural Intelligence

 Give your responses using a 1 to 5 scale where 1 means that you strongly disagree and 5 means that you strongly
 agree with the statement.

    Before I interact with people from a new culture, I wonder to myself what I hope to achieve.
    If I encounter something unexpected while working in a new culture, I use that experience to build new ways to
    approach other cultures in the future.
    I plan on how I am going to relate to people from a different culture before I meet with them.
    When I come into a new cultural situation, I can immediately sense whether things are going well or if things are
    going wrong.
    Add your total from the four questions above.
    Divide the total by 4. This is your Cognitive Cultural Quotient.
    It is easy for me to change my body language (posture or facial expression) to suit people from a different culture.
    I can alter my expressions when a cultural encounter requires it.
    I can modify my speech style by changing my accent or pitch of voice to suit people from different cultures.
    I can easily change the way I act when a cross-cultural encounter seems to require it.
    Add your total from the four questions above.
    Divide the total by 4. This is your Cognitive Physical Quotient.
    I have confidence in my ability to deal well with people from different cultures than mine.
    I am certain that I can befriend people of different cultural backgrounds than mine.
    I can adapt to the lifestyle of a different culture with relative ease.
    I am confident in my ability to deal with an unfamiliar cultural situation or encounter.
    Add your total from the four questions above.
    Divide the total by 4. This is your Emotional/Motivational Cognitive Quotient.
 Generally, scoring below 3 in any one of the three measures signals an area requiring improvement. Averaging over 4
 displays strength in cultural intelligence.

Cultural intelligence is an extension of emotional intelligence. An individual must have a level of awareness
and understanding of the new culture so that he or she can adapt to the style, pace, language, nonverbal
communication, etc. and work together successfully with the new culture. A multicultural team can
only find success if its members take the time to understand each other and ensure that everyone feels
included. Multiculturalism and cultural intelligence are traits that are taking on increasing importance in
the business world today. By following best practices and avoiding the challenges and pitfalls that can derail
a multicultural team, a team can find great success and personal fulfillment well beyond the boundaries of
the project or work engagement.

Digging in Deeper: Divergent Cultural Dimensions
Let's dig in deeper by examining several points of divergence across cultures and consider how these
dimensions might play out in organizations and in groups or teams.

Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Comparison of 4 countries: US, China, Germany and Brazil in all 6
dimensions of the model.

LOW-POWER VERSUS HIGH-POWER
DISTANCE

How comfortable are you with critiquing your boss's decisions? If you are from a low-power distance
culture, your answer might be "no problem." In low-power distance cultures, according to Dutch
researcher Geert Hofstede, people relate to one another more as equals and less as a reflection of dominant
or subordinate roles, regardless of their actual formal roles as employee and manager, for example.

   In a high-power distance culture, you would probably be much less likely to challenge the decision, to
provide an alternative, or to give input. If you are working with people from a high-power distance culture,
you may need to take extra care to elicit feedback and involve them in the discussion because their cultural
framework may preclude their participation. They may have learned that less powerful people must accept
decisions without comment, even if they have a concern or know there is a significant problem. Unless you
are sensitive to cultural orientation and power distance, you may lose valuable information.
274 |

INDIVIDUALISTIC VERSUS COLLECTIVIST
CULTURES

People in individualistic cultures value individual freedom and personal independence, and cultures
always have stories to reflect their values. You may recall the story of Superman, or John McLean in the
Diehard series, and note how one person overcomes all obstacles. Through personal ingenuity, in spite
of challenges, one person rises successfully to conquer or vanquish those obstacles. Sometimes there is an
assist, as in basketball or football, where another person lends a hand, but still the story repeats itself again
and again, reflecting the cultural viewpoint.

   When Hofstede explored the concepts of individualism and collectivism across diverse cultures
(Hofstede, 1982, 2001, 2005), he found that in individualistic cultures like the United States, people
perceived their world primarily from their own viewpoint. They perceived themselves as empowered
individuals, capable of making their own decisions, and able to make an impact on their own lives.

   Cultural viewpoint is not an either/or dichotomy, but rather a continuum or range. You may belong to
some communities that express individualistic cultural values, while others place the focus on a collective
viewpoint. Collectivist cultures (Hofstede, 1982), including many in Asia and South America, focus on
the needs of the nation, community, family, or group of workers. Ownership and private property is one
way to examine this difference. In some cultures, property is almost exclusively private, while others tend
toward community ownership. The collectively owned resource returns benefits to the community. Water,
for example, has long been viewed as a community resource, much like air, but that has been changing as
business and organizations have purchased water rights and gained control over resources. Public lands,
such as parks, are often considered public, and individual exploitation of them is restricted. Copper, a metal
with a variety of industrial applications, is collectively owned in Chile, with profits deposited in the general
government fund. While public and private initiatives exist, the cultural viewpoint is our topic. How does
someone raised in a culture that emphasizes the community interact with someone raised in a primarily
individualistic culture? How could tensions be expressed and how might interactions be influenced by this
point of divergence?

MASCULINE VERSUS FEMININE
ORIENTATION

There was a time when many cultures and religions valued a female figurehead, and with the rise of Western
cultures we have observed a shift toward a masculine ideal. Each carries with it a set of cultural expectations
and norms for gender behavior and gender roles across life, including business.

   Hofstede describes the masculine-feminine dichotomy not in terms of whether men or women hold
the power in a given culture, but rather the extent to which that culture values certain traits that may be
considered masculine or feminine. Thus, "the assertive pole has been called `masculine' and the modest,
                                                                                        | 275

caring pole `feminine.' The women in feminine countries have the same modest, caring values as the men; in
the masculine countries they are somewhat assertive and competitive, but not as much as the men, so that
these countries show a gap between men's values and women's values" (Hofstede, 2009).

   We can observe this difference in where people gather, how they interact, and how they dress. We
can see it during business negotiations, where it may make an important difference in the success of the
organizations involved. Cultural expectations precede the interaction, so someone who doesn't match
those expectations may experience tension. Business in the United States has a masculine
orientation--assertiveness and competition are highly valued. In other cultures, such as Sweden, business
values are more attuned to modesty (lack of self-promotion) and taking care of society's weaker members.
This range of difference is one aspect of intercultural communication that requires significant attention
when the business communicator enters a new environment.

UNCERTAINTY-ACCEPTING CULTURES
VERSUS UNCERTAINTY-REJECTING
CULTURES

When we meet each other for the first time, we often use what we have previously learned to understand
our current context. We also do this to reduce our uncertainty. Some cultures, such as the United States
and Britain, are highly tolerant of uncertainty, while others go to great lengths to reduce the element
of surprise. Cultures in the Arab world, for example, are high in uncertainty avoidance; they tend to be
resistant to change and reluctant to take risks. Whereas a U.S. business negotiator might enthusiastically
agree to try a new procedure, the Egyptian counterpart would likely refuse to get involved until all the details
are worked out.

SHORT-TERM VERSUS LONG-TERM
ORIENTATION

Do you want your reward right now or can you dedicate yourself to a long-term goal? You may work in a
culture whose people value immediate results and grow impatient when those results do not materialize.
276 |

Geert Hofstede discusses this relationship of time orientation to a culture as a "time horizon," and it
underscores the perspective of the individual within a cultural context. Many countries in Asia, influenced
by the teachings of Confucius, value a long-term orientation, whereas other countries, including the United
States, have a more short-term approach to life and results. Native American cultures are known for holding
a long-term orientation, as illustrated by the proverb attributed to the Iroquois that decisions require
contemplation of their impact seven generations removed.

   If you work within a culture that has a short-term orientation, you may need to place greater emphasis
on reciprocation of greetings, gifts, and rewards. For example, if you send a thank-you note the morning
after being treated to a business dinner, your host will appreciate your promptness. While there may be
a respect for tradition, there is also an emphasis on personal representation and honor, a reflection of
identity and integrity. Personal stability and consistency are also valued in a short-term oriented culture,
contributing to an overall sense of predictability and familiarity.

   Long-term orientation is often marked by persistence, thrift and frugality, and an order to
relationships based on age and status. A sense of shame for the family and community is also observed across
generations. What an individual does reflects on the family and is carried by immediate and extended family
members.

TIME ORIENTATION

Edward T. Hall and Mildred Reed Hall (1987) state that monochronic time-oriented cultures consider one
thing at a time, whereas polychronic time-oriented cultures schedule many things at one time, and time is
considered in a more fluid sense. In monochromatic time, time is thought of as very linear, interruptions
are to be avoided, and everything has its own specific time. Even the multitasker from a monochromatic
culture will, for example, recognize the value of work first before play or personal time. The United States,
Germany, and Switzerland are often noted as countries that value a monochromatic time orientation.

   Polychromatic time looks a little more complicated, with business and family mixing with dinner and
dancing. Greece, Italy, Chile, and Saudi Arabia are countries where one can observe this perception of time;
business meetings may be scheduled at a fixed time, but when they actually begin may be another story. Also
note that the dinner invitation for 8 p.m. may in reality be more like 9 p.m. If you were to show up on time,
you might be the first person to arrive and find that the hosts are not quite ready to receive you.

   When in doubt, always ask before the event; many people from polychromatic cultures will be used to
foreigner's tendency to be punctual, even compulsive, about respecting established times for events. The
skilled business communicator is aware of this difference and takes steps to anticipate it. The value of time
in different cultures is expressed in many ways, and your understanding can help you communicate more
effectively.

INTERCULTURAL AND PLANE CRASHES

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Culture can affect aviation safety through its effect on how the flight crew deals with difficult situations;
cultures with lower power distances and higher levels of individuality can result in better aviation safety
outcomes. In higher power cultures subordinates are less likely to question their superiors. The crash
of Korean Air Flight 801 in 1997 was attributed to the pilot's decision to land despite the junior officer's
disagreement, while the crash of Avianca Flight 52 was caused by the failure to communicate critical low-
fuel data between pilots and controllers, and by the failure of the controllers to ask the pilots if they were
declaring an emergency and assist the pilots in landing the aircraft. The crashes have been blamed on
aspects of the national cultures of the crews.

Cultural differences in aviation

Geert Hofstede classified national cultures into four dimensions, two of which can be applied to the
flight deck: power distance, which defines the "nature of relations between subordinates and superiors",
or "how often subordinates are afraid to express disagreement"; and whether the culture is collectivist or
individualist in nature. Western cultures are individualistic and have a low power distance, whereas most
Asian and Latin cultures are on the other side of the spectrum.

Past incidents

Tenerife Disaster

                                       On March 27, 1977, two Boeing 747 passenger

                                       jets, KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight

                                       1736, collided on the foggy runway at Los Rodeos

                                       Airport (now Tenerife North Airport), on the

                                       Spanish island of Tenerife, Canary Islands, killing

                                       583 people, making it the deadliest accident in

                                       aviation history. Before takeoff, the KLM flight

                                       engineer expressed his concern about the Pan Am

                                       not being clear of the runway by asking the pilots

                                       in his own cockpit, "Is he not clear, that Pan

Wreckage of Tenerife airport disaster  American?" The KLM captain emphatically
                                       replied "Oh, yes" and continued with the takeoff,

                                       snubbing the junior officer's concern. This event

led to widespread establishment of crew resource management as a fundamental part of airline pilots'

training.
280 | INTERCULTURAL AND PLANE CRASHES

Korean Air Flight 801

On approach to Guam in 1997, Korean 801
crashed, mainly due to pilot fatigue and poor
communication between the flight crew. The
captain made the decision to land despite the
junior officer's disagreements, eventually bringing
the plane down short of the runway, highlighting
how a pilot can contribute to a disaster. In high
power distance cultures, it is uncommon for
subordinates to question their superiors. "Leaders
may be autocratic". High power distance can be
seen as the willingness to be in an unequal position, Animation of Korean 801 on approach
making it a challenge for an officer lower in the
hierarchy to question the decisions of the one in power. At the same time, even in a high uncertainty
avoidance culture, with the crew more likely to follow standard operating procedures (SOPs), the crew
might react less efficiently to a novel situation.

Avianca Flight 52

                              Avianca 52 from Bogota to New York crashed

                              after running out of fuel, a problem caused by

                              language and cultural barriers. Both crew spoke

                              Spanish as their primary language, but the first

                              officer had better proficiency in English.

                              "Colombia is a highly masculine, high power

                              distance, and collectivist country", which might

                              have led to the crew's reluctance to ask for help

                              from the New York controllers when they knew

                              they were in trouble. In 1977, a cargo aircraft

Similar model of Avianca 52.  crashed shortly after takeoff from Anchorage en
                              route to Tokyo, killing all 3 crew. The captain was

                              a US national, with the other two being Japanese.

Neither Japanese pilot mentioned the captain's intoxication or stopped him from flying the plane. They

were reluctant to do so, and given Japan's moderately high power-distance index, their deference to

authority could have been a major contributing factor. Had they done so, it would have humiliated the

captain, who was clearly their superior, and from there on, it was impossible "to prevent the captain from

taking control of the aircraft, even at the cost of an accident."

Other impacts of culture in airline safety

Although crew resource management (CRM) can improve safety in the aviation industry, it is not widely
accepted across all cultures. This is likely due to differences in uncertainty avoidance, or "the need for rule-
governed behavior and clearly defined procedures". Standard operating procedures are more easily accepted
in high uncertainty avoidance cultures, such as Greece, Korea, and some Latin cultures. In the United
States, however, where flexibility is emphasized, pilots may not be as accepting of CRM culture.

   Improvements can be made to CRM by drawing on the strengths of
                             INTERCULTURAL AND PLANE CRASHES | 281

both individualistic and collectivisic cultures. Western assertiveness can be helpful in developing a low
power-distance cockpit, while the Eastern interdependence brings cooperation, interdependence, and
communication to create a safer flying environment.

   Ideally, "CRM represents low power distance (free exchange of information among the crew) and
collectivism (recognition and acceptance of crew interdependence), a rare cultural combination."

CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION

     Learning Objectives

        · Define conflict
        · Differentiate between functional and dysfunctional conflict
        · Recognize various types of conflict in groups
        · Describe the conflict process
        · Identify and apply strategies for preventing or reducing conflict in groups

Most people probably regard conflict as something to avoid, or at least not something we go looking for.
Still, we'd all agree that it's a familiar, perennial, and powerful part of human interaction, including among
groups and teams. In this chapter, we will define conflict, consider whether conflict is functional or
dysfunctional, discuss the conflict process, and identify strategies for preventing and reducing conflict in
groups.

Definitions of Conflict

Hocker and Wilmot (2001) defined conflict as an expressed struggle between interdependent parties over
goals which they perceive as incompatible or resources which they perceive to be insufficient. Let's examine
the ingredients in their definition.

   First of all, conflict must be expressed. If two members of a group dislike each other or disagree with each
other's viewpoints but never show those sentiments, there's no conflict.

   Second, conflict takes place between or among parties who are interdependent--that is, who need each
other to accomplish something. If they can get what they want without each other, they may differ in how
they do so, but they won't come into conflict.

   Finally, conflict involves clashes over what people want or over the means for them to achieve it. Party A
wants X, whereas party B wants Y. If they either can't both have what they want at all, or they can't each
have what they want to the degree that they would prefer to, conflict will arise.

The Positive and Negative Sides of Conflict

There are some circumstances in which a moderate amount of conflict can be helpful. For example, conflict
can stimulate innovation and change. Conflict can help individuals and group members grow and develop
self-identities. As noted by Coser (1956):
                                           CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION | 283

                Conflict, which aims at a resolution of tension between antagonists, is likely to have stabilizing
            and integrative functions for the relationship. By permitting immediate and direct expression of
            rival claims, such social systems are able to readjust their structures by eliminating their sources of
            dissatisfaction. The multiple conflicts which they experience may serve to eliminate the causes for
            dissociation and to re-establish unity. These systems avail themselves, through the toleration and
            institutionalization of conflict, of an important stabilizing mechanism.
   Conflict can have negative consequences when people divert energies away from performance and goal
attainment and direct them toward resolving the conflict. Continued conflict can take a heavy toll in terms
of psychological well-being. Conflict has a major influence on stress and the psychophysical consequences
of stress. Finally, continued conflict can also affect the social climate of the group and inhibit group
cohesiveness.

While often perceived as negative, some conflicts can actually be productive. (Credit: Arisa
Chattasa/Never Give Up for Boxing/Unsplash)
Thus, conflict can be either functional or dysfunctional depending upon the nature of the conflict, its
intensity, and its duration. Indeed, both too much and too little conflict can lead to a variety of negative
outcomes, as discussed above. This is shown in Figure 1. In such circumstances, a moderate amount of
conflict may be the best course of action. The issue for groups, therefore, is not how to eliminate conflict
but rather how to manage and resolve it when it occurs.

Types of Conflict

Group conflicts may deal with many topics, needs, and elements. Kelly (2006) identified the following five
types of conflict:

   First, there are conflicts of substance. These conflicts, which relate to questions about what choices to
make in a given situation, rest on differing views of the facts. If Terry thinks the biology assignment requires
an annotated bibliography but Robin believes a simple list of readings will suffice, they're in a conflict of
substance. Another term for this kind of conflict is "intrinsic conflict."

   Conflicts of value are those in which various parties either hold totally different values or rank the
same values in a significantly different order. The famous sociologist Milton Rokeach (1979), for instance,
found that freedom and equality constitute values in the four major political systems of the past 100
years--communism, fascism, socialism, and capitalism. What differentiated the systems, however, was the
degree to which proponents of each system ranked those two key values. According to Rokeach's analysis,
socialism holds both values highly; fascism holds them in low regard; communism values equality over
freedom, and capitalism values freedom over equality. As we all know, conflict among proponents of these
four political systems preoccupied people and governments for the better part of the twentieth century.

   Conflicts of process arise when people differ over how to reach goals or pursue values which they share.
How closely should they stick to rules and timelines, for instance, and when should they let their hair down
and simply brainstorm new ideas? What about when multiple topics and challenges are intertwined; how
and when should the group deal with each one? Another term for these disputes is "task conflicts."

   Conflicts of misperceived differences come up when people interpret each other's actions or
emotions erroneously. You can probably think of several times in your life when you first thought you
disagreed with other people but later found out that you'd just misunderstood something they said and
that you actually shared a perspective with them. Or perhaps you attributed a different motive to them
than what really underlay their actions. One misconception about conflict, however, is that it always arises
                                           CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION | 285

from misunderstandings. This isn't the case, however. Robert Doolittle (1976) noted that "some of the
most serious conflicts occur among individuals and groups who understand each other very well but who
strongly disagree."

   The first four kinds of conflict may interact with each other over time, either reinforcing or weakening
each other's impact. They may also ebb and flow according to the topics and conditions a group confronts.
Even if they're dealt with well, however, further emotional and personal kinds of conflict can occur in a
group. Relationship conflicts, also known as personality clashes, often involve people's egos and sense of
self-worth. Relationship conflicts tend to be particularly difficult to cope with since they frequently aren't
admitted for what they are. Many times, they arise in a struggle for superiority or status.

A Model of the Conflict Process

The most commonly accepted model of the conflict process was developed by Kenneth Thomas (1976).
This model consists of four stages: (1) frustration, (2) conceptualization, (3) behavior, and (4) outcome.

Stage 1: Frustration

As we have seen, conflict situations originate when an individual or group feels frustration in the pursuit
of important goals. This frustration may be caused by a wide variety of factors, including disagreement
over performance goals, failure to get a promotion or pay raise, a fight over scarce economic resources, new
rules or policies, and so forth. In fact, conflict can be traced to frustration over almost anything a group or
individual cares about.

Stage 2: Conceptualization

In stage 2, the conceptualization stage of the model, parties to the conflict attempt to understand the nature
of the problem, what they themselves want as a resolution, what they think their opponents want as a
resolution, and various strategies they feel each side may employ in resolving the conflict. This stage is
really the problem-solving and strategy phase. For instance, when management and union negotiate a labor
contract, both sides attempt to decide what is most important and what can be bargained away in exchange
for these priority needs.

Stage 3: Behavior

The third stage in Thomas's model is actual behavior. As a result of the conceptualization process, parties
to a conflict attempt to implement their resolution mode by competing or accommodating in the hope of
resolving problems. A major task here is determining how best to proceed strategically. That is, what tactics
will the party use to attempt to resolve the conflict? Thomas has identified five modes for conflict resolution:
(1) competing, (2) collaborating, (3) compromising, (4) avoiding, and (5) accommodating (see Table 1).

   The choice of an appropriate conflict resolution mode depends to a great extent on the situation and the
goals of the party (see Figure 2). According to this model, each party must decide the extent to which it
is interested in satisfying its own concerns--called assertiveness--and the extent to which it is interested in
helping satisfy the opponent's concerns--called cooperativeness. Assertiveness can range from assertive to
unassertive on one continuum, and cooperativeness can range from uncooperative to cooperative on the
other continuum.
286 | CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION

   Once the parties have determined their desired balance between the two competing concerns--either
consciously or unconsciously--the resolution strategy emerges. For example, if a union negotiator feels
confident she can win on an issue that is of primary concern to union members (e.g., wages), a direct
competition mode may be chosen (see the upper left-hand corner of Figure 2). On the other hand, when
the union is indifferent to an issue or when it actually supports management's concerns (e.g., plant safety),
we would expect an accommodating or collaborating mode (on the right-hand side of the figure).

Table 1 -- Five Modes of Resolving Conflict

Conflict-Handling  Appropriate Situations
Modes

Competing          1. When quick, decisive action is vital--e.g., emergencies
                   2. On important issues where unpopular actions need implementing--e.g., cost-cutting,

                        enforcing unpopular rules, discipline
                   3. On issues vital to company welfare when you know you're right
                   4. Against people who take advantage of noncompetitive behavior

Collaborating      1. When trying to find an integrative solution when both sets of concerns are too
                        important to be compromised

                   2. When your objective is to learn
                   3. When merging insights from people with different perspectives
                   4. When gaining commitment by incorporating concerns into a consensus
                   5. When working through feelings that have interfered with a relationship

Compromising       1. When goals are important but not worth the effort or potential disruption of more
                        assertive modes

                   2. When opponents with equal power are committed to mutually exclusive goals
                   3. When attempting to achieve temporary settlements to complex issues
                   4. When arriving at expedient solutions under time pressure
                   5. As a backup when collaboration or competition is unsuccessful

Avoiding           1. When an issue is trivial, or when more important issues are pressing
                   2. When you perceive no chance of satisfying your concerns
                   3. When potential disruption outweighs the benefits of resolution
                   4. When letting people cool down and regain perspective
                   5. When gathering information supersedes the immediate decision
                   6. When others can resolve the conflict more effectively
                   7. When issues seem tangential or symptomatic of other issues

Accommodating      1. When you find you are wrong--to allow a better position to be heard, to learn, and to
                        show your reasonableness

                   2. When issues are more important to others than yourself--to satisfy others and
                        maintain cooperation

                   3. When building social credits for later issues
                   4. When minimizing loss when you are outmatched and losing
                   5. When harmony and stability are especially important.
                   6. When allowing subordinates to develop by learning from mistakes.

                                              What is interesting in this process is the

                                              assumptions people make about their own modes

                                              compared to their opponents'. For example, in one

                                              study of executives, it was found that the executives

                                              typically described themselves as using

                                              collaboration or compromise to resolve conflict,

                                              whereas these same executives typically described

                                              their opponents as using a competitive mode

                                              almost exclusively (Thomas & Pondy, 1967). In

                                              other words, the executives underestimated their

                                              opponents' concerns as uncompromising.

                                              Simultaneously, the executives had flattering

                                                 Stage 4: Outcome. Finally, as a result of efforts

                                              to resolve the conflict, both sides determine the

extent to which a satisfactory resolution or outcome has been achieved. Where one party to the conflict does

not feel satisfied or feels only partially satisfied, the seeds of discontent are sown for a later conflict, as shown

in the preceding figure. One unresolved conflict episode can easily set the stage for a second episode. Action

aimed at achieving quick and satisfactory resolution is vital; failure to initiate such action leaves the

possibility (more accurately, the probability) that new conflicts will soon emerge.

RECOGNIZING YOUR EMOTIONS

Have you ever seen red, or perceived a situation through rage, anger, or frustration? Then
you know that you cannot see or think clearly when you are experiencing strong emotions.
There will be times in groups and teams when emotions run high, and your awareness of
them can help you clear your mind and choose to wait until the moment has passed to
tackle the challenge. This is an example of a time when avoiding can be a useful strategy, at
least temporarily.

Emotions can be contagious, and fear of the unknown can influence people to act in
irrational ways. The wise communicator can recognize when emotions are on edge in
themselves or others, and choose to wait to communicate, problem-solve, or negotiate until
after the moment has passed.

Bach and Wyden (1968) discuss gunnysacking (or backpacking) as the imaginary bag we
all carry, into which we place unresolved conflicts or grievances over time. Holding onto the
way things used to be can be like a stone in your gunnysack, and influence how you
interpret your current context.

People may be aware of similar issues but might not know your history, and cannot see your
backpack or its contents. For example, if you are used to things one way, and a group
member handles them differently, this may cause you some degree of stress and frustration.
Bottling up your frustrations only hurts you and can cause your relationships within the
288 | CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION

       group to suffer. By addressing, or unpacking, the stones you carry, you can better assess the
       current situation with the current patterns and variables.

Preventing and Reducing Conflict

There are many things group members can do to reduce or actually solve dysfunctional conflict when it
occurs. These generally fall into two categories: actions directed at conflict prevention and actions directed
at conflict reduction.

Strategies for Conflict Prevention

We shall start by examining conflict prevention techniques because preventing conflict is often easier than
reducing it once it begins. These include:

1. Emphasizing group goals and effectiveness. Focusing on group goals and objectives should prevent
      goal conflict. If larger goals are emphasized, group members are more likely to see the big picture and
      work together to achieve corporate goals.

2. Providing stable, well-structured tasks. When work activities are clearly defined, understood, and
      accepted, conflict should be less likely to occur. Conflict is most likely to occur when task uncertainty
      is high; specifying or structuring roles and tasks minimizes ambiguity.

3. Facilitating dialogue. Misperception of the abilities, goals, and motivations of others often leads to
      conflict, so efforts to increase the dialogue among group members and to share information should
      help eliminate conflict. As group members come to know more about one another, suspicions often
      diminish, and greater intergroup teamwork becomes possible.

4. Avoiding win-lose situations. If win-lose situations are avoided, less potential for conflict exists.

Strategies for Conflict Reduction

Where dysfunctional conflict already exists, something must be done, and you may pursue one of at
least two general approaches: you can try to change attitudes, or you can try to behaviors. If you change
behavior, open conflict is often reduced, but group members may still dislike one another; the conflict
simply becomes less visible. Changing attitudes, on the other hand, often leads to fundamental changes
in the ways that groups get along. However, it also takes considerably longer to accomplish than behavior
change because it requires a fundamental change in social perceptions.

   Nine conflict reduction strategies are discussed below. The techniques should be viewed as a continuum,
ranging from strategies that focus on changing behaviors near the top of the scale to strategies that focus on
changing attitudes near the bottom of the scale.

1. Physical separation. The quickest and easiest solution to conflict is physical separation. Separation is
      useful when conflicting individuals or groups are not working on a joint task or do not need a high
      degree of interaction. Though this approach does not encourage members to change their attitudes,
      it does provide time to seek a better accommodation.
                                          CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION | 289

2. Use of rules and regulations. Conflict can also be reduced through the increasing specification of rules,
     regulations, and procedures. Again, however, basic attitudes are not modified.

3. Limiting intergroup interaction. Another approach to reducing conflict is to limit intergroup
     interaction to issues involving common goals. Where groups agree on a goal, cooperation becomes
     easier.

4. Use of integrators. Integrators are individuals who are assigned a boundary-spanning role between two
     people or groups. To be trusted, integrators must be perceived by both groups as legitimate and
     knowledgeable. The integrator often takes the "shuttle diplomacy" approach, moving from one
     person or group to another, identifying areas of agreement, and attempting to find areas of future
     cooperation.

5. Confrontation and negotiation. In this approach, competing parties are brought together face-to-face
     to discuss their basic areas of disagreement. The hope is that through open discussion
     and negotiation, means can be found to work out problems. Contract negotiations between unions
     and management represent one such example. If a "win-win" solution can be identified through these
     negotiations, the chances of an acceptable resolution of the conflict increase.

6. Third-party consultation. In some cases, it is helpful to bring in outside consultants for third-party
     consultation who understand human behavior and can facilitate a resolution. A third-party
     consultant not only serves as a go-between but can speak more directly to the issues because she is not
     a member of the group.

7. Rotation of members. By rotating from one group to another, individuals come to understand the
     frames of reference, values, and attitudes of other members; communication is thus increased. When
     those rotated are accepted by the receiving groups, change in attitudes as well as behavior becomes
     possible. This is clearly a long-term technique, as it takes time to develop good interpersonal relations
     and understanding among group members.

8. Identification of interdependent tasks and superordinate goals. A further strategy is to establish goals
     that require groups to work together to achieve overall success.

9. Use of training. The final technique on the continuum is training. Outside training experts are
     retained on a long-term basis to help groups develop relatively permanent mechanisms for working
     together. Structured workshops and training programs can help forge more favorable intergroup
     attitudes and, as a result, more constructive group behavior.
