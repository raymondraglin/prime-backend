1Managerial Accounting Concepts
     1.1 INTRODUCTION

           Accounting is the system of recording and keeping track of financial
      transactions in a business and summarizing this information in reports. These
      reports provide information to people who are interested in knowing about the
      financial aspects of a business. The information guides business managers,
      investors, and creditors in planning and decision making. In fact, accounting
      is often referred to as "the language of business" because business people
      communicate, evaluate performance, and determine value using dollars and
      amounts generated by the accounting process.

           Financial accounting involves producing periodic reports called financial
      statements to inform such external groups as investors, boards of directors,
      creditors, and government/tax agencies about a company's financial performance
      and status. The income statement, retained earnings statement, balance sheet, and
      statement of cash flows are published at fixed intervals to summarize the historical
      earnings performance and current financial position of a company. Financial
      statements are prepared according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
      (GAAP), which helps ensure the information is relevant (useful and timely for
      making decisions), reliable (accurate and unbiased), consistent (prepared the
      same way each time information is reported), and comparable (prepared the
      same way by different companies).

           Managerial accounting is targeted more toward a company's managers and
      employees. The information gathered and summarized for these internal groups
      is customized to provide feedback for planning, decision making, and evaluation
      purposes. Managerial reports do not necessarily follow any particular format, but
      instead are uniquely designed to meet the needs of specific users. Analyses are
      often focused on targeted segments of a business rather than on a company as
      a whole. Information may be published over periodic time intervals or on an as-
      need basis. Managerial accounting involves not only actual financial data from
      past periods, but also current estimates and future projections.

           A manager's responsibilities in a business include making decisions related
      to planning (identifying goals and strategies for accomplishing them), leading
      (directing daily operations and carrying out plans), and controlling (comparing

                                                              Page | 1

expected and actual results and taking action for improvement). Since human,
financial, and time resources are limited, managers must select from among many
alternatives, foregoing other options. They try to optimize the collective outcome
of their choices. Managerial accounting provides timely and relevant financial
information that contributes to effective decision making.

    A business's operations are classified as one of three types - service,
merchandising, or manufacturing - depending on what it has for sale. A service
business sells expertise, advice, assistance, professional skills, or an experience
rather than a physical product. A merchandising business purchases finished
and packaged products from other companies, marks up the costs of these items,
and sells them to customers. A manufacturing business assembles and packages
products for sale to merchandisers or end users.

    Managerial accounting is relevant to all three types of businesses. In this
document, we will focus on manufacturing since that type of business involves
the most in-depth facets and examples of managerial accounting. We will also
discuss managerial accounting for service businesses where appropriate. Topics
will fall into four broad categories: accumulating costs, analyzing costs, evaluating
performance, and comparing alternatives.

    The goal of a business is to generate profit, which is the difference between
income and costs in a particular time period. Costs are the result of paying cash
or committing to pay cash in the future in order to earn revenue. Costs may be
accumulated for a product, sales territory, department, or activity. It is critical to
analyze costs because controlling them directly impacts profitability. Costs are also
used to determine selling prices of products, and they are monitored over time to
evaluate progress and discover irregularities.

ACCUMULATING COSTS

    Costs must be determined and recorded accurately, systematically, and on a
timely basis. Unless cost information is correct and reliable, it is not very useful
to managers who depend on it to make effective plans and informed decisions.
Job order costing and process costing are two methods of systematically
accumulating costs on manufactured products. Activity-based costing is a
system that is combined with the other two methods to identify and measure costs
more specifically.

ANALYZING COSTS

    Not all costs are created equal. Some are unavoidable; others are somewhat
controllable. Separating them out allows managers to focus on controllable costs
that should be monitored in order to contain or lower them. Costs may also be used
to mathematically determine sales required to achieve desired levels of volume
and profitability. Break even analysis and other cost relationships, as well as

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING  MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS

variable costing, will address these issues.

EVALUATING PERFORMANCE

    Planning involves looking into the future and estimating what a business's
financial activities will look like. This process is called budgeting and projects
what sales, costs, production, cash flows, etc. will be in at a future point in time.
Controlling methods such as variance analysis compare expected outcomes to
actual results and analyze overall progress in meeting goals.

COMPARING ALTERNATIVES

    Managerial decision making includes choosing one option over others, such as
whether to make or buy a component part or whether to continue manufacturing
a product or not. Differential analysis compares alternatives to determine
which choice will yield either the greatest benefit or the least cost. Capital
investment analysis is a type of differential analysis that involves evaluating
proposed investments in property, plant, and equipment that a company will use
in its operations.

1.2 COST TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS

    For a manufacturing company, a significant goal of managerial accounting is
to keep track of the costs of the units that are produced. A cost is a current or
future expenditure of cash for something that will ultimately generate revenue. In
manufacturing, many costs relate to products that are ultimately sold to customers.

    Period costs include selling and administrative expenses that are unrelated
to the production process in a manufacturing business. Selling expenses are
incurred to market products and deliver them to customers. Administrative
expenses are required to provide support services that are not directly related to the
manufacturing or selling activities. Administrative costs may include expenditures
for a company's accounting department, human resources department, and
president's office. Selling and administrative expenses may also include utilities,
insurance, property taxes, depreciation, supplies, maintenance, salaries, etc., that
are incurred in a business, but outside of the factory production area.

    Product costs are incurred when a company manufactures goods. Product
costs may be classified as either direct or indirect. Direct costs are expenditures
in a factory that can be specifically traced to a manufactured item and that become
part of its overall cost. Indirect costs are also incurred in a factory where
production takes place, but they are more general and cannot be attributed to any
specific product.

    There are three product costs associated with a manufactured item:

         1. Direct materials

         2. Direct labor cost

Page | 3
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING        MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS

         3. Factory overhead

    Direct materials are raw materials that will be used to create finished goods.
Their cost becomes part of the product that customers ultimately purchase.

    Direct labor is the cost of hourly wages of production workers who assemble
manufactured goods. These employees work on products that are sold to customers
when finished.

    Factory overhead is an indirect cost and includes ANY expense in a factory
that is not specifically traced to products that customers purchase. These may be
general expenses, such as utilities, insurance, property taxes, depreciation, supplies,
maintenance, supervisor salaries, and expired prepaid items. Factory overhead also
includes any materials or labor that do not become part of a manufactured product.

    Product costs may be further categorized, as follows:

         1. Prime cost = direct labor + direct materials

         2. Conversion costs = direct labor + factory overhead

EXAMPLE

    A manufacturing company produces kitchen cabinets. Direct materials
include wood, hinges, and hardware. Direct labor is the cost of wages of factory
employees who assemble the cabinets. Factory overhead includes expenditures
for electricity and water bills, insurance premiums, roof repair, depreciation of
machinery, materials used to build shelves in the factory, and wages of factory
workers to assemble those shelves.

    Assume that direct materials cost $700, direct labor is $500, and factory
overhead is $300 for cabinets that have been manufactured.

1. How much are prime costs?               $700 + $500 = $1,200
2. How much are conversion costs?          $500 + $300 = $ 800
3. What is the total cost of the product?  $700 + $500 +$300= $1,500

1.3 INVENTORY TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS

    A manufacturer reports its product costs as one of three types of inventory in
the current assets section of its balance sheet, depending on stages of completion.
Materials consist of items in inventory that have not yet been entered into
production or used. Work in process includes manufactured products that
have been started but are not yet completed. In other words, they are currently in
production. Finally, finished goods are manufactured products that have been
completed but not yet sold to customers.

1.3.1 Financial Reporting for a Manufacturer

    The three inventory accounts, and their balances at the end of the month,
appear in the current asset section of a manufacturer's balance sheet. A sample

                                                      Page | 4
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING   MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS

balance sheet follows.

Current assets:             Jonick Company         $40,000
Cash                         Balance Sheet          25,000
Accounts receivable           June 30, 2019
Inventory                           Assets

     Materials                            $18,000
     Work in process                       31,000
     Finished goods                        26,000

           Total inventory                         75,000
Prepaid insurance                                   4,000
Prepaid rent                                        2,000

     Total current assets                                   $146,000

    When manufactured items are sold, their costs are removed from the Finished
Goods inventory account and transferred to the Cost of Goods Sold expense account
on the income statement. Cost of Goods Sold represents the amount a company
paid for the manufactured items that it sold. Cost of Goods Sold is matched with
Sales on the first two rows of the income statement. The difference between Sales
and Cost of Goods Sold is gross profit, which is the amount of markup on the
manufactured goods.

    The income statement also includes expenses other than Cost of Goods Sold.
Selling and administrative expenses are non-factory costs that are classified as
operating expenses. These period costs are necessary to operate the business and
generate sales.

    A sample income statement follows.

Sales                                              $300,000

                          Net income                                   $50,000

    The Cost of Goods Sold amount on the income statement is determined by
considering the changes in the three inventory account balances during the period.
The elements of its calculation contain important information for managers, but
they are too detailed and lengthy to present directly on the income statement.
Therefore, a separate statement of cost of goods sold is prepared to show the
details of the calculations. The final cost of goods sold amount from the statement
of cost of goods sold is what appears on the income statement.

    The statement of cost of goods sold that follows presents how the $140,000
amount on the income statement is determined. The statement is followed by an
explanation of its sections.

    Three amounts that must often be solved for algebraically are the amounts of
inventory transferred out of the Materials, Work in Process, and Finished Goods
inventory accounts during a period. These amounts may be determined with an
equation similar to that used for the periodic inventory system for merchandising.
Beginning and ending inventory values are determined by taking physical inventory
counts, and, therefore, they are known. Amounts for inventory added during the
period are available from purchase orders and production reports that accumulate
costs on manufactured goods. The following general equation summarizes the
calculation of inventory transferred out of the inventory accounts:

Beginning inventory balance + additions during the month - ending inventory balance

     The equations that follow for each inventory account use the amounts from
the statement of cost of goods sold to illustrate the calculations for the amounts
transferred out of Materials, Work in Process, and Finished Goods, respectively.
The ledger account that corresponds to each type of inventory uses these same
amounts to show increases, decreases, and running balances. The ledger accounts
show the flow of manufacturing costs from Materials to Work in Process to
Finished Goods to Cost of Goods Sold.

    The accumulation of production costs, and the transfer of those costs from
account to account based on stage of completion, track the manufacturing process
from beginning to end, when the products are sold. This information is critical to
managers in manufacturing companies who make purchasing decisions, determine
selling prices, prepare sales budgets, and schedule production.

2Job Order Costing

2.1 INTRODUCTION

      Job order costing is a method of keeping track of the costs of manufactured
 items. Once products are completed, their overall costs are marked up and sold at
 a profit to customers.

      Job order costing is a method of cost accumulation that is used for items or
 batches of items that are unique - that is, each customer's order is different.
 Custom-made kitchen cabinets are an example of a manufactured product that
 is often customer-specific. Each order is based on different sizes, layouts, wood
 choices, finishes, hardware, installation costs, customer preferences, etc. No two
 orders are alike, so the total cost of each order will differ as a result. A single order
 might involve a homeowner updating her kitchen for a new look. A batch order
 might be processed for a home builder who is constructing 10 identical homes
 and therefore requires 10 of the same sets of cabinets. Each single or batch order
 is referred to as a job and is assigned a unique identification number, such as
 "Job 15".

      Costs accumulate on manufactured goods while they are in production. The
 three costs of production are direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead.
 For unique products, each job accumulates different amounts of each of these
 three costs. An analogy would be several patients in a doctor's office - each person
 has different symptoms and therefore receives different treatments, medications,
 and tests from the same doctor. Each person's total medical bill is like a "tab" that
 the patient has run up with the doctor.

      The three costs of production accumulate in an account called Work in Process,
 which is like the `tab" for the manufactured item. There are three debits to Work in
 Process - one for direct materials, one for direct labor, and one for factory overhead
 - as a result. The total of these three costs equals the cost of producing the item.

      The following Work in Process ledger for a single order assumes there is no
 beginning inventory and illustrates the three debits that represent the three costs
 of production.

2.    Materials moved to production  5,000                 9,000
3.
      Labor added to production      4,000                10,100

      Overhead added to production   1,100

    The total cost of this job is $10,100, as is shown in the final debit balance in
Work in Process ledger.

    A manufacturer may work on many jobs simultaneously. Even if several jobs
are started at once, it does not necessarily mean that they will all be completed at
the same time. In job order costing, each job is typically worked on at its unique
location on the production floor as material and labor come to the products, which
remain in place.

    The following series of journal entries describe and illustrate job order costing
transactions that are specific to accumulating the three costs of production:
materials, labor, and factory overhead.

1. Direct materials become an integral part of a manufactured product that is
    sold to a customer. They are requisitioned (asked for) and brought from the
    stockroom to the production area so that they can be worked on.

    Materials that cost $5,000 are requisitioned from the stockroom. This journal
entry represents the first of the three debits to the Work in Process account.

Account          Debit  Credit       First debit to Work in Process
Work in Process  5,000  5,000
                                      Work in Process is an asset (inventory)
  Materials                               account that is increasing

                                      Materials is an asset (inventory)
                                          account that is decreasing

    The wood, hinges, etc. that are considered direct materials are moved from the
Materials account (by crediting and reducing it) to the Work in Process account
(by debiting it and increasing it.) Work in Process is the asset account in which the
cost of the manufactured item accumulates, and materials is the first of the three
production costs.

2. Direct labor involves work done directly by factory laborers on
    manufactured items that are sold to customers. This journal entry represents
    the second of the three debits to the Work in Process account. In this case,
    direct labor is $4,000.

  Wages Payable                           account that is increasing

                                      Wages Payable is a liability account
                                          that is increasing

    Labor in the factory includes the hourly wages paid to production workers. It
is considered direct if a production employee is working on a product that will be
sold to a customer. Direct labor costs are added to Work in Process by debiting
that account and increasing it. Work in Process is the asset account in which the
cost of the manufactured item accumulates, and labor is the second of the three
production costs.

FACTORY OVERHEAD INCURRED

    The following six entries represent transactions that are recorded as debits
to the Factory Overhead account. This account is used to record all factory
expenses except direct materials and direct labor. Rather than Supplies Expense,
Maintenance Expense, Depreciation Expense, Insurance Expense, Wages Expense
(indirect), etc., the Factory Overhead account is used to substitute for any expense
incurred in the factory. Factory overhead costs are indirect because they cannot
be specifically traced to particular jobs, but are instead incurred in the factory as
a whole. Factory Overhead is debited (increased) for any actual overhead cost
incurred. While these expenses are in the Factory Overhead account, they are not
yet part of any of the manufactured items.

3. The company uses $400 of its raw materials to build a closet in the factory.

Account           Debit  Credit      Recording an expense in the factory as
Factory Overhead  400    400         Factory Overhead

  Materials                           Factory Overhead is an expense
                                          account that is increasing

                                      Materials is an asset (inventory)
                                          account that is decreasing

    Materials, such as wood, may be requisitioned for general factory use. These
materials are considered an indirect cost since they do not become part of a
manufactured item. Materials is credited just like it was for the requisition of direct
materials. In this case, Factory Overhead is debited for the indirect materials
rather than Work in Process.

    Supplies Expense is not used because the indirect expense occurs in the factory,
where all expenses are accounted for a Factory Overhead.

4. Wages of $300 are incurred for production employees building a closet in the
    factory.

Account             Debit  Credit    Recording an expense in the factory as

                                      Wages Payable is a liability account
                                          that is increasing

    If the same production employees also perform some general factory work,
such as hanging the wood shelves, the labor is considered indirect since the time
is not spent working on an actual manufactured item. Wages Payable is credited
just like it was for the direct labor. In this case, Factory Overhead is debited for the
indirect labor rather than Work in Process.

    Wages Expense is not used because the indirect expense occurs in the factory,
where all expenses are accounted for a Factory Overhead.

5. The company pays $350 cash for one of its utility bills.

Factory Overhead    350    350       Factory Overhead

                                      Cash is an asset account that is
                                          decreasing

    Factory Overhead is debited rather than Utilities Expense since the expense
occurs in the factory.

6. The company receives an invoice for $200 from a repairman who fixed a leak
    in the factory building.

    Factory Overhead is debited rather than Maintenance Expense since the
expense occurs in the factory.

                                                  that is decreasing

    Factory Overhead is debited rather than Insurance Expense since the expense
occurs in the factory.

8. The company records depreciation on factory equipment.

    Factory Overhead is debited rather than Depreciation Expense since the
expense occurs in the factory.

    Factory expenses accumulate in the Factory Overhead account, as just shown
in the journal entries (3) through (8). Notice that the Work in Process was not used
at all in these transactions, so at this point the third cost of manufacturing has not
been added to the cost of any job yet.

    Assuming there were no previous balances in the Work in Process or Factory
Overhead accounts, their ledgers would appear as follows based on the previous
eight transactions:

                                   Work in Process

                                           100

    So far there are only two entries in the Work in Process ledger account. The
third cost of production, factory overhead, must be added (or "applied") to Work in
Process to arrive at the total cost of the job(s). This final debit to Work in Process
allocates an estimated amount of the factory expenses from the Factory Overhead
account to the cost of each unit manufactured.

    Since all expenses associated with the period may not yet be determined and
all bills not yet received, actual factory overhead is not yet known. The running
balance of $1,500 shown may be incomplete since more bills may be outstanding.
The company needs timely information about the cost of each job, so factory
overhead is estimated at the time it is applied to Work in Process.

    Also, since factory overhead cannot be specifically traced to a particular job, it
is instead allocated to jobs using an activity base that estimates its consumption.
Each company uses a method of estimating that makes sense for them, so the
process can vary among companies. Three common activity bases used to allocate
factory overhead costs are (1) a percentage of direct labor cost (such as $1,500 x
20%) or the (2) number of direct labor hours or (3) number of machine hours.
When units such as hours are used, a predetermined factory overhead rate is
multiplied by the number of hours. The predetermined factory overhead rate
equals estimated total factory overhead costs divided by the estimated number of
hours in the activity base.

    In this example, assume total estimated factory overhead is $2,000. It will be
allocated, or applied to jobs, using a predetermined factory overhead rate that uses
an activity base of an estimated 200 direct labor hours. Therefore, $2,000 / 200 =
a factory overhead rate of $10 per direct labor hour.

    If 110 direct labor hours were actually used in this period's operations, factory
overhead applied to Work in Process would be $1,100 (110 hours x $10 per direct
labor hour). The journal entry that follows reflects this third cost of production
being added to the Work in Process and removed from the Factory Overhead
account using this estimating process.

9. The company applied $1,100 of factory overhead to jobs in production.

    The Factory Overhead account is reduced by crediting it, and that expense
amount is moved into the Work in Process (asset) account by debiting it.

    This journal entry represents the third of the three debits to the Work in
Process account.

    As shown in the ledger accounts that follow, there are now three entries in the
Work in Process ledger account. The third cost of production, factory overhead,
has been added (or "applied") to Work in Process to arrive at the total cost of the
job(s).

                                          ANALOGY

Assume three people go out on a Friday night (separately). Each will eat
dinner, have some drinks, and enjoy some entertainment - the three costs
of going out. Yet the food, beverages, and entertainment will be different for
each person, and, therefore, the costs will not be the same. Each person has a
"tab" - first the food, then the drinks, then the entertainment - that adds up
to the final cost of the night out.

Similarly, different products manufactured under job order costing each have
a "tab" on which their three costs - direct materials, direct labor, and factory
overhead - accumulate. The costs are different for each product, so the final
total for each is different as well.

2.2 COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE OF JOB ORDER
COSTING TRANSACTIONS FOR A MANUFACTURING
COMPANY

    The following example will expand upon the job order costing journal entries
previously presented and add other transactions in the manufacturing cycle. These
include purchasing raw materials, recording jobs completed, selling finished jobs,
and adjusting estimated to actual factory overhead incurred. The new transactions
will be marked as NEW and a brief explanation and/or calculation will follow each.

    Assume that Roberts Wonder Wood is a factory that produces custom kitchen
cabinets. Wood and metal hardware are the main materials used in production.
Roberts uses a job order costing system. The transactions are to be recorded for six
jobs in production in August, Roberts' first month of operations.

    The following information relates to production costs and usage for Roberts
during August.

    Once a job is completed, it is no longer considered work in process. It instead
must be reclassified as finished goods. To make this transfer, debit Finished Goods
to increase that inventory account and credit the Work in Process account to
decrease it.

    The amount of the transfer from Work in Process to Finished Goods is
determined by adding the three costs of production for each of the four jobs that
were completed. The schedule of cost of jobs completed organizes this information.
Each job has a materials cost, a factory labor cost, and a number of machine hours
that is multiplied by the predetermined factory overhead rate of $30 per hour.

    There are two journal entries for a sale. The first is to record the selling price of
the product to customers. The second is to reduce the inventory by its cost.

Add the selling prices of the two jobs sold: $4,100 + $5,200 = $9,300
Add the manufacturing costs of the two jobs sold: $2,530 + $3,470 = $6,000

    The amount of the transfer from Finished Goods to Cost of Goods Sold is
determined by adding the three costs of production for each of the two jobs that
were sold. The schedule of cost of jobs sold organizes this information. Each job
has a materials cost, a factory labor cost, and a number of machine hours that is
multiplied by the predetermined factory overhead rate of $30 per hour.

    This transaction may occur weeks or months after the product is manufactured
and sold. When all bills for the period have been received and all the actual costs
are known, the company adjusts the amount of estimated factory overhead to the
actual amount.

    Refer to transaction #7, recorded previously, and note that $2,100 of
factory overhead was applied to Work in Process based on an estimate using
machine hours.

    The company now knows that actual factory overhead is $2,150. Therefore,
factory overhead was under applied by $50 ($2,150 - $2,100) in transaction #7.
Reconciling the estimated and the actual amounts requires an additional credit
to Factory Overhead for $50. The first credit of $2,100 (transaction #7) plus this
follow-up credit of $50 in (transaction #10a) equals the actual factory overhead of
$2,150.

    Notice that the Cost of Goods Sold account is debited to adjust factory overhead
to its actual amount. The Work in Process account is not used when reconciling
estimated to actual factory overhead. If the difference between the two is unusually
large, the estimate may need to be revised in the future.

    The following is an alternative to transaction 10a. (Only 10a or 10b would
occur, not both.)

    Refer to transaction #7, recorded previously, and note that $2,100 of
factory overhead was applied to Work in Process at that time based on an estimate
using machine hours.

    The company now knows that actual factory overhead is $2,050. Therefore,
factory overhead was over applied by $50 ($2,100 - $2,050) in transaction #7.
Reconciling the estimated and the actual amounts requires a debit to Factory
Overhead for $50. The first credit of $2,100 (transaction #7) minus this follow-up
debit of $50 (transaction #10b) equals the actual factory overhead of $2,050.

    Two other questions related to the cost of jobs remaining in inventory may also
be asked:

1. What is the cost of the items remaining in Finished Goods?

Jobs 1, 2, 3, and 5 were completed. Of those, Jobs 2 and 5 were sold. Therefore,
Jobs 1 and 3 remain in Finished Goods.

Add the manufacturing costs of the two jobs that are completed but not sold:
$1,810 + $1,420 = $3,230

                         Schedule of Completed Jobs

Job 3                670           510      8 x $30 = 240           1,420

                                                 $ 420

2. What is the cost so far of the jobs that are still in Work in Process?

Jobs 4 and 6 were not finished at the end of the period.

Add the manufacturing costs of the two jobs that are not completed yet: $4,910 +
$1,850 = $6,760

                         Schedule of Uncompleted Jobs

Work in process  Materials  Factory Labor  Machine hours       Total cost
Job 4                                                            $4,910

    Assuming there were no previous balances, the inventory account ledgers
would appear as follows based on the previous transactions:

2.2.1 Selling and Administrative Expenses
    The previous problem deals only with the factory itself. Sometimes the factory

is part of a larger business. Period costs may also be required to generate revenue,

although they not involved in the manufacturing process. There may be a sales
staff and other expenses to promote and sell the manufactured items. In general,
these are classified as selling expenses. There may also be activities that do
not directly relate to production or sales but are necessary to run the business.
These may include a human resources department, an accounting department, a
company president, secretarial support staff, etc. All are considered administrative
expenses, outside of the factory part of the business. Here are examples that involve
selling, administrative and factory expenses. Factory Overhead is used to record
only factory expenses, but not selling or administrative costs.

1. The company uses some of its raw materials to build a closet in the factory
    ($200), shelving in the salespeople's offices ($150), and braces in the
    administrative area ($50), for a total of $400.

    is a factory expense, $100 is a selling expense, and $50 is an administrative
    expense, for a total of $350.

2.3 JOB ORDER COSTING FOR A SERVICE COMPANY

    Job order costing is also used for service businesses where the service and costs
are unique to each customer, such as those of an attorney, accountant, physician, or
event planner. Each customer, client, or patient is a separate job or project. Clients,
customers, and patients incur direct costs, direct labor and applied overhead costs.
And while there are no materials related to inventory for a service business, there
may be expenditures associated directly with a particular project, such as travel or
supplies.

2.3.1 Comprehensive Example of Job Order Costing
Transactions for a Service Company

    Creative Compton, Inc. is an advertising agency that designs web sites and
promotional materials for medium-sized businesses. For each client project,
Creative Compton accumulates the direct labor costs of its professional designers
at an hourly rate of $140. The company allocates overhead costs to jobs at a rate of
35% of total direct labor cost incurred. Creative Compton, Inc. earns a 60% profit
on each job.

    Journalize the journal entries for the direct labor, the overhead, the sale of the
project, and the reconciliation of actual to estimated overhead.

  Development Costs

    There are two journal entries for a sale. The first is to record the project's selling
price to the customer. The second is to reduce the development costs incurred and
expense them off to Cost of Services.

Cost of the project: $2,800 direct labor + $520 direct costs + $980 overhead costs
= $4,300

Selling price of the project: $4,300 costs x 1.6 to include the markup = $6,880

5. Actual overhead for Job 4 is ultimately determined to be $960.

between applied factory overhead and estimated factory overhead is $20 ($980
estimated - $960 actual). Since too much had been applied, $20 now needs to be
backed out by debiting the Overhead account. Cost of Services is used as the credit
account rather than Development Costs in reconciling the Overhead account.

3Process Costing
 3.1 INTRODUCTION

       Process costing is another method of keeping track of the costs of manufactured
  items. Once products are completed, their overall costs are marked up and sold at
  a profit to customers. Process costing is used when large quantities of identical
  items are manufactured in a continuous flow on a first-in, first-out basis. Examples
  of products that would use process costing are Cheerios brand cereal, iPhones, or
  Toyota Camrys.

       Items enter production in batches rather than individually. A batch is defined
  as each time a quantity of materials is added to the first point of production to
  keep the work flow going. Direct costs accumulate and indirect costs are applied
  to the batches as they move through the production processes. A unit is one of the
  products that is manufactured in a batch. Eventually, costs are averaged over the
  units produced during the period to determine the cost of one item.

       With process costing, products typically move from department to department
  in a "production line" format instead of the materials and labor coming to the
  product at one location (as is typically the case in job order costing, where each
  product is unique). Each department performs a different function and can be
  considered its own little business or mini-factory. As such, each department adds
  its own direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead costs. These three
  costs accumulate in a departmental account called Work in Process - Department
  Name, which is like the "tab" of the manufactured item. There will be three debits
  to Work in Process for each department - one for direct materials, one for direct
  labor, and one for factory overhead.

       As an example, a company manufactures the 16" chocolate chip cookies (yum!)
  similar to those in the cookie shops in the malls. The company's factory has three
  departments: (1) Mixing, (2) Baking, and (3) Packaging. The products move
  through these departments in order: Mixing first, Baking next, and Packaging
  last. The process occurs on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis where the first batch
  started is the first one to be completed. The batch started behind the first batch
  is the next to be completed, and so forth. Each time the Mixing Department adds
  more ingredients, a new batch is introduced into the overall production line.

       Process costing involves recording product costs for each manufacturing
  department (or process) as the product moves through. Each department has its

own Work in Process and Factory Overhead accounts that include the department
names, as follows:

Packaging                        Work in Process - Packaging  Factory Overhead - Packaging

    The batch moves from one department to the next. Materials, labor, and factory
overhead costs are added in each department. The sum of the departmental work
in process costs is the total cost of the batch that is transferred to Finished Goods.

3.2 PROCESS COSTING TRANSACTIONS FOR A
MANUFACTURING COMPANY

    Cost accumulation in each department and the transfer from one department
to the next is recorded using the following series of journal entries.

MIXING DEPARTMENT
    A batch begins in the Mixing Department when materials are added.

1. Direct materials - ingredients such as flour, eggs, sugar, and (of course)
    chocolate chips - that cost $4,600 and indirect materials that cost $400 are
    requisitioned.

2. Direct labor - workers combining ingredients, hand stirring the batter, and
    operating the mixers - costs $2,100 and indirect labor for general factory use
    costs $200.

    absorbs a proportionate share of the department's general factory costs, such
    as utilities, insurance, and supervisor salary.

    Notice there are three debits to Work in Process - Mixing for the three costs
of manufacturing in Mixing. These three debits total $7,700 ($4,600 + $2,100 +
$1,000).

    Once the batch is mixed, there is nothing more the Mixing Department can do;
in terms of mixing, the product is complete. The mixed batch is then sent off to the
Baking Department by crediting Work in Process - Mixing (decreasing that asset
account) and debiting Work in Process - Baking (increasing that asset account)
for $7,700.

4. Transfer from the Mixing Department to the Baking Department, $7,700

    (Although not illustrated here because our journal entries are only tracking
the first batch, as the work in process is transferred from Mixing to Baking, a new
batch of materials may be introduced into the Mixing Department to keep the flow
of production continuous.)

    Notice there are four debits to Work in Process - Baking. One is for the cost
transferred in from the Mixing Department; the others are the three costs of
manufacturing added in the Baking Department. These four debits total $10,200
($7,700 + $600 + $1,400 + $500).

    Once the batch is baked, there is nothing more the Baking Department can
do; as far as what it is set up to do, the product is complete. So, it transfers the
baked batch to the Packaging Department by crediting Work in Process - Baking
(decreasing that asset account) and debiting Work in Process - Packaging
(increasing that asset account) for $10,200.

manufacturing in Packaging. These four debits total $15,200 ($10,200 + $1,100 +
$3,000 + $900).

TRANSFER FROM PACKAGING DEPARTMENT TO FINISHED GOODS

    Once the batch is packed in boxes, there is nothing more the Packaging
Department can do; the product is entirely complete. The packaged batch is
transferred to Finished Goods at the overall accumulated cost of $15,200.

    The manufactured goods accumulate costs all throughout the production
process. Each batch picks up materials cost, direct labor cost, and factory overhead
cost in each of the three departments. The total of all these costs equals the total
cost of producing the batch. Determining the cost of the batch and the cost of each
unit in the batch is the goal of process costing.

    The process costing journal entries illustrate the cost accumulation process
through the three Work in Process accounts all the way through to Finished Goods.

    There are other process costing transactions that are similar to those for job
order costing. A process costing manufacturer would also purchase materials
on account, record numerous factory expenses by debiting Factory Overhead
(in a specific department), sell goods on account and recognize a corresponding
reduction of finished goods inventory, and account for over applied and under
applied factory overhead amounts. Examples of these transactions are shown under
the Job Order Costing topic and will not be repeated here. The only difference
between the two methods is that under process costing the department name must
be included whenever a Factory Overhead account is used.

TRACKING PRODUCT COSTS

    There are three departments in the cookie factory example, and each one
operates independently and does its own accounting. Assuming the company
prepares monthly financial statements, each department must provide monthly
information about its inventory for the balance sheet. We will now just look at the
recordkeeping that occurs in a single department for a one-month period.

    We will now focus only on the Packaging Department in the month of
May. Assume you are the Packaging Department manager. You are responsible
for keeping track of the cost of every unit that has been started and passes through
your department during the month, whether the units have been finished by the

                                             Page | 34
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING  PROCESS COSTING

end of May or not. For those units that have been completed, you must figure the
total cost of each batch and the cost of each unit in the batch. For those units
that are in production but not yet completed by the end of the month, you must
determine the cost to date of that batch and each unit in the batch.

    We will make two assumptions: (1) All materials that are needed to work on a
batch of items in a department are added when the batch is started; (2) When a
batch is started in the department, it will either be completed in the same month
or completed in the following month.

    Remember that there are three costs of a manufactured item: direct materials,
direct labor, and factory overhead. Conversion costs are simply direct labor
PLUS factory overhead. For process costing, the two costs of a manufactured item
will be referred to as direct materials and conversion costs.

                                              ANALOGY

   There are three departments in this factory. If you are the manager of the
   Packaging Department, your responsibility is limited to tracking the costs of
   the units in your department, but not in any of the other departments. The
   other departments have their own managers to take care of accounting for
   their costs. You don't have to keep track of the cost of every item in EVERY
   department - just your own.

   Similarly, as a university professor, I have to report final course grades for the
   160 students in my four classes. During the semester I record exam, homework,
   and project grades for my students, and from those I mathematically calculate
   each student's final course grade. It is my responsibility to do this for every
   student in my classes, but I do not have to calculate the final course grades for
   all students in all classes at the university!

    In a process costing system, both the cost of units transferred out of each
department and the cost of any partially completed units remaining in the
department must be determined.

    In each department, we determine both the total and per-unit costs of the
products that were completed in a given month. These completed units are
classified into two groups: those started in the previous month and those started in
the current month. The per-unit cost is not necessarily the same in the two groups,
and any difference may be analyzed to see if unit cost is decreasing (typically
favorable) or increasing (unfavorable) over time.

    We also accumulate costs for a third group of products: those started in the
current month but not completed by the end of the month. Their costs include
100% of the materials cost and a percentage below 100% of the conversion costs
based on how complete they are to date. This third group, not finished by the end

                                                     Page | 35
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                               PROCESS COSTING

of the current month, becomes the beginning work in process for the next month,
when the remaining conversion will take place to complete them.

    The following timeline illustrates the flow of product from month to month.

3.3 PROCESS COSTING CALCULATIONS FOR A
DEPARTMENT IN A MANUFACTURING COMPANY

    Goals of process costing are to determine a manufacturing department's cost
of finished goods during a month and the cost of work in process at the end of that
month. An example of the process follows.

    Information for production in the Packaging Department for May is as
follows:

Beginning work in process, May 1: 5,900 units, 20% completed (1)  $102,896
Direct materials costs in May for 44,700 units                     599,427
Direct labor costs incurred in May                                 589,323
Factory overhead costs incurred in May                             314,601
Work completed in May: 43,300 units
Ending work in process, May 31: 7,300 units, 30% completed (3)

    A grid is used to organize the unit (not dollar) information above and to
calculate key amounts.

    The first step is to classify the units into one of three groups in the whole
units column based on when they were started and completed according to the
information given.

                           50,600

(1) Group 1 consists of 5,900 (given) units started the previous month and
completed this month.

(2) Group 2 includes 37,400 units that are both started and completed this month.
This amount must be calculated in one of two ways.

              a. Total completed in May (43,300) minus those started in April
                  (5,900) = 37,400

              b. Total started in May (44,700) minus those not completed in May
                  (7,300) = 37,400 (Remember the assumption that the job is started
                  when materials are added.)

(3) Group 3 has 7,300 (given) units started this month to be completed next month.

(4) Total whole units equals the sum of the whole units in the three groups:
                            5,900 + 37,400 + 7,300 = 50,600

    The second step is to classify the units into one of three groups in the equivalent
units of production for materials column based on when they were started
and completed according to the information given. Remember the assumption is
that materials are added when a batch is started. Equivalent units of production for
materials equals the number of units in each group that had materials added in May.

    The first group was started in April, so none of the whole units had materials
added in May (all were added in April, when started). The second and third groups
were started in May, so all of the whole units had materials added in May.

(5) Group 1: The equivalent units of production for materials is zero.

(6) Group 2: The equivalent units of production is the same as the whole units
amount, 37,400.

(7) Group 3: The equivalent units of production is the same as the whole units
amount, 7,300.

(8) Total materials equals the sum of the materials in the three groups.
                      Calculation: 0 + 37,400 + 7,300 = 44,700

    The third step is to classify the units into one of three groups in the equivalent
units of production for conversion costs (direct labor and factory overhead)
column based on when they were started and completed according to the
information given.

                                            44,700

    Equivalent units of production for conversion costs uses the percentages of
conversion costs completed in May that are given to mathematically convert partial
units to whole units for costing purposes. The equivalent units of production
for conversion costs equals the number of whole units times the percentage of
conversion that takes place in May.

(9) Group 1: The units were already 20% complete at the beginning of May, so the
remaining 80% of the conversion costs are incurred in May.

                            Calculation: 5,900 x 80% = 4,720

(10) Group 2: These units are started and completed in May, so 100% of the
conversion costs takes place in May.

                          Calculation: 37,400 x 100% = 37,400

(11) Group 3: Only 30% of the conversion costs takes place in May. The remaining
conversion will take place in June.

                             Calculation: 7,300 x 30% = 2,190

(12) Total equivalent units of production for conversion costs equals the sum of the
three groups.

                    Calculation: 4,720 + 37,400 + 2,190 = 44,310

                                           EXAMPLE

Think of equivalent units of production for conversion costs like this. You
have 8 one-gallon buckets in your backyard. It starts to pour rain. When the
rain stops, you go out and see that each bucket is 3/4 full. Mathematically you
can convert this to say that the same amount of water would make 6 of the
buckets 100% full (8 x 3/4). It is highly unlikely that it would rain in such a
way that only one bucket would fill at a time. But after the rain stopped, you
could empty two of the buckets by filling the other six.

(If you had to carry the water a mile and could only carry two buckets at a
time, combining them would save you one trip! You would only have to go
three times rather than four!)

    The following dollar amounts should now be calculated from the information
given, as follows:

1. Total conversion costs in May
                                             Calculation:

     $589,323 (direct labor) + $314,601 (factory overhead) = $903,924

2. Conversion cost per equivalent unit
                                             Calculation:

$903,924 total conversion cost /44,310 equivalent units = $20.40 per unit

3. Materials cost per unit started in May
                                             Calculation:

$599,427 total materials cost / 44,700 units started = $13.41 per unit

4. Cost per unit of work in process on May 1 (100% of materials + 20% of
    conversion costs)
                                             Calculation:

$102,896 total work in process cost / 5,900 units started = $17.44 per unit

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                    PROCESS COSTING

    In a process costing system, the cost of units transferred out of each department
must be determined as well as the cost of any partially completed units remaining
in the department. Based on the previous calculations, the following seven cost
results can be determined. These amounts are the goals of process costing and can
be used to determine progress and for comparison purposes over time.

1. Cost per unit of finished goods started in April and completed in May
    Calculation: $17.44 + ($20.40 x 80%) = $17.44 + $16.32 = $33.76

2. Total cost of all finished goods started in April and completed in May
       Calculation: $33.76 (from #1) x 5,900 whole units = $199,184

3. Cost per unit of finished goods started and completed in May
                         Calculation: $13.41 + $20.40 = $33.81

4. Total cost of all finished goods started and completed in May
     Calculation: $33.81 (from #2) x 37,400 whole units = $1,264,494

5. Cost per unit of the work in process inventory on May 31
                  Calculation: $13.41 + ($20.40 x 30%) = $19.53

6. Total cost of the work in process inventory on May 31
       Calculation: $19.53 (from #3) x 7,300 whole units = $142,569

7. Total cost of units transferred to Finished Goods
                Calculation: $199,184 + $1,264,494 = $1,463,678

4Activity-Based Costing

4.1 INTRODUCTION

     Companies must accurately determine the costs of their products and services
to make sound management decisions, such as determining their selling prices
to customers. A manufacturer's product costs consist of direct materials, direct
labor, and factory overhead. The materials and labor are direct costs that can be
identified and traced to the product. Factory overhead, however, are indirect and
must be allocated to the product cost on an estimated basis.

     We have already looked at applying factory overhead to work in process using
a predetermined factory overhead rate in the discussion of job order costing. We
used a single factory overhead rate based on direct labor hours, total direct labor,
or machine hours.

     The following journal entry is an example of allocating $2,100 of factory
overhead to work in process.

Account             Debit  Credit   Work in Process is an asset (inventory)
Work in Process     2,100  2,100        account that is increasing

  Factory Overhead                  Factory Overhead is an expense
                                        account that is decreasing

    The issue we address now is how precise the estimate of $2,100 actually is.
Three different ways of allocating factory overhead will be looked at, as follows:

         1. Single factory-wide rate - the same rate based on the same activity base
             for all departments

         2. Departmental rates - different rates for different departments, but a
             single rate within a department

         3. Activity-based costing - different rates for different processes and
             activities, regardless of department

    An example of two different orders of custom wood furniture will be used to
illustrate the three methods. Both the direct materials and direct labor costs are

                                   Page | 42
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                      PROCESS COSTING

known for each job; only the factory overhead must be estimated. Assume jobs are
manufactured in a factory with two departments, Cutting and Assembly.

4.2 SINGLE FACTORY RATE TO ESTIMATE FACTORY
OVERHEAD

    A single predetermined rate may be used to estimate factory overhead in all
departments. The following amounts are given. Estimated factory overhead is
based on number of direct labor hours used.

Total budgeted factory overhead costs for the year                       $546,000
Total budgeted direct labor hours                                             3,000

The factory overhead rate is $182 per direct labor hour, determined as follows.

Total budgeted factory overhead        $546,000
  Total budgeted activity base                        = $182

                                            3,000

    If 300 direct labor hours are used for the two jobs as follows, total estimated
factory overhead is $54,600.

Job 1:              210 hours x $182 per direct labor hour =             $38,220
Job 2:              90 hours x $182 per direct labor hour =               16,380

                                                                  Total  $54,600

The journal entry to apply factory overhead of $54,600 to the jobs is as follows:

Account             Debit   Credit    Work in Process is an asset (inventory)
Work in Process     54,600  54,600        account that is increasing

  Factory Overhead                    Factory Overhead is an expense
                                          account that is decreasing

    Rather than direct labor hours, machine hours, percentage of direct labor, or
other relevant activity base could be used to estimate factory overhead.

    The single factory-wide rate is relatively simple to apply, but it assumes the
same rate across all departments, each of which performs different functions. It
also assumes all products consume factory overhead at the same rate. This "one-
size-fits-all" approach may not be as accurate as other more targeted methods of
estimating.

4.3 DEPARTMENTAL RATES TO ESTIMATE
FACTORY OVERHEAD

    A different predetermined rate may be used to estimate factory overhead in
each department. Within a department, the rate is the same for all products. The
following amounts are given.

Total budgeted factory overhead costs for the Cutting Department for the year     $310,000
Total budgeted direct labor hours for the Cutting Department                           2,000

Total budgeted factory overhead costs for the Assembly Department for the year    $236,000
Total budgeted direct labor hours for the Assembly Department                          1,000

    The department factory overhead rate is $155 per direct labor hour in the
Cutting Department and $236 per direct labor hour in the Assembly Department,
determined as follows.

Budgeted departmental factory overhead    Cutting          Assembly
Departmental budgeted activity base     $310,000            $236,000
                                                                 1,000 = $236
                                             2,000 = $155

Direct labor hours used and factory overhead estimated for this job are as follows:

Job 1:  Cutting Department              135 direct labor hours x $155 =           $20,925
Job 1:  Assembly Department             75 direct labor hours x $236 =             17,700
Job 1:
        Cutting Department                                                 Total  $38,625
Job 2:  Assembly Department
Job 2:                                  65 direct labor hours x $155 =            $10,075
Job 2:                                  25 direct labor hours x $236 =               5,900

                                                                           Total  $15,975

                                                                          Total   $54,600

The journal entry to apply factory overhead of $54,600 to this job is as follows:

Account             Debit   Credit       Work in Process is an asset (inventory)
Work in Process     54,600  54,600           account that is increasing

  Factory Overhead                       Factory Overhead is an expense
                                             account that is decreasing

    In the example so far, the use of departmental rates vs. a single factory rate
yields different results in terms of how much factory overhead is applied to each
of the two jobs. Although the total factory overhead applied, $54,600, is the same
under both methods, the amount allocated to each job differs, as follows:

                                        Page | 44
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                    PROCESS COSTING

Job 1:  Single Factory               Departmental
Job 2:           $38,220                     $38,625

    Using departmental rates is more job-specific and therefore results in a more
precise allocation of factory overhead to the jobs than the single rate. However, it
takes a bit more effort to calculate vs. using the single factory rate that is applied
to all jobs uniformly.

4.4 ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING FOR A
MANUFACTURING BUSINESS TO ESTIMATE
FACTORY OVERHEAD

EXAMPLE 1

    Recall that the simplest method for estimating factory overhead is to use the
same predetermined rate in all departments, for all activities, and for all products
in a manufacturing facility. Two amounts must be estimated for the calculation, as
follows:

           Total budgeted factory overhead
              Total budgeted activity base (such as direct labor hours, machine hours, etc.)

    The single factory overhead rate is a very loose estimate because it relies on
one fixed dollar amount to assign factory overhead costs across the many facets,
various segments, and different activities involved in the manufacturing process.
It is unlikely that one rate can capture all the diversity of what goes on in a factory
with reliable precision.

    Activity-based costing (ABC) is a more specific and more accurate way of
assigning factory overhead to manufactured goods versus using single factory or
departmental rates. An activity is a unit of work that consumes resources when
performed by a company. A cost object (in the case of manufacturing, the item
produced) is the target of the activity. Cost objects include products, jobs, services,
projects, clients, patients, customers, and contracts.

    In a factory, ABC identifies activities within the manufacturing process that
occur repeatedly, such as purchasing, production scheduling, setups, moves,
inspections, testing, clean-ups, and invoicing. Each activity has its own activity base
to measure usage. The following list matches common activities of a manufacturing
company with their respective activity bases.

Purchasing                  Number of purchase orders
Quality control             Number of inspections

    A factory overhead rate for each routinely-performed activity is calculated by
dividing the total budgeted cost amount for the activity for a period by the budgeted
activity base quantity over the same time frame. The fraction for each activity is
similar to the one used for the predetermined single factory rate, except at a more
micro level.

    There may still be some factory overhead costs that are not associated with
any particular activity for the cutting and assembly processes. These may include
factory expenses such as utilities, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. These
general overhead costs must be applied to jobs on an estimated (or "budgeted")
basis. In this example, machine hours and direct labor hours will be used as the
activity base for cutting and assembly, respectively. Factory overhead amounts for
the cutting and assembly processes will be less than those under the single rate or
departmental rate methods since the costs for identifiable activities have already
been separated out.

    The following information lists a company's six production activities and a
fraction for each that is used to determine the activity rate in the right column.
The denominator for each fraction is the activity base used. The amounts in
the Calculation column are estimates that are given, presumably prepared by
management using available company data.

    The following example will illustrate ABC for estimating factory overhead for
a custom furniture manufacturer whose production takes place in its Cutting and
Assembly departments. Identifiable activities include setups, moves, inspections,
and cleanups.

    The company uses ABC to estimate factory overhead for two jobs. Job 1 is a
batch of 300 identical nine-drawer wood dressers. Job 2 is a batch of 160 identical
free-standing wood clothing closets.

    The usage amounts of these activities for each job are given in the following
table. For each job, the number of times each activity occurs is multiplied by the
overhead rate for that activity. The sum of all the activity costs is the amount of
factory overhead applied to the job.

Activity            Activity Rate (calculated above)  Dresser Usage      Dresser Costs        Closet Usage       Closet Costs
Setups              $50 per setup                     24 setups        $50 x 24 = $1,200         10 setups       $50 x 10 = $500

                                                                                                                $15 x 90 = 1,350

The journal entry to apply factory overhead of $54,600 ($37,500 + $17,100) to the
two jobs using ABC is as follows:

4.5 DIFFERENCES BASED ON FACTORY OVERHEAD
METHOD

    Although the total factory overhead applied, $54,600, is the same for all three
methods, how it is allocated between the two jobs varies by method, as follows:

           Job 1:  Single Factory        Departmental      ABC Costing
           Job 2:           $38,220              $38,625          $37,500
           Total              16,380               15,975           17,100
                            $54,600              $54,600          $54,600

    ABC is the most specific strategy because it analyzes identifiable activities
closely, resulting in more precise estimates of many of the elements of overall
factory overhead. The results of the other two methods in the sample problem
would overstate the amount of factory overhead that is applied to Job 1 and
understate the amount for Job 2. When making decisions, such as determining a
product's selling price, it is critical to have sound cost information.

4.6 ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING FOR A
MANUFACTURING BUSINESS TO ESTIMATE
FACTORY OVERHEAD

EXAMPLE 2

    Speed Rider, Inc. manufactures golf carts and go karts. The company budgeted
$562,000 for the year for factory overhead and assigned it to four activities:
fabrication, $195,000; assembly, $160,000; setup, $138,000; and inspection,
$84,000. The company plans to produce 500 golf carts and 700 go karts during
the year.

    The activity-base usage quantities for each product by each activity are as
follows:

Golf cart  Fabrication  Assembly                 Setup       Inspection
Go kart    1,800 dlh    1,600 dlh                200 setups  700 inspections
           1,200        2,400                    400         500

Determine the activity-based factory overhead per unit for each product.

1. Calculate the rate for each activity

Fabrication        $195,000 / (1,800 + 1,200) = $65 per direct labor hour
Assembly           $160,000 / (1,600 + 2,400) = $40 per direct labor hour
Setup
Inspection              $138,000 / (200 + 400) = $230 per setup
                        $ 84,000 / (700 + 500) = $70 per inspection

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                           PROCESS COSTING

2. Calculate the total overhead for each vehicle by adding its four overhead costs.

Golf cart ($65 x 1,800 dlh) + ($40 x 1,600 dlh) + ($230 x 200 setups) + ($70 x 700 inspections)

$117,000                +  $64,000  +              $46,000  +                 $49,000            = $276,000

Go kart ($65 x 1,200 dlh) + ($40 x 2,400 dlh) + ($230 x 400 setups) + ($70 x 500 inspections)

$78,000                 +  $96,000  +              $92,000  +                 $35,000            = $301,000

3. Calculate the overhead per vehicle by dividing total cost for all units by the
    number of units budgeted.

Golf cart  $276,000 / 500 units = $552 factory overhead per jet ski
Go kart    $301,000 / 700 units = $430 factory overhead per snowmobile

4.7 ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING FOR A SERVICE
BUSINESS TO ESTIMATE FACTORY OVERHEAD

    Service businesses may also use activity-based costing to allocate general
overhead costs to clients, patients, and guests, also by estimating costs of activities
based on their use of resources, and assigning costs to customers based on their
use of activities.

    A hospital, for example, might identify the following activities whose general
costs must be shared among patients. Each activity rate is estimated based on the
activity's budgeted overhead cost for the year divided by the number of occurrences
expected during the year. For each patient stay, the number of times each activity
occurs is multiplied by the overhead rate for that activity. The sum of all the activity
costs is the amount of overhead applied to the cost of servicing the patient.

    ABC costing for a patient's six-day stay in a hospital is summarized in the
following table.

Activity                Activity Rate (estimated)  Patient usage              Patient Costs
Admissions              $70 per admission          1 admission
Operating room use      $900 per hour              4 hours                    $70 x 1 =          $70
Dispensing medications  $25 per administration     3 times per day / 6 days
Radiology testing       $290 per image             2 images                   $900 x 4 = 3,600
Diagnostic lab          $150 test                  6 tests
Medical assistance      $20 per visit              6 visits per day / 6 days  $25 x 3 x 6 =      450
Cleaning and laundry    $80 per day                6 days
Discharge               $100 per discharge         1 discharge                $290 x 2 =         580

                                                                              $150 x 6 = 900 =   900

                                                                              $20 x 6 x 6 =      720

                                                                              $80 x 6 =          480

                                                                              $100 x 1 =         100

                                                                              TOTAL              $6,900

A total of $6,900 of overhead costs is associated with this patient's hospital stay.

    ABC increases the accuracy of allocating overhead by budgeting multiple
targeted activities that can be estimated more precisely than relying on one

general overhead rate that applies to all overhead in a business This more granular
approach also gives companies better insight into ways to control the cost of a
product, such as reducing the time it takes to perform an activity or decreasing the
number of times an activity occurs.

    ABC helps managers, who already view costs by activity, and accountants
communicate more effectively. "An activity-based system aligns organizational
information with the business mission and operations rather than financial
transactions. It tears down the barriers that segregate financial information from
other information."1

5Cost Volume Profit Analysis
  5.1 INTRODUCTION

       Businesses focus on profitability and look for ways to improve operational
  performance by analyzing projected or actual financial information. One relatively
  simple strategy is to look at cost behavior, which is how costs respond to changes
  in sales volume. Knowing how costs behave helps managers forecast operating
  income based on sales volume. This insight also helps managers estimate costs
  related to the decisions they make in the business.

COST CLASSIFICATIONS

    Costs are classified as variable, fixed, or mixed.
    A variable cost is an expenditure directly associated with a sale. For each sale
of a unit of product or service, one unit of variable cost is incurred.
    The following are three examples. The sale of one manufactured desk for $200
includes the direct materials and direct labor costs combined of $100. The sale of
one pizza for $10 has the variable cost of $3 for the cost of the ingredients. The
rental of one room night at a hotel for $80 has the variable cost $5 for the guests'
breakfast that is included. There is only a variable cost if there is sale. The more
sales there are, the more total variable cost there is.
    The following table illustrates the cost behavior of a variable cost using the
pizza example.

Number of    Variable cost  Total variable cost
pizzas sold     per pizza   for all pizzas sold
                    $3
     200             3               $600
     400             3               1,200
     600             3               1,800
     800                             2,400

Variable cost behavior is summarized as follows:

         1. Variable cost per unit is the same regardless of number of units sold
             Example: Regardless whether 200 or 800 pizzas are sold, the cost of
             making each pizza is $3.

             Page | 51
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING   COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

2. Total variable cost increases (or decreases) as the number of units sold
   increases (or decreases)
   Example: Total variable cost is $600 for 200 pizzas sold and increases
   to $2,400 for 800 pizzas.
   The more pizzas sold, the more the total variable cost is.

    Fixed costs remain the same in terms of their total dollar amount, regardless
of the number of units sold. These are general expenditures that cannot be traced
to any one item sold and may include electricity, insurance, depreciation, salary,
and rent expenses.

    Fixed costs are considered within a relevant range. The costs remain the same
regardless of the number of units sold until capacity has been reached, at which
time the company cannot produce or sell any more without spending money for
expansion. We will assume for our examples that the business is operating within
its relevant range.

    The following table illustrates fixed and variable cost behaviors using the pizza
example.

Number of        Total    Fixed cost  Variable cost        Total
pizzas sold  fixed costs   per pizza    per pizza    variable costs
                                           $3.00
     200         $480        $2.40          3.00           $600
     400          480         1.20          3.00           1,200
     600          480         0.80          3.00           1,800
     800          480         0.60                         2,400

         1. Total fixed costs remain the same regardless of the level of sales.
             Example: Regardless whether 200 or 800 pizzas are sold, total fixed
             cost is $480.

         2. Fixed cost per unit decreases (increases) as the number of units sold
             increases (decreases)
             Example: Fixed cost per unit is $2.40 for 200 pizzas sold and decreases
             to $.60 each for 800 pizzas.

    The term leverage relates to fixed costs in terms of their ability to generate
sales. Since a company is committed to paying them, it wants to maximize the
value from doing so. The goal is to "get the most bang for your buck" for the fixed
amount the company must pay each period. Leverage is taking advantage of fixed
costs to generate sales. The more sales, the better fixed costs have been leveraged.

    The table that follows summarizes the cost totals for the four quantities/
batches of pizza sold.

           200        1,200 + 480 = 1,680    1.20 + 3.00 = 4.20    1,680 / 400 pizzas = 4.20
           400        1,800 + 480 = 2,280    0.80 + 3.00 = 3.80    2,280 / 600 pizzas = 3.80
           600        2,400 + 480 = 2,880    0.60 + 3.00 = 3.60    2,880 / 800 pizzas = 3.60
           800

    The total cost of a batch of pizzas equals total variable cost plus total fixed cost.
The cost per pizza in each batch can be determined in two ways: (1) fixed cost per
pizza plus variable cost per pizza or (2) total cost per batch divided by the number
of pizzas in the batch. Both calculations produce the same result.

    The batch of 800 units generates the most sales dollars from its fixed costs and
therefore leverages them most effectively. The more highly leveraged, the lower
the fixed cost per unit. In this case, the $480 is spread over more units, so each
unit picks up a lower amount of that $480. And the lower the fixed cost per unit,
the lower the total cost per unit, which is a desirable goal.

    Mixed costs have both a fixed and a variable component. There is typically
a base amount that is incurred even if there are no sales at all. There is also an
incremental amount assigned to each unit sold.

    The following are three examples of mixed costs. A prepaid cell phone plan
might include a base rate of $30 for1G of data and $5 for each additional 300
megabytes of data. A sales person might earn a base salary of $25,000 per year
plus $3 for each unit of product he sells. Equipment rental may cost $8,000 per
year plus $1 for each hour used over 10,000 hours.

    For purposes of analysis, mixed costs are separated into their fixed and variable
components. The high-low estimation method may be used to break out the costs
by looking at the total sales in dollars and the total cost of those sales for several
periods, such as months. The month with the highest activity level and the month
with the lowest activity level are selected for the calculation.

    The high-low method of separating costs is illustrated using the following
information over a six-month period.

                      Month     Units sold    Total cost
                     January        1,400      $52,700
                     February       2,100       61,200
                      March                     69,800
                               2,900 highest    66,400
                        April       2,500       48,200
                        May                     56,900
                       June    1,100 lowest
                                    1,800

    Since the fixed cost does not change with the number of sales, the difference
between the total costs of the month with the most units sold (March) and the
month with the fewest units sold (May) must be variable costs. Therefore, using
data from these two months,

                                                     Page | 53
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING  COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

Variable cost per unit =  Difference in total cost / Difference in units sold
Variable cost per unit =  (69,800 - 48,200) / (2,900 - 1,100)
                          $21,600 / 1,800 units sold = $12

    Now that the variable cost per unit is known to be $12, the fixed costs can be
determined by used either the March (highest sales) or May (lowest sales) using
the following equation:

March:                   Total cost - variable costs = fixed costs
May:    $69,800 - ($12 per unit x 2,900 units sold) = $69,800 - $34,800 = $35,000
        $48,200 - ($12 per unit x 1,100 units sold) = $48,200 - $13,200 = $35,000

    The high-low method estimates that variable cost per unit is $12 and fixed
costs are $35,000.

5.2 COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS (CVP)

    Cost volume profit (CVP) analysis is a managerial accounting technique used to
determine how changes in sales volume, variable costs, fixed costs, and/or selling
price per unit affect a business's operating income. The focus may be on a single
product or on a sales mix of two or more different products.

    The results of these analyses help managers make informed decisions about
products or services they sell, such as setting selling prices, selecting combinations
of different products to sell, projecting profitability, and determining the feasibility
of offering a product or service for sale.

The elements of CVP analysis are defined as follows:
a. Selling price - the amount a customer pays to acquire a product or service
b. Cost - the variable and fixed expenses involved in producing or selling a

    product or service
c. Volume - the number of units or the amount of service sold
d. Profit - the difference between the selling price of a product (or service) minus

    the costs to produce (or provide) it

The following assumptions are made when performing a CVP analysis.
1. All costs are categorized as either fixed or variable.
2. Sales price per unit, variable cost per unit and total fixed cost are constant.

    The only factors that affect costs are changes in activity.
3. All units produced are sold.

5.2.1 Contribution Margin

    Managers must monitor a company's sales volume to track whether it is
sufficient to cover, and hopefully exceed, fixed costs for a period, such as a
month. Contribution margin is useful in determining how much of the dollar
sales amount is available to apply toward paying fixed costs during the period.
Contribution margin is calculated at two different levels.

1. Unit contribution margin = selling price of one unit - variable cost of
   one unit

2. Total contribution margin = total sales - total variable costs

The following information relates to Jonick Company for the month of June:

         Sales                       1,000 units
         Selling price per unit      $25
         Variable cost per unit      $10
         Fixed costs                 $8,000

1. Unit contribution margin = selling price of one unit - variable cost of one unit

                                                        $15 = $25 - $10

    The unit contribution margin is $15, which is the $25 sales price per unit minus
the $10 variable cost per unit. With each sale, $15 is left after the variable cost is
paid to go toward paying down the fixed costs.

2. Total contribution margin = total sales - total variable costs

$15 x 1,000 units = $25 x 1,000 units -  $10 x 10,000 units
                                                10,000
$15,000  =  $25,000                  -

    The total contribution margin is $15,000 is the $25,000 total sales amount
minus $10,000 in variable cost. The $15,000 is available to pay the fixed costs.
Since fixed costs are only $8,000, there is operating income of $7,000.

    The following income statement information separates variable and fixed costs
and is formatted to show the contribution margin.

Sales                                    $25,000
Variable costs                            10,000
Contribution margin
Fixed costs                              $15,000
Operating income                            8,000

                                          $7,000

            Page | 55
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING               COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

    Contribution margin may also be expressed as a ratio, showing the percentage
of sales that is available to pay fixed costs. The calculation is simply the contribution
margin divided by sales. The same percentage results regardless of whether total
or per unit amounts are used.

                                     selling price of one unit - variable cost of one unit $25 - $10
1. Unit contribution margin ratio =                                                   = $25 = 60%
                                      selling price of one unit

                                total sales - total variable costs $25,000 - $10,000
2. Total contribution margin =                    = $25,000 = 60%
                                     total sales

    The higher the percentage, the more of each sales dollar that is available to
pay fixed costs. To determine if the percentage is satisfactory, management would
compare the result to previous periods, forecasted performance, contribution
margin ratios of similar companies, or industry standards. If the company's
contribution margin ratio is higher than the basis for comparison, the result is
favorable.

    The following three independent examples show the effects of increases in sale
volume, selling price per unit, and variable cost per unit, respectively.

EXAMPLE 1

Change in sales volume: effect on contribution margin ratio

    As the number of units sold increases, so does operating income when fixed
costs are within their relevant range and remain the same. This is shown in the
following two income statements with sales of 1,200 and 1,400 units, respectively.

1,200 units sold x $25 selling price              1,400 units sold x $25 selling price
1,200 units sold x $10 variable cost              1,400 units sold x $10 variable cost

Sales                                $30,000      Sales                               $35,000
Variable costs                        12,000      Variable costs                       14,000
Contribution margin                               Contribution margin
Fixed costs                          $18,000      Fixed costs                         $21,000
Operating income                        8,000     Operating income                       8,000

                                     $10,000                                          $13,000

(30,000 - 12,000) / 30,000 = 60% contribution margin (35,000 - 14,000) / 35,000 = 60% contribution margin

    Contribution margin remains at 60% regardless of the sales volume. As sales
increase, variable costs increase proportionately.

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING               COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

EXAMPLE 2
Change in selling price per unit: effect on contribution margin ratio

    Alternatively, if the selling price per unit increases from $25 to $30 per unit,
both operating income and the contribution margin ratio increase as well. Variable
cost per unit remains at $10 and fixed costs are still $8,000.

Original: $25 x 1,000 = $25,000 in sales          Revised: $30 x 1,000 = $30,000 in sales

Sales                $25,000                      Sales                $30,000
Variable costs        10,000                      Variable costs        10,000
Contribution margin                               Contribution margin
Fixed costs          $15,000                      Fixed costs          $20,000
Operating income        8,000                     Operating income        8,000

                      $7,000                                           $12,000

(25,000 - 10,000) / 25,000 = 60% contribution margin (30,000 - 10,000) / 30,000 = 67% contribution margin

    The contribution margin ratio with the selling price increase is 67%. The
additional $5 per unit in unit selling price adds 7% to the contribution margin
ratio.

EXAMPLE 3

Change in variable cost per unit: effect on contribution margin ratio

    Finally, if the selling price per unit remains at $25 and fixed costs remain the
same, but unit variable cost increases from $10 to $15, total variable cost increases.
As a result, the contribution margin and operating income amounts decrease.

Original: $10 x 1,000 = $10,000 in variable cost  Revised: $15 x 1,000 = $15,000 in variable cost

Sales                $25,000                      Sales                $25,000
Variable costs        10,000                      Variable costs        15,000
Contribution margin                               Contribution margin
Fixed costs          $15,000                      Fixed costs          $10,000
Operating income        8,000                     Operating income        8,000

                      $7,000                                            $2,000

(25,000 - 10,000) / 25,000 = 60% contribution margin (25,000 - 15,000) / 25,000 = 40% contribution margin

    The contribution margin ratio with the unit variable cost increase is 40%. The
additional $5 per unit in the variable cost lowers the contribution margin ratio 20%.

    Each of these three examples could be illustrated with a change in the opposite
direction. A decrease in sales quantity would not impact the contribution margin

                                                     Page | 57
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                  COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

ratio. A decrease in unit selling price would also decrease this ratio, and a decrease
in unit variable cost would increase it. Any change in fixed costs, although not
illustrated in the examples, would not affect the contribution margin ratio.

5.3 BREAKEVEN POINT

    The breakeven point is the number of units that must be sold to achieve an
operating income of zero. At the breakeven point, sales in dollars equals costs. The
breakeven calculation answers the question How many units does the company
have to sell to pay all its expenses for the month?

    This slightly revised information relates to Jonick Company for the month of
June and will be used to illustrate the breakeven point.

                            Sales                   1,000 units
                            Selling price per unit  $18
                            Variable cost per unit  $10
                            Fixed costs             $8,000

The following income statement presents a breakeven situation.

                            Sales                                       $18,000
                            Variable costs                               10,000
                            Contribution margin                          $8,000
                            Fixed costs                                    8,000
                            Operating income                                   $0

    Note that the contribution margin of $8,000, the amount available to cover
fixed costs, equals the fixed costs amount of $8,000. Therefore, operating income
is zero.

    The number of units sold was given in the previous example. In many cases,
that is the question that must be answered based on the selling price per unit, the
variable cost per unit, and the fixed cost given.

    Breakeven analysis is a form of CVP that uses the equation for a line to
determine the number of units that must be sold to break even. The equation that
follows proves the breakeven point in units is 1,000.

Breakeven point in units =  Total fixed costs                        =  $8,000     = 1,000 units per month

                            Unit selling price - unit variable cost     $18 - $10

    The denominator of unit selling price per unit minus the unit variable cost may
also be stated as the unit contribution margin.

                            Page | 58
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                    COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

5.3.1 Interpreting the Breakeven Result

    The lower the breakeven point, the better, since it takes relatively fewer units
of sales to cover all the fixed and variable costs. Once the volume of sales reaches
the number of units needed to break even, all fixed costs have been paid. Every
subsequent unit sold yields profit equal to the amount of the unit contribution
margin.

    The breakeven point is a relative number; it does not have much meaning on
its own. It must be compared to another breakeven number, such as the expected
or budgeted number of units to break even, an industry average, or the breakeven
point for comparable companies. If the breakeven point is higher than a business's
capacity or ability to fulfill, the operation of the business is likely doomed to fail. A
breakeven point that is at or below what was expected, easy to accomplish, and/or
well beyond the company's capacity indicates that the business will be successful
due to its ability to meet cost obligations and yield profit.

EXAMPLE 1

    Brian is considering opening a small factory that makes a single product -
widgets. Each unit will sell for $80. The variable cost of manufacturing each unit is
$30. Fixed factory overhead costs include rent, insurance, maintenance, supervisor
salaries, supplies, and depreciation, for a total of $120,000.

The breakeven point in units per month is determined as follows:

Total fixed costs                        =  $120,000   = 2,400 units per month

Unit selling price - unit variable cost     $80 - $30

Proof: 2,400 x ($80 - $30) = $120,000 - $120,000 = 0

    The manufacturing capacity is 5,000 units per month. The maximum possible
operating income per month is $110,000, determined as follows:

5,000 units capacity - 2,400 units to break even = 2,600 units x $50 contribution margin = $130,000

    Brian estimates his monthly sales will be 4,500 per month. The breakeven
point of 2,400 per month is encouraging. The first 2,400 units sold would be
applied toward paying the $120,000 in fixed costs. When 2,401 units are sold,
there will be operating income of $50 since the contribution margin on that one
unit above breakeven is pure profit. From that point on, each additional unit sold
will generate $50 in operating income as well. Since Brian anticipates that he will
sell 1,900 units above the breakeven point of 2,400, he will generate operating
income as follows:

                      1,900 units x $50 contribution margin = $95,000 operating income

                   Page | 59
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                             COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

EXAMPLE 2
    The information from Example 1 remains the same, except Brian forecasts he

will be able to sell 2,500 units per month. Now the breakeven point of 2,400 is
seems a less appealing outcome since anticipated sales are only 100 units more.

                        100 units x $50 contribution margin = $5,000 operating income

    This amount of profit may not be worth the effort of operating the business.
Almost all the sales volume must be used to cover fixed and variable costs.

EXAMPLE 3

    The information from Example 1 remains the same except the manufacturing
capacity is 2,500 units per month. Brian may be able to sell 4,000 units if he has
them, but he is only able to produce 2,400. Again, the outcome does not seem very
lucrative with operating income of only $5,000.

5.3.2 Breakeven Point with Target Profit

    One other element that might be included in the breakeven calculation is target
profit, which can be built in to the equation as if it were an additional fixed cost. At
the breakeven point operating income is zero, which is rarely the goal of a for-profit
company. An owner or manager may identify a desired operating income and add
that amount to the fixed costs in the numerator. The question then becomes How
many units does the company have to sell to pay all its expenses for the month
AND earn a profit of $30,000? The resulting number of sales units will generate
this desired operating income.

EXAMPLE 4

    Brian is considering opening a small factory that makes a single product -
widgets. Each unit will sell for $80. The variable cost of manufacturing each unit is
$30. Fixed factory overhead costs include rent, insurance, maintenance, supervisor
salaries, supplies, and depreciation, for a total of $120,000. Brian would also like
to generate a target profit of $50,000.

The breakeven point in units per month is determined as follows:

Total fixed costs                        =  $120,000 + $50,000  = 3,400 units per month to break even

Unit selling price - unit variable cost     $80 - $30

Proof: 3,400 x ($80 - $30) = $170,000 - $170,000 = 0

    Brian must sell an additional 1,000 units to generate enough contribution
margin to cover both fixed costs and target profit. The target profit of $50,000

                                            Page | 60
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                               COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

equals the 1,000 additional number of units times the contribution margin per
unit of $50.

5.3.3 Relationships in the Breakeven Equation

    The breakeven equation uses fixed costs, the unit selling price, and the unit
variable cost to determine the number of units. If one of those amounts changes,
the breakeven point does as well.

    Referring to the previous data for Jonick Corporation, the breakeven point was
1,000 units, computed as follows.

Total fixed costs                        =             $8,000     = 1,000 units per month to break even

Unit selling price - unit variable cost                $18 - $10

The following three independent changes would decrease the breakeven point.

1. An increase in the selling price per unit, which also increases the
    contribution margin

Change: Unit selling price increases from $18 to $20
Result: Breakeven point decreases from 1,000 to 800 units

Total fixed costs                        =             $8,000     = 800 units per month to break even

Unit selling price - unit variable cost                $20 - $10

2. A decrease in the variable cost per unit, which also increases the
    contribution margin

Change: Unit variable cost decreases from $10 to $8
Result: Breakeven point decreases from 1,000 to 800 units

             Total fixed costs                         $8,000     = 800 units per month to break even
                                                    =  $18 - $8

Unit selling price - unit variable cost

3. A decrease in fixed costs, in which case the contribution margin is
    unchanged

Change: Fixed costs decrease from $8,000 to $6,400
Result: Breakeven point decreases from 1,000 to 800 units

Total fixed costs                        =             $6,400     = 800 units per month to break even

Unit selling price - unit variable cost                $18 - $10

                                                       Page | 61
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                  COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

    The breakeven point in units would increase if the direction of any of the
previous three changes were reversed.

5.3.4 Breakeven Point with Sales Mix

    To this point the breakeven point has been calculated for a company that sells
a single product. A sales mix must be considered when calculating the breakeven
point for companies that sell two or more products.

    A company that sells two different products does not necessarily sell an equal
number of each. The first step in calculating the breakeven point in units is to
determine the sales mix, which is the percent of overall sales each of the two products
represents. Each product has its own unit selling price and unit variable cost. The
weighted average of each of the unit amounts is used in the breakeven equation.

    Carlie operates a specialty outlet that sells two products - hair dryers and
curling irons. Related information is as follows:

Hair dryer    Unit selling price        Unit variable cost  Percent of sales
Curling iron          $70                        $30               60%
                       50                        20                  40

                   Fixed costs are $25,200 for the month.

    The breakeven point divides the fixed costs by the contribution margin for the
sales mix.

                                Total fixed costs
                   Unit selling price - unit variable cost

    Only one unit selling price and one unit variable cost may be included in the
denominator. Yet there is one of each for each product. Therefore, a weighted
average of each will be used to combine them proportionately.

                                        Hair dryers  Curling irons

Weighted average unit selling price  = ($70 x 60%) + ($50 x 40%) = $42 + $20 = $62

                                        Hair dryers  Curling irons

Weighted average variable cost       = ($30 x 60%) + ($20 x 40%) = $18 + $ 8 = $26

The weighted average contribution margin is $62 - $26, or $36 per unit.

The breakeven calculation can now be performed using these weighted unit amounts.

Total fixed costs                    =  $25,200      = 700 units per month to breakeven

Unit selling price - unit variable cost $62 - $26

                                        Page | 62
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                     COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

    Finally, the sales mix percentages are used to determine how many of each
product must be sold to break even. Since it was determined that 60% of sales are
hair dryers and 40% are curling irons, the calculations would be as follows.

Hair dryers: 700 units to break even x 60% = 420 hair dryers
Curling irons: 700 units to break even x 40% = 280 curling irons

Proof: 420 * ($70 - $30) + 280 * ($50 - $20) = $16,800 + $8,400 = $25,200,
which is exactly the amount of the fixed costs!

5.3.5 Breakeven Analysis for a Service Business

    A breakeven analysis can be just as useful for a service business as it is for a
company that sells product. A simple example of a rental property will be used as
an illustration.

    Max is considering opening a 10-room upscale boutique hotel. He found
a facility suitable for this purpose and would rent the building from its owner
for $8,000 per month, which would be one of his fixed costs. Other fixed costs
would include monthly payments for salaries, utilities, insurance, maintenance
and advertising and would be an additional $10,000 per month. The nightly rate
charged to guests would be $110, the going rate in the area. The variable cost per
room night would be $10 for room supplies and breakfast food for the guests.

    The monthly capacity is 300 room nights (10 rooms x 30 days). The average
occupancy rate for similar properties in the area is 60%, which for this property
would be 180 rooms per month.

    Based on this information, the breakeven point in number of room nights per
month would be as follows:

Total fixed costs                        =  $18,000     = 180 room nights per month to break even

Unit selling price - unit variable cost     $110 - $10

    Although the property has the capacity for 180 rooms per month, it would have
to achieve a 60% occupancy rate - 180 rooms - just to pay its bills. Even this might
be challenging for a new start-up since existing properties tend to operate at this
rate. A newcomer might need a bit of time to ramp up the business and get the
word out to potential guests.

    Even at 60%, the property would not produce any operating income. Max
would have to be very sure he could exceed the industry average in the area before
taking steps to start this business.

    However, if Max can justify charging more per room night, the scenario may
change. If he can charge guests $190 instead of $110, his breakeven point will
decrease to 100 room nights per month.

                                            Page | 63
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                 COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

Total fixed costs    =  $18,000                     = 100 room nights per month to break even

Unit selling price - unit variable cost $190 - $10

    If he is then able to achieve a 50% occupancy rate, 150 room nights, his venture
may be viable. The business would yield operating income of $9,000 for the month.

Sales                                               60% occ.      50% occ.

                                                       $18,000       $27,000

                                                        18,000        18,000

    Breakeven analysis is a useful tool for looking at different combinations of costs
and selling prices to predict outcomes. It is then up to management or inventors to
determine the likelihood of each scenario occurring.

5.4 OPERATING LEVERAGE

    Operatying leverage is the degree to which a company can increase operating
income by increasing sales. It looks at the relationship between the contribution
margin and operating income. The difference between those two amounts is fixed
costs.

The following is a comparative income statement for two companies.

Sales                                               ABC Co.       XYZ Co.
Variable costs                                       $500,000     $500,000
Contribution margin
Fixed costs                                           400,000       400,000
Operating income                                     $100,000     $100,000

                                                        80,000        50,000
                                                      $20,000       $50,000

    In this example, sales, total variable costs, and contribution margin are the
same for both companies. ABC Co. has higher fixed costs, so as a result, it also has
lower operating income.

A company's operating leverage is determined as follows.

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

                                                      Contribution margin
                     Operating leverage =

                                                       Operating income

                                 Contribution margin                   ABC Co.             XYZ Co.
Operating leverage =                                              $100,000            $100,000 = 2
                                                                                      $ 50,000
                                  Operating income                               = 5
                                                                  $20,000

    Operating leverage results are used to determine the effect on a change in sales
on operating income. The percent increase (decrease) in sales is multiplied by the
operating leverage to find the percent increase (decrease) in operating income.
The higher the operating leverage, the more impact a change in sales will have on
operating income.

    In the example, both companies had sales of $500,000. An increase of 20%, or
$100,000, to $600,000 in sales would affect each of the two companies' operating
income as follows.

ABC Co. 20% x 5 = 100% increase in operating income                ($20,000 x 100% = $20,000
XYZ Co. 20% x 2 = 40% increase in operating income                 ($50,000 x 40% = $20,000 additional)

    An increase of 20% in sales to $600,000 brings operating income for ABC Co.
from $20,000 to $40,000, a 100% increase. The operating income of XYZ Co.
increases from $50,000 to $70,000, or 40%.

                     $500,000 in sales                             $600,000 in sales

Sales                ABC Co.                           XYZ Co.     ABC Co.            XYZ Co.
Variable costs        $500,000                         $500,000     $600,000          $600,000
Contribution margin
Fixed costs            400,000                           400,000     480,000            480,000
Operating income      $100,000                         $100,000     $120,000          $120,000

                         80,000                            50,000      80,000             50,000
                       $20,000                           $50,000     $40,000            $70,000

5.5 MARGIN OF SAFETY

    The margin of safety looks at how far above the breakeven point a company's
sales are. The greater the difference, the more secure a company can feel about
hedging against possible declines in sales. The margin of safety can be expressed
as a dollar amount, a percentage, or a number of units.

    As an example, a company's breakeven point of 2,400 units per month is
determined as follows:

             Total fixed costs                         $120,000   = 2,400 units per month to break even
                                                    =  $80 - $30

Unit selling price - unit variable cost

                                                       Page | 65
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING      COST VOLUME PROFIT ANALYSIS

    Actual sales for the month were 8,000 units. The contribution margin per unit
is $50 ($80 - $30).

Margin of safety in units:    8,000 - 2,400 = 5,600
Margin of safety in dollars:  (8,000 x $50) - (2,400 x $50) = $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000
Margin of safety percentage:  ($400,000 - 120,000) / $400,000 = 70%

    The margin of safety is 70%, which gives the company a significant cushion
over its breakeven point. The higher the margin of safety, and the more it exceeds
the breakeven point, the better.

6Variable Costing Analysis
 6.1 INTRODUCTION

       Operating income on the income statement is one of the most important results
  that a manufacturing company reports on its financial statements. External parties
  such as investors, creditors, and governmental agencies look to this amount to
  evaluate a company's performance and how it affects them. Managers and others
  within a company use operating income as a measure for evaluating and improving
  operational performance.

       We have been preparing income statements for manufacturers using this basic
  structure.

Absorption Costing Income Statement

Sales                                $750,000

Cost of goods sold                   525,000

Gross profit                         $225,000

Selling and administrative expenses  125,000

Operating income                     $100,000

    This format is referred to as an absorption costing income statement.
Expenses are separated into two accounts: Cost of Goods Sold, which are product
costs of the manufactured goods themselves, and Selling and Administrative
Expenses, which are general operating costs.

    Each of these two expense accounts includes both variable and fixed costs. Cost
of Goods Sold is made up of the three costs of manufacturing: direct materials
and direct labor, which are variable, and factory overhead, which may be both
variable and fixed. Likewise, Selling and Administrative Expenses may include
both variable and fixed costs.

    Absorption costing is required under generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for external reporting. All manufacturing costs, whether fixed
or variable, must be treated as product costs and included in an inventory amount
on the balance sheet until the product is sold. When the product is sold, its cost is
then expensed off as cost of goods sold on the income statement. Under absorption
costing, fixed factory overhead is allocated to the finished goods inventory account
and is expensed to cost of goods sold when the product is sold.

                                                     Page | 67
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING           VARIABLE COSTING ANALYSIS

    For managers within a company, it is also useful to prepare an income
statement in a different format that separates out the expenses that truly vary
directly with revenues. Variable costs are typically more controllable than fixed
costs, so it is useful to isolate them so they can be analyzed by management. A
variable costing income statement only includes variable manufacturing costs
in the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold amounts on the financial
statements. Under variable costing, fixed factory overhead is NOT allocated to
the finished goods inventory and is NOT expensed to cost of goods sold when the
product is sold. Instead, total fixed factory overhead is treated as a period cost that
is deducted from gross profit. On a variable costing income statement, all variable
expenses are deducted from revenue to determine the contribution margin, from
which all fixed expenses are subtracted to arrive at operating income for the period.

The following is a sample variable costing income statement.

                      Variable Costing Income Statement

Sales                                                            $750,000
                                                                  375,000
Variable cost of goods sold
                                                                 $375,000
Manufacturing margin                                                75,000

Variable selling and administrative expenses                     $300,000

Contribution margin                                               200,000
                                                                 $100,000
Fixed costs:

Fixed manufacturing costs                     $150,000

Fixed selling and administrative expenses                50,000

       Total fixed costs

Operating income

    As is shown on the variable costing income statement, total sales is matched
with the total direct costs of generating those sales. The difference between sales
and total variable costs is the contribution margin, which is the amount available
to pay all fixed costs.

    Under both methods, direct costs (materials and labor) and variable factory
overhead costs are applied to the cost of the product. The difference between the
two costing methods is how the fixed factory overhead costs are treated. Under
variable costing, fixed factory overhead costs are expensed in the period in which
they are incurred, regardless of whether the product is sold yet. Under absorption
costing, fixed factory overhead costs are expensed only when the product is sold.

    To recap, the variable costing income statement is different from the absorption
costing income statement in several ways. (1) Only variable production costs are
included in cost of goods sold. (2) Manufacturing margin replaces gross profit. (3)
Variable selling and administrative expenses are grouped with variable production
costs as part of the calculation of contribution margin. (4) Contribution margin
is listed after deducting all variable costs from sales. (5) Fixed production costs

                                                     Page | 68
       PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                              VARIABLE COSTING ANALYSIS

       are shown below the contribution margin on the income statement with fixed
       operating costs.

           Contribution margin (variable costing) is often higher than gross profit (absorption
       costing because many production costs, and most selling and administrative expenses,
       are fixed. Since variable costing tends to reduce cost of goods sold than it increases
       general operating expenses, the net result is a higher contribution margin.

           The following data will be used for three pairs of income statements that follow
       in sample problems. The only difference in the three scenarios is the number of
       units produced.

       costing income statements is the same, $100,000. This will always be the case
       when the number of units manufactured equals the number of units sold because
       there is no change in the number of units in inventory. The beginning and ending
       number of units in inventory are the same since the number of units added is the
       same as the number removed.

    When more units are manufactured than are sold, there are more units in
ending inventory than there were in beginning inventory. In this case, 5,000 of
the units produced were not sold, so they were added to inventory. Operating
income under variable costing is lower than under absorption costing when
inventory increases. This is because for variable costing the fixed factory overhead
for all units produced is expensed off during the period, regardless of whether the
units produced were sold. Under absorption costing, the fixed factory overhead
is expensed off is only for the units sold, resulting in lower overall expenses and
therefore higher operating income.

                2. Selling and administrative expenses on the absorption costing income
                    statement

           When more units are sold than are manufactured, there are fewer units in
       ending inventory than there were in beginning inventory. Some of the beginning
       inventory had to be sold to fulfill the order for more than what was produced. In
       this case, 5,000 of the units sold came from beginning inventory. Operating income
       under variable costing is higher than under absorption costing when inventory
       decreases. This is because under variable costing the fixed factory overhead that
       is expensed off during the period is only for units produced, even if more units
       are sold than were produced. Under absorption costing, the fixed overhead is
       included in the higher number of units sold, resulting in higher overall expenses
       and therefore lower operating income.

       6.5 ANALYSIS OF VARIABLE AND ABSORPTION
       COSTING

           Sales were 15,000 units in each of the three variable costing and three
       absorption costing income statements just presented. It was the number of units
       produced that varied among the three pairs of statements.

           The three variable costing income statements at the different levels of
       production were exactly the same, each yielding operating income of $100,000, as
       shown in the following comparative statements.

           The number of units manufactured during the period - 15,000; 20,000; and
       10,000; respectively -- does not affect operating income under the variable costing
       approach. This is as it should be, since production affects inventory, which is a
       balance sheet rather than an income statement account. When more units are
       produced (20,000) than sold (15,000), ending inventory is 5,000 units higher than
       beginning inventory. When fewer units are produced (10,000) than sold (15,000),
       ending inventory is 5,000 units lower than beginning inventory. Yet regardless of
       changes in inventory, operating income remains constant for a given level of sales
       because variable cost of goods sold and fixed manufacturing costs are identical for
       all three variable costing scenarios.

           Under absorption costing, however, operating income changes when the
       company's inventory balance changes. The results from the three absorption
       income statements presented earlier are shown again, as follows.

           When all units manufactured (15,000) are sold (15,000), operating income
       under absorption costing is the same as it is under variable costing, $100,000.
       Under both costing methods, $150,000 of fixed factory overhead costs is deducted
       to arrive at operating income. It just appears in two different line items. Under
       variable costing, the flat amount of $150,000 follows the contribution margin
       line. Under absorption costing, the $150,000 is included in cost of goods sold. The
       fixed cost per unit is $10, determined by dividing the $150,000 total fixed factory
       overhead cost by the number of units produced, 15,000. The $10 per unit is then
       multiplied by 15,000, the number of units sold.

Variable costing fixed manufacturing costs    $150,000 fixed factory overhead
Absorption costing fixed manufacturing costs  $10 fixed cost per unit x 15,000 units sold = $150,000

    When more units are manufactured (20,000) than sold (15,000), operating
income is higher under absorption costing ($137,500). Under variable costing,
fixed factory overhead is the flat amount of $150,000 that follows the contribution
margin line. Under absorption costing, $112,500 of fixed factory overhead cost is
included in cost of goods sold. The fixed cost per unit is $7.50, determined by
dividing the $150,000 total fixed factory overhead cost by the number of units
produced, 20,000. The $7.50 per unit is then multiplied by 15,000, the number of
units sold to get $112,500.

Variable costing fixed manufacturing costs    $150,000 fixed factory overhead
Absorption costing fixed manufacturing costs  $7.50 fixed cost per unit x 15,000 units sold = $112,500

    Since there is $37,500 less in cost of goods sold under absorption costing, there
is $37,500 more operating income as a result for the same level of sales.

    Conversely, when fewer units are manufactured (10,000) than sold (15,000),
operating income is lower under absorption costing ($50,000). Under variable
costing, fixed factory overhead is the flat amount of $150,000 that follows the
contribution margin line. Under absorption costing, $225,000 of fixed factory
overhead cost is included in cost of goods sold. The fixed cost per unit is $15,
determined by dividing the $150,000 total fixed factory overhead cost by the
number of units produced, 10,000. The $15 per unit is then multiplied by 15,000,
the number of units sold to get $225,000.

Variable costing fixed manufacturing costs    $150,000 fixed factory overhead
Absorption costing fixed manufacturing costs  $15 fixed cost per unit x 15,000 units sold = $225,000

    Since there is $75,000 more in cost of goods sold under absorption costing,
there is $75,000 less operating income as a result for the same level of sales.

    The point of this analysis is to illustrate that under absorption costing, operating
income changes based on increases or decreases in inventory due to producing
more or fewer units than were sold in a period. Such changes are unrelated to a
company's operating performance, and managers need to be aware of this type
of distortion under absorption costing. On a variable costing income statement,
changes in inventory have no effect on operating income, making this method
more reliable and desirable for analyzing profitability for an accounting period.

6.6 CONTRIBUTION MARGIN ANALYSIS

    A key element of the variable costing income statement is contribution margin,
which is what is left over from sales after paying variable costs. In other words,

                                              Page | 74
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING       VARIABLE COSTING ANALYSIS

contribution margin is the amount or percentage of sales available to pay fixed costs
and contribute to operating income. Once fixed costs are covered, any remaining
contribution margin represents profit that results from the sales.

    Contribution margin may be looked at from a variety of perspectives that often
involve comparisons within different segments of a company. Data may be isolated
by product, geographic area, salesperson, customer, distribution method, etc. and
analyzed in terms of how individuals or entities within a segment perform in terms
of contribution margin percentage. Managers may use these targeted results to
discover strengths that may be capitalized on and/or weaknesses that may need to
be addressed.

    As an example, a company manufactures two products and sells them in two
regions, East and West, to two customers that have a presence in both regions.
There are four salespeople in each region. Sales in these regions may be either in-
store or online.

    The following sales and production information will be used to show comparisons
of the contribution margin for a company as a whole, by region, and by product.

The contribution margin ratio of 45.4% for the company as a whole is determined
as follows.

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING   VARIABLE COSTING ANALYSIS

    For every $1.00 of sales, a little over $.45 remains after variable costs are covered
to apply toward paying fixed costs and yielding profit. The contribution margin is
$145,400, and the contribution margin ratio is 45.4% ($145,400 / $320,000). If
fixed costs were $100,000, for example, operating income would be $45,400.

    The analysis by product shows that the contribution margin ratio for Product
1, 38.0%, is lower that of the company as a whole, 45.4%. The ratio for Product 2 is
significantly higher than both those rates at 55.0%.

Sales                                 Product 1    Product 2
Variable cost of goods sold            $180,000     $140,000
Manufacturing margin                       36,000       16,800

Contribution margin ratio             38.0%        55.0%

    Although sales of Product 2 are lower, its contribution margin ratio is 17%
higher than that of Product 1. This is because the costs of producing and selling
Product 2 are proportionately lower.

    Based on this information, managers may look for ways to contain variable
costs associated with Product 1. They also might encourage and incentivize sales
staff to promote Product 2 to customers more than Product 1.

    A comparison by sales region shows that the contribution margin ratio for the
East, 42.3%, is lower that of the company as a whole, 45.4%. The ratio for the West
is higher than both these rates at 48.6%.

Contribution margin ratio             42.3%        48.6%

    At the same sales levels, the East has higher variable costs for both production
and selling. Management may look at the mix of products sold in each region to
determine if differences in costs in the regions are product related or if action
needs to be taken to contain costs in the East.

in a region may be determined. As an example, the data for sales staff in the East -
Annie Adams, Charles Bell, Valerie Crew, and Scott Davis - follows.

    The sales mix in terms of the percentage of each product that each salesperson
sold plays a role in the variable expenses incurred and the resulting contribution
margin ratio. Note that the highest contribution margin in dollars does not always
result in the highest contribution margin ratio. Managers must evaluate returns on
sales from both these perspectives when making decisions moving forward.

    Although specific data is not provided for the following two segments - customer
and distribution channel - results are presented here to show two additional types
of comparisons that may be meaningful in investigating operational performance.

    Contribution margin analysis is also useful for planning purposes. For each
product, sales volume, unit selling price, unit variable cost of production, and
unit variable cost of selling can be forecasted to estimate contribution margin.
Subsequently, one or more of these four variables may be changed to see the impact
on contribution margin. The following table compares six projections based on
different data. Amounts in bold font are changes from Projection 1.

    Managers consider both the contribution margin dollar amount and the ratio
in making decisions related to selling price and projecting quantities sold. A higher
contribution margin ratio alone is favorable relative to a lower one; the 46.9% for
Projection 1 is greater than the 44.0% for Projection 6. Yet if fixed costs are $375,000,
the contribution margin dollar amount for Projection 1 would only be enough to
break even, whereas Projection 6 would yield operating income of $26,500. Many
decisions require a combination of analyses to determine the optimal outcome,
but the results from separate measures can be insightful in determining points of
strength and weakness.

    Finally, managers may use the elements of a variable costing income statement
to compare planned to actual dollar amounts and units sold.

                             Variable cost of goods sold              252,000          297,000

                             Variable selling expenses               $513,000         $583,000
                             Contribution margin                      144,000          198,000

    The actual contribution margin is $16,000 higher compared to what was
projected, partially due to more unit sales than anticipated. The net decrease in
unit variable cost factors in as well. Although sales revenue is higher than expected,

                                                          Page | 78

it would be worth looking into why selling price per unit was lower than projected.
It is feasible that the price concession spurred the higher sales quantity.

    Variable costing may also be applicable to a service business, even though
manufacturing costs are not involved. A small hotel, for example, earns revenue
from renting rooms. Variable costs may include food and beverage expense for
breakfast, supplies expense, selling expense, and an incremental utilities expense
amount for times when rooms are occupied. Fixed costs of rent expense for the
property, salaries expense, depreciation expense, and insurance expense are
typical.

    The following is an example of a variable costing income statement for a hotel.
The room rate is $120 per night, and 700 room nights are recorded during the
month. The rate per unit for each variable cost is shown in the income statement.

7Budgeting
 7.1 INTRODUCTION
       Financial statements and managerial reports are often prepared to summarize
  historical transactions that occurred in a company to evaluate past performance.
  This information is also used as an integral part of the process of moving forward.
  Combined with insights into consumer trends and current economic, legal, social,
  and political environments, managers forecast future operations and develop
  strategies for achieving projected goals.
       A budget is a quantitative, written statement of a company's action plan for a
  future period of time. Budgets are planning tools that companies use to determine
  future activities and to keep financial control of operations. Budgets may be
  prepared at fixed intervals of time, such as annually, where they are reviewed and
  revised once a year. Alternatively, continuous budgets extend for one year but
  are adjusted each month to reflect activities for the upcoming 12 months. When
  a current month passes, its financial information is removed and the data for the
  new month that is 12 months in the future is added.

 7.2 STATIC BUDGET

       A static budget is prepared for a period of time based on a fixed amount of
  activity. For example, the Packing Department in a manufacturing company may
  prepare a budget that itemizes fixed and variable costs.

                                                       Page | 80
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING              BUDGETING

       Packing Department Budget
For the Year Ended December 31, 2019

Variable costs:                       $30,000
     Packing materials                  15,000
     Direct labor                         5,000
     Variable utilities cost
           Total variable costs       $50,000

Fixed costs:                          $60,000
     Supervisor salary expense            7,000
     Depreciation expense                 3,000
     Machine rental expense
           Total fixed costs          $70,000
                                     $120,000
Total budgeted costs

    This departmental budget does not specify the number of units to be processed,
making it difficult to determine if actual costs are reasonable and within budget.
Actual costs may wind up being higher than what was budgeted. For example,
actual costs of $130,000 might seem unfavorable since it exceeds total budgeted
costs of $120,000. However, more units may have been processed than were
considered in preparing the budget. In that case, being over budget may actually
be a positive outcome since additional production costs were the result of more
sales orders.

    The assumptions underlying the static budget are a bit vague. Even if the
number of anticipated units to be processed were stated, such as a quantity of
10,000, the budget would remain unchanged if production volume were higher
or lower. The lack of detail behind how the numbers are derived often limits the
usefulness of the static budget information.

7.3 FLEXIBLE BUDGET

    A flexible budget addresses the shortcoming of the static budget by providing
budgeted amounts at various quantity levels. A sample flexible budget follows.

Variable costs:
                                     $30,000     $36,000     $48,000     $60,000

           Total variable costs

                                         7,000       7,000       7,000       7,000
     Supervisor salary expense           3,000       3,000       3,000       3,000
     Depreciation expense
     Machine rental expense          $70,000     $70,000     $70,000     $70,000
                                    $120,000    $130,000    $150,000    $170,000
           Total fixed costs
Total budgeted costs

    The flexible budget is more useful to managers since budgeted costs can be
compared to actual costs for several activity levels. The example of the flexible
budget for the Packing Department shows four possible levels of production: 10,000;
12,000; 15,000; and 20,000 units. If actual costs were $130,000 and 12,000 units
were processed, the budget would have accurately predicted actual costs. If actual
costs were $130,000 and 10,000 units were produced, the department would have
been over budget by $10,000. A flexible budget is basically a menu of static budgets
to select from based on the number of actual units involved.

    The same financial statement formats that summarize and present results of
economic events from previous periods may also be used to communicate quantitative
projections of future performance. For example, the income statement includes sales
and multiple line items related to cost information, each of which can be budgeted
independently based on a company's action plan for a future period. Collectively
they result in a pro forma income statement that projects future net income.

7.4 MASTER BUDGET

    A master budget is a collection of all the separate budgets for different
elements of a business combined into one report. Master budgets contain operating
budgets that include goals for sales and associated costs of production, which result
in the budgeted income statement. Financial budgets such as the cash and capital
expenditures budgets are included on the budgeted balance sheet.

7.5 OPERATING BUDGET

Operating budgets include separate budgets for each of three key line items on
the income statement.

                                    Page | 82
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING              BUDGETING

1. Sales budget
2. Cost of goods sold budget *

* To prepare the cost of goods sold budget, a manufacturer first prepares the
following five supporting budgets:

a. production budget                  Requires sales budget result
b. direct materials purchases budget  Requires production budget result
c. direct materials cost budget       Requires materials purchases budget result
d. direct labor cost budget           Requires production budget result
e. factory overhead budget            Independent of previous budgets

         3. Selling and administrative budget

    The results of all the individual operating budgets are combined to present a
budgeted income statement, which culminates with the anticipated amount of net
income.

    To illustrate, two distinct master budgets for 2019 for two different
manufacturing companies will be presented side by side.

    The first company makes only one product, a 42" art deco replica of the Statue of
Liberty, which it sells to wholesalers and souvenir shops. Only one direct material,
metal, is used in producing these statues.

    The second company makes protective headgear and produces two products:
bicycle helmets and ski helmets. Each type of headgear requires two direct
materials: plastic and foam lining.

    The best approach is to first review the budgets for the statue souvenirs in the
left column of the side-by-side budgets. It is the simpler of the two since it covers
only one product that uses one direct material. It illustrates the basic concepts.
The budgets for the helmets are similar to those for the statues, but they are a
bit more complex since two products and two direct materials are involved. The
manufacture of the helmets occurs in two departments: forming and assembly.

    The following information will be used to prepare a sales budget, production
budget, direct materials purchases budget, direct materials cost budget, direct
labor cost budget, factory overhead budget, selling and administrative budget, and
budgeted income statement. The data in the left column is for the statue souvenirs;
the information in the right column is for the helmets.

7.6 SALES BUDGET

    The sales budget is prepared first by estimating the number of units that will
be sold. This analysis looks at budgeted and actual sales from the previous year and
adjusts those amounts to reflect economic conditions, shifts in trends, feedback
from customers, and pricing changes.

    In addition, the expected unit selling price for each product must be determined
by examining previous pricing and profitability, current costs, the market demand
for the products, and competitors' pricing.

    The sales budgets for the two companies' products are as follows.

    The budgeted sales in dollars equals the expected sales volume times the
expected selling price per unit for each product. The sum of all products' sales is
ultimately transferred to the budgeted income statement.

    Cost of goods sold is the next line item on the income statement. Five shorter,
more targeted budgets are first prepared to arrive at key elements of the cost of
goods sold budget.

a. The production budget estimates the number of units of each product that
    will have to be manufactured to achieve the anticipated sales and inventory
    levels. It begins with the estimated number of units to be sold from the sales
    budget. The number of desired units in ending inventory is added to that to
    determine total number of units required. Since some of those needed are
    already in stock, those do not need to be produced. The total units that do
    need to be produced are those needed for sales and ending inventory minus
    those that are already in inventory at the start of the period.

The production budgets for the two companies' products are as follows.

b. The direct materials purchases budget estimates how much will be
    spent to buy the quantity of materials needed for production. It begins with
    the total number of units to be manufactured from the production budget.

    Each statue requires 8.6 pounds of metal, so the total number of pounds
    for production can be calculated. Each helmet requires both plastic and
    foam lining, and the total amount needed for production is determined for
    each type. The number of pounds that should remain in ending inventory is

                                                     Page | 87
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                                  BUDGETING

added to total pounds needed for production. Then, the number of pounds of
materials in beginning inventory is deducted from total required since that
amount is already in stock and does not need to be purchased. The number of
pounds that does need to be purchased is multiplied by the cost per pound to
get the total cost of materials purchases.

The direct materials purchases budgets for the two companies' products are

as follows.

c. The direct materials cost budget looks at the total cost of materials
    available to be used in production by adding what was already on hand at the
    beginning of the year to what will be purchased during the year, taken from
    the direct materials purchases budget. From that total the remaining direct
    materials at the end of the year are deducted, since they were not used, to
    arrive at the cost of direct materials added to production during the year.

The direct materials cost budget can be presented in a summarized format, as
shown for the souvenir statues, or with a greater level of detail, as is the case
for the helmets, which require two types of materials rather than just one. The
direct materials cost budgets for the two companies' products are as follows.

d. The direct labor cost budget estimates the second direct cost of a
    manufactured product, direct labor. It multiplies the number of units to be
    produced, taken from the production budget, by the number of hours per
    unit. That result is then multiplied by the labor rate per hour.

    The direct labor cost budgets for the two companies' products are as follows.

begin with what was available at the beginning of the period, add what was
transferred in during the period, and deduct what was remaining at the end of the
period to determine what was transferred out. A transfer out from finished goods,
of course, indicates a sale and a move to cost of goods sold.

    The cost of goods sold budgets for both companies follow. Direct materials,
direct labor, and factory overhead amounts are taken from their respective
supporting budgets prepared previously.

    The first step on the cost of goods sold budget is to list and total the three
manufacturing costs: direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead. Their
amounts are taken from their respective cost budgets and appear in the left
column. Total manufacturing costs for the year is the sum of the three, entered in
the middle column.

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                               BUDGETING

    Next, the manufacturing costs for the year are added to the work in process
at the beginning of the year to arrive at the available total work in process for
the year. From that result, the ending work in process - the product that is still
unfinished - is deducted to determine the cost of goods manufactured.

    Finally, the cost of goods manufactured is added to the finished goods at the
beginning of the year to arrive at the cost of finished goods available for sale. From
that result, the finished goods that were not sold are deducted to arrive at the cost
of goods that were sold.

    The following table shows the calculations for the work in process and finished
goods amounts for the headgear manufacturing company. This level of detail is not
necessary to show in the statement of cost of goods manufactured, but it is useful
in understanding how amounts in that statement were derived.

           Additional budgets may be prepared that relate to balance sheet accounts.
       Financial budgets look at critical aspects of a business that are not directly
       operational but that impact a company's ability to pay its obligations. The
       discussion will be limited to the cash budget and the capital expenditures budget.

       7.10 CASH BUDGET

           The availability and commitment of cash is critical to management planning
       and operational success. The cash budget provides relevant information by
       estimating cash receipts and cash payments for one or more periods.

           Cash receipts result from cash sales, collection of accounts receivable, other
       revenue sources, sales of assets, and issuance of stocks and bonds. Cash payments
       occur due to incurring costs and expenses, paying invoices on account, purchasing
       assets, paying off debts, and paying interest and dividends. The frequency and
       amount of these transactions are estimated and consolidated to form the cash
       budget.

           The most common reason for cash receipts is sales to customers, and the most
       frequent cash payments are due to sales-related costs. The following example will
       illustrate the preparation of the cash budget.

       Assume that Jonick Corporation begin operating on January 1, 2019.
       Projected sales to customers for the first four months are as follows.

           The company expects that 20% of each month's sales will be for cash and the
       remainder on account. It anticipates that 40% of sales on account will be collected in

account for the current month and for the previous two months. In this example,
cash collections are expected to be $35,360 for January, $74,000 for February,
$105,920 for March, and $129,080 for April.

    The company expects that 30% of each month's purchases will be for cash and
the remainder on account. It anticipates that 60% of purchases on account will
be paid in the month of sale, 30% will be paid in the following month, and the
remaining 10% paid during the second month after the sale.

    The following table illustrates the budgeted cash payments to vendors for each
of the four months with corresponding calculations.

    Each month, the company expects to pay for cash purchases that month and
for purchases on account for the current month and for the previous two months.
In this example, cash payments are expected to be $24,480 for January, 39,540 for
February, $56,470 for March, and $66,570 for April.

    Jonick Corporation also anticipates the following cash-related transactions
will take place during the first four months the business operates.

1. The company will issue stock for $50,000 cash in January.
2. The company will purchase equipment for $8,000 cash in January.
3. The company will purchase equipment for $12,000 cash in February.
4. The company will sell equipment for $3,000 in March.
5. The company will pay $1,000 in cash dividends in March.

    Based on the information about Jonick Corporation's anticipated cash inflows
and outflows, the following cash budget can be prepared for the first four months
of operations.

7.11 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BUDGET

    A capital expenditure budget is a list of fixed assets that a company
plans to acquire over a future period of time. These assets may be purchased
to replace existing assets that are aging or outdated, or they may be additional
resources necessary to meet growing demand. Amounts for these expenditures are
usually determined by looking at current costs and factoring in potential pricing
adjustments in the future.

    Budgets provide a financial roadmap for executing the plans management
has developed. Keep in mind that they are projections of what will take place
in the future rather than reports of past performance. They can be compared to
evaluate actual performance once it can be measured. That assessment often leads
to discovering strengths and weaknesses that can be considered when making
subsequent plans going forward.

8Variance Analysis
  8.1 INTRODUCTION

        Budgets are the result of planning efforts to estimate a company's performance
   for a period of time in the future. They are tools that guide managers and employees
   for keeping operations on track to achieve stated goals. Once a budget's time period
   expires, its estimates then serve as benchmarks against which actual results may
   be compared.

        The discussion of budgeting for a manufacturing company included budgets
   for each of the three product costs: direct materials, direct labor, and factory
   overhead. Those budgets were as follows.

Direct Materials Purchases Budget                             Direct Labor Cost Budget

Estimated units to be produced          1,000      Total units to be produced           1,000

Number of pounds per unit               x 8.6      Production time per unit    x        5

Pounds of metal required for production = 8,600    Hours required for production = 5,000

Desired ending inventory, December 31 + 300        Labor rate per hour         x $10

Total pounds needed                     = 8,900    Total direct labor cost     = $50,000

Estimated beginning inventory, January 1 - 1,800

Total pounds to be purchased            = 7,100    Factory Overhead Cost Budget

Price per pound                         x $6       Supervisor salary                    7,600

Total direct materials to be purchased  = $42,600  Utilities                   + 1,900

                                                   Indirect materials          + 1,700

                                                   Depreciation                + 800

                                                   Total factory overhead cost = $12,000

    Two key estimates are part of the direct materials production budget: the
number of pounds needed for the desired level of production and the price per
pound. Likewise, the direct labor cost budget shows the number of labor hours
required to produce a desired number of units and the labor rate per hour.

    The factory overhead cost budget is prepared a bit differently, listing a dollar
amount for each cost. Some factory overhead costs may be further broken out into
their fixed and variable components.

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                                   VARIANCE ANALYSIS

    The amounts indicated by an arrow in the sample budgets are performance
goals, also called standards. Variance analysis is a process that compares
these standards to actual amounts once the budget period has expired.

    Standard costs are estimated goals that are used to calculate how much a
product or batch of products "should cost" to manufacture. Elements in bold below
show standard costs taken from the previous budgets.

Direct materials:            8,600 pounds x $6.00 per pound = $51,600
Direct labor:                    5,000 hours x $10.00 per hour = 50,000
Factory overhead:                                                             12,000

    Actual cost of production may be different than standard cost if any of the five
goals listed above is either not met or exceeded. If any one of the quantities or
dollar amounts is higher than its standard, the result for that amount is said to be
unfavorable since more was consumed spent than was planned. An unfavorable
outcome in this example would be if 8,900 pounds were used in production when
only 8,600 were budgeted. A quantity or unit cost is favorable when it is lower
than what was anticipated. A favorable result would be if $9 per labor hour were
spent since it is lower than the anticipated amount of $10 per hour.

    The following example conducts a variance analysis on the three costs of
manufacturing. It involves the production of 1,000 units. The standard quantities
and prices per unit are as follows:

Production costs             Standard price     Standard quality                      Standard unit cost
Direct materials             $6.00 per pound       8.6 pounds/unit                                     $51.60
Direct labor                 $10.00 per hour            5 hours/unit                                     50.00
Factory overhead             $12.00 per hour             1 hour/unit                                     12.00
                                                                                                      $113.60
     Standard cost per unit

8.2 DIRECT MATERIALS COST VARIANCE

    Actual and standard quantities and prices are given in the following table for
direct materials to produce 1,000 units. Total actual and standard direct materials
costs are calculated by multiplying quantity by price, and the results are shown in
the last row of the first two columns.

                             Direct Materials Cost Variance

                                     Actual     Standard                              Difference

Direct materials quantity in pounds  8,400      8,600                                 (200)

Direct materials price per pound     $6.30      $6.00                                 $0.30

Total direct materials cost          $52,920 - $51,600 = $1,320

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                  VARIANCE ANALYSIS

    The difference column shows that 200 fewer pounds were used than expected
(favorable). It also shows that the actual price per pound was $0.30 higher than
standard cost (unfavorable). The total actual cost is $1,320 higher than the standard
cost. The direct materials used in production cost more than was anticipated, which
is an unfavorable outcome.

    Managers can better address this situation if they have a breakdown of the
variances between quantity and price. Specifically, knowing the amount and
direction of the difference for each can help them take targeted measures for
improvement.

The following table is expanded to include this additional information.

                                                                                                              $2,520
Direct materials quantity in pounds  8,400   8,600       (200) x               $6.00                          $1,320

Direct materials price per pound     $6.30   $6.00       $0.30 x 8,400

Total direct materials cost          $52,920 - $51,600 = $1,320

    The difference in the quantity is multiplied by the standard price to determine
that there was a $1,200 favorable direct materials quantity variance. This is offset
by a larger unfavorable direct materials price variance of $2,520. The net direct
materials cost variance is still $1,320 (unfavorable), but this additional analysis
shows how the quantity and price differences contributed to the overall variance.

The following equations summarize the calculations for direct materials cost
variance.

       Direct materials quantity variance = (actual quantity - standard quantity) x standard price

             Direct materials price variance = (actual price - standard price) x actual quantity

Total direct materials cost variance = direct materials quantity variance + direct materials price variance

8.3 DIRECT LABOR COST VARIANCE

    Actual and standard quantities and rates for direct labor for the production of
1,000 units are given in the following table. Total actual and standard direct labor
costs are calculated by multiplying number of hours by rate, and the results are
shown in the last row of the first two columns.

Direct labor rate per hour                      $9.50               $10.00  ($0.50)

Total direct labor cost                        $48,450 - $50,000 = - $1,550

    The difference column shows that 100 extra hours were used vs. what was
expected (unfavorable). It also shows that the actual rate per hour was $0.50 lower
than standard cost (favorable). The total actual cost direct labor cost was $1,550
lower than the standard cost, which is a favorable outcome.

    Managers can better address this situation if they have a breakdown of the
variances between quantity and rate. Specifically, knowing the amount and
direction of the difference for each can help them take targeted measures for
improvement.

The following table is expanded to include this additional information.

    The difference in hours is multiplied by the standard price per hour, showing a
$1,000 unfavorable direct labor time variance. This is offset by a larger favorable
direct labor rate variance of $2,550. The net direct labor cost variance is still $1,550
(favorable), but this additional analysis shows how the time and rate differences
contributed to the overall variance.

The following equations summarize the calculations for direct labor cost variance.

                Direct labor time variance = (actual hours - standard hours) x standard rate
                   Direct labor rate variance = (actual rate - standard rate) x actual hours

         Total direct labor cost variance = direct labor time variance + direct labor rate variance

8.4 FACTORY OVERHEAD VARIANCES

    Factory overhead costs are also analyzed for variances from standards, but the
process is a bit different than for direct materials or direct labor. The first step is
to break out factory overhead costs into their fixed and variable components, as

shown in the following factory overhead cost budget.

                                                                              3,000

                              Machine rental expense                     $120,000

                                    Total fixed costs
                         Total budgeted costs

    This factory overhead cost budget starts with the number of units that could be
produced at normal operating capacity, which in this case is 10,000 units. Assume
each unit consumes one direct labor hour in production. Total variable factory
overhead costs are $50,000, and total fixed factory overhead costs are $70,000.
The following factory overhead rate may then be determined.

Factory overhead rate =  budgeted factory overhead at normal capacity $120,000       = $12 per direct labor hour
                                                                      =
                         normal capacity in direct labor hours              10,000

    The total factory overhead rate of $12 per direct labor hour may then be broken
out into variable and fixed factory overhead rates, as follows.

Variable factory = budgeted variable factory overhead at normal capacity = $50,000 = $5 per direct labor hour
overhead rate            normal capacity in direct labor hours              10,000

Fixed factory  =  budgeted fixed factory overhead at normal capacity     =  $70,000  = $7 per direct labor hour

overhead rate            normal capacity in direct labor hours              10,000

    The $5 fixed rate plus the $7 variable rate equals the $12 total factory overhead
rate per direct labor hour.

    Factory overhead variances can be separated into a controllable variance and
a volume variance.

    The variable factory overhead controllable variance is the difference
between the actual variable overhead costs and the budgeted variable overhead for
actual production. The following calculations are performed.

                         Page | 102
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                                VARIANCE ANALYSIS

1. Budgeted variable factory overhead = standard hours for actual units produced x variable factory overhead rate

    If 8,000 units are produced and each requires one direct labor hour, there
would be 8,000 standard hours.

            Budgeted variable factory overhead = 8,000 x $5 per direct labor hour = $40,000

2. Variable factory overhead controllable variance =   actual variable  - budgeted variable factory overhead
                                                      factory overhead

Assume actual variable overhead cost is $39,500

Variable factory overhead controllable variance = $39,500 - $40,000 = ($500), a favorable variance since actual is less than expected.

    The variable factory overhead controllable variance indicates how well the
company was able to adhere to the budget.

    The fixed factory overhead volume variance is the difference between
the budgeted fixed overhead at normal capacity and the standard fixed overhead
for the actual units produced. The following calculations are performed.

Fixed factory overhead volume variance =                                                                           fixed factory overhead rate
    (standard hours normal capacity - standard hours for actual units produced) x

    If 8,000 units are produced and each requires one direct labor hour, there
would be 8,000 standard hours.

Fixed factory overhead volume variance = (10,000 - 8,000) x $7 per direct labor hour = $14,000

    The 8,000 standard hours are less than the 10,000 available at normal capacity,
so the fixed overhead was underutilized. This results in an unfavorable variance
due to the missed opportunity to produce more units for the same fixed overhead.

    If 11,000 units are produced (pushing beyond normal operational capacity)
and each requires one direct labor hour, there would be 11,000 standard hours.

 Fixed factory overhead volume variance = (10,000 - 11,000) x $7 per direct labor hour = ($7,000)

    When standard hours exceed normal capacity, the fixed factory overhead
costs are leveraged beyond normal production. A favorable fixed factory overhead
volume variance results. Additional units were produced without any necessary
increase in fixed costs.

    An income statement that includes variances is very useful for managers to
see how deviations from budgeted amounts impact gross profit and net income.
These insights help in planning by addressing reasons for unfavorable variances
and continuing with line items that are favorable.

    In this example, assume the selling price per unit is $20 and 1,000 units
are sold. The standard cost per unit of $113.60 calculated previously is used to
determine cost of goods sold - at standard amount. Assume selling expenses are
$18,300 and administrative expenses are $9,100.

    The net variance from standard cost and the line items leading up to it build
deviations from standard amounts right into the income statement. Managers can
focus on discovering reasons for these differences to budget and operate more
effectively in future periods.

9Differential Analysis
 9.1 INTRODUCTION

       Managerial decision making often involves choosing among alternative courses
  of action. From a financial perspective, the better of two options is either the one
  that yields the highest amount of income or, if neither produces income, the one
  that results in the least amount of loss.

       Differential analysis is a decision-making technique that examines the
  benefits and costs associated with each of two options and compares the net results
  of the two. The alternative selected is the one with the most favorable (or least
  unfavorable) financial impact. The evaluation includes only those costs that will
  change if one alternative is selected over another. Fixed costs or other costs that
  are constant for the two options are excluded from the analysis since they will not
  differentiate one choice from the other. Sunk costs, which are past expenditures
  that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, are also ignored since
  the amount will be the same regardless of the alternative selected.

EXAMPLE

    A bed & breakfast inn owner uses differential analysis to decide whether to
renovate a first-floor guest bedroom or to convert that space to a gift shop. A
summary of the year's revenues and costs for the two alternatives follows.

Revenues  Differential Analysis       Difference
Costs       Guest Room Gift Shop          $10,000
Income             $36,000 $42,000
                   (11,000) (15,000)
                   $47,000 $57,000

    Since the gift shop will yield $2,000 more in operating income than the guest
room, the gift shop alternative should be selected.

    Seven additional examples will be used to illustrate how differential analysis
can be applied to specific business decisions.

1. Make or buy a component part
2. Continue with or discontinue a business segment
3. Lease or sell equipment
4. Sell a product or process further
5. Keep or replace a fixed asset
6. Accept business at reduced price
7. Capital investment analysis

9.2 MAKE OR BUY A COMPONENT PART

    A manufacturing company may have the capacity and ability to make one of the
parts that goes into the manufacture of its products. It may also have the alternative
of purchasing the same part from an external supplier. Assuming equal quality and
availability, the lower-cost option will be selected.

EXAMPLE

    Compu Company manufactures laptop computers and now will sell them
complete with a carrying case. The company is currently operating below full
capacity and has the ability to manufacture the cases. The company may use
differential analysis to determine if it should make or buy the cases.

    For this differential analysis, only costs need to be considered. The selling price
per unit would not be affected by the decision, and no other factors impact revenue.

The following are the costs of producing one carrying case in house.

Direct materials        $22.40
Direct labor             14.00
Fixed factory overhead     5.60

    Rather than manufacturing the carrying cases, the company can purchase
them from an outside vendor for $34.20 each, plus a transportation cost of $3.70
per case.

    The following differential analysis compares the manufacturing costs per
unit with the costs related to purchasing the carrying case. Note that the factory
overhead is fixed and would be incurred under either alternative, so it is not listed.

Direct labor                         14.00

Total cost per case                  $36.40   $37.90   $1.50

    The cost of making the carrying case is $1.50 less than purchasing it. Compu
Company should manufacture the cases.

9.3 CONTINUE WITH OR DISCONTINUE A PRODUCT

    A product, department, territory, or other segment of a company may not
be performing to expectations and may even be generating a loss. The company
may consider discontinuing that segment to eliminate its variable costs and
any operating losses associated with the segment. However, fixed costs such
as depreciation, property taxes, and insurance will not be reduced. Therefore,
eliminating a segment does not always result in higher income for the business as
a whole. The decision as to whether to continue with or discontinue a product, etc.,
is based upon the relative difference between the financial impacts.

EXAMPLE

    Healthy Habits Company sells a variety snack food items. The following income
statement information relates to the popcorn product line for the previous year.

Sales                   $720,000
Cost of goods sold       480,000
Gross profit
Operating expenses      $240,000
Loss from operations     500,000

                      ($260,000)

    It is estimated that 25% of the cost of goods sold amount is fixed and 40% of the
operating expenses are fixed.

    The following differential analysis compares the cost of continuing the popcorn
product with the cost of discontinuing it. Note that the fixed portions of the cost of
goods sold and operating expenses would be incurred under either alternative, so
they are not included.

Revenue                              $700,000

Costs:

Variable cost of goods sold1         $360,000

Variable operating expenses2         300,000

Income                               $40,000

1 $480,000 x 75%
2 $500,000 x 60%

    Although continuing the sale of popcorn results in an operating loss for that
product line, it does yield $40,000 in operating income when fixed costs are
eliminated from the calculation. Since fixed costs will be incurred regardless of
whether popcorn is sold or not, keeping it in the product offerings has a positive
impact on the company's earnings. Discontinuing popcorn results in no revenue or
variable costs at all, so the company would miss out on the $40,000 contribution
toward paying fixed costs. The company should continue selling popcorn.

9.4 LEASE OR SELL EQUIPMENT

    A company may have purchased and used a fixed asset, such as equipment, a
vehicle, or a building, and finds it no longer needs that item in its operations. The
company may choose to sell the asset or lease it to another company to generate
an income stream. The company can use a differential analysis to determine the
alternative that provides the greater financial return.

EXAMPLE

    Harper Company purchased equipment for $40,000 several years ago. It
currently has a book value of $15,000. Harper can sell the equipment for $10,000.
The company would have to pay a 2% commission on the sale. Alternatively, the
company could lease the equipment to Alden Company for $2,400 for each of four
years. At the end of the lease period, the company could return the equipment to its
manufacturer for $100 for scrap. In both cases, it will cost Harper Company $900
to restore the equipment site in the factory once it is removed.

                                     Lease       Sell      Difference

         Revenue1                    $9,600 $10,000

         Costs:

                  Sales commission2                   200

         Income                      $9,700 $9,800

         1 $2,400 x 4
         2 $10,000 x 2%

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                  DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

    The income from the four-year lease plus the scrap value is compared to the
selling price minus the commission. The $900 restoration cost is not considered
since it must be paid under either option. The original purchase price is a sunk
cost that will not be recouped or changed regardless of the decision; therefore, it
is ignored as well. Since selling the equipment will result in a $100 greater return,
the company should sell the equipment.

9.5 SELL A PRODUCT OR PROCESS FURTHER

    A manufactured item may be produced in various stages or processes. In some
cases, the initial production yields one finished product and processing it further
results in a different product. In other cases, there may be a market for a partially
completed manufactured good, where the buyer ultimately completes the product
to its own specifications. A manufacturer may have to decide whether to sell a
product at an initial stage or process it further. The preferred choice is the one that
is more financially beneficial.

EXAMPLE

    Morning Roast Coffee, Inc. produces dark roast coffee in batches of 5,000
pounds. Materials cost is $5.80 per pound. The dark roast coffee can be sold
without further processing for $9.70 per pound or may be processed further to
yield dark roast decaf, which can be sold for $12.10 per pound. The processing into
decaf requires additional costs of $7,480 per batch. The additional processing will
also cause a 4% loss of product due to evaporation.

                      Differential Analysis

                                     Sell  Process   Difference
                                                          $2,100
Revenue1              $48,500 $60,500
Costs:
                       29,000                36,480
     Materials cost2  $19,500                 2,420
     Evaporation3
Income                                       $9,800

1 5,000 x $9.70  5,000 x $12.10
2 5,000 x $5.80  5,000 x $5.80 + $7,480
3 $60,500 x 4%

    The differential analysis first considers the different revenues from each
alternative and then the respective costs. Even with the 4% product loss from
processing further, the decaf coffee results in higher income. The company should
process the batch further.

9.6 KEEP OR REPLACE A FIXED ASSET

    A company may consider replacing a fixed asset it currently owns and operates
with one that is more efficient to reduce operating costs. The company can use
differential analysis to compare the cost of keeping its original asset and the cost of
replacing it with something new.

EXAMPLE

    McNamara Company is considering selling an existing piece of equipment
for $75,000 and replacing it with new equipment that will cost $182,000. The
old equipment cost $200,000 and currently has accumulated depreciation of
$120,000. The estimated annual variable operational costs for the next six years
are $21,000 for the old equipment and $6,000 for the new equipment.

     Purchase price       ($126,000)       36,000

Income (loss)                         ($143,000)

1 $21,000 x 6 $6,000 x 6

    Replacing the equipment will generate revenue from the sale of the original
asset, but the cost of acquiring the new asset will also be incurred. Each alternative
has different annual operating costs. The purchase price of the original equipment
is a sunk cost that will not be recouped or changed regardless of the decision;
therefore, it is ignored. Each alternative independently generates a loss, so the
choice with the lower loss is preferable. The company should keep and operate the
original equipment.

9.7 ACCEPT BUSINESS AT REDUCED PRICE

    A manufacturer may receive an offer to produce and sell additional items,
but at a selling price lower than normal. If the company has the capacity for the
additional production, it may use differential analysis to determine if the order
should be accepted or rejected based on financial considerations.

EXAMPLE

    Spark Top Company manufactures countertop toaster ovens and sells them
for $60 per unit. An overseas wholesaler offers to purchase 5,000 toaster ovens
for $36 per unit, which would be additional production beyond what Spark Top
had planned for. The company has the capacity to process this special order. The

                          Page | 110
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING            DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

variable manufacturing cost per unit is $25, and the fixed manufacturing cost per
unit is $15. A tariff of $800 is charged to the company for shipping each batch of
5,000 toaster ovens.

                        Differential Analysis

                        Accept       Reject    Difference
                                                  $54,200
Revenue1                $180,000
Costs:
                        125,000
     Production costs2       800
     Tariff
Income (loss)           $54,200

1 $5,000 x $36
2 $5,000 x $25

    No additional revenue or variable costs will be recognized if the company
rejects the special order. If it is accepted, revenue will exceed variable costs. Fixed
costs are not factored in since they will be incurred regardless of the decision. The
company should accept the special order.

    The implications of special order pricing may go beyond just financial
considerations. For example, processing special orders may reduce demand for the
same product at the normal selling price, ultimately decreasing overall income. In
addition, regular customers may be irritated to learn that new customers are receiving
a better deal and either demand a price match or consider shopping elsewhere.

    As has been discussed and illustrated, differential analysis involves
looking at the different benefits and costs that would arise from alternative solutions
to a particular problem. Much of the analysis is quantitative, but it is also important
to consider qualitative factors such as customer loyalty, vendor relationships,
employee morale, social responsibility, and opportunity costs. The financial
element, however, is a critical starting point for managerial decision making.

9.8 CAPITAL INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

    One of a company's most significant financial decisions involves the purchase
of property, plant, and equipment that will be used in business operations. The
costs of these assets are often very high, and they will be in place for many years
to come.

    Before acquiring a capital asset such as equipment, machinery, or a building,
which involves a large expenditure and long-term commitment, a company should
evaluate how effectively it is expected to generate a return on investment for the
business. Capital investment analysis is a form of differential analysis used to
determine (1) whether a fixed asset should be purchased at all, or (2) which fixed
asset among a number of choices is the best investment. Three commonly used
methods for evaluating capital investments will be discussed.

                        Page | 111
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING                                          DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

    The first two, the average rate of return method and the cash payback method,
are relatively straightforward calculations that are often used to determine whether
a proposed investment meets a minimum standard for it even to be considered
further.

    The average rate of return method is the percentage return of net income
from the proposed investment. It is calculated as follows:

                       Average annual income
                         Average investment

Each of the two amounts must first be calculated independently.

Average annual income      Total estimated income over the asset's useful life
       (numerator)     =

                                 Number of years in the asset's useful life

Average investment = Book value at the beginning of the first year1 + Book value at the end of the last year2
(denominator)                                       2

1 The book value at the beginning of the first year is the asset's cost.
2 The book value at the end of the last year is the asset's residual value.

As an example, a new piece of equipment that is being considered for purchase
costs $90,000 and has a residual value of $10,000. It is expected to generate
revenue of $75,000 over its estimated useful life of 5 years.

               Average annual income  =  $75,000       = $15,000

                                                 5

               Average investment =  $110,000 + $10,000  = $60,000

                                         2

                                                        $15,000
               Average rate of return = $60,000 = 25%

    The average rate of return of 25% should then be compared to the minimum
rate of return that management requires. If the average rate of return is greater
than the minimum acceptable rate, the equipment should be evaluated further
since it seems promising. If it does not even meet this standard, however, it should
not be purchased.

    The cash payback method looks at the annual net cash inflow from the use
of an asset to determine how many years it will take to recover the cost of the asset.
Net cash flow includes all cash revenue generated minus all cash expenditures paid
from using the asset. Depreciation is not a cash expenditure, so it would not be
considered in determining net cash flow.

                                     Page | 112
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING  DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

    As an example, a new piece of equipment that is being considered for purchase
costs $80,000. It is expected to generate $25,000 cash revenue each year and
require cash expenditures of $5,000 to maintain.

      Cost                           $80,000
Cash payback period = Annual nest cash flow = $25,000 - $5,000 = 4 years

    The cash payback period of four years should be compared to the maximum
period that management desires. If the cash payback period of four years is more
than an acceptable payback period of three years, for example, the purchase should
no longer be considered. If a payback period of five years is acceptable, the purchase
should be looked into further.

    If annual net cash flows are not expected to be equal each year, the cash payback
period is determined by adding the annual expected cash flows year by year until
the sum equals the initial cost of the asset.

    For example, a new piece of equipment that is being considered for purchase
costs $80,000. Its expected annual cash flows are as follows:

Year  Net Cash Flow                  Cash Flow to Date
  1       $12,000                           $12,000
  2        18,000                            30,000
  3        24,000                            54,000
  4        26,000                            80,000
  5        30,000                           110,000
  6        34,000                           144,000

In this case, net cash flows recover the initial cost of $80,000 after four full years.
    The average rate of return and the cash payback methods are relatively simple

to calculate, yet they yield rather general results. Since neither considers the time
value of money, they are more effective for shorter-term investments. They are
often used as an initial screening to see if an investment should be immediately
disqualified. If not, the investment may be analyzed further using more robust
analyses.

    The net present value (NPV) method for evaluating a potential investment
also looks at estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. It compares
the purchase price (investment amount) to the present value of all the future net
cash flows from using the asset. The investment is considered viable if the present
value of the future net cash flows is greater than the purchase price. Otherwise, the
investment should be avoided.

    Present value factors the timing of future net cash inflows and the effect of
a prevailing interest rate. An amount of cash received in the future is worth less
than the same amount of cash received today. This is because cash received now
may be invested at a given interest rate that causes its value to grow over time

      Page | 113
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING       DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

compounding, where interest is earned both on principal and on interest that has
already been earned. The opportunity to invest dollars received in the future rather
than today is postponed, missing out on time available to earn interest.

    Determining the future value of a current amount is calculated by multiplying
the amount by itself plus the interest rate. For example, the future value of $1.00 in
3 years at an interest rate of 6% would be calculated as follows:

       $1.00 x 1.06 = $1.06 x 1.06 = $1.12 x 1.06 = $1.19

Note that interest is calculated on interest previously earned. This process is called
compounding.

    Present value works in the opposite direction. An amount in the future is
known or estimated (such as a net cash inflow), and the calculation backs that
amount up to its current value. The process is called discounting. For example, the
present value of $1.00 to be received in 3 years at an interest rate of 6% would be
calculated as follows:

$1.00  =  $0.94   =  $0.89  = $0.84 (rounded to the nearest cent)
1.06
          1.06       1.06

    The following table summarizes the present value of $1 for 10 periods for three
interest rates: 6%, 8%, and 10%. Amounts are rounded to five decimal places rather
than to the nearest cent.

                     0.55840 0.46319

    Note that all amounts in the present value table are less than $1.00 since all
represent a future cash receipt rather than the $1.00 today. The further into the
future the $1.00 will be received for a given interest rate, the lower its present value.

    Clearly not all future cash receipts are for $1.00. To get the present value of
a different value, multiply the actual number of dollars by the present value of
$1 amount given in the table at the intersection of a specified interest rate and
number of years.

    Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the process of discounting the future net cash flows
to determine their total and comparing it to the cost of the asset.

EXAMPLE 1

    A company is considering purchasing equipment #1 for $100,000. It is expected
to provide net cash flows of $24,000 per year for the next six years for a total of
$144,000. The minimum desired rate of return on the investment is 6%.

  5         24,000        0.79209         20,151    annuity of $1, as follows:

            24,000        0.70495         17,934    $24,000 x 4.91731 = $118,016

           $144,000                      $118,016   Rather than multiplying $24,000
                                                    six times by six different factors,
Cost                                 (100,000)      $24,000 can be multiplied once

                                                    (4.91731). The result is the same.

    In this case, the net present value of the future cash flows of $18,016 is greater
than the cost of the asset, $100,000. The investment may be accepted since it more
than pays for itself over time.

    If the cost of the asset had been $130,000 rather than $100,000, the net present
value would have been ($11,984), which is $118,016 - $130,000. In this case the
NPV is negative and the proposed purchase should be rejected.

EXAMPLE 2

    A company is considering purchasing equipment #2 for $100,000. It is expected
to provide net cash flows of different amounts each year for the next six years for
a total of $144,000. The minimum desired rate of return on the investment is 6%.

       than the cost of the asset, $100,000. The investment may be accepted since it more
       than pays for itself over time.

           Net present value can be used to perform differential analysis to compare
       results of two or more proposed investments to determine which is more financially
       beneficial. Examples 3 and 4a show these comparisons.

       EXAMPLE 3

           A company is considering two different proposals for purchasing equipment.
       Both assets will be useful for six years. The first piece of equipment costs $100,000,

       but it also costs more to purchase. Both assets yield a positive net present value, but
       the first piece of equipment has a higher NPV, $21,526, vs. the NPV of the second
       piece, $17,788. The first piece of equipment should be purchased based on this result.

           It is possible that two different investments will span two different periods;
       that is, one may generate cash flows for more years than the other. In order to
       perform a differential analysis, the number of years must be the same for both. To
       make them comparable, the asset with the higher number of years of cash flows is
       adjusted to assume that it is sold for its residual value amount in the last year that
       the other asset provides cash flows.

       EXAMPLE 4A

           A company is considering two different proposals for purchasing equipment.
       The first asset provides cash flows for four years, and the second one provides
       cash flows for six years. Both assets cost $100,000 and have a residual value of
       $10,000. Both have undiscounted net cash flows of $124,000 as shown in the
       tables that follow.

                                      $8,724

           Note that the cash flow period for the second piece of equipment is adjusted
       to four years to match that of the first piece of equipment. There are two net cash
       flows for the second piece of equipment in year four: (1) the inflow from using
       the equipment, and (2) the proceeds from selling it at its residual value. The cash
       flows for the fifth and sixth years for the second asset are not considered and are
       therefore greyed out in the table.

           Both assets yield a positive net present value, but the first piece of equipment
       has a higher NPV, $8,724, vs. the NPV of the second piece, $7,733. The first piece
       of equipment should be purchased based on this result.

           As a final illustration of two companies with different cash flow periods, note
       that the net present value would be identical if the annual net cash flows were the
       same. In this case, all are equal in years 1, 2, and 3. In year 4, they also both equal
       $32000: for the first asset the $32,000 is all operational cash flow, and for the
       second piece of equipment, the $32,000 includes $22,000 of operational cash flow
       and $10,000 selling price.

           Differential analysis is a useful planning tool for projecting relative results among
       alternatives. It encourages managers to think ahead and analyze the components of
       alternative outcomes with the goal of more insightful decision making.
