Dear Reader,

Since our 10th Anniversary Edition of eMarketing: The Essential Guide to Marketing in a Digital
World, we have witnessed a global wave of change that has had an undeniable impact on
how we live, connect, and communicate worldwide. There is no doubt that the COVID-19
pandemic has, and will continue to have, a lasting effect on human reality. With this in mind,
we are incredibly proud to present the 7th Edition of our textbook.

The pandemic has sped up digital transformation and technologies by several years, which is why
we've adopted an alternative approach to revisiting the contents of this textbook. Every digital
marketing element has changed significantly since our last edition, and for this reason, we have
aligned this textbook with the latest trends and developments in evolved marketing structures.
Consumer and user-experience continue to influence all strategic marketing decisions, while
technology and data-driven insights fuel decision-making to accelerate results for businesses.

We've revisited each part and changed the titles to Planning, Claiming, Creating, Uniting,
Advertising and Analysing - a slight departure from our previous edition - to focus on the
integration of technology and data in every aspect of marketing to enhance customer experience
and secure business success through meaningful engagement and connections. We have
reorganised the contents of this edition with updated statistics and new case studies.

You will notice that we have elaborated on planning and strategy to set the context and
framework for digital marketing, with a strong focus on content as an essential part of Creating.
The structure of the textbook explores why customers and data have become so essential to
marketing, and how brands can use customer data to market more effectively. We have also
included dedicated chapters like Content marketing and value and Content creation as the
primary means to connect and engage with customers. Because of the evolution of technology
and data-driven insights, we've dedicated three chapters to Advertising to unpack the extent
of opportunities that have progressed over the past few years. An exciting new chapter titled
Future of advertising, looks at how technology has and continues to change advertising into
the future, as well as how marketers and business owners can take full advantage of authentic
content and online connections to build brand presence and foster loyalty.

All the content has been critically reviewed by our experienced panel of subject matter experts
who have given their time and expertise freely to deliver this comprehensive and insightful
edition. Their commitment and support, thereby giving back to the digital community, made
this possible. We are incredibly proud of this achievement, and we thank every person who
has contributed. We are humbled by the relentless pursuit to deliver this book, despite the
copious amount of work it has taken. We believe that knowledge is power and developing the
skills to action this power is what sets the achievers apart from the rest. We believe that for
education to have an effective future, it needs partnership between the private and academic
sectors to ensure students are being taught the latest thinking from the coalface of business
innovation. By making our textbook available for free online, we hope to ensure that the very

                                                                                                                                    iii
     best education is as accessible as it can be to as many people as possible. In fact, less than
     10% of the many institutions who use our book pay for it, and we are delighted by this. We
     want to make a lasting impression, and this is an important part of us achieving that.
     We hope you enjoy our book and remember, the most important thing any human can do is
     teach, even if you're not a teacher. Share your knowledge and make the world a better place.
     If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

    This 7th edition is our first edition in a post-Covid world and arrives in a world that has seen
    dramatic change and acceleration in all things digital. It is also the first edition we've produced
    following Red & Yellow's acquisition by Honoris United Universities in 2020.

    As has been the experience of so many tertiary institutions and businesses, the last two years
    have brought about great change for our school. Whilst many of the people who have worked
    on this edition are new and have brought with them fresh ideas and perspectives, they are also
    fortunate to have stood on the shoulders of the marketing giants who have preceded them.

    continued success of this textbook. We want to acknowledge the following people in particular:

Reviews for previous editions

In teaching my postgraduate course, eMarketing has been the textbook of choice for years. It
presents a great blend of marketing strategy information with detailed but digestible technical
explanations of the digital space. The material is presented in a way that remains current and
relevant, despite the constantly evolving world of digital marketing. Students also appreciate
the open-source content, making it a go-to resource each semester.

Prof. Anne Cramer (Professor, Fashion Faculty of Business, Humber Institute of Technology and
Advanced Learning)

eMarketing: The Essential Guide to Marketing in a Digital World provides rich detail without
overwhelming the reader with technical jargon. Overall, the author does a great job in presenting
somewhat more complex issues in user-friendly ways. The book situates some examples in a
South African context, but it should be meaningful in any cultural context.

Dr. Reto Felix (Associate Professor of Marketing, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Department
of Marketing)

This book has been put together by some of the sharpest minds in the digital marketing and
education fields, and the combination of deep subject matter expertise and pedagogic nous
is powerfully telling. The book is at once informative, accessible, and practical - a must read
for anyone looking to enter the industry or to better come to grips with an ever-changing
dynamic landscape.

PLANNING
        PLANNING

  INTRODUCTION TO PLANNING

    Advertising and marketing were once the domain of a few powerful people who told customers
    what they wanted. Customers are no longer told what they want. The pervasiveness of digital
    technology has empowered the customer when it comes to making purchasing decisions.
    They tell businesses what they want, how, and when.

    Marketing and digital marketing, in particular, has created a symbiotic relationship between
    businesses and their customers. The proliferation of digital tools and the internet has opened
    a free-flowing, two-way marketing channel into our daily lives.

    Digital marketing does not deviate much from traditional marketing. However, it does offer
    unique opportunities that used to be more difficult to execute. For example, marketing campaigns
    can now be easily tailored to target specific customers, `attention for value' can be leveraged
    to create consumer demand, and the customer experience can be personalised and leads to
    a far higher return on investment.

    All of this means that planning is an essential part of an effective marketing strategy that has
    impact. If you don't plan, you risk a sloppy marketing campaign, one that is inconsistent in its
    messaging, and carries reputational risk. As the cliché goes: `If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.'

    Planning means taking a big picture view of your customers, and then using these insights to
    further distil what makes your product special, and how to target your customers. For example,
    you need to consider the way people use their devices before you even consider what medium
    you will use to target your customer.

    While existing and operating in a digital world has its risk, the opportunities are huge. There
    are immense advantages to digital marketing that can guarantee higher rates of return on
    investment. Digital marketing can be low cost, flexible, convenient, and targeted.

    Chapter 1: Introduction to marketing tackles how the internet has changed marketing and
    how to think about digital audiences. You will learn how to leverage the advantages of digital
    marketing and through data analytics, discover that there is no excuse for not reaching your
    audience and getting your product or service into their hands.

    Chapter 2: Importance of the customer focuses on the use of demographics and psycho-
    graphics to develop user personas, and how extrinsic and intrinsic motivators encourage brand
    recognition and loyalty.

    Chapter 3: Market research discusses the importance of conducting market research and
    how to use this research and data to inform your strategy.

    Chapter 4: Strategy defines business strategy with the goal (other than making your customer
    happy) to use research to inform your plan of action. You will understand how consumer
    behaviour affects strategy and ultimately, get to a place where you understand the how and
    the why, and to use the why to realise the how.

· How to think about digital audiences
· About the importance of data-driven decision making.

                                                                                                                                    3

1.1 INTRODUCTION

Where there is a product or service, there must be a way to get it into a customer's hands.
Some of the primary functions of marketing include planning, promoting, persuading, managing
channels and information, pricing, product service management, and selling. Digital marketing
offers a unique opportunity to tailor marketing campaigns to target specific customers. If done
properly, this can result in a higher return on investment (ROI), which is the ratio of cost to profit.
Digital marketing also allows for more scope in terms of branding and public relations through
content marketing. However, this also poses risk. The internet moves fast, and reputational
damage is possible in a heartbeat if campaigns and digital marketing strategies are not carefully
thought out and planned. In this chapter, you will be introduced to digital marketing, creating
a foundation on which you can build your digital marketing strategy.

  1.3 WHAT IS MARKETING?

    Marketing is the creation and satisfaction of demand for your product, service, or idea. If
    marketing is successful, it will create demand; this demand should translate into sales and,
    ultimately, revenue. Kotler (2012) described marketing as follows:
4
                                                                                                      Introduction to marketing

   The science and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of
   a target market at a profit. Marketing identifies unfulfilled needs and desires. It defines,
   measures, and quantifies the size of the identified market and the profit potential.

The American Marketing Association (2017) defines marketing as follows:

   The activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and
   exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

The design of the product or service itself is, arguably, a function of marketing - this is where
meaningful benefits and value for the customer are created. Once the product or service
exists, you need to get it into customers' hands and motivate them to pay for it. Even better,
you need to convince the customer that your product, service, or organisation is superior to
your competitors. To do this, you need to convince the customer of your product's benefits and
value. The value that a marketer should seek to create should be equal to or even greater than
the cost of the product to the consumer. Doing this often and consistently will grow trust in
and loyalty towards the brand and create strong brand equity.

1.3.1 Business goals

The goal of a business is to sell services and products to generate a profit. Marketing is the
sum total of activities and strategies that a business undertakes to encourage people and other
businesses to buy (and continue buying) its products and services. Every business benefits
from marketing, and each one needs to create a tailored mix of approaches and tactics that
suit it, its budget, its offering, and its target customers.

Marketing enables customers to buy products by fulfilling the following roles:

· Awareness: Marketing lets people know about brands and products. Customers can't buy
    something they don't know about. Therefore the first essential role of marketing is to raise
    awareness of an offering among the target group who is likely to buy it.

· Information: Marketing tells people when, where, and how to buy products. Once a person
    knows about a product, they need some basic information in order to buy it. A brand's
    marketing strategy should always include information that enables customers to easily
    make a purchase.

· Persuasion: Marketing makes people want a product. Once someone knows a product
    exists, they need to be convinced that it is worth their time, money, and effort to obtain it.
    Marketing strives to create an emotional connection between person and product or brand.

· Affinity: Marketing makes people love brands and products. A customer is much more
    likely to buy a product that makes them feel great, shares their values, and entertains
    them. Many established brands focus their marketing efforts on building and improving
    sentiment - just think about how passionate Apple, adidas, or Tabasco fans are about their
    favourite brands, and what an impact this can have on their success.

                                                                                                                                    5
        PLANNING

    The role of marketing is to inform, entice, educate, excite, and persuade people to buy services
    or products. Marketing aims to influence the perceptions of people in favour of the brand
    and its offering, with the ultimate goal of getting them to make a purchase (and continue
    to make purchases in the future and to become return customers). It does this through two
    complementary approaches:

    1. Factual: This approach appeals to the intellect and relies on clear facts, features, benefits,
         and rational arguments that indicate why a product is a good choice, for example: "This
         solar heater lets you save 60% off your monthly electricity bill."

    2. Emotional: This approach relies on tapping into people's feelings, aspirations, hopes, fears
         and dreams to encourage emotive, impulse purchases, for example: "This solar heater could
         be your contribution to saving the environment and protecting the planet we live on."

    One of the most important concepts for marketers to internalise is that people don't buy products;
    they buy what the product can do for them, how it makes them feel, or what it says about them.

    Nobody buys a hammer for the sake of owning a hammer; they are buying the ability to repair
    a broken appliance, enjoy some hobby DIY, or appear capable. A TAGHeuer wristwatch doesn't
    do anything a Casio couldn't, but it indicates a person who values masculinity, innovation,
    and precision.

    Extrapolating from this, marketing is about showing your potential customers how your offering
    can make them awesome, successful, and better.

    The first step to developing a marketing strategy is to understand your environment, your
    customers, and how to access these customers.

  1.4 UNDERSTANDING YOUR ENVIRONMENT

    Your brand does not exist in a vacuum. There are multiple factors affecting your business right
    at this very moment. Your business has control over some of these elements, while it has no
    control over others.

   1.4.1 Micro factors

    Micro factors are mostly internal elements or factors that you and your business have some
    control over, such as your brand, your brand or product's unique selling point (USP), and any
    digital offerings.

    It should be noted that, while you have some control over micro factors that affect your business,
    these are informed by macro factors. It is important to keep this in mind when you are doing
    any kind of strategic planning, or simply day-to-day brand management. You could say that
    macro factors are the `bigger picture,' while micro factors are the details. You need to keep an
    eye on the bigger picture without losing sight of the details, and vice versa.

Your brand

Your company or business is the factor that you have the most control over. You decide how
the brand comes across to the world - your brand identity. Here are some important questions
to ask yourself about your brand:

9 Who are you?

9 Who are you for?

9 What does your brand stand for?

9 What does your brand stand against?

9 What is your USP?                                  NOTE    Watch this video of Professor John
9 How do you find customers? (i.e., Do you                   Simpson explaining USP: vimeo.

    have a website/app? Which social media
    platforms do you use? Where and how do

you advertise online?)

9 How do you treat customers (past, existing, and future)?

Aside from the product or service you offer, your brand is your most important currency. It is
the thing that people will remember (for better or for worse). However, it is easy to fall into a
trap of insincerity. Ensure that your brand is aligned to your company's values. Exposure for
the sake of exposure is not always a good thing. Your brand must be sensitive to macro factors,
as well as your own internal values and goals.

                                                                                                   7

   1.4.2 Macro factors

   You can control what you present to the world, to a degree. Unfortunately, there is little you
   can do about how the world sees you.

   Macro factors are aspects that are beyond your business's control. Macro factors are the
   opportunities as well as the threats to your business. These can include:

   · The state of the local or global economy         NOTE  Opportunities and risks will be explored
   · Current trends                                         in greater detail in Chapter 4: Strategy.
   · Current events
   · The opportunity or threat presented by a

       specific thing `going viral.'

   1.5 WHAT IS DIGITAL MARKETING?

   How does digital marketing fit into this definition? There is, in fact, no difference between
   `traditional' marketing and digital marketing. They are one and the same, apart from digital
   being specific to a medium.

   Ultimately, the aim of any type of marketing is to keep and grow a customer base and
   stimulate sales in the future. Digital communication tools contribute to connecting and building
   long-term relationships with customers.

   What is digital?

   A participatory layer of all media that allows users to self-select their own experiences,
   and affords marketers the ability to bridge media, gain feedback, iterate their message,
   and collect relationships (Caddell, 2013).

   Digital is a way of exploring content and ideas (for users) and connecting with and understanding
   customers (for marketers).

   Digital marketing is powerful in two fundamental ways. Firstly, the audience can be segmented
   very precisely, even down to factors like current location and recent brand interactions, which
   means that messages can (and must) be personalised and tailored for them.

   Secondly, the digital sphere is almost completely  NOTE  You will learn more about data-driven

1.5.1 The digital audience

In the simplest terms, a digital audience is your online target audience.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a marked shift in the way people access the things they
want and need. While people were increasingly moving online in many parts of the world,
they were looking for specific products and services. People still sought out many, if not most,
products and services in traditional ways. For example, a person may do bulk shopping on a
website such as Amazon, but do their daily grocery shopping at an actual store. Or, a person
may from time-to-time purchase clothing on sites such as Alibaba or Shein, but still visit
clothing stores for unique pieces.

However, during the lockdowns that followed the outbreak of COVID-19, people were forced
to move most, if not all, of their shopping online in some way. For instance, there was a huge
spike in on-demand grocery delivery services, as this was safer and more convenient. In South
Africa, one of the largest supermarket chains, Checkers, launched their on-demand delivery
app and service, Checkers Sixty60, months before hard lockdown was announced in March
2020. This service met the needs of a population but, more than that, it simplified a chore that
is generally quite tedious.

The service was a huge success, with competitors scrambling to catch up. Even after lockdown
regulations were eased, many customers continued to use the service regularly.

Convenience and speed are driving customers online more and more. The rise of social media
and the internet of things (IoT) has also increased the rate of a migration to digital. Customers
have certain expectations, and one of these is that they are able to investigate, access, acquire,
and talk about a product or service online.

Like any target audience, it is important to be as specific as possible when it comes to reaching
out. It is tempting to consider your digital audience as a homogenous group and only one segment
of your overall audience, but the past decade has shown that this is not an effective strategy.

1.5.2 Data-driven decision making

A benefit of digital marketing is that you do not have to theorise, guess, or rely on `gut feel' in
pursuit of customers who want and will pay for your product or service. The internet provides
real-time data, which you can use to improve your business and marketing decisions.

You can use data to be:

· Descriptive: Use raw data to describe the market.
· Diagnostic: Find out `why' and look for patterns.
· Predictive: Analyse data, both past and current, to predict future sales, revenue, and

    market changes.
· Prescriptive: Use the findings of the previous three types of data analytics to determine

    a possible solution to a problem, thereby delivering value.

                                                                                                                                    9
    PLANNING

    In addition to having access to more raw data than ever before, which is current and based

    on user behaviour, the internet makes it possible

    for a business to pivot, or to change direction,   NOTE  Learn more about data-driven decision
    far more quickly. This agility allows for a              making in Chapter 20: Tracking and
    business to meet actual needs and current                analysis.
    trends, rather than perceived needs and desires.

    Two major data-collection trends that are relevant and useful for digital marketing are the rise
    of social media and the `internet of me.'

    Social media

    Briefly, social media refers to social networking sites and apps, such as Facebook, Twitter,
    Instagram, and TikTok. The content on these platforms is, by and large, user generated, however,
    social media advertising has been a fast-growing marketing option since the mid-2000s.

    Social media allows customers to be part of a conversation, which can drive interest to a
    business's social media profile, their website, or even a brick-and-mortar store. In addition,
    social media makes it possible for the collection of big data, as well as user-specific data.

    The internet of me

    The `internet of me' is a broad term, which refers to technology that allows people to take their
    bodies and minds online. At present, this includes:

    · Self-tracking technology on smartphones or smartwatches (i.e., Clue or Flo, which a woman
        can use to track their menstrual cycle).

    · Wearable technology (i.e., Apple watches, Garmin, Fitbit, which track everything from a
        user's sleep patterns to their heart rate throughout the day).

    Tied to the ability to gather and mine more data, the `internet of me' is also creating unique
    opportunities for marketers to find, target, impress, and retain customers. Smartwatches, for
    example, allow users to input data to track everything from exercise to menstrual cycles to
    calorie consumption. Many smartwatches also track personal data in the background, such
    as sleep or heart rate.

    1.6 MARKETING AND THE INTERNET

    The complete scope of digital marketing is practised on the internet. Products and services are
    positioned and promoted, purchased, distributed, and serviced. The web provides consumers
    with more choice, more influence, and more power. On the internet, brands constantly have:

    · New ways of selling
    · New products and services to sell
    · New markets to which they can sell.

Digital marketing helps to create consumer demand by using the power of the interconnected,
interactive web. It enables the exchange of currency but, more than that, it enables the exchange
of attention for value.

                                                                  Product or
                                                                    service

Data  Attention

                                                                    Money

                                       Figure 1.2 An exchange of value

If marketing creates and satisfies demand, digital marketing drives the creation of demand
using the power of the internet and satisfies this demand in new and innovative ways.

A brand on the internet can gain value in the form of time, attention, and advocacy from the
consumer. For the user, value can be added in the form of entertainment, education, and
utility. Brands build loyalty among users who love their products or services and must align
with users' values and aspirations. Users fall in love with products and services when their
experience is tailored to their needs, and not the needs of the brand. The internet makes this
possible by closing the gap between who creates the product and who uses the product. In
this way, customers themselves become part of the marketing project.

1.6.1 Understanding the internet

There is no doubt about it: the internet has changed the world we live in. Never before has it
been so easy to access information, communicate with people all over the globe, and share
articles, videos, photos, and all manner of media.

But, what is the internet? And how has it changed marketing?

The internet is, simply, a network of networks. Its proliferation has led to an increasingly
connected communications environment. Not only does the internet offer marketers wider
audience reach, it also allows for tracking and data gathering, which can inform future campaigns
and, even, product development. What started as pop-up ads on basic webpages has become
far more sophisticated and powerful. The internet has certainly moved on from its early
beginnings, and marketers are well positioned to reap the benefits.

                                                                                                                                    11
          PLANNING

     The internet is almost ubiquitous in today's world. Even in less economically developed countries,
     digital marketing is possible, and effective, because of social media access. This is primarily
     driven by the rise in smartphones and more affordable data in most countries. People who were
     previously excluded from using the internet because they did not have access to a computer
     or internet connection, now have access to the internet and social media on their phones.
     Look at Figure 1.2 below, which shows the number of unique mobile phone users, internet
     users, and active social media users. Almost 60% of the world's population uses the internet,
     and just over 50% of the world's population is active on social media.

                                        Figure 1.3 Digital use around the world

   1.6.2 How people access the internet

     People connect to the internet and access content in many different ways. When it comes
     to the physical connection to the internet, the market presents a number of options, such as
     Dial-up, 3G, 4G, and 5G connection, wifi and WiMAX, Broadband, and ADSL.
     The devices people use to access the internet vary from mobile phones and tablets, to personal
     notebooks and desktop computers.
     The environment that people are in when they access the internet also differs. People can
     access and use the internet:
     · At home
     · At the office, or place of work
     · At a library

· At an internet café
· On the go (using portable devices, such as mobile phones, laptops, or tablets).
Not only do these environmental factors affect how people use the internet, but their reasons
for using the internet also have an effect on how they interact online.

For some people, the internet is primarily a communications channel, and their online activity
is focused on social media or their email inbox. For others, it may be a research channel, with
search engines playing a large role in their online experience.

1.6.3 What does the internet have to do with marketing?

The growth of internet usage has resulted in declining distribution of traditional media, such as
television, radio, newspapers, and magazines. These were once important marketing channels,
as they offered a way for marketers to connect with audiences.

Consider this example: In the late 1980s through the early 2000s, many families watched
television on a daily basis. They had limited options when deciding how, when, and where to
watch programmes on television. Over an hour, the show may have had six to seven ad breaks,
which the viewer was forced to watch - they did not have the ability to fast-forward through
the ads. However, as the internet has become more and more ubiquitous, and as data has
become more affordable, streaming has become the preferred way to watch television. When
a viewer is streaming a show, there are no ad breaks or, at least, the viewer has the option to
fast-forward and ignore them.

So, where marketers once had a captive audience (the television viewer), this model has
changed, necessitating a shift in how companies tell customers about their products. The
rise of streaming platforms, such as Netflix, has necessitated a shift in how marketers reach
customers that they previously would have had contact with through TV advertising.

The way people use their devices, such as their laptops, mobile phones, or desktop computers,
also influences marketing activities and campaigns. For example, if your target audience is the
parents of small children and your research has turned up the fact that most of your customers
use a social media app, such as Facebook, after their children have gone to bed, it would affect
your scheduling. In this case, hosting a live Facebook event at 6 p.m., when most parents are
cooking dinner and getting children ready for bed, would not be well attended and would not
have the desired reach. However, scheduling it in for 8 p.m. will be far more successful. It may
also mean that all parents attend, instead of just the primary caregiver. In this example, you
want to give parents less to worry about. Your scheduling should therefore be practical, and
the technical aspects of the event should be seamless. If parents struggle to log in or register,
they will rather not bother; it's just one more thing to add to their to-do list.

By really considering your target audience, you can eliminate potential problems before they
even arise. This will result in a successful campaign and goodwill towards your brand.

                                                                                                                                    13
PLANNING

1.6.4 What makes online marketing so special?

This is not to say that advertising should be solely online. Your online and offline marketing
efforts are not separate. These two should ideally work in conjunction with each other. You
may think that you don't need to put effort into your digital marketing because people don't
buy as much online, but this is rapidly changing. Many brands are starting to concentrate on
their online presence as much as their offline presence.

Over the past few decades, marketers have begun to wake up to the power of the internet,
both as a platform for communication and as a way of tracking conversations. Marketing is
about conversations, and the internet facilitates these on a global scale.

As shown in Table 1.2 online marketing has definite benefits that do not apply to offline marketing.

Table 1.2 The benefits of online marketing

Low cost: Online marketing allows for             Flexibility and convenience: The marketer
lower production costs, speed-to-market,          can switch creatively mid-campaign, based on
cost-efficient customer feedback, and wider       instant feedback. Consumers can also research
advertising reach at lower costs than offline     and purchase products and services at their
marketing.                                        leisure. This means businesses need to offer
                                                  them what they want and use careful targeting
                                                  to ensure they are reaching the right people.

Targeting: Online marketing offers                More options: Advertising tools include pay-
exceptionally specific targeting, including       per-click advertising, email marketing, local
demographic, geographic, browser, channel,        search integration, and much more.
and behavioural and interest targeting, helping
to reach the right people in the right place and
at the right time, to encourage conversions.

Analytics: The best part of online marketing is how measurable it is. You can measure pretty
much everything you do online. Consider traditional marketing: You might purchase a billboard.
You have an idea of how many cars drive past that billboard each day, and you hope that the
people in those cars notice it. With digital, you can place a social media ad or a banner ad, and
you'll know exactly how many people had the opportunity to see it and what their reactions were.
Google Analytics and other free analytics tools make it easy to measure the performance of
marketing efforts and optimise them for the best results.

   1.6.5 What are the affordances of digital?

     On a surface level, it is good to know what type of digital marketing is available to your
     business. However, it is also important to understand the properties of digital, in other words,
     its properties and what it is used for. This is known as the affordances.

     For example, the affordance of a banana is eating. The banana exists, and we can explain
     what it looks like, but unless we understand what it is used for, it is not useful to describe it.

14
                                                          Introduction to marketing

In a similar way, digital marketing offers opportunities for tailoring how you target and engage
with customers. There are several ways to think about the affordances of a particular digital
marketing tool. Firstly, understand the affordances of digital as a whole which offers:

· Information
· Connection
· Community
· Convenience
· Power and influence
· Feedback.

Then, consider the affordances of particular platforms below:

Business's website  Business's social media accounts
                    (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
Information
Convenience         Information
                    Connection
                    Community
                    Convenience
                    Feedback

Taking the time to properly consider the affordances of digital allows for businesses to be more
human-centric, driven by data to gain insight into customers' lives, opinions, needs, desires,
weaknesses, and more to inform design and approach.

1.7 WHAT IS A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL?

A communication channel is the route through which a business or brand communicates with
the customer.

    PLANNING

    Digital marketing makes it possible to put the customer at the centre of your digital marketing
    strategy. This is because there is a greater sense of community online. Whereas a radio advert
    is one-way communication, digital marketing, particularly on social media platforms, allows
    for two-way communication.

    It is important to factor this in when you are      NOTE  You will learn more about this in
    developing your marketing strategy. There is a            Chapter 4: Strategy.
    time and place for both forms of communica-
    tion, however, this will depend on your product,
    the customer, your budget, and your strategic goals.

    1.7.1 Employing an omnichannel approach

    It is tempting to stick with what you know, especially when it comes to a form of marketing
    that is as ever-evolving as digital marketing. However, your customers are not homogenous
    in their dreams, desires, ambitions, or lifestyles. Digital marketing offers you an opportunity
    to find a common thread between all of these potential and existing customers and to pull at
    that in order to convert attention into sales. By sticking with one approach, you risk missing a
    segment of customers entirely or frustrating a segment of customers who are used to choices.

    The term `omnichannel' refers to a business strategy that offers "seamless and effortless,
    high quality customer experiences that occur within and between contact channels" (Frost
    & Sullivan, 2020).

    An example of this is a retailer who has both an online presence (web store, social media
    store), as well as a brick-and-mortar store. This retailer offers customers multiple options in
    terms of purchasing products, including:

    · The ability to shop online, with delivery to their door

    · The ability to shop in person, which allows    NOTE     You will explore the omnichannel
        them to browse and possibly try the product           approach in greater detail in Chapter 22:

    · The ability to research online, ahead of

    visiting the brick-and-mortar store.

    1.8 CASE STUDY: SPRINT
       AN OMNICHANNEL APPROACH TO INCREASE SALES

    Sprint Corporation was an American telecommunications
    company, which has now merged with T-Mobile. Before the
    merger, Sprint was the fourth-largest mobile network operator
    in the USA.

                                                                                                  Introduction to marketing

One-line summary

In 2017, Sprint, a US-based mobile network operation, performed an experiment with
Google Ads to test how digital advertising impacted the business's revenue.

The problem

Executives at Sprint were interested in how digital marketing spend impacted digital
and in-store sales. Acknowledging the challenges that traditional marketing campaigns
presented when quantifying sales and impact, Sprint decided to isolate the impact that
paid Google search would have on driving sales.
Initially, Sprint looked at its normal marketing approach and predicted its online and offline
sales. They looked at consumer behaviour, trends, and seasonal purchasing cycles. Once
the company put this data together, creating a `control,' Sprint increased its investment
into paid search by a set amount over its usual budget.
The mobile network let it run for eight weeks and then compared the actual sales with
their predicted sales.

The solution

Sprint found that not only did online sales increase, so did retail sales. Compared to
predictions, Sprint saw a 20% increase in digital sales and a 32% increase in in-store sales.
What this highlighted for the company was not that digital marketing should take precedence
over traditional marketing, but that Sprint needed to ensure a consistent omnichannel
approach. To quote Rob Roy (Sprint Chief Digital Officer) and Wouter Blok (Sprint Vice
President of Digital Marketing): "Are you actually limiting the power of a digital campaign
if you build it with the assumption that it will only affect online sales or underestimating
the impact it has on in-store sales?"

The results

Following the experiment, Sprint increased its digital experimentation budget by 20%, with
the aim of reaching new customers and collecting data to drive their business strategy of
signing up new subscribers. The company also focused on consistency across the brand,
so that customers who saw a campaign online would be able to walk into a store and
access the exact same offer.

                                                                                                                      (Source: Roy and Blok, 2017)

   1.10 THE BIGGER PICTURE

     Digital marketing in the past has felt like a shiny, new toy that few people knew how to use
     properly. It is important to understand that at the heart of all of your marketing activities -
     whether on-line or offline - is the customer and their experience of your product or service.
     No amount of fancy digital marketing will make a poor experience feel better. It is, therefore,
     important to approach your marketing strategy holistically. Do not forget about the fundamentals
     of marketing - these have not changed; it is simply the delivery that has changed. Data-driven
     decisions have the power to change your business and to ensure that your customer is satisfied
     and talking about your product or service. Used properly, digital marketing is a powerful tool
     that you can leverage to promote, persuade, set pricing, manage services, and sell.

   1.11 SUMMARY

     Marketing is the creation and satisfaction of demand for your product, service, or ideas. If
     marketing is successful, it will create demand; this demand should translate into sales and,
     ultimately, revenue. Digital marketing offers an opportunity to tailor marketing campaigns to
     target specific customers. It also allows for more scope in terms of branding and public relations
     through content marketing. Digital marketing is a two-way communication between the brand
     and the customer, providing the business with valuable data that it can use to inform better
     product and service design.
     The affordances of digital go beyond traditional modes of advertising and marketing. As well
     as information, digital marketing affords community, connection, feedback, and convenience.
     This makes digital marketing a powerful tool, if used properly.

     1. Why is it important to consider the business context when planning your marketing strategy?
     2. How has the internet affected marketing and the models we use to understand it?
     3. Do you agree with the idea that customers are more empowered than they were before digital

          communications were so prevalent? Justify your answer.

    2.1 INTRODUCTION

    Although marketing is a business function, it is primarily an exercise in applied human psychology.
    The role of marketing is to address customer needs and provide value. In either case, success
    requires a nuanced understanding of how people think, process, and choose within their
    environment.

    To achieve this, one must strike a balance between awareness of global shifts and how these
    impact people's behaviour and the fiercely intimate motivations that determine how and where
    individuals spend their time and money. This chapter outlines an approach for understanding
    customer behaviour, and introduces some conceptual tools used to frame and focus how you
    apply that understanding to your marketing efforts.

    2.3 UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR

    The study of consumer behaviour draws on many different disciplines, from psychology and
    economics to anthropology, sociology, and marketing. Understanding why people make the
    decisions they do forms part of a complex ongoing investigation.

22
                                       Importance of the customer 

Marketing and product design efforts increasingly focus on a customer-centric view. Rather
than simply making people want stuff, successful organisations are focused on making stuff
people want. Given the plethora of options, product or service attributes, pricing options, and
payment choices available to the connected consumer today, competition is fierce. Only the
most highly considered brands will succeed. To achieve this, brands need to offer customers
value, and this relies on understanding consumer behaviour.

No point of engagement with your brand occurs in isolation for your customer. Their life events,
social pressures, and motivations impact their experience with your brand. Something happened
before and after they bought the product, and their experience with it does not start or end at the
point of sale. It starts well before they purchase and continues long after the sale is completed.

For example, think about a specific type of cereal. A customer stands in front of the shelves
at the supermarket to choose a box of cereal. Purchasing decisions start before the customer
even steps foot into a store.

Before the purchase, the customer relies on a host of preconceived ideas and personal
preferences and goals to make their decision, for example:

· Nostalgia: "I ate this cereal as a child."
· Brand loyalty: "My family has always eaten this brand."
· Visibility or interest: "I've heard about this cereal on social media."
· Goals: "I need to increase my fibre intake."
· Budget: "What can I afford?"
· Value: "Can I get a deal?" (For example, 150 g free or a hidden toy)
· Appeal and personal preference: "I don't like the flavour of bananas."

After the purchase, they will experience the product until it is finished. At this point, as they say,
`the proof of the pudding is in the tasting.' The customer will either re-purchase the product
based on a positive or neutral experience, or they will not re-purchase the product based on
a negative or neutral experience. Consider Figure 2.1 below.

                                   Likelihood that customer will purchase again, or stay loyal to the brand

          PLANNING

   2.4 KEY DIGITAL CONCEPTS INFLUENCING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR

      The pervasiveness of digital has changed the way that customers make purchasing decisions.
      For one thing, information is constantly at their fingertips and available to them. Whereas
      customers would perhaps see a new product in a magazine ad or hear about it on the radio,
      they are now bombarded with targeted ads, banner ads, and more, whenever they open their
      browsers or inboxes. Whereas `word of mouth' used to refer to a person's friends, family, or
      neighbours, it may now refer to the people they follow on social media -- and they may not
      even know these people personally.

      This is, however, not to say that the customer is a passive recipient of this information and
      content. Digital tools, such as the internet and social media, enable customers in a way that
      they have not previously been empowered. They can research more widely, they have access
      to products and services that may not be available locally; and they have more recourse if the
      experience is not a positive one.

      Marketers now have more power, too. By analysing customer data, they can improve customers'
      experiences and increase engagement rates and conversions. Access to this data is perhaps
      one of the most integral uses of digital to connect with customers and create more brand
      awareness and loyalty.

      There are three main concepts that you should understand when considering customer
      behaviour:

      1. The impact of digital, or digital disruption
      2. Global citizenship and the idea of global `tribe'
      3. The attention economy.

    2.4.1 The impact of digital

      Digital disruption, which is discussed throughout this book, can appear in many small and large
      ways. If there's one thing the past 20 years have taught us, it's that there is constant disruption
      and upheaval in the digital world. How we communicate with one another, how we shop, how
      we consume entertainment, and how we see ourselves in the world, has all changed because
      of digital. And these changes are accelerating.

      One of the results of digital tools and media is a destabilising of the status quo. All industries
      are vulnerable to change when a product or service comes along that meets user needs in
      an unprecedented way. Netflix has disrupted the media industry, airbnb has changed travel,
      and Uber has dramatically impacted what individuals can expect from transport options. At
      the core of their offerings is personalisation. Customers want to be treated as individuals, not
      as users, accounts, or prospects. Personalisation is a chance to use behaviour as the most
      important clue about what people want and more importantly, what they need (Godin, 2014).

             Figure 2.2 Netflix, Uber, and airbnb fundamentally changed the way that
          consumers watch television, travel short distances, and find accommodation

All three of these tools use customer data in some way to offer, improve, or price their services.
Consider how Netflix recommends particular shows or movies based on previous viewing
history. The catalogue is too vast for people to be able to find what they will enjoy without
assistance. Therefore, an algorithm has been developed to push relevant content to the fore,
making it easier to access; ultimately, the user experience is less frustrating and disappointing.
Uber uses data to either reduce or increase ride prices based on demand in a particular area,
and at a certain time.

Take into account that people born after 1985, more than half the world's population, have no
idea what a world without the internet is like. They only know a rapid pace of advancement
and some tools that serve them better than others.

The internet seeks no middlemen. Established industries or organisations can be bypassed
completely when people are in control. Your customers can find another option with one click,
and are increasingly impatient. They are not concerned with the complexity of technical aspects
of how the site functions; they are simply interested in the fact that it does. People will use
the service that best serves them, not what best serves an industry or existing regulations.

2.4.2 The global citizens and their tribe

Coupled with these empowered digital consumers, who are changing digital and driving
disruption as much as digital is changing them, is the contradiction evident in the relationship
between a global citizen and increasingly fragmented and differentiated tribes built around
interests. National identity, given global migration and connectivity, has shifted as the world
becomes smaller. The internet has created space for people to create, form, support, and evolve
their own niche communities. This duality forces marketers to keep cognisant of international
shifts while tracking and focusing on niche communities and specific segments within their
market. It is important to remember that tribes are fickle and nomadic; you need to feed their
passions and beliefs.

          parenting/familial relations can impact people into adulthood).

    2.4.3 The attention economy

                             Attention is a resource -- a person only has so much of it.

                                                                                                                                                   (Matthew Crawford)

      The attention economy describes attention as a scarce resource, and considers the ways
      that it can be captured and retained long enough for information to be absorbed, or for a
      customer to make a purchasing decision. Media forms and the mediums through which they
      can be consumed have exploded over the last decade, and it's increasingly difficult to get the
      attention of those you are trying to reach. Your customer is distracted and has many different
      things competing for their attention.
      If a customer is not interested, they will quickly disengage. Likewise, if they feel that something
      is not relevant to them, they will turn their attention to something else.

   2.5 TOOLS FOR UNDERSTANDING YOUR CUSTOMER

      Despite the complexity of the customer landscape, various tools and frameworks are available
      to consider your customer. The goal with many of these is to inform your decision making and
      help you think from the perspective of your customer.

2.5.1 Developing user personas

To understand all your customers, you must have an idea of who they are. While it's impossible
to know everyone who engages with your brand, you can develop representative personas
that help you focus on motivations rather than on stereotypes.

A user persona is a description of a brand-specific cluster of users who exhibit similar behavioural
patterns in, for example, their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer
service preferences, and lifestyle choices. We will revisit the user persona at multiple points
during this course, as it shouldn't be seen as an end in itself.

A user persona is a consensus-driving tool and a catalyst that can be applied when you try to
understand your entire customer experience, or when you decide on the implementation of
specific tactics. Every organisation should have four to five user personas to help strategists
target their efforts.

To create a user persona and inform decisions with your customers' point of view, one must
prioritise real information over your team's assumptions and gut feelings.

alternatives to offline primary research.

A combination of habits and specific needs are combined into a usable overall picture. A key
feature of the user persona below is how it accounts for customer motivation. Summer is
driven by emotion, rich storytelling, and social belonging. This knowledge should drive how
the brand communicates with her and how her brand experience is tailored to make her feel
like part of a community.

PLANNING

To build a robust user persona, you should consider the demographics, psychographics, and
motivators for your customers.

Demographics and psychographics

Understanding customers can involve two facets:

1. Understanding the physical facts, context, and income of their `outer world', i.e., their
    demographics. These include their culture, subcultures, class, and the class structures in
    which they operate, among other factors.

2. Understanding the motives, desires, fears, and other intangible characteristics of their `inner
    world,' i.e., their psychographics. Here we can consider their motives, how they learn, and
    their attitudes.

Both facets above are important, though some factors may be more or less prominent depending
on the product or service in question. For example, a women's clothing retailer needs to consider
gender and income, as well as feelings about fashion and trends equally, while a B2B company
typically focuses on psychographic factors as their customers are linked by a job function,
rather than shared demographics.

Demographics can be laborious to acquire but are generally objective and unambiguous data
points that change within well-understood and measurable parameters. For example, people
get older, incomes increase or decrease, people get married or have children. Data sources
like censuses, surveys, customer registration forms, and social media accounts are just a few
places where demographic data can be gathered, either in aggregate or individually.

Psychographics, however, are fluid, complex, and deeply personal because, after all, they
relate to the human mind. On top of that, there are other elements to consider: those `human
traits,' habits and thought processes that apply to all of us, but play out in unique ways. This
information is very hard to define, but when complementary fields work together, it's possible
for marketers to uncover a goldmine of insight.

2.5.2 Understanding motivation

People make hundreds of decisions every day and are rarely aware of all of the factors that
they subconsciously consider in this process. That's because these factors are a complex
web of personal motivating factors that can be intrinsic or extrinsic and positive or negative.

                                                                    Positive

                     I'll get a reward      to feel good

                     If I don't do this,  I need to do this
                     I'll face a penalty   or I'll feel bad

                                                                           Negative

Extrinsic motivators

Extrinsic factors are external, often tangible, pressures, rewards, threats, or incentives that
motivate us to take action even if we don't necessarily want to. For example, a worker in a
boring or stressful job may be motivated to keep going by their pay check, and drivers are
motivated to obey traffic rules by the threat of getting a fine or hurting someone.
Marketing often uses extrinsic motivators to provide a tangible reward for taking a desired
action. Some examples include:
· Limited-time specials and discounts: The customer is motivated by a perceived cost

    saving and the urgency of acting before the offer is revoked.
· Scarcity: The limited availability of a product or service is used to encourage immediate

    action.
· Loyalty programmes: They typically offer extrinsic rewards like coupons, exclusive access,

    or free gifts in exchange for people performing desired behaviours.
· Ancillary benefits: They can include things such as free parking at the shopping centre if

    you spend over a certain amount at a specific store.
· Free content or downloads: They can be obtained in exchange for contact details, often

    used for subsequent marketing activities.
Booking.com, for example, uses a range of extrinsic motivators to encourage customers to
book quickly, including a price discount exclusive to their site and urgency through the use of
the words "High demand", "Only three rooms left" and, "There are two other people looking
at this hotel". All of these factors nudge the customer to book quickly to avoid missing out on
what is framed as a limited-time opportunity.

                Figure 2.6 A screenshot of Booking.com using extrinsic motivators

                                                                                                                                    29
          PLANNING

      The problem with extrinsic motivation is that a customer can often perform the desired action
      to get the reward or avoid the threat without fully internalising the meaning or marketing
      message behind the gesture. Or worse, the required action becomes `work,' diminishing the
      enjoyment of the task and the reward.

      Some people will, for example, swipe in at the gym with their membership card to avoid
      losing their access, but won't actually exercise. Some might log in to a website every day to
      accumulate points without actually looking at the specials on offer.

      Kohn (1987) summarised the three risks of extrinsic rewards:

      1. "First, rewards encourage people to focus narrowly on a task, to do it as quickly as possible
          and to take few risks.

      2. Second, people come to see themselves as being controlled by the reward. They feel less
          autonomous, and this may interfere with performance.

      3. Finally, extrinsic rewards can erode intrinsic interest. People who see themselves as working
          for money, approval or competitive success find their tasks less pleasurable, and therefore
          do not do them as well."

    Intrinsic motivators

      Somebody who is intrinsically motivated performs an action for an intangible benefit simply
      because they want to, or for the pleasure, fun, or happiness of it. Intrinsic motivators are much
      subtler and more difficult to quantify, but are also more powerful and longer-lasting drivers
      of human behaviour.

      Some common forms of intrinsic motivation include:

      · Love: This includes not just romantic love, but also the love of an activity or outcome.
      · Enjoyment and fun: Few intrinsic motivators are as powerful as the desire to have a good

          time.
      · Self-expression: Some people act in a certain way because of what they feel the action

          says about them.
      · Personal values: Values instilled through cultural, religious, social, or other means can be

          powerful motivators.
      · Achievement or competence: When people challenge themselves, take a meaningful

          personal risk, or attain a long-desired goal, they are acting because of an intrinsic motivation.
      · Negative intrinsic motivators: Fear, embarrassment, and inertia are some powerful drivers

          that rely on negative emotions.

      The following ad (Figure 2.7) combines multiple intrinsic motivators to drive home a message.
      It appeals to pet owners' love and sense of responsibility for their pets, as well as testing their
      competence as a `good' pet owner. It also touches on negative motivators: fear for the pets'
      health and a sense of shame if they are not feeding their pets an appropriate diet.

Figure 2.7 This advert for a brand of dog food, reads "Stop treating your dog like a trashcan"

2.6 Finding the right motivators

Many brands develop elaborate marketing campaigns with gimmicks and rewards, but find that
these fail. This is often because of a misunderstanding of the motivators that drive customers
to take action in the first place. Marketers tend to overvalue how much people like, understand
and care about brands, which can lead to a disconnection from the audience.
The most important factor to consider in choosing a customer motivator is relevance to the
customer, to the brand, and to the campaign. Ask yourself, "Is the incentive you are offering
truly relevant and useful?"
Most complex human actions involve a combination of factors. For example, we work because
of the external pressure to earn money, and some also get an intrinsic reward in the form of
achievement, self-expression, or making a difference in the world. Both factors are important,
and if one is missing, the other needs to compensate strongly for this; i.e. interns working
for free to get ahead quickly in their careers; people being paid more to stay in a difficult or
unfulfilling job.
The success of your customer persona will depend on how carefully you interrogate assumptions
about your customer, how carefully you draw on research, and how you prioritise understanding
their motivations and the way decisions are made.

                                                                                                                                    31
          PLANNING

    2.6.1 Knowing your customer

      One tool to understand your customer is to examine a day in the life of (DILO) the customer.
      DILO is a useful marketing tool, because it can help you uncover certain motivations, triggers,
      stress points, and opportunities.

      Consider a brand that is aimed at lower income families. Once you analyse this customer's
      DILO, you would realise that:

      · You would need a mobile app or at least a mobile-friendly website, because the majority
          of lower income families do not have access to a PC or laptop

      · Your app or website would need to have very low data demands
      · Your campaigns would be aimed during the early mornings or early evenings, when people

          are likely to be commuting and, therefore, on their mobile devices
      · Your campaigns would need to be very clear on pricing and value.
      Can you recognise how, by understanding the customer's day, you can make better marketing
      decisions? Knowing your customer puts your product or service in their line of sight and allows
      you to save money and resources, while also maximising impact.

    2.6.2 Decision making and behavioural economics

      One significant shift in understanding customers over the past few years has come from the
      fields of psychology and economics. This area of inquiry, behavioural economics, looks at what
      assumptions or behaviours drive decision making. An understanding of individual motivations
      and interactions between customers and your brand can help you cater to what your market
      really wants or needs.

      As an example, industrial designer Yogita Agrawal designed an innovative and much-needed
      human-powered light for people in rural India. Although the product ingeniously took advantage
      of the locals' mobile lifestyle - the battery is charged through the action of walking - and the
      idea was well received, initially no one actually used the product. Agrawal eventually discovered
      the simple reason for this: the device had a plain, ugly casing that did not match with the vibrant
      and colourful local dress at all. When she added a colourful and personalisable covering to
      the device, usage shot up dramatically. Although she had found the big insight, that walking
      can generate energy to power lights in areas not served by the electrical grid, it took a further
      understanding of regional preferences to truly make the device appealing.

      If marketers can apply this insight to their strategies and campaigns, it means that they may
      be able to get more customers to take desired actions more often, for less cost and effort. This
      is the ideal scenario for any business.

    Biases

     Cognitive biases
      Cognitive biases are our own personal prejudices and preferences, as well as common ways of
      thinking that are inherently flawed. A classic example is confirmation bias, where we take note of
3 2 information that confirms our beliefs or worldview, but discount or ignore information that doesn't.

on the road. Does it begin to seem like there are more red cars than usual?

                                 outcomes.

                                 threats.

                                 a task.

Pricing biases
There is also a lot of bias around the price of an item. Generally, we perceive more expensive
to be better, and we can actually derive more psychological pleasure from them, even if the
cheaper alternative is objectively just as good.

A classic example of this is wine-tasting, where in repeated experiments participants agree that
the more expensive wine tastes better where, in fact, all the wines were identical. Taken even
further, researchers discovered that people tasting the more expensive wines actually had a

                                                                                                    33
          PLANNING

      heightened pleasure response in their brains, showing that researchers could generate more
      enjoyment simply by telling participants they were drinking an expensive wine (Ward, 2015).

     Loss aversion
      One of the most powerful psychological effects is the feeling of loss, when something we
      possess is diminished or taken away. The negative feeling associated with loss is far stronger
      than the positive feeling of gaining the equivalent thing. In other words, we feel the pain of
      losing R500 more acutely than the joy of gaining R500.

      Marketers can use loss aversion very effectively in the way they frame and execute marketing
      campaigns. Here is an example: Consider giving a customer a free trial version of a service
      for a long period. This then becomes so useful and important to them that they would rather
      pay to avoid losing it. On-demand TV service Netflix, uses this to great effect with its 30-day
      free trial, especially since they ask for credit card details upfront so that shifting over to the
      paid version is seamless.

     Heuristics
      A heuristic is essentially a decision-making shortcut or mental model that helps us to make
      sense of a difficult decision-making process, or to estimate an answer to a complex problem.

      Some classic examples include:

      · The availability heuristic: We overemphasise the likelihood or frequency of things that
          have occurred recently because they come to mind more easily.

      · The representativeness heuristic: We consider a sample to represent the whole for
          example, in cultural stereotypes.

      · The price-quality heuristic: We consider more expensive things to be better quality. A
          higher price leads to a higher expectation, so this can work both to the advantage and
          disadvantage of marketers. For products where quality is measurable and linear, the price
          needs to correlate, and a higher price needs to be justified tangibly. For products or services
          where quality is less tangible or more subjective, such as food, drinks, experiences and
          education, in many ways the price can heighten the perceived quality and experience even
          on a neurological level.

      · Anchoring and adjustment heuristic: We make decisions based on relative and recent
          information rather than broad, objective fact. In marketing, this can be used to steer customers
          to the package or offer that the brand most wants them to take.

    Choice

      Choice in its simplest form, is the ability to make a decision when you have two or more pos-
      sibilities. How do people choose? This is a difficult question to answer because people decide
      based on irrational, personal factors and motivators, objective needs, and their immediate
      circumstances.

Word of mouth or peer suggestions
We are very susceptible to the opinions of other people and tend to trust the opinions of
friends, family, trusted experts, and `people like us' over companies or brands. We are also
much more likely to join in on an activity like buying a specific product if we see others like us
doing it first. This is the notion of social proof. Human beings generally rely on early adopters
to lead the way, with the vast majority waiting for a new product or service to be tested before
jumping on board.

This is why many brands use spokespeople or testimonials. They act as a reassurance to the
potential customer that other normal people actually experience the benefits that are promised.
This also highlights the importance of positive online word of mouth. The Zero Moment of Truth
(ZMOT) is the moment that occurs after the customer has been exposed to your brand, but
before a purchase is made. People do extensive research online before important purchases
and can have their minds swayed by the reviews, experiences, and opinions of others who
are often strangers.

Consider the rise of #BookTok, a subcommunity on the social media platform TikTok, which
focuses on book reviews and recommendations. Globally, publishers are seeing tangible
results and an uptick in sales directly related to #BookTok. Interestingly, backlist titles (in other
words, books that are not new releases) are also seeing a rise in sales directly influenced
by `BookTokkers.' This is partly due to how quickly and easily accessible these reviews are.
However, there is also a level of trust in the reviews, particularly if the review comes from one
of the more popular accounts.

Personal preferences and history
Some of our decisions are based on very personal factors, such as a favourite colour, a positive
past experience, or a historical or familial association. For example, some people may choose
to buy the same brand of breakfast cereal that they remember eating as a child, regardless
of the price or nutritional benefits. For them, the total experience and good feelings form part
of the overall value they derive. This is why many brands place emphasis on their long and
prestigious histories.

Habits
Habits form when we buy the same thing because we've always bought it, and it's simply the
easiest option.

Habits are typically triggered by an outside or environmental factor (the cue), which then causes
us to act out our habit (the action), after which we receive a positive boost (the reward). This
sequence is referred to as the habit loop.

In marketing, the goal is to get a customer to form a habit loop around purchasing or using the
brand's offering. For example, many snack brands try to associate the environmental cues of

                                                                                                                                    35
PLANNING

hunger or boredom with their products, such as KitKat's "Have a break" or SNICKERS' "You're
not you when you're hungry" campaigns.

Loyalty programmes can play a key role in helping customers solidify a habit. For example,
given the choice of two similar coffee shops on the morning commute to work, a person may
be more inclined to visit the one offering a free coffee once they've collected a card full of
stamps (even if that means going out of their way or paying a bit more for what is essentially
a small discount). Eventually, the routine becomes set and it becomes easier to stick to the
safe, familiar option.

Below are some examples from brands that encourage habit formation.

Table 2.3 How brands capitalise on habits

Brand      Cue                  Routine             Reward

How do habits form? To create a habit, you need to perform a repeated action many times
in a row. The harder the action, such as going for a jog each morning, the longer and more
consistently you need to practice the behaviour. Once the habit sets, it becomes a mental
`shortcut' that will take conscious effort to override in future.

     Decision load

      Making decisions is difficult, even if the decision is a low-stakes, low-impact one. Generally,
      psychologists agree that we have a certain quota of decisions that we can make every day,
      after which subsequent decisions become harder and more taxing, and often result in poorer
      outcomes called `decision fatigue.' This is why leading thinkers try to cut out as many trivial
      decisions as possible. Steve Jobs of Apple famously wore the same blue-jeans-and-black-
      turtleneck outfit every day to save himself making that one extra decision every morning.

      This is also why we tend to subconsciously eliminate unnecessary decisions and stick to
      reliable, tested habits. This is especially true for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)
      sector. Consider your habits when buying toothpaste. Typically, you will purchase the same
      brand you always do without really thinking about it. Unless you had a terrible experience with
      the product, one toothpaste seems as good as the other and there's no incentive to switch.
      You certainly won't pause for five minutes in front of the shelf each time to carefully study each
      option before making your decision. It doesn't matter enough to get the best one.

                                                                                                 Importance of the customer 

Now imagine that your usual brand is out of stock. Suddenly, instead of relying on the existing
habit, you are forced to make the decision from scratch at which point marketing factors and
price can play an important role. However, crucially, it is the experience that the new product
delivers that will be the deciding factor. If the new toothpaste is similar or inferior to the usual
brand, there's no incentive to change the buying habit.

Defaults
Providing a `default option' can be a powerful decision-making shortcut, because it removes
the need to make an active decision. Defaults work for a number of reasons.

· They offer a path of least resistance: The default setting is perceived to be the one that is
    good enough for most people, and requires the least amount of thought and customisation.
    This is ideal for reducing effort.

· They serve as a social signal: The default is seen as the socially approved option, as the
    presumption is that the majority will choose this, and there is safety in aligning with the majority.

· They offer assurance: Similarly, we also presume that the default choice has been selected
    by an expert because of its merit to the end user.

· They take advantage of loss aversion: When it comes to sales and marketing, effective
    default packages typically include more products or services that are strictly needed to
    increase the value and therefore the price. This is done simply because opting for a more
    basic version involves the customer taking elements away, and therefore suffering a loss.
    Once the default price has been anchored in the customer's mind, there is less incentive
    to remove unwanted elements, even if the price gets reduced. For example, when buying
    a new laptop, the customer may be offered a package deal that includes antivirus software,
    a laptop bag, a wireless mouse, and other related accessories.

Choice architecture

You can simplify your customers' decision-making processes by cleverly designing the choices
you offer. This is called choice architecture.

While the following are guidelines only, they should be tested thoroughly based on your own
individual context, brand, and customers. Generally speaking, a good choice architecture has
the following characteristics:

· A small number of choices: Usually not more than five choices are offered, though ideally
    three. The smaller the number of options to choose from, the easier it is for the customer
    to distinguish the differences between the options and to avoid a feeling of missing out.

· A recommended or default option: Because people consider expert advice and social
    preferences when choosing, highlighting one option as `the most popular choice' or `our
    top-selling package' can direct people to the option you most want them to take.

· A visual design hierarchy: Typically use colour and size. To make your preferred option
    stand out, one easy trick is to make it bigger and brighter than the options around it.

                                                                                                                                    37

    guide you around who your customer groups            Customer experience mapping is a

    has (or could have) with your company and

    brand. These interactions are commonly referred to as `touchpoints' (Kramp 2011).

    You can use it as a tool to map your entire customer experience or to drill down into detail for
    particular parts of that experience. Examples include in-store purchasing or someone trying
    to buy something on your website.

    The customer experience map should detail how customers are feeling at various points in
    their interaction with you and also highlight any pain points that they may be experiencing.
    Identifying these problems or dips in their experience presents opportunities for engagement
    and also helps to explain your customer behaviour in context.

Customer experience maps should vary from business to business, so one shouldn't just
follow a blueprint. Evaluate the customer journey from consideration through to purchase
and hopefully, loyalty. The experience map looks at the progression from consideration
through to post purchase in great detail and visually synthesises your customer's behaviour
and motivations at every point of contact with your brand. Look at the example above, which
includes some key sections:

· Phase: Where is your customer in their interaction with your brand?
· Doing, thinking, feeling: How does what they are feeling and doing vary from stage to stage?
· Channels: What channels or contact points are involved in facilitating this stage of their

    journey?

· Opportunities: What opportunities exist to solve pain points for your brand?

There are five basic steps to data collection.

1. Establish the goal: Decide what data you are collecting and why you are doing it.
2. Impose a timeframe: Data collection should have a set timeframe.
3. Pick a data collection method: Choose how you will collect data based on your goals

    and set timeframe.
4. Collect the data: You can do this via surveys, online tracking, transactional data tracking,

    online marketing analysis, and collecting subscription data.
5. Analyse and learn from the data collected: This is the most crucial part of this exercise.

    There is no use collecting data if you are not going to use it.

2.8 CASE STUDY: CHECKERS SIXTY60

Checkers is a FMCG retailer founded in 1956.

One-line summary

As part of their `strategy to grow and monetise its ecosystem
of value for customers,' South African grocery retailer,
Checkers, followed global trends towards on-demand,
`quick commerce' grocery delivery services, and are now
local market leaders with over 1.5 million app downloads.

The problem

Checkers, a major grocery retailer in South Africa, observed a global trend towards
on-demand grocery services. Other grocery retailers, such as Woolworths Food and
Pick n Pay, were offering grocery delivery but customers had to pre-book delivery slots
with turnaround times of more than 12 to 24 hours, and the ordering mechanisms were
clunky and inefficient.

The solution

Checkers went in a completely different direction, choosing to focus on a more convenient
ordering and delivery process for the customer.

                            Figure 2.11 Ordering and delivery made easy
1. They launched a simple and easy-to-use app-based service called Checkers Sixty60.
2. They reinforced their market position as a quality, high-value, affordable grocer.
3. They localised ordering and delivery. Customers share their location so that the app

    can find the closest store to them. This means that customers' orders can be delivered
    faster due to proximity.
4. They employed their own delivery personnel (rather than relying on a logistics company),
    most of whom use branded motorcycles and can therefore move around towns and
    cities more easily.

                                                                                                                                 41
          PLANNING

         5. They limited the number of items allowed to 30, which means that turnaround/delivery
              times can be within 60 minutes and that people order more often.

      The results

         Launched months before lockdown was enforced in South Africa due to the COVID-19
         pandemic, Checkers Sixty60 has the lead on other retailers who launched later (for
         example, Woolies Dash and Pick n Pay Asap!). The service was very popular during 2020
         but has continued to grow even as lockdown restrictions were lifted. This is as a result
         of the value that customers derive from the service, as well as the positive experiences
         before, during, and after ordering, live shopping (where customers can make replacement
         decisions in the app if a product is unavailable), and delivery (where customers can track
         the driver to their door).

                               Figure 2.12 Exponential growth of Sixty60 over a year

         offering a recycling service. The driver will collect the brown bags from a previous delivery
         when delivering the latest order.

2.10 THE BIGGER PICTURE

Customers are autonomous beings, who make decisions every day - what to wear, what to eat,
how to travel to work, what to use on their bodies, faces, and hair, what to feed their children
and pets, the list goes on and on. In a maelstrom of information, you need to make your product
and service stand out. This requires knowing your customer intimately, and you can only learn
about your customers by taking the time to get to know them. With this knowledge, you can
recommend a product to fit their needs or desires; or you can craft a product or service to fit
into their lifestyles; or, even more ambitiously, you can tell them and show them what they
never knew they wanted. Always put your customer front and centre. Do not get so bogged
down by your own concepts and preconceived ideas that you forget that they are the people
you are targeting and creating content and products for.

2.11 SUMMARY

People have come to depend on and shape the digital channels that enable connection,
individual interest, and the disruption of industries. Your consumers are connected, impatient,
fickle, and driven by a number of motivations and contextual realities. Only through targeting
and understanding specifically can you reach them and ensure the success of your brand.

Some tools can help you paint a picture of your customers and their experience of your brand
by depicting complex motivations, both external and internal. These tools enable real customer
data and research, that consider the complex and sometimes irrational influences on how people
make decisions. Customer personas, customer experience maps, and the field of behavioural
economics can all help to shape your thinking and drive your approach.

    3.1 INTRODUCTION

    The internet is built for research. Whether it's a consumer shopping around for prices, a
    researcher exploring a topic, or a fan looking up their favourite band, the internet provides
    new ways for gathering and analysing data.

    Customers are able to research companies and products easily, gathering information to
    compare prices and services with a few clicks. Customers can also share likes and dislikes
    easily, with both companies and friends.

    As a result, brands can study who their customers are, what they are interested in, how they feel
    about the brand, and the best times and places to engage with them. Insights can be gathered
    from ongoing market research, making it possible to course correct and apply data-driven
    decision making. This chapter will focus on tools and methodologies for gathering useful data.

3.3 THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKET RESEARCH

The modern world can feel unpredictable. It is increasingly difficult to keep up with trends,
customer needs, popular opinions, and competitors. So, how can you keep your brand and
products relevant to ensure you are meeting your customers' needs?

The answer is to conduct market research. Market research helps you make informed business
decisions. It involves systematically gathering, recording, and analysing data about customers,
competitors, and the market, and turning this data into insight that can drive marketing strategies,
product design and positioning, and communications strategies.

Online market research is the process of using digital tools, data, and connections to glean
valuable insights about a brand's target audience. In other words, it's the process of learning
about your audience by engaging and observing them online. Technology plays a key role in
gathering data and connecting with research participants, and can make the whole process
quicker and easier to manage than traditional offline research methods.

Traditional and online market research have the same goals and underlying principles, but online
market research has the benefit of using digital technology, which provides a range of benefits:

· The internet is always on, meaning that data is readily available at any time.
· Many of the processes for finding, gathering, and storing data can be automated. For

    example, you can get an automatic email alert if someone mentions your brand, or you
    can set up self-administered digital surveys.

                                                                                                                                    47

    being automatically collected, such as web
    analytics and social media data. All you need
    to do is access it.

    People are often happy to share their own research, insights, and methodologies online, so
    you can access this trove of resources to inform your own research.

    Online market research can be much more cost effective and quicker to set up than traditional
    research techniques.

    There are many reasons why you should conduct regular market research, such as:

    · Gain insights into your consumers, including:
        · what customers want and need from your brand
        · what customers like and dislike about the brand
        · why customers buy the brand's products or services
        · why potential customers might choose your brand over another
        · why customers do or do not make repeat purchases

    · Understand the changes in your industry and business
    · Discover new market trends on which you can capitalise
    · Find new potential sales avenues, customers, products, and more
    · Identify and engage new audiences
    · Allow customers to help steer your business.

    If you are able to understand your customers and the greater business context, you will be able

    to market more effectively, meet their needs better, and drive more positive sentiment around

    your brand. All of this adds up to happier customers and, ultimately, a healthier bottom line.

    3.4 DESIGN THINKING

    Design thinking is a process that can be used by marketers to understand their users. By
    applying design thinking, they understand, define, and redefine assumptions and problems
    and create solutions for the market. The most important characteristic of design thinking is
    that it is non-linear and iterative.

    Because this process forces marketers to understand their users' needs (and, in fact, broader
    needs), it results in ideas that can be prototyped and tested. This keeps the marketers close
    to the users and results in products and services that actually meet people's needs -- not just
    what companies think people need.

The five stages of design thinking are: empathise, define, ideate, prototype, test.
Notice that there is emphasis on prototyping and testing, as well as empathising. This is
important because it is what makes design thinking so useful. Instead of working apart from
customers and putting a product or service in the market that falls short, this process allows
for more granular market research and iterative design.

3.5 KEY CONCEPTS IN MARKET RESEARCH

While the research field can be full of complex terminology, there are four key concepts to
understand before conducting your own research:
1. Research methodology
2. Qualitative and quantitative data
3. Primary and secondary research
4. Sampling.

                                                                                                                                    49
          PLANNING

      Let's consider each of these in turn.

    3.5.1 Research methodology

      Research methodology refers to the process implemented to conduct accurate and valuable
      analysis. The research process should involve the following steps:

                                                            Step 1

                                                             Establish the goals of the project

                                                            Step 2

                                                                   Determine your sample

                                                            Step 3

                                                             Choose a data collection method

                                                            Step 4

                                                                         Collect data

                                                            Step 5

                                                                     Analyse the results

                                                            Step 6

                                        Formulate conclusions and actionable insights (e.g., producing reports)

                            Figure 3.3 The steps in the research methodology process
      Most often, market research focuses on specific issues unique to a business or brand. It is
      therefore not always possible to freely obtain comparable information to aid decision making.
      This is why it can be useful to start from a distinct research problem or hypothesis when
      kicking off such a project. Your question should guide your entire process, and will determine
      your choice of data collection method.
      Another approach involves ongoing data collection. Unbiased decision making is far more
      accurately driven when aided by market insight. Many have argued that less expensive, ongoing
      data collection is increasingly a route proven to be useful to organisations.

    3.5.2 Primary and secondary research

      Research can be based on primary data or secondary data. Primary research is conducted
      when new data is gathered for a particular product or hypothesis. This is where information
      does not exist already or is not accessible, and therefore needs to be specifically collected from
      consumers or businesses. Surveys, focus groups, research panels, and research communities
      can all be used when conducting primary market research.
50
                                                     Market research

Secondary research uses existing, published data as a source of information. It can be more
cost-effective than conducting primary research. The internet opens up a wealth of resources
for conducting this research. The data could have originally been collected for solving problems
other than the one at hand, so they may not be sufficiently specific. Secondary research can
be useful for identifying problems to be investigated through primary research.

The internet is a useful tool when conducting both primary and secondary research. Not only
are there a number of free tools available when it comes to calculating things such as sample
size and confidence levels (see section 3.8 Tools of the trade for some examples), but it is
also an ideal medium to reach large numbers of people at a relatively low cost.

The internet and secondary research

Research based on secondary data should precede primary data research. It can be used in
establishing the context and parameters for primary research. The data can provide enough
information to solve the problem at hand, thereby negating the need for further investigation.

Secondary data can provide sources for hypotheses that can be explored through primary
research. Sifting through secondary data is a necessary precursor for primary research, as it
can provide information relevant to sample sizes and audience, for example. The data can be
used as a reference base to measure the accuracy of primary research.

Companies with online properties have access to an abundance of web analytics data that
are recorded digitally. These data can then be mined for insights. It's worth remembering,
though, that it's usually impossible to access the web analytics data of competitors so this
method will only provide information about your own customers.

Customer communications are also a source of

data that can be used, particularly communi-   NOTE  Consumer sentiment can be defined as

consumers discuss their likes and dislikes.          impact their shopping habits have.

Customers can be particularly vocal about

companies and products. This data can, and should, be tracked and monitored to establish

consumer sentiment. If a community is established for research purposes, the resulting feedback

is considered primary data, but using social media to research existing sentiments is considered

secondary research. The internet is an ideal starting point for conducting secondary research

based on published data and with so much information out there, it can be a daunting task

to find reliable resources.

                                                                                                  51

    The first point of call for online research is usually a search engine, such as google.com or
    yahoo.com. Search engines have an array of advanced features, which can aid online research.
    For example, Google offers:

    · Advanced search: google.co.za/advanced_search?hl=en
    · Google Scholar: scholar.google.co.za/schhp?hl=en
    · Google Book Search: google.co.za/books?hl=en
    · Google News Archive: news.google.com/newspapers

    Many research publications are available online, some for free and some at a cost. Top research
    companies now feature analyst blogs, which provide some industry data and analysis free of charge.

    Some notable resources are:

    · econsultancy.com
    · experian.com/hitwise
    · pewinternet.org (US data)
    · nielsen.com

    The internet and primary research

    Primary research involves gathering data for a specific research task. It is based on data that
    has not been gathered beforehand. Primary research can be either qualitative or quantitative.

    Primary research can be used to explore a market and can help to develop the hypotheses or
    research questions that must be answered through further research.

    Generally, qualitative data is gathered at this stage. For example, online research communities
    can be used to identify consumer needs that are not being met and to brainstorm possible
    solutions. Further quantitative research can investigate what proportion of consumers share
    these problems and which potential solutions best meet those needs.

    3.5.3 Quantitative and qualitative data

    Data can be classified as qualitative or quan-

    titative. Qualitative research is exploratory and  NOTE  With larger sample sizes, qualitative data
    seeks to find out what potential consumers               can be analysed quantitatively.

    think and feel about a given subject. Qualitative

    research aids in identifying potential hypotheses, whereas quantitative research puts hard

    numbers behind these hypotheses. Quantitative research relies on numerical data to demon-

    strate statistically significant outcomes. Quantitative data can be counted, or measured and

    can tell you how many, how much, and how often.

    The internet can be used to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In fact, the communities
    on the web can be viewed as large focus groups, regularly and willingly sharing their opinions
    about products, markets, and companies.

                                                    Market research

In robust research studies, both qualitative and quantitative research can be applied at different
stages of the study.

The main differences between quantitative and qualitative research are represented in Table
3.2 below.

Both quantitative and qualitative research can be conducted online.

Web analytics packages are a prime source of data. Using data, such as search terms, referral
URLs, and internal search data can lead to qualitative information about the consumers
visiting a website. However, when data is measurable and specific, such as impressions and
clickthrough rates, it leads to quantitative research.

3.5.4 Sampling

Qualitative research is usually conducted with a small number of respondents in order to
explore and generate ideas and concepts. Quantitative research demands far larger numbers,
enough to predict how the total population would respond.

                                                                                                                                    53
          PLANNING

      You should ensure the sample is representative of the population you are targeting as a whole.
      If your business transacts both online and offline, be aware that using only online channels
      for market research might not accurately represent your target market. However, if your business
      transacts only online, offline channels for your market research are less necessary.

      Because quantitative research aims to produce predictors for the total population, sample size
      is very important. The sample size needs to be sufficient in order to make statistically accurate
      observations about the population.

      For example, if your website has 4000 registered users you don't need to survey all of them
      in order to understand how the entire population behaves. You need to survey only 351 users
      to get a sample size that gives you a 95% confidence level with a ±5% confidence interval.
      This means that you can be 95% sure your results are accurate within ±5%.

      There are several sample size calculators mentioned in section 3.8: Tools of the trade.

   3.6 ONLINE RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES

      There are many online market research methodologies. This chapter touches on three of the
      most popular and useful ones: surveys, online focus groups, and social media monitoring.

      Which methodology should you choose?

      That depends on a variety of factors, from your research question and purpose, to your budget
      and time. Here are some general pointers:

      Surveys: Ideal for collecting large amounts of quantitative data and some qualitative data.
      They are quick and easy to set up and can run automatically.

      Online focus groups: Ideal for engaging consumers and collecting qualitative data, such as
      opinions, ideas, and feelings about the brand. They require a larger time investment and a
      willing group of participants.

      Online monitoring: Ideal for collecting qualitative data on brand sentiment, and can also
      provide some quantitative data around volume of interest in the brand. This data can be
      collected passively, and there are several tools that can automate this process.

    3.6.1 Surveys

      Surveys are questionnaires that contain a series of questions around a specific topic. Their
      purpose is to gather large volumes of quantitative data easily, though they can also collect
      some qualitative data.

      Conducting surveys online allows for data to be captured immediately, and data analysis
      can be performed easily. By using email or the internet for conducting surveys, geographical
      limitations for collecting data can be overcome cost effectively.

Technology allows you to compile sophisticated and user-friendly surveys. For example, as
opposed to indicating impressions on a sliding scale, respondents can indicate emotional
response. The survey can also be tailored depending on previous answers, such as questions
being skipped if they are not relevant to the respondent.
You can run ongoing online surveys at minimal cost. Simple polls can be used in forums and
on blogs to generate regular feedback. Website satisfaction surveys are also an easy way to
determine the effectiveness of a website or marketing campaign.
Surveys allow for instant feedback on questions or ideas from an existing community, such as
a trusted group of thought leaders, your brand's social media fans, or a pre-created research
community. Examples include Facebook polling apps and real-time mobile survey platforms.

Designing surveys

How you design a survey and its questions will directly impact your success. A survey can
include any number and type of questions. More complicated questions should appear only
once users are comfortable with the survey. Be careful that you do not introduce bias by
asking leading questions.

  Example:

Do you agree that this conference venue is a  Rate your experience of our conference venue
world-class facility?                         from 1 to 10.

In general, you will also find that you get more accurate answers when phrasing questions in
the past tense than in the continuous tense.

Example:

How many times a week do you buy take-        In the past month, how many times did you
away food?                                    buy take-away food?

Questions in the survey should be brief, easy to understand, unambiguous, and easy to answer.

    Types of survey questions

     1. Open-ended
      Open-ended questions allow respondents to answer in their own words. This usually results
      in qualitative data.

        Example:

          What features would you like to see on the website for the digital marketing textbook?

2. Closed

Closed questions give respondents specific responses from which to choose. These are typically
multiple-choice questions with either one or multiple possible answers. Broadly speaking,
closed questions can be answered with a `yes' or a `no.' Alternatively, they can be selected
from a very specific set of responses that have been provided. This results in quantitative data.

Example:

Do you use the digital       Yes  No

marketing textbook website?

3. Ranked or ordinal
These types of questions ask respondents to rank items in order of preference or relevance.
Respondents are given a numeric scale to indicate order. This results in quantitative data.
Broadly speaking, closed questions can be answered with a `yes' or a `no.' Alternatively, they
can be selected from a very specific set of responses that have been provided.

    rank behaviour or attitude.

    3.6.2 Focus groups

    Online focus groups involve respondents gathering online and reacting to a particular topic.
    Respondents can be sourced from all over the world and react in real time, arguably being
    freer with their responses since they can be anonymous in an electronic environment.

    Online focus groups are ideal for having frank, detailed conversations with people who have
    an interest in your brand. This means they result in primary qualitative data. This information
    can then be used to create quantitative research questions.

    Online focus groups can be conducted using a range of technologies. The simplest is to use
    a text-based messaging program or online forum. There are many options available. More
    sophisticated tools allow for voice or video conferencing, and can make it easier for the
    researcher to pick up clues from the respondent's voice and facial expressions. Some tools
    allow the researcher to share their desktop screen with respondents in order to illustrate a
    concept or question. Jamboard offers an interactive whiteboard feature, which can be very
    useful for brainstorming and for recording and grouping users' responses.

    Zoom also offers opportunities to separate      NOTE  Zoom's popularity soared in 2020, due
    participants into breakout rooms, which can be        to the COVID-19 pandemic. As more

Good options for conducting online focus groups include:

· Skype: skype.com/en
· GoToMeeting: goto.com/meeting
· Zoom: zoom.us
· Jamboard: jamboard.google.com
Focus groups are less formal than surveys, meaning the researcher will have specific questions
to ask, but the conversation usually grows and develops organically as participants discuss
their impressions. Usually running for between one and two hours, focus groups are used to
get consumer views on:

· New products or marketing campaigns
· Existing products and campaigns and how they can be improved
· Sentiment around the brand
· Views on a brand's new direction or visual style
· Ideas for how the brand could improve its position or branding.
Online focus groups are excellent for collecting a lot of qualitative data quickly. When setting
up the group, try to include enough participants to keep the conversation alive, but not too
many so that some get drowned out by others (eight to ten is a good range). Also consider
that you may run into technical troubles if people are connecting from different locations and
internet connections. Be prepared to do some basic troubleshooting if this happens.

There are a number of different ways that you can recruit participants for an online focus
group. This could include inviting people from your existing customer database, going through
a traditional market research recruiting agent, or putting a call out on your website or social
media communities. It is common practice to offer a small incentive to people who participate
in a focus group, as it is a fairly time-intensive activity.

In-person focus groups are also an option, however, these are more time consuming and costly.
The venue, catering, stationery requirements, and more will need to be considered. Aside from
the logistics, you will need:

· At least one whiteboard
· Ample seating that is flexible and can be easily rearranged
· Large sheets of paper
· Post-its
· Markers.
In-person focus groups tend to be more lively and engaged than online groups. You will need
to determine what suits your budget and needs.

    3.6.3 Sentiment analysis

      Finding out if people are talking about you is quite difficult in the offline world, but almost
      effortless online. Rather than having to conduct real-world surveys and interviews, in the digital
      world you can simply `listen' to the conversation happening about you.
      Keywords, the foundation to categorising and indexing the web, make it simple to track
      conversations taking place online. Customers don't always use channels designated by a
      company to talk about that organisation, but the good news is that the internet makes it easy
      for a company to identify and use the channels that customers have selected.
      Online tools allow a company to track mentions of itself, its staff, its products, its industry
      and its competitors, or anything else that is relevant. This is called online monitoring, online
      listening, or data sentiment analysis. It involves using digital tools to find and tap into existing
      conversations. The tool then gathers and collates all the mentions it finds, so that you can
      analyse the data for insights.

                                         Figure 3.5 A sentiment analysis report
      Typically, searches include the following main focus areas:
      · Company
      · Brand name
      · Key products
      · Key personnel (names, job titles, etc.)
      · Key campaigns and activities
      · Industry

· Conferences
· Patents
· News
· Competitors
· Product launches
· Website updates
· Job vacancies
· Key people.
There are four different types of searches you can perform to track relevant brand keywords.
Each modifies the specific type of data collected and aims to improve the quality and depth
of the data you gather.

The four operators are:

1. Broad match: For example, Apple Computers. This is when any of or all words must be
    found in the mention.

2. Direct match: For example, "Apple Computers." This is denoted by quotation marks and
    dictates that the tool should find mentions only where the phrase appears complete and
    in that order in the content.

3. Inclusive match: For example, Apple +computers. This is denoted by a plus sign directly
    before a word or phrase. This will direct the tool to search for any mention that contains
    both Apple AND computers, although not necessarily in that order.

4. Exclusive match: For example, Apple -fruit. This is denoted by a minus sign directly before
    a word or phrase. This will instruct the tool to include only mentions that contain the first
    word or phrase but not when the second word is also in the same mention.

Combinations of these four types of searches (operators) can be used to improve accuracy.

For example: "Apple Computers" +"Steve Jobs" -fruit.

Applying this theory to the groupings above, some keywords used for Apple might be:

Company

   "Apple computers"
   "www.apple.com"
   Apple +MacBook, "iPod Nano," "Macbook Air," "iTunes" +music -radio
   "Steve Jobs"

Industry

   "Consumer Electronics Show" +"Las Vegas"
   "CEBIT"

                                                                                                                                    61
    PLANNING

    Competitors

       Microsoft
       microsoft.com

    It is also important to track common misspellings and typos, all related companies and
    all related websites.

    Tracking the names of people key to a company can highlight potential brand attacks or can
    demonstrate new areas of outreach for a company.

    Brand names, employee names, product names, and even competitor names are not unique.
    To save yourself from monitoring too much, identify keywords that will indicate that a post has
    nothing to do with your company and exclude those in your searches.

    For example, "apple" could refer to a consumer electronics company, or it could appear in a
    post about the health benefits of fruit. Finding keywords that will indicate context can help
    save time. So, you could exclusive-match words, such as "fruit", "tasty" and "granny smith."

3.6.4 Other avenues for online research

Let's look at other options for conducting online research:

Personal interviews

There are various tools available to the online researcher for conducting personal interviews,
such as private chat rooms or video calling. The internet can connect a researcher with many
people around the world and make it possible to conduct interviews with more anonymity,
should respondents require it.

Observation/online ethnography

Taking its cue from offline ethnography, online ethnography requires researchers to immerse
themselves in a particular environment. In this way, insights can be gathered that might not
have been attainable from a direct interview. However, they do depend more heavily on the
ethnographer's interpretation and are therefore subjective.

                               Figure 3.6 The BeautyTalk online community

Online research communities

Although online communities are a valuable resource for secondary research, communities
can also provide primary data. BeautyTalk is an example of an online research community

                                                                                                                                    63
PLANNING

that helps gather research data. The community platform can be used as a means to elicit
feedback about products and can generate ideas for new products. This is qualitative data
that can aid the company in exploring their research problem further. In many cases, social
media can be used to gather insight about a brand or customer experience. It is important to
remember, however, that a representative sample is necessary for making solid conclusions.

Listening labs

When developing websites and online applications, usability testing is a vital process that will
ensure the website or application is able to meet consumers' needs. Listening labs involve
setting up a testing environment where a consumer is observed using a website or application.

Conversion optimisation

Conversion optimisation aims to determine the    NOTE  Chapter 21: Conversion optimisation

more effectively. From search adverts to email

subject lines and shopping cart design, tests

can be set up to determine what variables are affecting the conversion rate.

3.6.5 How to get responses: Incentives and assurances

As the researcher, you know what's in it for you when sending out a survey. You will receive
valuable insights that will aid in making business decisions. But what is in it for the respondents?

Response rates can be improved by offering respondents incentives for participating in the
research, such as a chance to win a grand prize, a discount or special offer for every respondent,
or even the knowledge that they are improving a product or service that they care about.

Some researchers feel that monetary incentives are not always a good thing. Some respondents
may feel that they need to give `good' or `correct' answers that may bias results. Alternatively,
you may attract respondents who are in it just for the reward. One approach could be to run
the survey with no incentive, with the option of offering one if responses are limited.

Designing the survey to assure respondents that a minimal time commitment is required
and their privacy is assured can also help to increase responses.

    3.6.6 Room for error

      With all research there is a given amount of error to deal with. Bias may arise during surveys
      and focus groups, for example, interviewers leading the respondents. Or bias may be present
      in the design and wording of the questions themselves. There could be sample errors or
      respondent errors. Using the internet to administer surveys removes the bias that may arise
      from an interviewer. However, with no interviewer to explain questions, there is potential for
      greater respondent error. This is why survey design is so important, and why it is crucial to
6 4 test and run pilots of surveys before going live.
                                                                                                                   Market research

Respondent errors also arise when respondents become too familiar with the survey process.
The general industry standard is to limit respondents to being interviewed once every six months.
Sample error is a fact of market research. Some people are just not interested, nor will they
ever be interested, in taking part in research. Are these people fundamentally different from
those who do? Is there a way of finding out? To some extent, web analytics, which track the
behaviour of all visitors to your website, can be useful in determining this.
When conducting online research, it is crucial to understand who is in the target market and
what the best way to reach that target market is. Web surveys can exclude groups of people
due to access or ability. It is vital to determine if this is acceptable to the survey, and to use
other means of capturing data if not.

3.7 JUSTIFYING THE COST OF RESEARCH

Regular research is an important part of any business' growth strategy, but it can be tough to
justify the budget necessary for research without knowing the benefit. Conducting research
can cost little more than an employee's work hours, depending on their skills, or it can be an
expensive exercise involving external experts. Deciding where your business needs are on
the investment scale depends on the depth of the research required, and what the expected
growth will be for the business. When embarking on a research initiative, the cost to benefit
ratio should be determined.
Testing should be an ongoing feature of any digital marketing activity. Tracking, a characteristic
of most digital marketing, allows for constant testing of the most basic hypothesis: Is this
campaign successful in reaching the goals of the business?

   3.9 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

      Market researchers are increasingly turning to online tools in their research processes. The
      internet allows for research at a far lower cost; it can also more easily cross geographic
      boundaries and can speed up the research process.
      This is not to say there are no downsides. While the internet makes it possible to reach a far
      larger group of people without the cost of facilitators, it does come with some challenges. For
      example, you cannot control the environments in which information is being gathered. For an
      online sample, it's important to focus on getting the correct number of people to make your
      study statistically viable. If your questions are not carefully drafted, confusing questions could
      lead to answers that are flawed or not relevant. Additionally, online incentives could lead to
      answers that are not truthful, meaning that the value of the data could be questionable. Certain
      target groups are not accessible via the internet, and so it's important that you carefully consider
      who you are trying to reach.
      The value of internet research should by no means be discounted, but it is important to consider
      the nature of the study carefully and to interrogate the validity and legitimacy of the data as
      a valid representation. Data is meaningful only if it is representative, so be sure to establish
      goals and realistic expectations for your research.

     3.10 CASE STUDY: SEPHORA

         Sephora is a leading international beauty retail store
         with over 2 600 stores across the US alone.

      One-line summary

         Material, a leading integrated marketing services company, was commissioned by Sephora
         to conduct research towards understanding how racial bias affects the retail sector, and
         to offer insights that support Sephora in becoming a more inclusive brand.

      The problem

         In an attempt to ensure that the brand was aligned with its stated values of inclusivity
         and anti-racism, Sephora understood that racial bias could be implicit and widespread
         throughout its stores, impacting the retail experience of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People
         of Colour) customers and staff.
         To fully understand how BIPOC experienced the retail portion of the Sephora experience
         (and, more broadly, all retail experiences), they commissioned a study.

The solution

Material, the company hired to put the study together, worked with their Growth Strategy
and Insights divisions. They conducted interviews with shoppers and employees across
the United States of America to compile a report that consisted of both quantitative and
qualitative.
The research consisted of the following:
· A review of academic literature to understand retail policies and practices that may

    affect racial bias and discrimination
· A contextual analysis of cultural insights to determine where racial bias may manifest
· An Online SmartCommunity
· Digital ethnographies
· Employee interviews
· Online survey among 3 034 shoppers and retail employees.
On the back of the findings, Material compiled `five truths,' which could be used to develop
an action plan across three key business areas: marketing and merchandising, in-store
experiences, and workplace environment. This was aimed to better equip staff and head
office staff to recognise and address bias and to eradicate discrimination.

The results

In January 2021, Sephora released the Racial Bias in Retail study. In it, the `five truths' were
listed and an action plan put in place.
Sephora committed to the following:
· To double its Black-owned brands
· To showcase diverse backgrounds, identities, ages, and body types in marketing

    materials
· To put in place a greeting system that will standardise the in-store experience for all

    customers
· To increase the depth and frequency of anti-bias training for staff
· To formalise and intensify efforts to recruit, mentor, and develop programs for BIPOC

    employees
· To put in place zero-tolerance policies for matters of bias and discrimination.

3.12 THE BIGGER PICTURE

Understanding your market is the foundation of every marketing activity, online or off. If you
don't know who you're speaking to or what your audience cares about, it's unlikely that your
message will resonate with them.
Market research will define the content you create across channels like email marketing, digital
copywriting, SEO, and online advertising. It helps you find your audiences on social channels
by indicating where they spend most of their time and how they like interacting with your
brand. It also helps you meet their needs by defining the touchpoints they expect from your
brand, especially when it comes to creating web and mobile channels.
The more data you can gather about your audience, the better you will be able to optimise
and improve your marketing efforts. Market research is an excellent supplement to the quan-
titative data you can gather through data analytics.

3.13 SUMMARY

Market research means gathering and analysing data in order to gain insight to consumers,
to understand a market, and make business decisions. Information can be gathered about
customers, competitors and the market.
Research can be conducted based on secondary data, which refers to information or data
that is already published, or based on primary data, which is data gathered specifically for a
particular research problem.
Research can also be qualitative or quantitative. The internet provides the tools for gathering qual-
itative data, while online tools such as surveys and web analytics packages are ideal for gathering
quantitative data.
Surveys, online focus groups, and online monitoring are three excellent ways to conduct
research online.
Analytics and online report tools play a big role in providing data. While these are digital
marketing tactics in themselves and are covered later in this book, keep in mind that they also
provide information that can feed into research conducted for a particular purpose.

3.14 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

    customer and this one.

2. What is primary research?
3. What role does online research play in the overall market research toolkit?

    4.1 INTRODUCTION

    Every business needs a strategy. It directs the actions of and creates the vision for the organisa-
    tion to achieve its long-term objectives. The strategy involves consistent decision making that
    guides the route of activities and approaches that a business will take over a defined period after
    considering its operating environment, customers, product, and/or service offering to achieve
    its set goals. It also outlines the tactics and plans that you will use to execute this direction.

    Typically, you will formulate your strategy based on your business goals and aspirations -
    whether this is purely to make money, to help the environment, to help employees find a way
    to contribute meaningfully to their communities, or a combination of all the above. Your answer
    to `Why do we exist?' or `Why do we do what we do?' will provide the core purpose of your
    business strategy, which will in turn direct how you will reach your goals.

    In marketing, strategy starts by understanding what the business wants to achieve, what
    problem it wants to solve, who the business serves (i.e., the customer), and how it will add
    value to the market. It then considers the context in which the business and its competitors
    operate to outline the key methods to gain competitive advantage and add value.

    In 2020, the world changed. As a result of global lockdowns and international social distancing
    laws, digital communication technology instantaneously facilitated the need to connect, com-
    municate, and operate without direct human contact. Digital quickly became integral to every
    area of business to continue running - at least, for those businesses that could still operate.
    As a result, it has become vital for companies to adopt a holistic approach to planning their
    business and marketing strategies in a way that integrates digital technology as a standard
    business practice, rather than just an add-on.

    This chapter considers digital as an integral part of the strategy to reach customers and solve
    marketing problems, while focusing on getting the basics right.

    Before we get into this chapter, consider what we have covered in the previous chapters of
    our Planning section so far. What you have already learned will prepare you for some of the
    important activities involved in setting up a successful marketing plan, including:

    · Planning your campaigns
    · Setting campaign objectives
    · Defining the target audience
    · Selecting campaign tactics
    · Determining budget allocations
    · Setting the timeline.

    4.3 UNDERSTANDING MARKETING STRATEGY

    Before starting your marketing strategy, it is important to first understand the business and
    brand with which you are working.

    4.3.1 Business and brand strategy

    The goal of any business is to make money. To do so successfully, business strategy needs
    to ask a few important questions, such as "What is the business challenge that we are facing
    that prevents us from making more revenue?" and "What business objective/s should we strive
    for to increase the money in the bank?"

    Although still relevant, the world has evolved. These questions were sufficient to kickstart the
    business strategy before the global COVID-19 pandemic, but as global uncertainty remains a
    certainty, we cannot ignore the effects of lockdowns and social distancing that prevailed in 2020
    and 2021. Businesses that adopted technology proved to be far more resilient in the wake of
    the changes. Using digital communication technology proved to be effective in compensating
    for online interactions and connections. For this reason, businesses should answer a few more
    questions concerning technology and how it affects business operations.

                                                                                                                              Strategy

Consider the following:

· What is digital technology's role in my business?
· How will we achieve success in the current and future environment?

To improve business performance, it is vital that you consider the impact of technology on
your operations, processes, and customers. The role that digital can play in your business
strategy may include:

· To offer a better understanding of how people are living their lives (B2C)/how businesses
    are operating in the contemporary world (B2B)

· To offer an idea of various opportunities, what is feasible for your business, and your value
    proposition.

Determining the role of digital in your business will assist in making key decisions to drive
the business' strategic direction. Once you determine your business imperatives for survival
and growth, you will also identify important organisational focus areas for your brand and
marketing objectives.

Brand, however, proves why the business matters. It demonstrates the reasons to believe,
justifies the business' purpose, and reinforces the value that the business adds to people's lives.
In line with the business strategy, the brand strategy provides the roadmap for the business
to achieve its goals and objectives. It focuses on the customer and their needs, the brand's
identity, and the business' key value propositions.

The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines a brand as, "A name, term, design, symbol,
or any other feature that identifies one seller's goods or service as distinct from those of other
sellers. The usual expression of a brand is its trademark. A brand may identify one item, a family
of items, or all items of that seller". To quote Fred Burt from Siegel+Gale, a brand presents "a
reason to choose" one product or service over another.

The value of the brand is measured by how well the product and/or service sells, the role
that the brand plays in customer buying decisions, and its competitive strength. Other than
through the financial performance of the brand, it is not always straightforward to measure
brand value. By building brand awareness and recognition through marketing and advertising,
creating positive customer experiences, and fostering brand loyalty, you can enhance your
brand equity to increase brand value.

Here are a few brand-related questions that you may want to ask:

· Is this brand designed to grow at a rate of knots?
· Is it designed to deliver consistent decent returns?
· Is it an experiment and designed to test the waters in a new market or an endeavour for

    the company's portfolio as a proof of concept?
· Is the company trying to quietly demarket the brand and giving it a form of palliative care?

    (e.g., through the BCG model of cash cows, stars, question marks, and pets)
                                                                                                                                    75
          PLANNING

      When you have the answers to these questions, you can start to formulate a marketing strategy to
      address the challenge or objective you've discovered.

    4.3.2 Marketing strategy

      The purpose of a marketing strategy is to reach the brand's target market and turn people into
      buyers of the business' product/s and/or service/s. It uses the business and brand strategy to
      determine its objectives and then packages the value proposition and offering to the market.
      The marketing strategy also addresses business and brand challenges or objectives.

      An effective strategy involves making a series of well-informed decisions about how the brand,
      product, or service should be promoted. A brand that attempts to be all things to all people
      risks becoming unfocused or losing the clarity of its value proposition. It is therefore important
      to be authentic when presenting your brand and offering to the market - especially in the
      digital age - because of its reach. Connecting with people should be your number one priority.

      For example, if a new financial technology company wants to launch successfully, the marketing
      strategy would need to focus on what its target audience requires. It will prioritise customer
      benefits when presenting its value proposition, while differentiating itself from its competitors.
      It will also consider whether its product is local or international, whether its target market is
      small business owners or established corporate decision makers, and whether the channel to
      reach its target market would be through networking, word of mouth, or social media. Each
      of these choices will result in a vastly different strategic direction.

      To make these decisions, a strategist must understand the context in which the brand operates,
      asking, "What are the factors that affect the business?" This means conducting a situational
      analysis that looks at the following four pillars:

      1. The environment
      2. The business
      3. The customers
      4. The competitors.

      Here are some considerations and tools for conducting your brand's situational analysis.

    Understanding the environment

      The environment is the overall context or `outside world' in which the business functions.
      It can involve anything from global economics (how well is the local currency performing
      these days?) to developments in your industry (how does remote work affect daily business
      processes?). Every brand will have a specific environment that it needs to consider, based on
      the type of product or service it produces.

      An analysis of the business and brand environment will typically consider political, economic,
      social, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE) influences to identify a clear set of

76
                                                           Strategy

issues pertinent to the marketing strategy. Although each element influences the analysis of
the environment, technology has proven to be a particularly valuable enabler of strategy for
businesses and consumers globally. It will be important for you to prioritise digital transformation
in your business.

You should consider a few important matters, such as:

· Where will we compete in terms of geographies, product categories, consumer segments,
    channels, vertical stages of production?

· What role will digital play in this?

The process of digital transformation will help you to identify where growth will come from
and determine the following:

· Will growth come from new geographies?
    · Will it be possible to find growth in existing targets through premiumisation or by targeting
         the middle- and/or low-end markets? What will be required here to achieve this?
    · Will your business find growth through verticalisation? (i.e., If you are Facebook, do you
         try to grow in the mindfulness space? Or, if Twitter, by buying CNN?)
    · Do you find growth by targeting adjacencies? (i.e., If you are Headspace, do you try to
         grow in the exercise space?)

· Do you try to rebuild the economic model of the business by playing in subscription rundles
    (recurring revenue bundles) instead of the attention economy?

If you are going to complete a digital transformation process for your business, the digital
strategy will need to respond to the questions and considerations above, in addition to how
to execute against a brand's segmentation.

What does it mean? What associations, ideas,

From this, you can determine what the brand or product's unique selling point (USP) is. A
USP is the one characteristic that can make your product or service better than that of the

      Relevance is important for brands in the digital age. It is the difference between a successful
      brand and a brand that is ineffective, because connecting to your customer in ways that
      resonate, will lead to growth for your business.

    Understanding customers

      Market research is essential if you want to understand your customers. Try not to make
      assumptions about why people like and transact with your brand - you may find their values
      and motives are quite different from what you thought. Ongoing research and a data driven
      business will help you to build a picture of what particular benefit or feature your business
      provides to your customers, allowing you to capitalise on this in your marketing content.
      One important area on which to focus here is the consumer journey, which is the series of steps
      and decisions a customer takes before buying from your business (or not). Luckily, online data
      analytics allow you to get a good picture of how people behave online before converting to
      customers. Other forms of market research will also help you establish this for your offline channels.
      The surge in the use of digital technology to connect and market has changed the customer
      journey - both online and offline. Consumers may engage with your brand in a variety of ways
      (across devices or marketing channels) before making a purchase. In addition, how your brand
      resonates with the customer will affect how they respond to your offer.

                                Figure 4.2 The customer journey is cyclical

The goal is to reach customers with the right marketing message at the right stage of their
journey, in the right context, and in a way that is relevant. For example, you may want to use
aspirational messages for someone in the exploration phase, but focus on more direct features
and benefits (such as a lower price) when they're almost ready to buy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive effect on people, who have had to adapt to new
ways of connecting, using technology to achieve what they want. This has unlocked a global
market for them, which is why brands need to meet consumers in the technological spaces
they have chosen. The consumer relationship with technology is about accessibility - theirs
to brands and products, and the brands' to theirs. This has shifted a great deal of power to
the consumer.

          PLANNING

      This connection to technology offers many opportunities for marketers. Every new technology
      embraced by a consumer offers brands new ways to collect information about them. This leads
      to more granular segmentation and more targeted marketing messages.

      Building a powerful brand takes time. Use Keller's brand equity model as an opportunity to
      ask the right questions to strengthen your brand.

     Understanding competitors

      It's important to know who else is marketing to your potential customers, what they offer, and
      how you can challenge or learn from them. Many competitors target the same needs in each
      customer, sometimes through very similar products. Positioning places your brand in a unique
      place in people's minds. It is impossible to create a strong value proposition or USP without
      knowing your competitors' positioning strategy.

      On the internet, your competitors are not just those who are aiming to earn your customers'
      money; they are also those who are capturing your customers' attention. With more digital
      content being created in a day than most people could consume in a year - for example,
      over 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute as of February 2020 (Statista,
      2022) - the scarcest resources these days are time, focus, and attention.

      When considering competition, it's also worthwhile to look at potential replacements for your
      product. The internet has disrupted and accelerated the pace of disintermediation in several
      industries, meaning that people can now go directly to the business instead of transacting
      through a middleman (look at the travel industry as an example). To stay ahead, you should
      be looking at potential disruptors of your industry as well as the existing players.

    4.3.3 Digital marketing strategy

      Once you have a clear sense of what the business challenge or objective is, you can define
      how your marketing strategy will leverage digital channels to fulfil it.

      As discussed in the introduction, digital should not be considered as separate from your core
      strategy. Digital marketing builds on and adapts the principles of traditional marketing, using
      the opportunities and challenges offered by the digital medium.

      A marketing strategy should be constantly iterating and evolving. Since the internet allows for
      near-instantaneous feedback and data gathering, marketers should constantly be optimising
      and improving their online marketing efforts to remain relevant in consumers' minds.

      Customer-centric thinking, which involves placing the user at the core of all decisions, is vital when
      looking at building a successful marketing strategy. Today's marketing strategist offers not only a
      plethora of tactical possibilities, but also unprecedented ways of measuring the effectiveness of
      chosen strategies and tactics. Digital allows greater opportunities for interaction and consumer
      engagement than were possible in the past, so it is important to consider the ways in which the
      brand can create interactive experiences for consumers, not just broadcast messages.

One of the key strengths of digital marketing is that it is highly empirical - almost everything
can be measured, from behaviours to actions and action paths, to results. Insight tools can
even be used to track the sentiment of users towards certain elements online. This means that
the digital marketing strategist should be constantly measuring and adapting to ensure the
highest ROI. Built into any strategy should be a testing framework and the ability to remain
flexible and dynamic in a medium that shifts and changes as user behaviours do.

If we defined strategy as a plan of action designed to achieve a particular outcome, the
desired outcome of a digital marketing strategy would be aligned with your organisation's
overall business and brand building objectives or challenges. For example, if one of the overall
objectives was acquisition of new clients, a possible digital marketing objective might be
building brand awareness online.

4.4 THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF MARKETING STRATEGY

The following building-block techniques will help you structure a marketing strategy, both
on- and offline, that addresses your core business challenges. These strategy models are just
starting points and ways to help you think through problems. As you grow in experience and
insight, you could find yourself relying on them less or adapting them.

4.4.1 Porter's Five Forces analysis

Porter's Five Forces analysis is a business tool that helps determine the competitive intensity
and attractiveness of a market. The internet's low barrier to entry means that many new
businesses are appearing online, providing countless choices for customers. This makes it
important to consider new factors when devising a marketing strategy.

    4.4.2 The four Ps

      The four Ps of marketing help you structure the components that make up a brand's offering,
      differentiators, and marketing. They have been fundamentally changed by the internet and need
      to be looked at in the context offered by digitally connected media, and from the perspective
      of the consumer. Your success will ultimately be determined by how your brand is positioned
      in the mind of your consumer.

     1. Products (and services)
      Products and services are what a company sells. The internet enables businesses to sell a huge
      range of products, from fast-moving consumer goods and digital products such as software,
      to services such as consultancy. In fact, the internet has in some cases made it possible for a
      product or service to exist, for example Netflix and Amazon. Online, the experience the user
      has in discovering and purchasing can be considered part of the product the brand provides
      or the product itself.

      The internet has enabled hyper-personalisation. Nike (nike.com/za/nike-by-you) and Converse
      (converse.com), for example, allow customers to customise their own trainers, which gives these
      brands a unique competitive advantage. The internet as a distribution medium also makes it
      possible for products, such as software and music, to be sold digitally.

     2. Price
      The prevalence of search engines and of shopping comparison websites, such as shopping.
      google.com and pricegrabber.com makes it easy for customers to compare product prices across
      several retailers. This makes the internet a market of near-perfect competition (Porter, 2008).
      The internet allows for personalised and flexible pricing strategies to a level that traditional
      retailers would find almost impossible to achieve.

      With price differentiation becoming a challenge, especially for smaller players in the market,
      businesses need to consider differentiating on value. Value is a combination of service, perceived
      benefits, and price, where customers may be willing to pay a higher price for a better experience
      or if they feel they are getting something more than just the product.

     3. Placement (or distribution)
      Product distribution and markets no longer have to be dictated by location. By simply making
      their products visible online (for example, on a website or Facebook page), brands can now
      reach a global market. The key is to reach and engage customers on the channels they are
      using. This is why choosing your digital tactics is vital. You want to engage customers on their
      terms, not yours by showing them your commitment to meeting their needs. Ultimately, you
      want your customers to share in the experience of your brand wherever they are in the world.

4. Promotion

The internet, as an information and entertainment medium, naturally lends itself to promoting
products. The online promotional mix is an extension of the offline, but with some significant
differences. Online promotion can be tracked, measured, and targeted in a far more sophisticated
way.

Promotion doesn't just mean advertising and

          PLANNING

      Always have a purpose in mind when conducting a SWOT analysis. For example, study the
      external threats to your business and see how learning from these can help you overcome
      internal weaknesses. This should tie back into your business and marketing objectives; strengths
      should be promoted, opportunities should be sought out, while threats and weaknesses should
      be minimised or converted into opportunities as much as possible. A SWOT analysis is part
      of a situational analysis and identifies the key issues that direct the marketing strategy. Be
      mindful of the fact that weaknesses can be opportunities and strengths threats, especially in
      the world of digital disruption.

   4.5 CRAFTING A DIGITAL MARKETING STRATEGY

      Any activity with an end goal or target should have a plan of action in place for every person in
      the organisation to follow. In digital marketing, however, there is no single definitive approach
      so each business must create its own roadmap. But, there are questions you can use to guide
      this process.

      A strategy needs to distinguish between who you are and who you are not. It should also
      include what you are offering and to whom, as well as why and how you are doing so. The
      steps and questions below cover what an organisation should be aware of when creating
      and implementing a strategy that will meet its marketing objectives and solve its challenges.

    1. Context

      The first step in crafting a successful strategy is to examine the context of the organisation
      and the various stakeholders. We covered this under marketing strategy earlier in this chapter,
      but here's a quick recap.

      · What is the context in which you are operating (PESTLE factors) and how is this likely to
          change in the future?

      · Who are you, why does your brand matter, and what makes your brand useful and valuable?
      · Who are your customers, and what needs, wants, and desires do they have?
      · Who are your competitors? These may extend beyond organisations that compete with you

          based on price and product and could also be competition in the form of abstracts, such as
          time and mindshare. Thorough market research will reveal the answers to these questions.

    2. Value exchange

      Once you have examined the market situation, the second step is an examination of your
      value proposition or promise: in other words, the unique value your organisation can add to
      that market. It is important to identify the supporting value-adds to the brand promise that
      are unique to the digital landscape. What extras, beyond the basic product or service, do you
      offer to customers? What do your customers expect or need to gain value from your brand?

84
                                                       Strategy

The internet offers many channels for value creation. However, the definition of what is
`valuable' depends largely on the target audience, so it is crucial to research your users and
gather insights into what they want and need. Gathering the right data can help you evolve
this value exchange over time.

3. Goals

When setting your digital marketing goals, there are four key aspects to consider: objectives,
goals, tactics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and targets. Let's look at each one in turn.

Objectives

Objectives are essential to any marketing endeavour; without them, your strategy would have
no direction and no end goal or win conditions. It's important to be able to take a step back
and ask, "Why are we doing any of this? What goal, purpose or outcome are we looking for?"

· What are you trying to achieve?
· How will you know if you are successful?

Sometimes, words like 'objective' can be used in different situations with slightly different
meanings. Remember, the objective of a website or online campaign is aligned with the
strategic outcomes of the business. The objective of a campaign may be to create awareness
for a new business or increase sales of a product. The objective answers the question, "What
do we want to achieve with this marketing campaign?" For example, an objective might be to
increase the sales of a product, grow brand awareness, or increase website traffic. A business
objective (something that your business will either do or not do) and a marketing objective (a
change in customer behaviour that your business wants to achieve) are not the same thing!

Objectives need to be SMART:

· Specific: The objective must be clear and detailed, rather than vague and general.
· Measurable: The objective must be measurable so that you can gauge whether you are

    attaining the desired outcome.
· Attainable: The objective must be possible for your brand to achieve, based on available

    resources.
· Realistic: The objective must also be sensible and based on data and trends; don't exaggerate

    or overestimate what can be achieved.
· Time-bound: The objective must be linked to a specific timeframe.

Goals                                            NOTE  Goals related to visitor behaviour, such

    PLANNING

    of pages in a visit. A completed goal is called a conversion. Goals are derived from objectives
    and answer the question, "What do we need users to do in order to achieve our objective?"

    Tactics
    Objectives are not the same as tactics. Tactics are the specific tools or approaches you will use
    to meet your objectives, for example, a retention-based email newsletter, a Facebook page, or
    a CRM implementation. As a strategy becomes more complex, you may have multiple tactics
    working together to try to achieve the same objective. Tactics may change (and often should),
    but the objective should remain your focus. We'll look at tactics in more detail in the next section.

    Key performance indicators (KPIs)
    Key performance indicators or KPIs are metrics that are used to indicate whether tactics are
    performing well and meeting your objectives. There are many metrics to be analysed, and
    determining which are important will help to focus on what really matters to a particular
    campaign. KPIs relate closely to goals and answer the question, "What data do we need to look
    at to see if goals are being completed?" If, for instance, your objective is to increase website
    traffic, you may look at the number of website visitors, the percentage of new visitors, and
    how long users stay on the site.

    KPIs are determined per tactic, with an eye on the overall objective. The diagram below shows
    how a few KPIs can feed into one goal and several goals can feed into one objective. A single
    objective can have a few goals, each with their own number of KPIs, to ensure it is achieved.

Targets
Targets are the specific values that are set for your KPIs to reach within a specific period. That
is, they are the actual target values that KPIs need to meet for the campaign to be declared a
success. Sportspeople need to reach targets to advance their careers, for example, come in
the top ten to qualify for the final or run 10 km in under 27 minutes. If you meet or exceed a
target, you are succeeding; if you don't reach it, you're falling behind on your objectives and
need to reconsider your approach (or your target). If one KPI is `newsletter subscriptions,' then
a target might be 100 subscriptions every month. If one month falls short at 70, this will quickly
reveal that a fix is required.

When setting objectives and targets for any campaign, remember to think about overlaps in
customer behaviour that might impact how you measure your success. People might click on
an ad and visit your website to buy something, but they could also browse and then go and
buy something in the brick-and-mortar store. The total economic value of online activities
needs to account for this so that you can get an idea of the true contribution digital is making.

Here is an example:

   SMART objective:

   · Increase sales through the ecommerce platform by 10% within the next six months
   Tactics:

   · Search advertising
   · Social media marketing using the Facebook brand page
   KPIs per tactic:

   · Search advertising - number of search referrals, cost per click on the ads
   · Facebook brand page - number of comments and shares on campaign specific posts
   Targets per tactic:

   · Search advertising - 1 000 search referrals after the first month, with a 10% month-
        on-month increase after that

   · Facebook brand page - 50 comments and 10 shares on campaign-specific posts
        per week.

4. Tactics and evaluation

Many digital tools and tactics are available once you have defined your digital marketing
objectives. Each tactic has its strengths, for example, acquisition (gaining new customers) may
best be driven by search advertising, while email is one of the most effective tools for selling
more products to existing customers.

                                                                                                                                    87

Once the objectives and tactics have been set, these should be cross-checked and re-evaluated
against the needs and resources of your organisation to make sure your strategy is on the right
track and no opportunities are being overlooked.

5. Ongoing optimisation

It is increasingly important for brands to be dynamic, flexible, and agile when marketing online.
New tactics and platforms emerge every week, search algorithms are updated and refreshed
often, customer behaviours change over time, and people's needs and wants from brands
evolve as their relationship grows.

                                                                                                                                    89
          PLANNING

      This process of constant change should be considered in the early stages of strategy formu-
      lation, allowing tactics and strategies to be modified and optimised as you go. After all, digital
      marketing strategy should be iterative, innovative, and open to evolution.

      Understanding user experience and the user journey is vital to building successful brands.
      Budget should be set aside upfront for analysing user data and optimising conversion paths.

      Social thinking and socially informed innovation are also valuable and uniquely suited to
      the online space. Socially powered insight can be used to inform strategic decisions in the
      organisation, from product roadmaps to service plans. Brands have moved away from being
      merely present in social media towards actively using it, aligning it with actionable objectives
      and their corresponding metrics. This is critical in demonstrating ROI and understating the
      opportunities and threats in the market.

      Managing the learning loop (the knowledge gained from reviewing the performance of your
      tactics, which can then be fed back into the strategy) can be difficult. This is because brand
      cycles often move more slowly than the real-time results you will see online. It is therefore
      important to find a way to work agility into the strategy, allowing you to be quick, creative, and
      proactive, as opposed to slow, predictable, and reactive. The data collected around success of
      your marketing strategy should feed into a larger pool of information used to drive business
      decisions.

     4.6 CASE STUDY: VETS NOW: TAKING CARE OF THE BRAND

         Vets Now, an industry-known UK accident and emergency vet-
         erinarian service, is dedicated to improving the lives of pets by
         providing emergency care when most vet surgeries are closed.

      One line summary

         Vets Now wanted to become the brand of choice amongst consumers and veterinarians
         by improving brand awareness and appeal to customers and delivering exceptional care
         to pets and owners.

      The problem

         Vets Now provided their accident and emergency service to over 1 000 veterinary practices
         across the UK. But, with more and smaller local emergency veterinary clinics opening
         and day clinics starting to offer out-of-hours services, Vets Now was experiencing intense
         competition. They decided to target pet owners directly and make themselves the brand
         of choice for pet owners, if and when their pet required emergency care.

         However, the brand didn't deal directly with clients too often, and brand awareness of Vets
         Now among pet owners was at about 8% (despite 1 in 4 UK vet practices using the service).

90
                                                                                                                          Strategy

The brand was also offering inconsistent sub-brands, which confused pet owners.
Vets Now wanted to improve brand awareness, consolidate their offering, and create a
pet-owner led approach.

The solution

Vets Now recognised that they needed to conduct a brand audit to determine their unifying
core purpose. A brand workshop was held, and the key insight was that emergency
and critical care were the heart of the brand. All other sub-brands and straplines were
negating from this core message. The brand wanted to present a singular pet owner brand
proposition and developed the single unifying strapline: Introducing Vets Now - Your pet
emergency service.
To appeal to customers directly, they needed to know who their potential customers were
and what their feelings were towards their pets. Vets Now conducted surveys, interviews,
and focus groups with over 1 000 pet owners. They identified 8 pet owner types, and
highlighted the key drivers behind pet ownership in the UK. They then mapped out the
owner types against these drivers.

                     Figure 4.7 Map of pet ownership from Vets Now (2018)
The key insight was that pet owners expect others to treat their pets as they would other
human beings. This means that the care and professionalism offered to pets are paramount.
Pet owners are dedicated to keeping their pet happy and healthy and want the best
care possible if an emergency were to occur. Pet owners needed emotional support and
reassurance when dealing with an emergency involving their pet.

                                                                                                                                 91
          PLANNING

         Vets Now also identified three touchpoints of customers with the brand:

         · Search and online: Finding an emergency vet
         · Clinica: Referring to Vets Now by another veterinary clinician
         · Social space: Engaging with other pet owners and online content.
         Using these insights, the brand consolidated itself as one single brand offering. The brand
         also identified its essential brand principles and used these to inform all its branding
         and marketing communication. Vets Now created new branding and imagery and chose
         a reassuring and expert but friendly and straightforward tone of voice to use across all
         communication. This unified and consolidated look and feel conveyed the core purpose
         of the brand and offered consumers brand recognition.

         This new look and feel was rolled out across the website, Vets Now hospitals and clinics,
         internal branding, and in print and digital marketing campaigns. These were chosen to
         ensure the new branding reached consumers at all three touchpoints.

         The marketing campaign included various platforms and a mixture of traditional and digital
         tactics. There were print and digital ads, as well as content delivered across the website,
         social media, printed flyers, and in-clinic posters. Content included emergency plans
         for illness and accidents, as well as dangers present in the home during the Christmas
         holiday period. It also included information about how to ensure a pet stays happy and
         healthy over the festive season. This content was specifically created to resonate with
         the audience and used the insights gained from the in-depth research conducted by the
         brand to inform content development and creation.

      The results

         The research and ensuing strategy ensured the brand's awareness among customers
         increased. After the campaigns and rebranding, 59% of respondents had an unprompted
         recall of Vets Now, up 20% from before the campaign. Within the sample of respondents,
         propensity to use Vets Now after the campaign was up 138%. These were strong indicators
         of positive performance. The new website also saw a 23% drop in bounce rate within 5
         days of going live, showing that the brand was now more in line with what users were
         searching for.

      The importance of relooking at your brand and really investigating your customers is clearly
      demonstrated in this case study. It shows how a B2B brand can reposition itself as B2C with
      the right analysis and strategy. Clearly laying down your objectives, doing the necessary
      research and identifying how to address your customer across all touchpoints is essential to
      marketing strategy.

4.8 THE BIGGER PICTURE

All the chapters in this book are linked to digital marketing strategy in one way or another.

A solid business and brand strategy should be the starting point of any marketing venture,
and you should always keep one eye on it as you develop specific campaigns, platforms, and
approaches. After all, you should always remember that you are trying to reach your chosen
audience by communicating with them in the most effective way to build rewarding and
lucrative long-term relationships.

While strategy helps you understand the questions you should ask, data collected across
your business, including market research, provides the information you need to answer them.

4.9 SUMMARY

Strategy is the essential first step in positioning your brand within the market and creating a
roadmap for achieving your business goals. While there are many different paths one can take,
there is a clear process for understanding where you are, where you need to be, and how you
will get there. It all starts with understanding the business challenges that your brand faces.
From there, an effective marketing strategy looks at the market context, weighs the available
options, and makes important choices, based on solid research and data. Digital adds a layer
of technology, engagement, and iterative optimisation into the strategic process. The wide
variety of tools and tactics offered by the digital medium should inform your strategic choices,
including data.

The more data you collect, the more relevant you can make your customer experience. Relevance
leads to a better customer experience, which leads to more opportunities to collect data. A
customer-focused, data-driven organisation needs to embrace this cycle, which enables both
incremental and disruptive innovation.

Businesses need to embrace dynamic data that enables them to keep a clear view of their
evolving customer. This data strategy should be built around lagging, current, and leading
or future indicators, each of which can give you a different piece of the data puzzle. If this
happens, the business will have a clear view of past and current performance as well as where
they can go in the future.

                                                                                                                                    93
          PLANNING

      Digital can make marketing strategy highly empirical, and your strategic thinking should be
      mindful of ROI and how it can be measured. This will allow you to optimise your tactics and
      performance to create a valuable brand story, an excellent user experience, the most optimised
      conversion funnels, and the highest ROI.

CLAIMING
          CLAIMING

   INTRODUCTION TO CLAIMING

      Claiming your space in the digital marketing arena requires that you know your customer
      and understand their desires, needs, and how they will access your service or product. One
      of the most important benefits of digital marketing is the availability of data. This data can be
      collected, analysed, and used in numerous ways to not only increase reach and engagement
      with your customer, but also to improve their overall experience.

      Search engine optimisation (SEO) puts your product or service directly in the path of a
      potential customer. SEO helps people understand what is relevant, popular, and important.
      It tells customers that they can trust your brand. SEO is one of the more effective tools that
      you must get to grips with if you take digital marketing seriously. Chapter 5: Search engine
      optimisation focuses on how search engines work and deliver results, how to plan and
      implement an effective keyword strategy, and techniques for link building.

      Once you have drawn customers in, you want them to have a good experience. The process
      of UX is clearly linked to the customer journey; good UX will make your customer return, and
      likely recommend your brand. Good user experience design (UX) is easier than people think
      and does not require fancy software; it simply requires that you understand some web design
      fundamentals and that you consider your customers' user journey from start to finish. Chapter 6:
      User experience design helps you recognise and create usable and enjoyable experiences.

      With the UX principles in place, you can focus on web design. A good website is essential
      for successful digital marketing, and for staking your claim in customers' hearts, minds and
      (ultimately) encouraging them to open their wallets. Chapter 7: Web development and design

5.1 INTRODUCTION

With millions of people performing billions of searches each day to find content on the internet,
Google alone processes over 40 000 searches per second (Internet Live Stats, 2017). It makes
sense that marketers want their products to be findable online. Search engines, the channels
through which these searches happen, use closely guarded algorithms to determine the
results displayed.

Determining what factors these algorithms take into account has led to a growing practice
known as search engine optimisation (SEO).

SEO is the practice of optimising a website to  NOTE  Take a look at this speculative list of

                                                      On-page factors
Google uses about 200 different factors in its
algorithm to determine relevance and ranking          moz.com/learn/seo/on-page-factors
(Dean, 2016). None of the major search engines
disclose the elements they use to rank pages,         Off-page factors
but there are many SEO practitioners who
spend time analysing patent applications to           moz.com/learn/seo/off-site-seo
try to determine what these are.

Other types of websites that rely on search, like YouTube and Facebook, have their own
algorithms. Facebook's Newsfeed algorithm, for example, uses around 100 000 factors
to rank and sort content that appears in users' newsfeeds.

SEO can be split into two distinct camps: white hat SEO and black hat SEO.

1. White hat SEO: This refers to working within the parameters set by search engines to
    optimise a website for better user experience. Search engines want to send users to the
    website that is best suited to their needs; white hat SEO should ensure that users can find
    what they are looking for.

2. Black hat SEO: This refers to attempts to    NOTE  If you want to know more about white

SEO techniques may have short-lived gains in some cases. However, the risk of penalties

from the major search engines, especially Google, make such SEO techniques not worth

           it in the end.

     5.3 CORE PRINCIPLES

     In order to understand how to use SEO to your advantage, it's important to understand what
     it is and how it works. Remember that data is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal.
     SEO is just one way to utilise the data that you collect.

5.3.1. Understanding SEO

Search engines need to help users find what they're looking for. To do this, they list the best
or most relevant results first. Search engines typically rank results based on signals such as
popularity, authority, relevance, trust, and importance.

SEO, also called organic or natural optimisation,   NOTE  Want to see how search works?

keywords without the use of Google Ads.                   howsearchworks/thestory
Generally, techniques used for optimising on
one search engine will help efforts across others.

SEO can be divided into two main strategies:        NOTE  A good place to keep track of Google
1. On-page optimisation: This is achieved by              search algorithm updates is this handy

content, and structure of a website, making               algorithm-change

it more accessible to search engines, and

by extension, easier for users to find.

2. Off-page optimisation: This is generally focused on building links to the website and

covers activities like social media and digital PR.

SEO is an extremely effective way of generating new business to a site. It is a continuous
process and a way of thinking about how search engines see your website and how users use
search engines to find your website. It's search psychology.

Consider that SEO stands for `Search Experience Optimisation' because search engines want
to promote the visibility of websites that they determine provide the best experience for users.
The best experience refers to how user-friendly the website is and how well the website's
content meets users' needs, as well as enhancing other factors to convince search engines.

SEO is a fairly technical practice but it can easily be broken down into five main areas:

1. A search engine-friendly website structure
2. A well-researched list of keywords
3. Content optimised to target those keywords
4. Link popularity
5. User insights.

5.3.2 Search engine-friendly website structure

Search engines encounter two kinds of obstacles:

1. Technical challenges that prevent the search engine spider from accessing content
2. A competitive marketing environment where everyone wants to rank highly.

                                                                                                  103

Technical challenges

To ensure that search engines can access your content, you must remove technical barriers.
There are certain best practices that you can use to achieve optimum results.

The key is to make sure that there are direct HTML links to each page you want the search
engines to index. The most important pages should be accessible directly from the homepage
of your website.

The information architecture or, how content is

planned and laid out, has important usability    NOTE  Read more about user experience in
and SEO implications. Users want to find what          Chapter 6: User experience design.

they are looking for quickly and easily, while

website owners want search engine spiders to be able to access and index all applicable pages.

Google consistently points out that it wants users to have a good user experience. Content

relevance, user engagement, and user experience are all crucial to SEO (Martin, 2016).

There are times when user experience and SEO can be at odds with each other but, usually,
usable, accessible websites are search engine-friendly as well.

Another technical challenge to search engines    NOTE  Chapter 7: Web development and design
is Flash. For the most part, search engines            delves more deeply into designing and

are some workarounds, but the best approach

from an SEO perspective is to avoid building

sites or delivering key content using Flash. Instead, use HTML5, which provides similar

interactivity and visuals, while remaining easily crawlable.

    5.3.3 Voice search

       As digital marketers, we must evolve with the times to stay effective. The `no interface trend'
       refers to the way people want new, natural forms of interaction with technology. Consider
       Stephen Sandmann's (2016) observation that, "Speech, gesture, touch and sight: truly intuitive
       technologies are set to transform your customer interactions forever".

       When people think of SEO, they usually think of only the traditional type of SEO, based on
       desktop and mobile Google search. SEO has evolved to be mobile-centric, which now includes
       voice search.

       Many consumers use Google search on their mobile phones to find answers to their everyday
       questions. This means that you can encourage your consumers to engage with your brand
       via voice search-accessed mobile search. The Google app allows a person's voice to access
       mobile Google search results on their smartphones. Google voice search is part of Google
       Assistant in all of the latest Android smartphones and Google Home devices.

       Other voice search tools include Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Facebook's
       Hey Facebook.

Voice searches are usually made through mobile devices because of their on-the-go convenience
factor, which means that the mobile context will generally apply. This has the following
implications:

· User behaviour relating to voice search differs from traditional mobile search. This may
    seem obvious, but you have to make a conscious effort to accommodate voice search in
    your mobile SEO strategy.

· In most cases, voice searches appear in the form of questions, such as, "What movies are
    showing at Brooklyn Mall?"

· Voice-derived search queries are usually longer than the average traditional search query.
· Companies can develop `voice actions' into their applications to take advantage of voice.
These differences should be factored into your content by adding local keywords that are
geographically relevant and by writing content that answers common questions that your
intended audience may ask.

Make sure your website's content is the best at answering popular questions; it may appear
as `Featured Snippets' above the usual search results, which the relevant search engine will
read out.

The future

Google Assistant is incredibly intuitive; it is a Google voice search that has contextual awareness.
When you search using Google Assistant, it scans your phone's screen and recent activities
to help give it context for your search, thereby better answering your query to fill in the gaps
of a vague search request. Google also makes use of a personal index of what you do on your
Android phone as a means of learning more about you.

Siri and other voice search platforms are making major headway in terms of technological
advancements and additional predictive features. Voice search is here to stay and will become
more widely used going forward.

5.4 IMPLEMENTATION

How do you start building your keyword list? It requires a little thought and a fair amount of
research and insight, using tools that are readily available to help you grow and refine your
list of keywords.

5.4.1 SEO and keywords

Keywords are the very foundation of search. When users enter a query on a search engine,
they use the words they think are relevant to the search. The search engine then returns those
pages it has calculated to be most relevant to the words searchers use and, increasingly, the
implied meaning of the search. When you optimise your content around words and phrases
that people search for, your website can rank higher for those terms.

                                                                                                                                    105
        CLAIMING

     Developers of search engines have built a sophisticated understanding of semantics and the
     way in which we use language. So, if a user looks for `car rental,' the search engine will look
     for pages that are relevant to `car rental,' as well as synonyms like `car hire,' `vehicle hire,' and
     so forth. Search engines have also built up knowledge around common misspellings, typos,
     synonyms, and related searches.

     we are tapping into the mental process of
     searchers and putting together the right mix
     of keywords to target.

     There are four things to consider when choosing a keyword:

     1. Search volume: How many searchers             NOTE  If you're researching keywords using

2. Competition: How many other websites out there are targeting that same phrase? For
    example, Google finds over 2 900 000 000 results for `hotel,' but only 640 000 for `Cape
    Town Waterfront Hotel.'

3. Propensity to convert: What is the likelihood that the searcher using that keyword is going
    to convert on your site? A conversion is a desired action taken by the visitor to your website.
    Related to propensity to convert is the relevance of the selected term to what you are offering.
    If you are selling rooms at a hotel at the V&A Waterfront, which of the two terms - `hotel' or
    `Cape Town Waterfront hotel' - do you think will lead to a higher rate of conversions?

4. Value per lead: What is the average value per prospect attracted by the keyword? Depending
    on the nature of your website, the average value per lead varies.

Look at the differences in results based on keywords used. Both show terms used by someone
wanting to book a hotel in Cape Town, but it is expected that someone looking for a luxury hotel
is intending to spend more. That means that this particular lead has a higher value, particularly
if you have a hotel booking website that offers a range of accommodation.

                                                                                                                                    107

     Step-by-step keyword research

       Keyword research helps you to produce a repeatable content process that consistently earns
       traffic over time.
      Step 1: Brainstorm
       · Your primary focus should be on users' needs from all potential aspects and contexts, not

           jamming or stuffing your website content full of certain keywords.
       · Offer users clarity in the form of descriptive content that features relevant vocabulary and

           terminology. Depending on how popular jargon is with the intended audience, avoid jargon
           in some cases.
       · Be mindful of US English and UK English spelling. This can make a difference in terms of
           a word's popularity in search engines.

· What would users unfamiliar with your company name search for when looking for your
    company's product or services? Leave it to Google Ads to target competitors' specific
    keywords, like their names.

· Think about the words you would use to describe your business and about the questions or
    needs of your customers that it fulfils. How would someone ask for what you are offering?
    Consider synonyms and misspellings, as well.
    · Bear in mind that people may not ask for your services using the same words that you
         use to describe them. You may sell `herbal infusions,' whereas people may ask for `herbal
         teas' and some might even request a `tisane.'
    · Even common words are often misspelt and you may need to consider common
         misspellings and typos, for example, `morgage.'

     find you and add those to your list. If they are
     already sending you some traffic, it is worth
     trying to increase that traffic.

     Step 3: Use keyword research tools

     There are several tools available for keyword discovery and some of them are free. Some tools
     will scan your website and suggest keywords based on your current content. Most will let you
     enter keywords and will then return suggestions based on past research data, along with:

     · Similar keywords
     · Common keywords used with that keyword
     · Common misspellings
     · Frequency of the keywords in search queries
     · Industry-related keywords
     · Keywords that are sending traffic to your competitors
     · How many sites are targeting your keywords.

     See 5.8 Tools of the trade for some resources that you can use.

     Bearing in mind the factors that make a good keyword, you need to aim for the right mix of
     keywords. Low-volume terms with low levels of competition may be a good way to get traffic
     in the short term, but don't be scared off by bigger competition in the high-value, high-volume
     areas. It may take longer to get there, but once you do, the revenue can make it worthwhile.

     It is a good idea to create a spreadsheet of the list of keywords, along with additional information
     about each one.

     Table 5.2 A spreadsheet of targeted keywords for reference

     Keyword or     Search  Competition                      Propensity to  Value of lead

     Luxury hotels    345                                          35%

     This will help you to choose the right keywords to target. These lists should be created for the
     whole website and then be broken down for each page you want to optimise.

Optimising content for keywords

Once keywords and phrases are selected, we need to ensure that the site contains content to
target them. You must confirm that the content is properly structured and that it sends relevant
signals. Content is the most important part of your website. Create relevant, targeted content
aimed at your selected keywords. Remember, search engines can recognise context and
implied meaning, so synonyms are important.

Content has several roles to play on your site:  NOTE  Try it now: Pick one of the tools listed in
                                                       Section 5.8 and try a little of your own

· It must engage with them.                            any useful keywords that your favourite
· It must persuade them to do what you want.           brand should be using?

Content must also send signals of relevance to

search engines. You need to use the keywords

on the content page in a way that search engines will pick up and users will understand.

Previously, each web page used to be optimised for a set number of keywords. With the
increasing sophistication of search engines and their semantic awareness, however, pages
are now optimised for themes instead. This means that search engines have moved from
keywords to concept and context. For example, one page might be optimised for car insurance,
with relevant keywords used as required, while another page might be optimised for health
insurance, or household insurance.

Search engines consider context in three ways:

1. User intention: Google tries to match your query to what you are asking rather than the
    individual words used. A search for `book about children stranded on island' gives you Lord
    of the Flies by William Golding as a result, rather than a page with those specific keywords.

Figure 5.4 Google relates concepts to each other
                                                                                                      111
           CLAIMING

      2. Your content: Google reads your pages' keywords to find out what they are about,
           conceptually.

      3. Relating concepts: Google relates concepts to each other, like showing William Golding
           as author of Lord of the Flies and offering results that are related to the book and the story
           of children stranded on an island.

                               Figure 5.5 How Google relates concepts to each other
      While keywords are still useful, focus has shifted from repeatedly using keywords to ensuring
      that each page is about something specific. Even though you should be thinking `customer
      first' rather than exact keywords, these terms are still useful. Here are some guidelines:
112
                                                       Search engine optimisation (SEO)

1. Title tag: Use the keyword in the title and as close to the beginning as possible. Be mindful
    that this needs to offer readers clarity and promote users to click through to your website
    as well.

2. H1 header tag: Use the keyword in the header tag, and as much as possible, in the other
    H tags, as long as it makes sense to do so from a readability perspective.

3. Body content: Use keywords as long as it makes sense in context. Remember to use
    synonyms rather than focusing exclusively on one specific version of a keyword. You should
    aim for as much content as needed in terms of its purpose. Start off with the information that
    is most commonly needed or searched for. Then, add more content to provide additional
    information together with sub-headings to give it needed structure. About 350 words of
    content should be a minimum. Make sure the content is original and insightful with excellent
    flow and structure.

4. Bold: Use <strong> tags around the keyword at least once.
5. URL: Try to use the keyword in your page URL.
6. Meta description: Use it at least once in the meta description of the page, which should

    also entice users to click through to your site from the SERP.
7. Link anchor text: Try to ensure that the keyword is used in the anchor text of the pages

    linking to other pages within your website (internal linking) and third-party websites that
    link to your website. Anchor text provides additional context to search engines and can
    also be included in sitelinks (the additional links seen within a website's search result for
    some search queries).

Optimising media

Images, video, and other digital assets should be optimised with the relevant keywords. Search
engines cannot decipher multimedia content as effectively as text, so they rely on the way that
media is described to determine what it is about. Screen readers read out these descriptions,
which can help visually impaired users make sense of a website. In addition, media such as
images and video are often also shown on the SERPs. Proper optimisation can give a brand
more ownership of the SERP real estate and can be used effectively to target competitive terms.

Ensure that media usage doesn't hinder a website's performance, for example, how quickly a
website page loads. Also, users are mobile data sensitive. Auto-playing website videos are
usually unpopular, especially if users are using the internet at the office or in a public place.

Media should not obstruct users when they visit  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 12:
a website page, for example, a pop-up video            Content creation: Video.
shouldn't cover the whole screen.

Just as rich media can help emphasise the content on a page to a visitor, they can help search
engines to rank pages, provided they are labelled correctly.

                                                                                                    113
     CLAIMING

     Here are some ways to optimise images with keywords for SEO:

     · Use descriptive, keyword-filled filenames.
     · Use specific alt tags and title attributes.
     · Add meta information to the image. Make sure this information is relevant.
     · Use descriptive captions and keep relevant copy close to the corresponding media. For

         example, an image caption and neighbouring text will help to describe the content of the

     image.

     · Make sure that the header tags and images are relevant to each other.

     · Think about what other digital assets you      NOTE  Find out how to optimise your apps in
         have and whether these can be optimised

     in line with your keyword strategy. For                Chapter 16: Direct marketing: Email and

     of optimising your mobile and web apps for the specific web stores, such as Google Play

Use your website and its pages to establish and reinforce themes. Information can always be
arranged in some kind of hierarchical structure. Just as a single page can have a heading and
then be broken down into subheadings, a large website can have main themes that are broken
down into sub-themes. Search engines will see these themes and recognise your website as
one with rich content.

5.4.2 Link popularity

Links are a vital part of how the internet works. The purpose of a link is to allow a user to go
from one web page to another. Search engines, mimicking the behaviour of humans, also
follow links.

Besides allowing search engine spiders to find websites, links are a way of validating relevance
and indicating importance. When one page links to another, it is as if that page is voting or
vouching for the destination page. Generally, the more votes a website receives, the more trusted
it becomes, the more important it is deemed, and the better it will rank on search engines.

Links help send signals of trust. Signals of trust can come only from a third-party source. Few
people will trust someone who says, "Don't worry, you can trust me!" unless someone else,
who is already trusted, says, "Don't worry, I know him well. You can trust him." It is the same
with links and search engines. Trusted sites can transfer trust to unknown sites via links.

Links help to validate relevance. The text that makes up a text link can help validate relevance.
A link such as `Cape Town hotel' sends the message that, "You can trust that the destination
site is relevant to the term `Cape Town hotel.'" If the destination web page has already used
content to send a signal of relevance, the link simply validates that signal.

The parts of a link

Here is an example of the HTML code for a link:

                                            HTML tags: Show where the link starts and ends

<a href="http://www.targeturl.com/targetpage.htm">Anchor Text</ac>

Page that the link leads to (make sure that      Visible text that forms
you are linking to a relevant page in your site  the link: It should contain
and not just the homepage)                       the keyword that you are
                                                 targeting

                                    Figure 5.7 The HTML code for a link
The link sends a signal that the target URL is important for the subject used in the anchor text.

                                                                                                   115
        CLAIMING

     There can be a lot more information included in this anatomy, such as instructions telling the
     search engine not to follow the link, or instructions to the browser on whether the link should
     open in a new window or not.
     <a href="http://www.targeturl.com/targetpage.htm" rel="nofollow" >Anchor Text</a>
     rel="nofollow" can be included in links when you don't want to vouch for the target URL. Search
     engines do not count nofollow links for ranking purposes. This was introduced by Google to
     try to combat comment spam.

     Not all links are created equal

     Of course, not all links are equal. While link volume is the number of links coming to a specific
     page of your site, link authority looks at the value of the links. Some sites are more trusted
     than others. Likewise, some sites are more relevant than others to specific terms. The more
     relevant a site, the more value is transferred by the link.
     It is more important than ever to avoid your website being associated with spammy links of
     any kind. `Quality' links are better than a high `quantity' of `poor-quality' links.
     Well-known and established news sites, government sites (.gov), and university domains (.ac)
     are examples of sites from which links can carry more weighting.
     Sites with higher authority carry more link weight.

     Figure 5.8 Links from universities and government bodies carry more weight

     Search algorithms also consider relationships      NOTE  Discussion: Why are government and
     between linked sites. By analysing various               university websites considered to have
     elements, search engines try to determine                more authority? What sorts of websites
     if the links are natural links, or if they are           would they be likely to link to?
     manipulative, artificial links created solely for
     ranking purposes.

     Manipulated links are worth very little compared to natural links and may even lead to a drop
     in search engine rankings. Penguin, the Google algorithm update that focused on reducing
     spammy links, was released in 2012.

     The search engine algorithm will also determine the relevancy of the referring website to the
     site being linked to. The more relevant the sites are to each other, the better.

     Also keep in mind that linking to valuable, relevant external resources can help to improve
     the visibility of your own site. When you add trustworthy and relevant website links to your
     content, it improves the credibility of your website.

External linking is similar to the way you cite sources in a bibliography for an academic paper;
it shows that you've created your content based on sound research.

How does a website get more links?

With links playing such a vital role in search engine rankings and traffic for a website, everyone
wants more of them. There are certainly dubious means of generating links, most of which
can result in penalties from the search engines. However, here are some ways for ethical and
honest website owners and marketers to go about increasing links to their websites:

Create excellent, valuable content that others want to read
If people find your site useful, they are more likely to link to it. It is not necessary (or possible)
to try to write content that will appeal to the whole of the internet population. Focus on being
the best in your industry and in providing value to the members of that community. Make sure
that valuable content is themed around your keywords.
Create content that relevant, important websites would like to share and link to own their own.
Writing excellent original content is time consuming, so make it work for you.

 Figure 5.9 Ensure that you create remarkable, valuable content that people want to link to

Infographics are visual and graphic representations of data that can encourage lots of traffic
and inbound links. They are a popular type of content that is useful to users.

Create tools and documents that others want to use
Interview experts in your field and host those interviews on your website. Create useful PDF
guides for your industry that people can download from your site. Think outside the box for
quirky, relevant items that people will link to. Calculators are popular tools, and we don't just
mean the ones that add two and two together. For example, a company that offers car finance
can have a calculator so that people get an idea of the costs involved, as well as an easy route

                                                                                                                                    117

     to apply. Wesbank's website includes various calculators, including one that can calculate an
     estimated monthly repayment based on information that a customer inputs. Similarly, Property24
     has a bond calculator that helps potential buyers to estimate their bond repayments over a
     selected number of months.

     Create games
     Creating a game that people want to play is a great way to generate links. Make sure that the
     theme of the game is based on the keywords for your website so that when others talk about
     and link to the game, they are using your keywords.

     Capitalise on software and widgets
     Widgets, browser extensions, and other software that users love to use, all help to generate
     links for a website. For example, the TripAdvisor widget enables hotels, attractions, restaurants,
     destination marketers, and bloggers to add TripAdvisor content, such as reviews, awards, and
     local area attractions to their website. Whitegrass, a popular fine-dining restaurant in Singapore,
     uses widgets for Instagram, Facebook, and TripAdvisor in the bottom-right corner.

        Be creative! The best link-building strategies are those that provide value and automate
        the linking process as much as possible. The easier it is for someone to share your link,
        the more likely they are to do it.

     Competitor analysis

     You can find out who is linking to your competitors, and which non-competing sites are ranking
     highly for your keywords. Use this information to identify sites to target for link requests.

     Until January 2017, using Google search along with the 'link:' command could be used to find
     these links and websites. Now, a better alternative is to use the data in your Google Search

5.4.3 User insights

Search engines want their results to be highly relevant to web users, to make sure that web
users keep returning to the search engine for future searches. And how do you establish what
is relevant to users? By looking at how they use websites, of course!

User data is the most effective way to judge the true relevance and value of a website. For
example, if users arrive on a website and leave immediately, chances are it wasn't relevant
to their query in the first place. However, if a user repeatedly visits a website and spends a
long time there, it is probably extremely relevant. When it comes to search engines, relevant,
valuable sites are promoted, and irrelevant sites are demoted.

How do search engines access this data?

Search engines use cookies to maintain a history of a user's search activity. This will include
keywords used, and websites visited from the search engine. Search engines gather data on
the clickthrough and bounce rates of results.

Site speed, that is, the performance of your website, is one of the contributing factors to ranking
in Google (Dean, 2016). This is becoming increasingly important, especially since Google
switched to a mobile-first indexing in 2020, which prioritises a website's mobile experience
from a Google perspective. Check out Google's PageSpeed tool to help analyse your site's
performance. It will recommend ways to improve your site's speed and mobile-friendliness:
developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/.

You may think your website is mobile-friendly or it has a mobile-friendly version as part of
a responsive website build, but is it genuinely mobile-friendly? Does your website tick all of
the mobile-friendly boxes? For example: How fast does your website load compared to its
competitors? How long do visitors have to wait before they can engage with the site? Are
your images rendering correctly? Is your layout responsive? Think of this: Your website starts
loading in 3 seconds, but the main interactive parts have only loaded 20 seconds later. That's
poor user experience and will certainly increase your bounce rate and therefore limit any
desired customer interaction. It's important to look at the entire user experience from start to
finish and not just at face-value. Remember to prioritise how the underlying mechanics affect it.

In 2021, Google took this a few steps further with the roll out of their use of Core Web Vitals
to influence rankings.

Core Web Vitals are essential to getting it right. But what are they? These are among the
foremost important signs of a webpage that Google can measure in terms of the user experience.
If any are failing, Google will penalise you. You can generally group them into three easy-to-
understand categories:

1. Website loading performance: How long does it take for the website to start loading? Do
    elements load at different intervals?

                                                                                                                                    119
           CLAIMING

       2. Interactivity of the website: How long does someone have to wait before they can interact
           with it fully?

       3. Visual stability of a website: How stable is the website when you are reading/interacting
           with an article? Does the text drop halfway down the screen because something has just
           loaded?

       Initial page load speed might be an obvious one, but delving deeper into all the other elements
       that affect usability and interactivity are often overlooked.

       Lighthouse offers a useful Chrome browser extension tool to measure a website's Core Web
       Vitals and how you can fix any issues, as well: chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/
       blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en.

       Google's AMP project also underlines the importance of site speed for users and thus to
       Google themselves (and therefore, of course, to your SEO). Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)
       essentially simplifies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements to serve stripped-down pages
       containing only the most essential elements to mobile users. This leads to anything from a
       15% to an 85% improvement in site speed (Chung, 2015).

       So, what does this mean for SEO? When it comes to a website, it must:

       · Be valuable enough to attract both visitors and links naturally
       · Retain visitors and make sure they return to the website
       · Convert visitors.

     Social and search

       Social information is playing an ever-increasing role in search. Social content, such as Twitter
       messages or YouTube videos, can appear in the SERPs, and there is a growing indication of
       social influence on search rankings.

       There are four social factors to consider for social and search:

      1. Use social media properties to dominate brand SERPs
       When someone searches for your brand name, you can use your social media properties
       to `own' more of the results on that page, reducing the likelihood that a user will end up on
       a competitor's website instead. Use your brand name when naming Twitter and Instagram
       profiles and Facebook and YouTube pages.

       It is worthwhile mapping out where your brand has a presence and making sure that these
       all align. Not only will this ensure that you can plan to dominate SERPs, but it will also benefit
       your overall brand cohesion. Remember to optimise campaign-specific pages for campaign-

2. Social links as signals of relevance
Links from social sites such as Twitter include 'rel=nofollow.' However, there is a strong indication
that these links are, in fact, followed by search engines, and are used to determine relevance.
If you focus on creating great content on your site and making sure that it is easy to share
socially, you should see results in your SEO efforts.
3. Personalised results influenced by your online social network
If you are logged in to a social network while searching, such as Facebook for Bing or your Gmail
account for Google, you could see results from or influenced by your social circles. In Bing, for
instance, results can include indications of what your friends have previously liked or shared
via Facebook. On Google, you may be more likely to see a friend's blog for relevant searches.
4. Optimisation for social search engines
Google is the biggest search engine world-wide, YouTube is the second largest and Facebook
is growing. Even within social properties, users still depend on search tools and features to
find the content they are looking for. Content that is housed on these properties should be
optimised for the relevant social search engine as well.

Mobile search

As web-enabled mobile devices continue to grow in the market, and become easier to use,
mobile search remains a key growth area. Mobile searches tend to be different to desktop
searches. They are more navigational in nature, as users tend to know where they want to end
up, and users are often looking for concise, actionable answers.
Most online searches are conducted using mobile devices. It is essential that this is as easy
as possible for your potential customer. People search online while they stand in queues, at
their desks at work - no place is sacred!

                                                                                                                                    121
        CLAIMING

     The need for a website that performs well on mobile became crystal clear in 2015, when Google
     made what is called the mobilegeddon update. Following this update, sites that perform well on
     mobile are given higher rankings, while sites that do not perform well on mobile are penalised.

        You can find a good overview of mobile SEO and how to create a website easily accessible
        via mobile here: developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/.

     Mobile search input can also be different from desktop search. As well as typing in search
     keywords, mobile users can search by voice or by using images or scanning barcodes.

           official branded videos in the top positions

     As with mobile web development, mobile SEO

     is a little different from desktop SEO, although  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 7: Web
     the fundamental principles remain the same.             development and design.

     Mobile search engine optimisation is impacted

     by the location of the user, the size of their screen, and the device's operating system. It can be

     frustrating to users if they have to zoom in to read the text, can't click on buttons, or otherwise

     have to struggle to find information on your site. Build usable and accessible sites with great

     content, and you've already come a long way towards a flawless viewing experience.

                                                     Search engine optimisation (SEO)

Differences in approach for mobile SEO are largely because:

· Search engines have the ability to deliver precise location-based results to mobile users
· Usability is critical in sites for mobile devices
· Search engines have less data to work with compared to traditional web in terms of site

    history, traffic, and inbound links.

The fundamentals of mobile SEO are not so      NOTE  Discussion: Why is usability so important
different to those of desktop SEO:                   for mobile SEO?

1. A usable, crawlable site is very important

Build mobile versions of your website that cater for mobile users that prioritises simple navigation
and stripped-down content.

2. Content is important and should be formatted for mobile usage
Text and images should be optimised for the mobile experience, so no large file sizes! Metadata
still matters and titles and descriptions are what users see in the SERPs.

3. Links are important
You should link to your mobile site from your desktop site and vice versa. Submit your mobile
site to relevant mobile directories.

4. Submit a mobile XML sitemap
Mobile-specific sitemaps use the same protocols as standard XML sitemaps, with the addition
of a mobile tag.

5. Use the word `mobile' on the mobile website, or use mobile top-level domains
Make it explicit to search engines that this is the mobile version of your website, and they are
more likely to prioritise it as such.

Local search

Local search refers to search behaviour and results where location matters. Either results
returned are local in nature, or results returned can be map based.

With blended SERPs, map-based results can be returned together with other types of results,
depending on the type of search. As search engines become more sophisticated, location can
be inferred and therefore, influence the types of results.

A user may search for `plumber london,' for example, and the search will know to return results
for London plumbers. These may even be returned on a map.

                                                                                                      123
        CLAIMING

     However, a user in London may search just for `plumber.' The search can infer from the user's IP
     address that the user is in London and still return results for London plumbers, since someone
     searching for this term is likely to be looking for a nearby service. Location is one of a number
     of factors that help Google to provide useful and relevant search results for people, such as
     traffic and weather info.

     Figure 5.12 A Google search for `pizza in Florence' turns up a
           range of location-based results displayed on a map

     For search engines to return location-relevant results, they need to know the location of
     elements being searched. This is often determined from sites that include the name and address
     of a business. Note that this site may not be yours. Location results are often determined from
     various review sites, and the results can include some of those reviews.

     Search engines also allow businesses to `claim'

     their locations. For example, Google's Google        NOTE  Find the Small Business Guide to Google
     My Business function allows small businesses               My Business here: www.simplybusiness.
     to enter their information. These details will then        co.uk/microsites/google-my-business-

     which, once completed, will give them access

     to various page-management and optimisation tools and make them more visible on SERPs.

     Many of the searches people perform on their phones today are location-based; customers are
     looking for businesses around them to meet their needs in that moment. Your brand should
     be right there in the search results.

     5.5 SEO FOR APPS

     App store optimisation provides a similar function for apps as SEO does for websites and
     follows some of the same principles.

     Consider:

     · Is your app relevant for a particular search query?
     · Is it a user-friendly app that doesn't crash often?
     · Does it have great reviews?

     Reviews are a cost-effective way to generate large numbers of organic app downloads and to
     increase the frequency of overall downloads, especially between app-promoting paid media
     campaigns.

     Here are more tips:

     · Make sure your app is always running as                  Google Play Store
         well as it should and that it is delivering on

         its promises.                                          Make sure that your app meets Google's
                                                                latest requirements. Regularly check:
     · Never incentivise users to leave positive                android-developers.googleblog.
         reviews.                                               com/2021/04/updated-guidance-to-
                                                                improve-your-app.html.
     · Follow all necessary guidelines to avoid
         your app being removed from the relevant

     web/app stores.                                      NOTE  Be sure to follow Google Play Store's

     · Make sure to use all available features in               guidelines for your app's store listing:
         your app's web store page listings, from               play.google.com/console/about/
                                                                storelistings/.
         titles to screenshots. Android apps may

     benefit from link-building.                                App Store

     · Be sure to set up `App Indexing' for your                Make sure that you follow Apple's
         Android app, which will increase its visibility        guidelines for your app: developer.apple.

     in Google Search in some instances.                        com/app-store/product-page/.

     · ASO is most beneficial for apps that may
         be searched for by generic, non-brand-specific search queries.

     · ASO doesn't stop with improving an app's visibility. It should also make the best use of
         the improved visibility. So, like any website page, your app store pages must perform their

     required outcomes as best as possible.

     · Ensure that you respond to reviews in a useful manner. Assist users and provide informative,
         helpful information (app titles, short descriptions, long descriptions, promotional text,

     etc.). Include engaging screenshots, an eye-catching app icon, and a video (that meet all

     requirements).

     · Like SEO, with ASO it is essential that you always meet all app/web store guidelines. Be
         sure to stay up to speed on updates from Apple, Google, and other stores when applicable.

5.6 WHAT NOT TO DO

Black hat SEO refers to practices that attempt   NOTE  You can find the latest guidelines for
to game the search engines. If a search engine         webmasters for 2022 here: hevodata.
uncovers a website using unethical practices           com/learn/google-webmaster-
to achieve search engine rankings, it is likely        guidelines/.
to remove that website from its index.

Google publishes guidelines for webmasters, available through Google's Search Central. As
well as outlining best practice principles, Google has supplied the following list of tips:

· Avoid hidden text or hidden links.
· Don't use cloaking or sneaky redirects.
· Don't send automated queries to Google.
· Don't load pages with irrelevant keywords.
· Don't create multiple pages, subdomains, or domains with substantially duplicated content.
· Don't create pages that include malicious behaviours, such as phishing or installing viruses,

    trojans, or other malware.

· Avoid `doorway' pages created just for search engines or other `cookie cutter' approaches,
    such as affiliate programmes with little or no original content. If your site participates in

    an affiliate programme, make sure that your site adds value. Provide unique and relevant

    content that gives users a reason to visit your site first.

· Avoid link farms and focus on attracting quality, valuable links.

The bottom line is this: Design websites for users first and foremost, and don't try to trick the

search engines. It will only be a matter of time before they uncover your black hat techniques.

5.7 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

Optimising a website for search engines should entail optimising the website for users. Done
properly, it should result in a better user experience, while ensuring that search engines index
and rank the website well.

It can be tempting to focus on the technicalities of SEO and to forget that both robots and
humans need to read the same website. One should not be sacrificed for the other.

Search engines update their algorithms regularly. Each update is an attempt to improve search
results, but can result in loss of rankings for some websites, depending on the update. A
contingency plan, such as a pre-prepared search advertising campaign, needs to be in place
to cope with a sudden drop in rankings.

As with any digital marketing practice, SEO should not be the only focus of digital marketing
efforts. It works best when part of a holistic online marketing strategy.

                                                                                                   127
           CLAIMING

          The SEO community is constantly sharing insights about search algorithms. Whenever
          a new one is released, do some research on the best ways to avoid being penalised.

    5.8 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

 5.9 CASE STUDY: THE CONTAINER STORE

   The Container Store group has brick-and-mortar stores, as well as an online store that
   delivers internationally.

  One-line summary

   By working with a company with expertise in SEO and focusing on SEO for their online
   store, The Container Store saw an increase in organic traffic to their website, which helped
   to build an online presence beyond their brick-and-mortar-stores.

                                                                                                                                    129
           CLAIMING

       The problem

          The Container Store has a well-established retail presence; their brick-and-mortar stores
          are very popular in the home organisation space. However, even though The Container
          Store was the only US-based retailer solely focused on home organisation, they did not
          have a particularly impressive ecommerce presence.
          Prior to hiring an SEO manager, The Container Store did not have a content marketing
          strategy, nor did they pay much heed to organic traffic. This meant that they were
          overspending on driving traffic to their website. They needed a solid website development
          and marketing strategy to attract customers.

       The solution

          The Container Store brought in a dedicated SEO to help it grow the ecommerce side
          of the business. The company began working with BrightEdge, an SEO platform, which
          allowed them to strategise and control their web presence.
          The strategy included creating page groups populated with logical keywords and on-page
          recommendations. The SEO team also took a more active role in content management
          to drive traffic to the site, as well as HTML tagging. Additionally, BrightEdge allowed for
          the mapping of backlinks to target new sources of links.

       The results

          A seven-month campaign led to an increase in the authority of the site, as well as:
          · 30% increase in keywords in first rank position
          · 93% increase in traffic
          · 68% increase in conversions.

5.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

Search engine optimisation can be influenced and enhanced by most other digital marketing
campaigns, and they should all be approached with this in mind.

SEO and content marketing go hand in hand, since SEO relies on fresh, relevant, and popular
content, and content marketing can be informed by SEO keywords and insights.

For example, search advertising campaigns can provide valuable keyword research, which can
then be fed into an SEO strategy. Social media marketing can generate an enormous number
of links to a website. Digital PR aims to generate links too, and these can be optimised for
search engines.

User research and web analytics can generate insights into how users find the website, which
can inform SEO strategy, and effective SEO techniques can provide insights into user behaviour.

5.12 SUMMARY

The average website receives a significant proportion of its traffic from search engines, the
gateway to the internet, highlighting the importance of SEO. SEO specialists need to constantly
find ways to extract more value as they are not only competing with competitors' websites but
also Google Ads (paid results). At first glance, to the untrained eye, paid results are increasingly
less distinguishable from organic listings. Also, organic search listings used to have a monopoly
on imagery in some search results. However, Google Ads' image extensions and Shopping
Ads now draw more of users' attention away from organic search results.

There are two types of search results:

1. Organic or natural results
2. Paid results.

SEO aims to improve a website's ranking in the organic results. Search engine optimisation is
a fairly technical practice, but it can easily be broken down into five main areas:

1. A search engine friendly website structure
2. A well-researched list of keywords
3. Content optimised to target those keywords
4. Link popularity
5. User insights.

Growing trends in SEO include the influence of social content on search results, mobile SEO,
and local search. Google is placing more and more emphasis on a mobile-first approach. Start
sketching and prototyping the smallest screen first and work your way up to larger screens.
Essentially, it's about delivering the right user experience to the right device.

                                                                                                                                    131

    5.13 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

       1. Why do links send signals of trust to search engines?
       2. Why is it better to have more niche pages of content than fewer pages that cover a lot of

           content?
       3. How can analysing the links to a competitor's website help aid your own link building

           strategy?
       4. Why is it important for search engines to keep updating their algorithms?

     6.1 INTRODUCTION

     Have you ever visited a website that was confusing, with broken links and long, rambling text?
     Or have you had a web experience that just worked, where everything was clear, easy, and
     enjoyable to use? If so, you've encountered the extremes of user experience design. Excellent
     UX can delight and convert customers. Bad UX can lead to lost revenue and a decrease in
     repeat visitors.

     In practice, great UX can differ based on the audience and context. The principle remains the
     same: make it easy for your users to find what they need and to convert to your desired goal.
     UX is the first, foundational step of an effective digital asset.

6.3 UNDERSTANDING UX DESIGN

User experience (UX) can be defined as all the experiences, physical, sensory, emotional, and
mental, that a person has when interacting with a digital tool.

As illustrated below, online UX can be divided into two broad categories -- functional and creative.
                                                                                                                                    137

     it? Does it work on my mobile phone or on a slow internet connection? Can I use it as a

     disabled person?

     3. Desirability: Do I want to use it? Is it a pleasant experience, or do I dread logging in?

     4. Usability: Is it easy to use? Are the tools I need intuitive, and easy to find?

     5. Credibility: Do I trust it? Is this website legitimate?

     6. Usefulness: Does it add value to me? Will I get something out of the time I spend interacting

     with it?

     6.3.1 The benefits of UX

     There are some real, tangible benefits to applying UX design to digital marketing strategies.

     Good UX is an excellent way to differentiate your brand in the market and give yourself a
     competitive advantage. If your online touchpoints are easy, intuitive and awesome to use, your
     customers won't have any reason to look elsewhere.

     Good UX research and design allows you to find the best solution for your needs.

     Every business, website and online service is unique in some way, which means that the way
     it is constructed, must be unique too.

     Amazon's $300 million button is perhaps the most dramatic example of how a simple UX
     fix can impact the business. Amazon managed to gain an extra US$300 million worth of
     sales simply by changing their `Register' button to one that read `Continue' instead. The
     number of customers increased by 45% because they no longer felt they needed to go
     through an onerous registration process simply to fulfil a basic shopping action. In fact,
     nothing else about the purchase process had changed (Spool, 2009)!

                                                       User experience design 

Every marketer knows that the ideal customer is a happy customer. Customers who love the
experience you give them will become loyal clients, and possibly brand evangelists.

Applying UX principles allows you to get your digital tools working earlier, with much better
functionality, at a lower cost. You can cut out features and elements that you simply don't need
and focus on the core user experience. This optimised development process in turn leads to
sites that are easier and cheaper to maintain, upgrade, and support across multiple platforms.

6.4 CORE PRINCIPLES OF UX DESIGN

UX should make using your website simple. However, that does not mean that it's simple to
design a site that offers an excellent user experience. There are a few core principles that you
can consider.

6.4.1 User-centric design

While this may seem like the most obvious point, it's surprising how often the user is forgotten
in the user experience. Business owners, marketers, and web developers frequently focus
on creating the web platforms they want and think are best, instead of really interrogating
what the user needs. When the design process is driven only by internal business needs, the
performance of the web assets is compromised. Making sure that each department has a
space that it controls, often comes at the expense of what the user needs.

When designing for the user, you need to ask the following questions:

· Who is the user?                               NOTE  The customer journey is introduced in
· What are the user's wants and needs from             Chapter 4: Strategy. It refers to the steps
                                                       your customer takes when engaging
    your platform?                                     with your brand.

· Why is the user really coming to your
    website?

· Where is the user most likely to be in their
    customer journey when they visit your site?

· What are the user's capabilities, web skills, and available technology?
· How can the site facilitate the customer journey to conversion and purchase?
· What features would make the user's experience easier and better?

The answers to these questions will come out of user research, as discussed in Chapter 3:
Market research.

Of course, many users may not know exactly what their wants and needs are. It is the UX
practitioner's job to discover these through research and interpret them in the best way possible.
Keep Henry Ford's famous quote in mind here: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they
would have said faster horses."

     Mobile users

       When discussing user-centric design, whatever you have learned about the user context
       must be considered. Today more than half of web traffic originates from a mobile device, with
       users accessing the internet through either a smartphone or tablet (Think with Google, 2016).
       In 2021, the number of unique mobile internet users stood at 4.32 billion, indicating that over
       90% of the global internet population use a mobile device to go online. Therefore, designing
       for mobile must be a priority.

       The context of mobile users affects the way in which they use their devices. Mobile users are:

       · Goal orientated: Mobile users turn to their mobile devices to answer a question, quickly
           check email, find information, or get directions. They often have a distinct purpose in mind
           when using their phone.

       · Time conscious: There are two aspects to this. On the one hand, mobile users are often
           looking for urgent or time-sensitive information such as the address of the restaurant they
           are looking for, so answers should be available as quickly as possible. On the other hand,
           the mobile device is also frequently used to kill time or as a source of entertainment such
           as reading articles on the couch, or playing games while waiting in a queue, so content is
           also crucial. User research will tell you which of these groups your users fall into and how
           you need to structure your site accordingly.

       · Search dominant: Even users who know what they are looking for tend to navigate there
           via search, for example, typing the brand name into Google, rather than accessing the page
           from a bookmark or typing the URL directly into the browser bar.

· Locally focused: According to Google             NOTE  Some mobile users use their phones
    search data 30% of all mobile searches are           for browsing in a similar way one would
    for location (Think with Google, 2016). Since        use a desktop computer. How does your
    mobile phones are always carried, users              audience use their devices?
    turn to them to find information about things

in their surroundings, from local businesses

to more detail on a product they have just seen.

Usability is especially challenging with mobile. One of the biggest challenges is the sheer number
of different device categories and models available. The OpenSignal report from 2015 identified 24
000 distinct android mobile devices, running a myriad of operating systems (OpenSignal, 2015).

The limitations of mobile create additional considerations for the UX designer to address in
order to ensure that visitors have a pleasant user experience while visiting the site. These
limitations include:

· Small screens: Even the largest smartphones have screens many times smaller than a
    standard laptop, and tablets fall somewhere between the two. This means that the user

has a much smaller window through which to perceive and understand the website, so it

may be difficult to get an overall impression of where things are or what's important. It is

important to consider all devices when thinking about the design of your website or app.

· Difficult inputs: Mobile phones don't                  One design approach puts `content
    come with full-sized keyboards and mice,             first.' This means that you should decide

    so they are usually a lot more difficult to

operate fluidly and accurately than desktop        NOTE  which content to provide on your site

    their own pitfalls.                                  and then adapt the layout and material
· Slow connection speeds: Many mobile                    to that device.
    phone users, especially in developing

countries, are on slow internet connections. Even fast options such as 4G can often be

more sluggish than a desktop equivalent. This makes loading large websites or images

slow and frustrating and can be expensive in terms of data costs.

· Slow hardware: Sometimes the slowness comes from the hardware itself. The more basic
    the phone, the slower its processing components are likely to be, making the simple act

of opening the browser and loading a page time consuming.

There are three main approaches to creating

mobile-accessible content.                         NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 7: Web

     6.4.2 Usability and conventions

     Usability is about making the digital assets we build easy and intuitive to use. To paraphrase
     Steve Krug, don't make your users think: they should just do (Krug, 1997-2013).

     One of the most important aspects of usability involves sticking to conventions, which are simply
     common rules or ways of displaying or structuring things on the web. Study Figure 6.3 below.

     to building a user-friendly and usable website:

     · Never resize windows or launch the site in a pop-up.
     · Don't use entry or splash pages (splash pages are pages that site visitors encounter first

         before reaching the homepage).

     · Never build a site entirely in Flash. While Flash can be optimised for search engines, the
         process is far more demanding than for an HTML site and is not recommended as best

         practice. Unaided, most search engine spiders cannot effectively crawl Flash sites, and will

         not work on many mobile devices.

     · Don't distract users with `Christmas trees,' such as blinking images, flashing lights, automatic
         sound, scrolling text, and unusual fonts.

     And finally, while the following principles apply to desktop as well, they are especially valid
     for mobile:

6.4.3 Simplicity

In UX projects, the simpler option is almost always the more user-friendly one. Even if your
service or product is complex, your customer-facing web portals need not be. In fact, it's
important to remember that most customers want the most basic information from you, such
as "What is this?" and "How does it work?" 14 3
CLAIMING

Simplicity can mean several things:

Lots of empty space: In design terms, this is referred to as negative or white space. Of course,
it need not specifically be white. Dark text on a light background is easiest to read. In general,
the more effectively `breathing room' is placed between various page elements, lines of text,
and zones of the page, the easier it is for the user to grasp where everything is.

Fewer options: Studies have found that people faced with fewer choices generally choose
more quickly and confidently, and are more satisfied with their decision afterwards (Roller, 2010).

Plain language: Unless your website is aimed

at a highly specialised technical field, there's  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 11:

usually no need to get fancy with the words you         Content creation: Copy.

use. Clear, simple, well-structured language is

the best option when creating a great user experience.

Sticking to conventions: As we've said before, conventions are excellent shortcuts for keeping
things simple for users. There's no need to reinvent the wheel and try to teach your users a
whole new way of navigating a website.

               Figure 6.5 The FreshBooks homepage is clean, simple, inviting, and easy to use

       When it comes to mobile, it's even more important to simplify. Show information only when
       it's needed. While you should ensure that the mobile asset provides all the same information
       as the desktop equivalent, this doesn't need to be presented in the same format or volume.

    6.4.4 Credibility

       Credibility refers to how trustworthy and legitimate something looks, and is a big consideration
       for web users deciding whether to use your website or not. Here are some of the cues that
       visitors use to determine the credibility of a website:
144
                                                                                                        User experience design 

· Looks: Does it look professional and beautiful?
· Prominent, easy-to-locate phone numbers and addresses: This assures the visitor that

    there are real people behind the website, and that they are easily reachable.
· Informative and personal `About us': Some customers want to see the inner workings of

    a company and are interested in the head honchos. Consider including employee pictures
    and profiles to add personality to the site.
· Genuine testimonials: Testimonials are a great way to show potential customers what your
    current customers have to say about your organisation. Trust is vital, and this is one way
    to encourage it. Video testimonials can be particularly effective, assuming your audience
    does not face data restrictions.

            Figure 6.6 Genuine user testimonials can create a sense of credibility, like
                 this example from Xero which includes text and video testimonials

· eCommerce: Using a reputable sales channel helps your website's credibility.
· Social media: Having a social media presence often goes further towards establishing

    credibility than testimonials, which could have been faked.
· Logos of associations and awards: If you belong to any relevant industry associations or

    have won any awards, feature them. Not only does this go a long way towards establishing
    your credibility; it will show that you're at the top of your game, a notch above the competition.
· Links to credible third-party references or endorsements: This is a way to assert your
    credibility without tooting your own horn.
· Fresh, up-to-date content: A news section that was last updated a year ago implies that
    nothing has happened since or that no one cares enough to update it.
· No errors: Spelling and grammar mistakes are unprofessional, and while the large majority
    of readers may not pick them up, the one or two who do will question your credibility. This
    extends to broken links, malfunctioning tools, and interactive elements that don't work as
    advertised.

                                                                                                                                    145

    6.5 IMPLEMENTING UX DESIGN

       The UX design process happens before, during, and after the website is being built. It ties in
       very closely with strategy and research, web development and design, SEO, content strategy
       and creation, and later conversion optimisation.
       As discussed in 6.4: Core principles of UX design, mobile should not be an afterthought in UX
       or any other digital endeavour. It should be prioritised in strategy, design, and implementation.
       The `mobile first' movement supports this notion, and aims to create mobile user experiences
       first, and then adapt these for the web (instead of the other way around). Designing this way
       has many advantages, since the principles of good mobile UX works just as well on full sites
       using simple designs, linear interfaces, and clear buttons and features.

    6.5.1 Conduct research and discovery

       Step one involves conducting detailed research on the business, the users, and the technology
       involved. This is covered fully in Chapter 3: Market research which includes user research.
       Doing this lets UX practitioners know exactly what they need to do to address the needs of the
       business and audience. This will generate a lot of data that needs to be filtered and organised.

    6.5.2 Create the site's basic structure

       Information architecture (IA) is about managing information, taking a lot of raw data, and
       applying tools and techniques to it to make it manageable and usable. Categories and pages
       should flow from broad to narrow. An intuitively designed structure will guide the user to the
       site's goals.
       IA operates on both the micro and the macro level, covering everything from the way individual
       pages are laid out, for example where the navigation and headings are, to the way entire
       websites are put together.
       Most websites have a hierarchical structure, which means there are broad, important pages
       at the top, and narrower, more specific and less important pages further down. Hierarchical
       structures can be very broad and shallow having many main sections with few lower pages
       or very narrow and deep, with few main sections and many pages below. It's up to the UX
       practitioner to find the right balance of breadth and depth.

                      Figure 6.7 A broad, shallow hierarchy on the left,
                           and a narrow, deep hierarchy on the right

6.5.3 Analyse content

If you're working on a website that already exists, it will be populated with a wide variety
of content. In this case, you need to perform a content audit, which is an examination and
evaluation of the existing material.

If the website is new, or if you plan to add new content to an existing website, you need to put
together a content strategy. This is a plan that outlines what content is needed and when and
how it will be created. There's no single template or model for this, so every content strategy
will be unique.

The content strategy is largely the responsibility of the strategy, copy, and concept teams,
but the UX practitioner needs to get involved in a few key roles. The points that UX needs to
address are:

What the site should achieve: Naturally, the content should work towards achieving the
objectives of both the site and the business.

What the user wants and needs: By conducting thorough user research you should be able
to answer this question. Provide only content that will add real value to the user.

What makes the content unique, valuable, or different: Content needs to provide value to
the user. A content strategy will help ensure content is updated regularly and will include
up-to-date information.

The tone and language used: You need to

consider the tone, whether it's fun, light, or     NOTE  Don't forget SEO! There are lots of ways

other content types. Correct grammar and

spelling are important considerations as they speak to the credibility of the site.

6.5.4 Principles of creating content

There are three key points you should consider here:

1. Structure

Content needs to be written so that users can find the information they need as quickly as
possible. Chapter 10: Planning your content will cover this in more detail. Copy can be made
more easily readable by:

                                                                                                   147
           CLAIMING

       · Highlighting or bolding key phrases and words
       · Using bulleted lists
       · Using paragraphs to break up information
       · Using descriptive and distinct headings.
      2. Hierarchy
       On the page, use an inverted pyramid style or F structure for your copy. The important information
       should be at the top of the page to make for easy visual scanning. The heading comes first and
       is the largest and boldest type on the page. The subheading or blurb follows this, and then the
       content is presented in a descending scale of importance. Sentences should be short, and
       important words should appear early in the sentence, especially in bullet points. Eye-tracking
       research has shown that the F structure is still the most user-friendly structure, as this is the
       natural flow of the eye (Hanes, 2016).

              Figure 6.8 Users read websites in an F structure, and your site should enable this
      3. Relevance
       Above all, the content on the page must be relevant to the user and the purpose of the page
       itself. If a user clicks to read about a product but ends up on a page with content about the
       company, their experience is going to be tarnished.

    6.5.5 Create a sitemap

       In UX terminology, a sitemap is the visualised structural plan for how the website's pages will be
       laid out and organised. The sitemap provides a high-level view of the entire site, including how
       pages are linked, and the titles of each page. The sitemap allows the webmaster to determine
       whether any pages are missing or can be deleted, and how the site has come together.

            Figure 6.9 An example of a sitemap

To create the visuals for your sitemap, you can follow this process:

1. Define your homepage. This should be the top item in the hierarchy.
2. Place the main navigation items below the homepage.
3. Arrange your pages of content below the main navigational items, according to the results

    of your user testing and insight and your information architecture structure.
4. Add pages below this until you have placed all your content. Make sure that every page is

    accessible from at least one other page. It may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how
    often this is overlooked!
5. Define any other navigation elements (i.e. the footer, sidebar, header navigation, and
    search tools). Place these in your diagram in a logical place, possibly branching off directly
    from the homepage, or as separate blocks.

Which sitemap is which?

The term `sitemap' can have two meanings. One is the way it's defined above - the
structural plan of the website. The other is a page on your website that lists all the pages
available in a logical and accessible way. An example is the Apple website's sitemap: apple.
com/sitemap. This sitemap should be available from every page. Dynamic sitemaps can
be employed so that it is updated automatically as information is added to the website.
Different sitemaps exist for different purposes, so investigate what your users would find
most useful.

                                                                                                                                149

     6.5.6 Build the navigation

     The navigation should guide users easily through all the pages of a website; it is not just about
     menus. Successful navigation should help a user to answer four basic questions, such as where
     am I, how did I get here, where can I go next, and How do I get home?

     1. Where am I?
     Navigation should let the users know where they are in the site. Breadcrumb links, clear page
     titles, URLs, and menu changes all help to show the user where they are. The larger your site
     is and the more levels it has, the more important it becomes to give your users an indicator
     of where they are in relation to everything else on the site. This helps the users to understand
     the content of the page that they are on, and makes them feel more confident in navigating
     further through the site.

     Figure 6.10 Google's search results have clear navigation options

     2. How did I get here?
     Breadcrumb navigation often indicates the general path a user may have taken. In the case of
     site search, the keyword used should be indicated on the results page.

     3. Where can I go next?
     Navigation clues let a user know where to go to next, such as `Add to cart' on an ecommerce site
     or a contextual link that indicates `Read more.' The key is making the options clear to the user.

     4. How do I get home?                           NOTE  There is a tendency, when thinking

Each of these typically contains certain types of elements and content, such as:

· Logo or identifying mark (possibly including the brand's tagline)

· Main navigation

· Login feature

· Search bar.

more (This can be broken into several

columns.)

· CTAs of various kinds, such as `Sign up'; `Get started'; `Claim your free trial.'

3. The sidebar (either on the left or the right, or sometimes on both sides): Used to present

    secondary content and tools:

    · Secondary navigation bar or other navigation features (i.e., blog article archive by date)
    · CTAs, including buttons and signup forms
    · Additional content, like links or snippets.

4. The footer (at the bottom of the page): Used for important but non prominent content
    and resources:
    · Legal information, privacy policy, and disclaimers
    · Additional navigation elements.

The most important consideration for any page layout is the content: what needs to be included,
what is the most important action or piece of information, and how can this be structured to
meet the user's needs? After all, web pages are created to support a user's journey. All pages
on your site should not necessarily look identical.

                                                                                                  151

     Creating sketches, wireframes, and prototypes

       Wireframes are the skeletal outlines of the layout of a web page. Their purpose is to map out
       the placement of various elements on the page as a guide for the designer to create the visual
       design and the web developer to create the code and interactivity required. Wireframes can be
       low fidelity (very rough and basic sketches, barely resembling the final output) or high fidelity
       (very detailed, complex layouts including creative elements). Any website project will have
       several wireframes, at least one for each template page. Capture your first ideas on paper; it's
       the fastest and best way to capture good ideas.

                                 Figure 6.12 Low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes
       Prototypes are a step up from wireframes, in that they are interactive. Prototypes are essentially
       sets of wireframes that have been linked together like a website, so that they can be navigated
       through by clicking and scrolling.

Prototypes are excellent tools for testing the flow and function of a proposed website before
diving into the costly and lengthy design and development phases. They can save a lot of time,
money, and effort by helping to identify problems and improvements upfront. Again, paper
prototyping is the best method for fast, iterative UX design.

6.5.8 Assemble the other elements

Once you've defined your content and mapped out the basic layout of each page, you need
to add all the extra elements that your website will need. Remember that the page should only
ever contain the elements a user might need to support them in their task. These can include:

Calls to action

Successful CTAs are simple, quick, clear actions that don't require the user to make a commitment
or to do anything they may feel unsure about. They should always do exactly what they state in
order to instil confidence and clarity. It's all about managing user expectations: Do they actually
go where they think they will? Do they perform the action that users expect?

Positioning
The primary CTA should usually appear above the fold to capture the attention focused here.
Other CTAs can appear below the fold, and the main CTA can also be repeated lower down.

Prioritisation
A single web page can be built around one CTA or could incorporate a wide range of possible
desirable actions. This all comes down to what the overall page and website seek to achieve,
based on the business requirements.

When multiple CTAs are used, there should be one primary action that stands out strongly
and the others should be more muted, playing a supporting role. CTAs can be differentiated
through colour, shape, placement, and size; the fewer choices, the better.

                                                                                                     153

                         `Start your free trial' and a secondary `Get started' in the top right

      Clickability
       Any CTAs that can be clicked must look tactile or touchable. This means they must stand out
       somehow from the background and from static elements. One approach is to make the button
       look like a real button, standing out from its environment. Another train of thought advocates
       for the flat design approach as a more elegant and modern strategy.

       Finally, be sure not to overwhelm users with too many choices. Stick to one central CTA per
       page, making it obvious to users what the main goal, action, or outcome of the page is.

     Forms

       Forms are extremely useful tools for gathering user information and encouraging interaction
       on the site. Users are generally familiar with them and have some experience filling them out,
       and there are lots of web conventions that govern how these should be set up. As a general
       rule, the shorter you make your form, the better. The fewer fields users have to fill out, the more
       likely they are to complete the process.

Steps and sections

Simple forms with only a few fields can be assembled as a series of boxes. For forms that
are longer, for example, those in ecommerce checkouts or complex registration processes, it
makes sense to split them up into manageable portions. Manage users' expectations by clearly
indicating what the next step is.

Relevance

Simplicity is a key consideration, forms should be as short and clear as possible. The effort
must be equal to the reward gained. All of the fields included must be clearly relevant to the
purpose of the form, otherwise users may get confused or suspect that you are harvesting
their information.

It is important that users are notified about       NOTE  Be aware of local laws that define what
which fields are required and which are                   information you're allowed to collect and
optional. If all the fields are required, then the        how you can use it.
form should indicate this clearly.

Assistance
It is a good idea to include help for users filling out forms. This is especially the case where a
specific field requires inputs to be entered in a certain way and doubly so for password fields
with special rules. Users will not instinctively know the rules associated with specific fields,
so you must provide plenty of guidance along the way.

A form should be well designed and intuitive rather than provide tips and text to users on how
to complete it. Ideally, users shouldn't need any help at all.

            moving the label text from being a placeholder to hovering above the field

Validation
Validation means giving the user feedback on the inputs they have submitted, whether correct
or incorrect. Validation can happen at two points, after the user has submitted the form, which is
submission validation, or during the process of filling out the form, which is live inline validation.
Submission validation is essential for protecting the database, but will also assist in catching

                                                                                                        155

       user errors. Live inline validation usually results in much better user experiences as the users
       then know that their information is correct before submitting the form.

       Error messages are an important part of validation that is shown to users. Error messages are
       often ignored in UX development and are a huge source of frustration for users.
       Some best practices to consider:
       · These messages should be easy to understand, meaning the user should not struggle to

           understand the error or how to fix it.
       · The error message should stay visible until the error has been corrected.
       · The tone of the message should match the rest of the site.
       · It is important to remember that a form is a conversation with users. It's an interactive

           dialogue even though you are not present.
      reCAPTCHA
       reCAPTCHA is a free service offered by Google that requires users to answer questions to
       prove they are not bots. It helps to protect websites from spam and abuse but does reduce
       conversions, and in certain instances, can render the site unusable for users. Despite these
       accessibility issues, reCAPTCHA is still an important factor when developing forms in order
       to protect your website.

Search

Search has three useful functions on a website. Not only does it help users to find specific
things, it also serves as an essential navigation aid for larger sites and collects valuable
data from keyword research about what the user is looking for. From the UX practitioner's
perspective, there are some important non-technical principles to bear in mind.
For large sites, it can be useful to allow users to search within categories. On Amazon, for
example, you can search just within the category `books.'

                  Figure 6.18 The advanced search within `Books' on Amazon.com
                                                                                                                                    157
     CLAIMING

     Positioning
     Search will either be the primary starting point for your site, or it will be a useful additional
     tool. In the former case, for example, on a large eCommerce site such as Amazon, the search
     tool should be positioned centrally and visibly to encourage the user to use this as the main
     navigational tool. In the latter case, best practice dictates that it should be in the top-right
     corner or easily accessible in the sidebar.

     Accuracy
     The better you can interpret what your user is searching for, the more relevant and accurate
     the search results can be. Google works very hard to fine-tune its search algorithm to ensure
     that users don't just get what they searched for, but what they actually wanted in the first place.

     User research can suggest why they would search your site, and what they would typically be
     looking for. Popularity and recentness of content are other key considerations.

     Results
     When it comes to displaying search results, there are a few key questions to ask:

     Questions                              Answers

     How many results should be             Ten to 20 results per page is generally a good

     What order should results              This will depend on the nature of the site.
     be in? Most popular first?
     Cheapest? Newest? Closest match?       Some websites allow users to do a second search
                                            constrained to the results of the first one.
     Can results be filtered?
                                            If no search results are found, the search function
     What happens if there are no results?  should provide hints and tips to the user on how to
                                            navigate better on the site. The fact that there are no
                                            results should be stated clearly, followed by a list of
                                            the closest match of content to the search query. It's
                                            quite possible the user didn't know the exact term for
                                            what they were looking for or made a typo, though the
                                            site should be forgiving of these. Hints could include
                                            wildcards or breaking up the terms into smaller pieces.
                                            The message shown to users should be helpful and
                                            relevant, and not simply copied from Google's advice.

Before users interact with your carefully

considered content, your excellent navigation   NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 7: Web
structure and slick search bar, their first           development and design.

impression comes from the look of the website,

such as the colours, graphics, and overall design elements. As people are spending more

and more time on the web, they are less tolerant of websites that don't look good or credible.

While a website is not an art installation, it is a design project, and the fundamentals of good

design apply.

While much of the visual design expertise will come from the graphic designer, it's valuable
for the UX practitioner to know the following principles of visual design:

Colour

Colour has an incredible psychological effect on people. Based on our culture, preferences,
and learned cues, people interpret colours in very specific ways. This can be used to inform
and steer user experience.

When choosing the colour palette for your website, be aware of legibility and accessibility
concerns. Using a lot of open or white space often makes sites appear simple and easy to read.

    upfront and uses colour to draw the eye to the important buttons/forms

                                                                                                                          159
     CLAIMING

     Imagery

     The choice of images used on the website can have a massive effect on how users behave and
     interact on the page. You can never be quite certain which images will have the best results,
     so this is one area where you will need to do a lot of testing (See 6.7 Conduct testing below).

     Humans tend to gravitate towards and identify with pictures of other humans. Content strategy
     should include an image strategy, especially if the site is rich in images. Camera angles, content,
     brand strategy, and the tone of the visuals all need to be considered. Images must always be
     relevant and not used as fillers or pure decoration.

     6.6 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF UX DESIGN

     Ensuring you adhere to all the principles of UX design can be costly and time consuming. Testing
     each development or aspect of the site can be very drawn out. However, the advantages that
     UX provides far outweigh the costs.

     Good UX means users will have a pleasurable experience on your site. In turn they are more
     likely to return and recommend your site, ultimately leading to sales that help meet your
     business objectives. Poor UX means users have negative and disappointing experiences; they
     may not return and may relate their negative feedback to others, which in turn can result in
     the loss of potential sales.

     Including UX from the beginning helps to keep costs low and on budget. It is estimated that for
     every US $1 spent in the initial phases to improve UX, it costs US $10 to fix during development
     and upwards of US $100 to fix after the product is released (Gray, 2016).

     6.7 CONDUCT TESTING

     Measuring how successful your UX has been cannot be left until the final website is complete
     and ready for launch. The key to an effective user-friendly site is testing each step of the way
     during the design, development, and implementation process. User testing is crucial to UX.

     User testing means giving one or more users access to a website or prototype and observing
     how they behave when using it. The purpose of this is to discover problems and gain insights
     that can be used to improve the final product.

     The goal of user testing is not to eliminate     NOTE  In the real world, time and budget
     every potential problem on a website; that's           limitations will certainly have an impact
     simply not possible, especially if you consider        on how much you can test, but the goal

The two biggest questions around testing tend to be "What do I test?" and "When do I test it?"
The answers are simple: Test as much as possible, as often as possible, and as early as possible.

      6.9 CASE STUDY: TINDER

          Tinder is arguably the most popular dating app in the world,
          with 75 million monthly active users in 2020 (Iqbal, 2022).

       One-line summary

          In order to make using the app effortless and fun, the developers of Tinder focused on
          the user experience as much as the outcome, resulting in the `swipe right' action that has
          become synonymous with Tinder.

       The problem

          Generally speaking, dating websites were tedious for users, who had to spend a lot of
          time creating long profiles. These dating sites were also complicated and stigmatised. The
          developers were interested in creating a simple app design that was `sticky,' engaging,
          intuitive, and fun but also simple to use with a quick onboarding process.

       The solution

          Tinder is famous for the `Swipe Right'® concept. If a user likes what they see, they swipe
          right. If the person they have swiped right on has also swiped right, there is a `match' and
          the users are given the option to message one another (in-app messaging).
          This simple user experience has resulted in high levels of engagement for the app.

This was not the only UX design decision made by the team. Further UX successes include
the following:
· A simple registration process

              Figure 6.21 The registration process on Tinder is simple and quick
· Card stack/panel design, which is employed for many of the actions on the app

    (including the registration process shown above). This means that users are focused
    on one action at a time, rather than having multiple actions or decisions to make at
    once (the way they might when using a dating website).
· In-app gestures that are simple and intuitive.

The results

Jonathan Badeen, co-founder of Tinder, had the following to say about their motivation
to create Tinder:

   After school ends, your non-digital social network begins to shrink and it becomes
   really hard to meet new people - especially outside of a work environment. I think this
   was really one of the largest motivators for us. Helping people meet was our priority.
   Many of the choices we made were driven by the need to make that experience easy
   and enjoyable instead of frightening.
The mark of a dating app's success is two-fold: engagement and results. According to
Tinder, their average active users log in four times a day. They also say that 1.5 million
Tinder users go on dates every week.

                                                                                                                                 163

           app space?

    6.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       UX touches on so many aspects of digital marketing that it's hard to list them all. It's involved
       right up front at the strategy and research phase and then touches on all the create disciplines,
       such as web development, design, copywriting, and SEO. For example, when it comes to SEO,
       Google's algorithm assesses the UX design on a website as part of the overall decision on
       where to rank it.

Social media, email marketing, display advertising, video marketing, and other fields can also
benefit from solid UX thinking, such as "What do users want, need and expect from you on
these channels?" Finally, UX goes hand in hand with web analytics data as both disciplines aim
to understand users and create real, actionable insights from the data gathered about them.

6.12 SUMMARY

Users come first when creating any web-based marketing channels. Core UX principles, such
as user-centric design, web conventions, simplicity, and credibility, are essential for creating
web experiences that are seamless, memorable, and valuable to users.

Mobile UX is a special subset of the discipline that takes the unique context and characteristics
of mobile users into account, whether for designing a mobi site, an app, or a responsive website.
When it comes to implementing a UX process, the following steps should be followed:

1. Identify business requirements: What does the business need to get out of the site?
2. Conduct user research: Who are you building the site for, and why? What information do

    they need? How will they move through the site? Does the user need this?
3. Create the basic structure: What goes into solid information architecture?
4. Analyse and plan content: How should content be put together here?
5. Design the sitemap: How will the overall website be structured?
6. Build and develop the navigation: How will users get to where they need to go?
7. Create the layout: What will each page look like, from top to bottom? Does the layout

    support the functional purpose of the website? What content is needed for this page to
    achieve its business goals?
8. Add other useful elements: How will CTAs, search tools, and forms behave? Where will
    they be best placed to achieve the business goals?
9. Conceptualise the visual design: How will the visual layer add to the overall UX impact?
10. Conduct user testing: Are there any errors on the site, and is it easy to use? Testing should
    be done at each step in the UX process. The earlier errors or difficulties in the UX are picked
    up, the more cost effective it is to correct and change.

6.13 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

1. Provide a succinct explanation of UX and its purpose.
2. What are the six qualities that make up a good user experience?
3. Are there any mobile-specific issues that UX designers should keep in mind? What growing

    trend should UX designers keep in mind when designing any user experience?
4. Explain why testing is so important with UX.
5. List at least three things that can ruin a website's UX experience.

                                                                                                                                    165

     7.1 INTRODUCTION

     Websites are, in many ways, at the heart of successful digital marketing. They are your home
     on the web, a shop window over which you have full control, and often the first place people
     go to find out more about you.

     Web development and design applies to more than just websites. The principles can be used
     for any digital assets you create, from mobile platforms to social media profiles.

     Creating online assets involves three key          NOTE  Unlike social media properties, your
     processes: planning and design, which create             website is not subject to changes in
     the appearance, layout, and style that users see,        policy, and content remains easily
     and development, which brings this imagery               accessible regardless of its age.
     to life as a functioning web tool.

     The fundamental principle of good development and design is to understand your users, since
     they are the people who will actually be accessing and interacting with your website. What are
     they looking for? What are their objectives? Your offering must have user experience central
     to the process.

7.3 WEB DESIGN

Web design is the process of creating all the visual aspects of the interface. This covers the
layout, colour scheme, images, logos, type, design elements (such as buttons and links), and
anything else that you can see.

The web is a visual medium, so design is an important part of creating assets that are both
engaging and effective. Designers need to keep in mind the technical aspects of design while
prioritising the human factor. Digital properties shouldn't only look beautiful. They need to
create a good experience for the visitor and meet business objectives, such as increasing
sales, creating brand ambassadors, and encouraging sign-ups, and encouraging sign-ups
that ultimately result in conversions.

7.3.1 Visual identity and designing for persuasion

The visual interface, or the design of a website, is what users see and interact with. It's the
visual representation of all the hard work that goes into developing a website. It's what the
site will be judged by first, and is the initial step in creating a delightful user experience. The
interface matters. A lot.

There is a close relationship between UX and UI. Ideally the UI designer will use the documents
created by the UX designer and add the visual skin, but often the designer has to manage both
UX design and visual design.

Design is not just about aesthetics, although looks are very important. Design is about the
visual clues we give users so that they know what to do next. It assures web visitors of our
credibility and turns them into customers.

The visual designer plays a key role in defining good interface design, which involves many
things closely linked to UX. Here are a few basic considerations:

· Navigation: The signage of the site, indicating to users where they are and where they can go.
· Layout: How content is structured and displayed.
· Headers: The element with a fixed position at the top of every page; this usually includes

    all primary navigation items that need to be presented on every page, such as main menu,
    login and search.
· Footers: The usually consistent bottom part of the page.

     Visual identity

     The visual identity answers the question, "How do users know it's us?" Certain design elements
     should be carried through on all web assets created for a brand, as well as print and traditional
     communication media. Often, the visual identity guidelines for the web are codified into a
     digital style guide document to ensure consistency across different agencies, designers, and
     teams. This document can include guidelines for creating all manner of web assets, including
     banners, social media content, and website design elements.
     The logo is the most prominent way to reinforce your brand identity on the website. The logo
     is part of a brand's corporate identity (CI).
     The primary font is typically used for prominent headings on the site, while body copy is often
     set in a standard web font that closely matches the primary font.
     Menu and button style, as well as icons, are also part of a site's visual identity. Even when a
     user is viewing a small part of a site or page, it should look as if it belongs to the site as whole.

     Design can be a pretty precise science and
     there is a lot of research on what makes for
     effective design. A lot is also common sense
     and practice based on accepted web standards.

7.3.3 Collecting and collating design assets

Elements, such as your logo and brand colours, represent your brand and form part of your
brand expression. The latest versions of these brand assets need to be available to the designer
or marketing agency designing your website.

Getting the right brand assets to designers in a good quality format that they can easily access
will save time and avoid expensive mistakes.

Here is a list of brand assets that a designer requires to start working on a site. The quality,
format (or file type), and file size are all important considerations:

· Brand guidelines or style guide: These are        NOTE  The brand guidelines or style guide would
    presented in Adobe Reader (PDF) format.               be created in Illustrator, PS, or Sketch, but
                                                          saved for the client as a PDF.
· Logo and other key brand elements:
    These are generated in Illustrator format (ai)

or Photoshop format (psd). Best practice

is to have your logo designed using vector graphics. If your logo or other brand assets

are created in this format, they can be enlarged without losing quality. If you do not have

a vector version of your logo available, then you should make sure that your image is at

least 1 000 pixels wide.

· Image libraries: Photographs and images can be hosted online, where the designer can
    access them with a login. They can also be sent via Cloud file sharing services. Make sure

the images are of sufficient quality. It is best practice to provide images that are 300dpi.

Although all images on the web are displayed at 72dpi, a higher quality image will give

your designer room to optimise and resize and crop or cut images where needed. It may

be necessary to consider different images for mobile vs. desktop, because the viewpoint

on mobile is so much smaller. You may need to consider using much fewer images for

mobile or even none at all.

If you don't own the image and its copyright, it is illegal to use the image on your site
without permission from the owner. If you require these images, they can be purchased
from stock libraries online, such as iStock or Shutterstock. Avoid using images from
Google Image Search on your pages.

· Fonts folder: You will need to provide both Apple Mac and PC versions of the fonts that
    are listed in your Style Guide. Many designers work on Macs, which use different font
    versions from those read by PCs.

· Brand colours: They need to be given to digital designers in RGB format. RGB stands for
    red, green, and blue and is the standard for colours online.

· Any existing creative assets that have been created for your brand over time, such as:
    · Print designs
    · TV ads.

                                                                                                                                    175
CLAIMING

· Website copy: This should be made available before the final design is required. This
    prevents delays caused by designers waiting for material. This applies to any additional
    assets your designer may need that can be downloaded or sent, such as your price guides
    or product descriptions.

Fonts

Copy conveys your brand message to your client or customer and should be easy to read and
search-engine friendly. The CI is expressed through fonts, also known as typefaces.

Typographic layout can draw attention to the content users should see first. Indicate which
pieces of information take precedence. Importance can be signified by text size, colour, weight,
capitalisation, and italics. Placement also contributes to how important text appears.

Some fonts are common to all computer users.     NOTE  Some web safe fonts are: Times New

7.4 WEB DEVELOPMENT

Web development is the process of taking finished web designs and transforming them into
fully functioning, interactive websites. Development is what gives life and movement to static
designs and enables users to access the website through their web browsers. This is done
by translating the designs into web coding languages that can be interpreted and displayed
by browsers.

Learning to code your own website is beyond the scope of this textbook and requires years
of practice and some considerable technical know-how. But we can teach you to understand
the aspects that go into creating a website, the process that should be followed, and how to
help in making key choices about your website.

7.4.1 Assessing your development needs

It is important to identify what your development needs are, as these fundamentally impact
the options that are most appropriate to your site's development. Will you use a CMS? Will you
need complex content management? Is it for ecommerce, or is it simply a brochure site? For
instance, if you're building a small brochure site, you don't need someone to come up with a
bespoke development solution.

Content management

The majority of websites today are built using a content management system, or CMS. A web
CMS is a software application that assists in managing your digital assets and any form of
content for your website. It needs to facilitate the creating, collecting, managing, and publishing
of any material for your site.

Managing a website is collaborative and involves various people, in various roles - creators,
editors, publishers, administrators and even visitors to your site - working on your site. A CMS
provides tools to allow users with little knowledge of web programming languages or markup
languages to create and manage website content. A CMS enables a business to manage and
update their own website without needing a web developer (Johnston, 2015).

Ideally, the CMS becomes a set of automated processes that facilitate the functioning, updating,
and management of your site. Using a CMS means it is cheaper and easier to update, manage,
and create new content as web developers are not required for each change. A CMS also
allows for the content of websites to be updated from any location in the world by means of
signing in to the system.

       across a range of businesses, from consumer-based retail, through auction, music, and video
       subscription sites, to intercorporate trading.

     Brochure site

       A brochure site is a static site. It provides content that does not need to be updated regularly,
       and there is very little interaction with the visitor. It is essentially a brochure of a company's
       offering, providing relevant information and contact details to prospective customers. The site
       does not `do' anything. The user cannot interact with it in any way; they are unable to place
       orders, make payments, or engage with the website.

                                                Figure 7.4 Static brochure site
       Brochure sites are a means of getting your business an online presence quickly and relatively
       cheaply, and if it meets all your business requirements, then such a simple site may be sufficient.
       Consider the limitations of a brochure site before making a choice, as they can be difficult or
       impossible to build on later.

7.4.2 Development options

When selecting how to proceed with your website development, you have a few options at
your disposal. The choice between an off-the-shelf solution and bespoke development comes
down to how flexible the off-the-shelf solution is. If too much customisation is required, or
it does not support the business's requirements, it may be better and cheaper to develop a
bespoke solution.

Off-the-shelf solution

The CMS you choose can be pre-built by an external company or developer. This can be bought
like any other software on the market. While this option may provide fewer custom features,
it's potentially a more cost-effective option than a bespoke CMS. It is certainly quicker if little
customisation is required.

Bespoke development

This involves a CMS that is built specifically for a certain website. This option is highly tailored
and customised to your website, and can be more expensive than other options. It is possibly
less future proof, as finding alternative agencies to support custom-built code is challenging.

          A great CMS platform should have tools for you to easily export your data and move it

          and add-ons will fix that problem. You can think of them as your apps for your CMS platform.

    7.4.3 Development frameworks

       The back-end of a website refers to the server-side layer. This layer is hidden from the user's
       view. The interaction between the user and the back-end is handled via a presentation layer
       known as the front-end or client-side layer. A website is a marriage between these layers
       (Ferguson, 2016).

     Back-end/server-side languages and frameworks

       Server-side languages are the hidden web coding languages that determine how your website
       works and communicates with the web server and your computer.
       When choosing a server-side language, you need to consider:
       Cost: The cost varies depending on the language you choose for your web development
       project; as some are more intricate than others, the developer may charge more. The language
       chosen may therefore directly influence the salary of the developer. If information is processed
       where your website is housed, as opposed to on the client's computer, it increases the costs.
       Some languages also require ongoing website management and maintenance, which is an
       additional cost to consider.
       Scalability: When planning a project where scalability is a factor, consider whether there
       are developers readily available to write in this language. Also find out if there are supporting
       libraries and frameworks available that may suit possible changes to your project.
       Some of the most common and popular server-side languages include PHP, Java, Ruby, .NET,
       and Python. Ask your web developer to advise you on the best language for your specific project
       (Ferguson, 2016). Some common back-end frameworks are Laravel, CodeIgniter, Sympfony,
       cakePHP, and Zend.

Front-end/client-side development languages and frameworks

Web users have come to expect rich, interactive    NOTE  There are many free resources online
experiences online, and interactive website              that teach you how to code. One is
interfaces are a part of that. Front-end                 Codeacademy: www.codeacademy.com.
languages, or client-side languages, are
languages that are interpreted and executed
in users' browsers rather than on the web server.

These experiences range from simple animations through to highly responsive interfaces that
require input from the user. There are several technologies available to create such experiences,
each with its own opportunities and challenges.

As with server-side languages, you need to consider a few properties of the front-end language
you want to use. Bear in mind that server-side languages and front-end languages are often
used together, as all web projects require front-end languages for development.

Cost: Front-end language development costs are comparatively lower than back-end costs,
although rich interface developers often demand premium rates.

Features: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript open-source languages are often used together and are
compatible with most hardware and software. Content developed in these is also more search
engine friendly. Today, Flash is rarely used despite its interactive multimedia capabilities. In
many cases, richer experiences can be achieved with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your most
important consideration should always be what your end users will be able to view.

Scalability: Depending on the capabilities of the device executing the language, certain features
may not be available, or certain code may run too slowly to create a good user experience.
The development of front-end code needs to take all the considered devices into account.

Browser and OS support: With front-end languages, you have to cater for browser and
operating system support. A website will look different on each browser and operating system,
and this needs to be factored in. If a feature cannot be displayed under certain conditions,
workarounds have to be implemented. A rule of thumb in web development is that a website
must work on Safari.

Open-source or proprietary software: Any developer can create add-ons for or improve on
open-source software, while proprietary software is owned and its use is restricted. It can be
cheaper to develop in an open-source front-end language such as HTML. However, as HTML
is needed to host all web pages, combinations of open source and proprietary software are
sometimes used. This is however, in most cases and for the languages we cover, not a major
consideration.

There are several front-end language options to choose from, although the most popular by
far is HTML coupled with CSS and JavaScript.

                                                                                                   183

      HTML5
       HTML is the language for creating websites, and HTML5 is the fifth iteration of the language.
       It is also the name for a range of technologies that enable modern web browsing features.
       It's a specification published by the web standards body, W3C, describing what features are
       available and how to use them. HTML5 is different from proprietary web software, such as
       Adobe Flash, in that the specification is the result of contributions from many organisations
       and can be implemented by anyone without having to pay for royalties or licensing fees. You
       do, however, pay for the development tools provided by the companies.

                                  Figure 7.6 The HTML5 , JavaScript, and CSS logos
       HTML5 simplifies many common tasks when building a web page, such as including multimedia
       content, validating forms, caching information, and capturing user input data, such as date
       and time.
       HTML5 allows browsers to play multimedia content without the use of Flash or a similar plug-in.
       There is also a technology called Canvas, which allows developers to create rich, interactive
       experiences without the constraints that came with previous versions of HTML. For example,
       a 3D animated video can now be played, something that used to require the use of Flash or
       Silverlight.
       The goal is a website that just works, without the need for particular browsers or plug-ins to
       enable certain functionality. Having a standardised way of implementing common features
       means that the web is open and accessible to all, regardless of competency.

      CSS
       CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a style sheet language used to instruct the
       browser how to render the HTML code. For example, the plain text on a web page is included
       in the HTML code, and CSS defines how it will appear. CSS can set many properties including
       the size, colour, and spacing around the text, as well as the placement of images and other
       design-related items. CSS pre-processors, such as LESS, SASS, and Stylus are also available
       to make CSS more easily maintainable and scalable. They allow for more functional CSS
       compilation. The latest standard of CSS is CSS3. It is backwards compatible with all versions
       of CSS, and provides many more useful features, such as text effects, 2D/3D transformations,
       and animations (w3schools, n.d.).

JavaScript
This is the most common client-side language used to create rich, dynamic web properties.
Because it is an open-source language, many developers have added functionality that can be
more quickly implemented. For example, there are over 1 000 different gallery systems created
by JavaScript developers for JavaScript developers.

Frameworks
Frameworks are packages that are made up of a structure of files and folders of standardised
code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for example) which can be used as the basis for developing
websites. Essentially, frameworks are templates to provide the common structure for websites
so that developers don't need to start from scratch each time. Frameworks save a lot of time
and money.

Some examples include vue.js, backbone.js, angularJS, emberJS, react.js, and the popular
jQuery libraries. Bootstrap has long been the most popular CSS framework, and bulma is also
increasing in popularity.

7.4.4 Development best practice

There are multiple ways to design and develop for the web, but it is a good idea to learn from
the best in the industry and to follow some best practice guidelines to achieve the best results.

Meta and title tag customisation

The CMS you have either selected or created should allow you to enter your own meta tags
for each page, as well as allow full customisation of title tags for each page. It is important to
note that Google does not use keyword meta tags for ranking anymore (Lincoln, 2015).

URLs

Instead of using dynamic parameters, the CMS should allow for clean URLs by using server-
side rewriting. Clean URLs consist only of the path to a webpage without extra code. A clean
URL could look like this: example.com/cats, while an unclean URL could look like this: example.
com/index.php?page=cats. It should allow for the creation of URLs that are:

· Static
· Rewritable
· Keyword rich.
Be careful when building clean, descriptive, and dynamic URLs from CMS content. Should
you use a news headline, for example, `Storm,' as part of your URL and someone changes the
heading to `Tornado,' this will alter the URL and the search engines will index this as a new
page, but with the same content as the URL which had the old heading. Bear this in mind
before adding dynamic parameters to your URLs.

                                                                                                                                    185
CLAIMING

Customisable navigation

A good CMS will allow for flexibility when creating the information architecture for a website.
For the purposes of adding additional content for search engines, a CMS should not require
that all content pages be linked to from the homepage navigation. Responsive considerations
also need to be in place for mobile devices.

The CMS needs to have good support for managing SEO considerations, such as URL
rewriting and avoiding duplicate content issues.

Customisable image naming and alt tags for images: A good CMS will allow you to create
custom alt tags and title attributes.

robots.txt management: robot.txt files are .txt files that restrict search engines from indexing
certain pages of information. Ensure that you are able to customise the robots.txt to your needs,
or that this can at least be managed using the meta tags.

Finally, using a CMS that supports standards compliant HTML and CSS is very important,
as without it, inconsistencies may be rendered across various browsers. It also ensures faster
loading time and reduced bandwidth, makes markup easier to maintain, supports SEO efforts,
and ensures that every visitor to a website, no matter what browser they are using, will be able
to see everything on the site.

7.4.5 Developing for multiple screens              NOTE  In 2021, the number of mobile users
                                                         worldwide stood at 7.1 billion, and likely

in 2014 and continues to grow year on year,
while desktop usage is declining (Chaffey, 2016).

Because of this, it's important for all brands
to be accessible on mobile devices. As you learnt in Chapter 6: User experience design,
mobile devices can fall into a range of categories, and not all mobile devices have the same
features and screen size. This means that websites need to be designed to be accessible and
are optimised for a variety of screen sizes and devices.

Developing for a variety of screens and mobile requires an understanding of the opportunities
and challenges presented by mobile technology. Challenges include the obvious, such as a
smaller screen and navigation limitations, different operating systems, as well as more complex
issues, like file formats and bandwidth restrictions.

     Mobile devices

       A mobile device is a small device with computer-like functionality. It allows for an internet
       connection and various features such as Bluetooth, NFC, wifi, and GPS. These include
186

smartphones and PDAs (MDN, 2016). Remember, mobile goes beyond just the mobile phone.
Also consider tablets, game consoles, netbooks, wearables, and a range of other web-enabled
devices.

The constraints with developing for a range of devices

Due to the size constraints of mobile device screens, various considerations must be taken
into account to allow your website to render correctly.

Fluid CSS layouts will allow the site to manipulate its contents based on screen size. Additionally,
CSS media queries can use target styles for a specific screen width, height, and pixel density.

Images must be optimised for mobile screens and bandwidth restrictions.

Development approaches

Here are some development approaches that you may want to consider:

Specialised mobile development
Mobile devices allow users to access information about your brand on the move. Because
mobile penetration is so heavy and many users worldwide will access the internet first and
primarily through mobile (Chaffey, 2016), every website needs to be designed with the mobile
device in mind. Mobile website interfaces demand a simpler approach and a consideration of
screen size and input method. A specific design for various mobile screen sizes in the form of
an adaptive design may be an option. However, Google prefers responsive to adaptive sites,
so creating an adaptive site may not be in your business's best interest, in terms of SEO.

A native mobile app is software designed to help users perform particular tasks. Examples
include a tool for checking the weather, a fuel calculator, or an airlines app to check-in or to
track flight progress.

Mobile apps can be sold or made available for free. Many developers create apps to derive an
income, while free apps that offer users value are often sponsored by brands or advertising.
An app can be an excellent tool for connecting with your customer.

The key difference between native applications and mobile-optimised websites is that native
applications are designed for particular handsets and operating systems and have to be
downloaded to the mobile device. Mobile-optimised websites can be accessed using any
internet-enabled mobile device. That said, mobile apps can allow for more integration with the
device and hence a better user experience, depending on the complexity of the functionality.

                                                                                                                                    187

a niche or targeted audience.

Some brands still create a separate mobile site just for their mobile users, but this is falling
out of fashion as internet access via mobile increases. Google recommends responsive
sites as best practice.

A responsive site

A responsive website is a website that changes its layout depending on the device it is displayed
on so it looks one way on a desktop computer, but then adapts to the smaller screen size and
layout on a tablet or mobile phone. In this way, a single development project can cater for
multiple device form factors.

A responsive website is not the same as an adaptive website. A responsive site uses the
browser's screen space to determine how to reflow the original design content that was
probably optimised for desktop, while an adaptive site provides a specifically tailored design
for the device you are using. Designing an adaptive site requires multiple fixed layout sizes,
usually the six most common screen widths. The relevant one is deployed depending on the
screen size of the device.

Many users prefer responsive design as it provides familiarity, uniformity, and seamlessness, which
are important considerations in user experience (Soegaard, 2021). Responsive design should
be mobile friendly. This helps to maintain usability when reflowed for a mobile device's screen.

Adaptive designs are more labour intensive and more expensive. As an approach, it's being
used less and less. Although industry professionals often prefer adaptive sites, industry
preference won't translate into higher listings on SERPs, while Google's ranking methodology
favours responsive design.

Here is a table that compares the relative strengths and weaknesses of each option. There's
no right or wrong answer on which one to pick. Choose the option that best suits your brand,
target audience, and digital objectives.

      Designing for multiple screen sizes
       Designing a site that will display consistently across multiple devices and screen sizes is
       difficult, but understanding and sticking to web standards will bring you closer to this goal.

       Design your site so that the information your users want is not only on display, but also easy to
       get to. The limited screen space is valuable, so you can't necessarily have the full site navigation
       on every page. Well thought-out information architecture is essential ensuring that you make
       the most logical use of navigation in line with what your site visitors need.

      Standards
       There are few standards currently in place to ensure your design will be optimised across
       multiple screens. It is still not entirely possible to create content including images, text, and
       beyond that can be correctly formatted on most mobile devices, or at least legible on phones
       where formatting is flawed. There is a certain amount of trial and error involved in designing
       a site optimised across a variety of devices. However, the process is certainly worth it. There
       are 4.7 billion unique mobile subscribers, and the majority of these are accessing the mobile
       web (GSMA Intelligence, 2016).

Web standards are managed by the W3C. The standards were created to promote
consensus, fairness, public accountability, and quality. Complying with web standards
means the site uses valid code and adheres to stipulations from the W3C. Read more

of screen widths. When deciding whether to
create a responsive site or adapt desktop sites,
consider your customer first:

· How much of your website traffic comes from specific mobile devices? If this is a large
    percentage, consider building a responsive site designed for optimal viewing on mobile

    screen sizes.

· Do your desktop users have the same goals as your mobile users? Here you need to keep
    in mind your CTAs and drop-down menus. Ensure they can be accessed correctly by the

    relevant device.

· What is your budget and how quickly do you need your website to be built? Responsive
    websites take a while to build and can be expensive. You could save money long term by

    going this route, but there is a sizeable upfront investment.

· Do you have an existing site, and can it be converted into a responsive website, or will it
    need to be rebuilt? (Du Plessis, 2012).

     Flexible grid
     Typical websites are designed as large, centred, fixed-width blocks. With responsive design,
     the page elements, such as the heading, the text or copy, the main image, and other blocks
     of information are arranged in a grid of columns that have predefined spacing. Each element
     relates proportionally to the other elements. This allows elements to rearrange or resize in
     relation to each other whether the screen is tiny or huge and the screen quality is high or low.
     Although this system allows for flexibility, an extremely narrow screen can cause the design
     to break down. In this case, we can make use of media queries.

                      Figure 7.9 Flexible grid used in responsive design

     Media queries

     Media queries are bits of code that allow websites to ask devices for information about
     themselves. The website style that will suit the device best is then selected from a list of styles
     defined in a CSS. Media queries ask for information about the device's browser window size,
     orientation (landscape or portrait), and screen display quality.

Step 1: Discovery and planning

Planning a website starts with research

have a website, you can use existing web

analytics data to understand how well you are meeting your users' needs. It's also worth

running some user labs to watch how users interact with your existing site.

   What are your business objectives?                                  Who are your users?
How should this digital property help you                           Your potential customers?

In research and planning, you should also reach an understanding of what tasks or actions
users need to do on your website. These are usually in line with your business objectives.
Some tasks a user may need to do include checking the availability of a hotel, signing up to a
newsletter, or printing information.

Before any web design project starts, decide what browsers, operating system, and devices
you will develop for. For browsers, you usually use the latest, plus one before. For devices, iOS
and Android are quite different, so if you are optimising for both, it can be quite expensive.
Technology moves so fast; you can hardly keep up with all the latest OS and devices.

Choosing a domain name

Domain names are important. They are part of the URL of a website. A domain name looks
something like this: www.mycompany.com.

A lot more information can be included in this. Domain names can carry the following
information: subdomain.domain.tld/directory

· Domain: The registered domain name of the website
· Subdomain: A domain that is part of a larger domain
· TLD: The top level domain, uppermost in the hierarchy of domain names
· Directory: A folder to organise content.
The TLD can indicate the country in which a domain is registered and can also give information
about the nature of the domain:

.com: The most common TLD

co.za, .co.uk, .com.au: These TLDs give country information

.org: Used by non-profit organisations

.gov: Used by governments

.ac: Used by academic institutions.

Domain names must be registered, and, in most cases, there is a fee for doing so. Many hosting
providers will register domain names on your behalf, but you can also do it yourself. Domain
names should be easy to remember, and, if possible, include important search keywords for
your business. For example, if you were building a website for your restaurant named Omega,
www.omegarestaurant.com could be a better choice than www.omega.com as it contains the
important keyword `restaurant.'

compiled so far. This document should detail

the development requirements for the website

and can be used to communicate any specific design constraints.

It's now time to move on from planning to building.

Search engine visibility

Search engine traffic is vital to a website; without it, the chances are that the site will never
fulfil its marketing functions. It is essential that the search engines can see the entire publicly
visible website, index it fully, and consider its relevance for its chosen keywords.

Search engine optimisation (SEO) has its own chapter in this textbook (Chapter 5), but here
are the key considerations for web development and design.

In web development, the copy that is shown on the web page needs to be kept separate
from the code that tells the browser how to display the web page. This means that the search
engine spider will be able to discern easily what content is to be read and therefore scanned
by the spider, and what text is an instruction to the browser. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
can take care of that.

If the search engine cannot see the text on the page, it means that it cannot crawl and index
that page.

Step 2: Design

Design usually happens before development. According to the steps explained earlier in this
chapter, the designer will transform the wireframes and basic planning materials into beautifully
designed layouts. These are static images that show how the website will look once it's coded.

      Step 3: Development

       The development phase usually kicks in once the design is finished. Developers will sometimes
       start their involvement as early as the wireframe stage by creating low-fidelity prototypes to
       support the user-testing process. Normally, the developer uses the design templates to code the
       actual website, using the front-end language that you have chosen. Server-side development
       and CMS considerations may also be part of this phase.

Step 4: Testing and launch
Once you have planned an amazing site, designed it beautifully, built it skilfully, and filled it
with fantastic copy, it's time to test it and then take it live!

Testing is an important part of website development and design, and it should take place
throughout the process of planning, designing, and building, leaving just final quality assurance
(QA) testing before the site goes live. Test subjects should be real potential users of the website,
not just members of the development team. The site needs to be tested in all common browsers
and devices to make sure that it looks and works as it should across all of them. All links should
be tested to make sure that they work correctly, and it's always a good idea to get a final check
of all of the copy before it goes live.

Tools such as W3C's HTML validator, validator.w3.org should be used to validate your HTML.

7.6 DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES

There are different approaches to building a website. The one described in this chapter (Section
7.5 The web development process) is the waterfall process, where one step follows the other.
This is in contrast with other methods, such as the agile methodology, which involves faster
iteration and greater collaboration, but doesn't afford clients as much control and upfront clarity
on the deliverables and timelines.

The Agile method is a series of sprints, and involves working through iterative, incremental

cycles. Agile methodology is more collaborative, less rigid and requires incremental investments.

It often results in being able to release the final product to the market faster. The collaborative

approach means that instead of handing over the project to the next person in the chain, you

work together catching any issues and working on each iteration as you move through each

process. The Agile method often involves scrum

methodology and requires (or at least tries for)            NOTE  Read more about scrum methodology

Careful consideration of the specific project, the goals, and ultimately, the client's needs, will
decide which of these methods is appropriate for a specific project. The method chosen should
be the one that will best fit the required project goals.

7.7 QUALITY ASSURANCE

The software development cycle has one

final step before the website goes live: quality            NOTE  Be sure to factor in enough time to do
assurance. This is often referred to as QA. It is                 QA at various points in the development

expectation is in line with the agreed Statement

of Work. This step is independent of the design and development phases and involves various

end-user test cases. Test cases ensure that the graphical user interface (GUI) promotes a

great user experience (UX). QA involves two steps: functional and user-interface testing

       (Thompson, 2015).

7.7.1 Functional testing

This involves testing the features of a website to ensure that they are working correctly. Functional
testing should be done early in the development cycle as it speeds up development, increases
quality, and reduces the risk of errors towards the end of the project. Testing can take place
either manually by a tester or be completely automated using an application (AppPerfect, 2016).

7.7.2 User interface testing

This is the process of testing whether users can engage with the site as envisioned during
development. It also includes testing all features, such as screens with controls, menus,
dropdowns, buttons, icons, toolbars, dialogue boxes, forms, and all other user interface features
on the site.

User interface testing is crucial as it is the users'  NOTE  You can read more about GUI testing at

will or will not use the site or application in

the future. If an interface is not intuitive and is

difficult to understand, users are unlikely to use that product again. Testing is essential.

The following should be checked during GUI testing:

 Can users input the necessary information

      into the user fields?

 Does the feature execute the desired

      function when activated?

 Are error messages displayed correctly

      and for the correct function?

 Is the font appropriate?
 Is the text aligned?
 Are the colours and fonts, and even error

      messages, visually appealing?

 correctly? Are the images clear and displaying
 they appear where they are supposed to? Are the images correctly aligned, and do
 for different screen sizes and resolutions? Are the GUI elements positioned correctly

            CLAIMING

     7.7.3 Cross browser and device testing

       With the myriad of browsers and devices available, developers need to ensure that their
       websites render acceptably across all of them. Perfection is extremely difficult as each browser
       and device renders a website slightly differently. To ensure compatibility, developers write
       cross-browser code. If a feature is not supported, a fallback must be in place to ensure that it
       degrades gracefully.
       If you are deploying your site across a range of devices, each version needs to be checked.
       And if the site is designed to be responsive, check the GUI across a range of devices to test
       the responsiveness of the design and that all the elements work across the various devices
       and possible views.
       Test websites on different browsers and operating systems, for example Google Chrome on IOS
       and Google Chrome on Android devices. Various tools are available to assist in this process,
       one being BrowserStack (browserstack.com). BrowserStack allows you to test various operating
       systems and devices from within your browser (MDN, 2016).

      7.8 CASE STUDY: OFFSPRING

           Offspring is a UK-based shoe retailer.

       One-line summary

           Offspring, a UK-based sneaker store, wanted to increase mobile conversion and mobile
           revenue, and to achieve this, they moved to a responsive design website.

       The problem

           Offspring had no mobile website, and mobile users were having a poor user experience
           when accessing the site on their devices. This caused poor conversion rates and low
           revenue for mobile.
           Mobile users are the largest growing online market and Offspring witnessed a consistent
           increase in mobile traffic to their website. Their current site was not mobile friendly and
           was not providing a good user experience. This was also impacting their SEO score.
           Offspring knew they needed ensure that mobile users had a good user experience to
           improve conversions, revenue, and SEO.

       The solution

           Offspring considered a mobile-friendly site, but decided to opt for a fully responsive site
           to provide an optimised viewing experience irrespective of the device used to access
           the site. Offspring wanted to ensure that tablet users were also catered for in the design.

In addition the brand wanted to ensure that they provided existing customers with a familiar
look and feel so that they could still easily access and navigate the site.

                    Figure 7.17 Offspring's responsive vs. non responsive site
Certain key design features were included to improve user experience. A new `sticky'
header was included that followed users down the page as they scrolled, providing easy
navigation without having to scroll back to the top each time.
Other design features included:
· A new product listing page that was three columns wide on a desktop that could

    automatically scale down to two or one depending on the size of any different device
    used.
· New image view and selection process was included on the product detail pages.
· A `Don't forget' section was included on the basket page so that users could automatically
    add items to their respective carts.
· An improved checkout process was created with new delivery options.
The intuitive navigation process was crucial to ensuring that users on any device would
be able to find the information they needed - quickly and easily.

       The results

           Users spent more time on the site, which led to an increase in conversions and sales.
           The SEO visibility of the site showed dramatic improvement after moving over to the
           responsive site mainly due to the mobile site usability score on Google rocketing from
           60/100 to 100/100. This saw organic traffic to the site increasing by over 25%.

    7.10 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       Web development and design can be seen as the thread that holds digital marketing together.
       After all, websites are the first thing we think of when talking about the internet.
       With the crucial role that search engines play in the way people explore the internet, web
       development and design go hand in hand with SEO. Online advertising campaigns, social
       media channels, email marketing newsletters, and even affiliate programs lead people to click

through to your website and sometimes to a customised landing page. That's web design
jumping into the mix again.

Setting up analytics correctly on your website is also essential to managing and monitoring
your marketing success.

Successful website development and design is all about the right preparation, and the resulting
website usually forms the foundation of any digital marketing to follow. Make sure you understand
your users' needs, and that you're building on a strong base.

7.11 SUMMARY

Successful websites come from strong planning with a focus on user needs. Websites should
be built to be accessible and usable, search engine optimised, and shareable.

Key considerations include:

· Designing your website according to best practices, following the process of developing
    a website from start to finish.

· Developing a strong, stable, and usable website.
· Creating a suitable mobile web experience for your users.
· Enhancing user experience through design and guiding a visitor seamlessly through a

    website, as opposed to distracting visitors from their goals.
· Ensuring consistency in visual messaging across all properties.
· Supporting a wide range of web browsers and mobile devices.

     8.1 INTRODUCTION

     While credit cards and online shopping are often associated with the term ecommerce, the
     field encapsulates all digital transactions. This includes the buying and selling of goods and
     services and the transfer of funds and data.
     The explosive growth of ecommerce in recent years can be attributed to the ever increasing
     reach of the internet, the development of faster internet speeds, and the convenience afforded
     by ordering things online. Hunting and comparing prices from the comfort of your chair is often
     more enticing than going from store to store.
     According to Statista, in 2021, ecommerce sales worldwide amounted to $4.9 trillion dollars,
     and this is forecasted to increase to over $7 trillion by 2025.

    8.3 TYPES OF ECOMMERCE

       Electronic commerce, or ecommerce, is defined as the buying and selling of products and
       services, including funds and data, electronically. eCommerce can be divided into four main
       types, namely, business to consumer, business to business, consumer to consumer, and
       consumer to business.

    8.3.1 Business to consumer (B2C)

       The most common type of ecommerce is business to consumer (B2C), in which a business
       sells products or services directly to consumers over the internet. All retail sites are essentially
       B2C. The world's largest online retailer, amazon.com, is a prime example.

                      Figure 8.2 The Amazon homepage is an example of B2C ecommerce
       The benefits of ecommerce include the ability for retailers to have a wide variety of products
       available without needing the physical retail space to hold and display items. The procurement
       and distribution processes are also streamlined as products are shipped directly to consumers,
       and not via distributors or retail outlets in between. The process has `less overhead,' and is
       more efficient in terms of time and money, reducing inventory management costs. Ultimately
       B2C is able to deliver products to customers at lower costs than in-store retail outlets.

    8.3.2 Business to business (B2B)

       Another type of ecommerce is business to business (B2B), which describes online transactions
       between businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler or between a wholesaler
       and a retailer. It can also include business-related services, such as letting of commercial spaces,
       printing services, outsourced marketing, as well as hiring and selling of office equipment.
       Like B2C, the same benefits of lowered inventory management costs and a more streamlined
       procurement and distribution process, make ecommerce an efficient and attractive model for
       companies selling to other businesses.

8.3.3 Consumer to consumer (C2C)

Consumer to consumer (C2C) ecommerce is where consumers sell products to other consumers.
Generally, a C2C business provides the platform for various users to use it to interact with
each other for mutual benefit. A recent large-scale C2C ecommerce example is Uber. The
business simply provides a transactional platform where consumers offer other consumers
a lifting service based on location and cost preference. eBay is another globally recognised
C2C online business. Sellers can list their products on eBay, and interested buyers auction for
listed products. Similar sites, such as Airbnb, Gumtree, and Craigslist are all C2C ecommerce
platforms.
In C2C ecommerce, consumers either pay a fee to use the platform or the platform takes a
percentage of all transactions processed through the site. If the platform is free to all consumers
to buy and sell, then the site often generates its revenue through advertising.

                     Figure 8.3 Airbnb is a platform that facilitates C2C services

8.3.4 Consumer to business (C2B)

Consumer to business (C2B) ecommerce involves consumers selling products or services to
businesses; the business pays the consumer. Examples include guru.com, a freelancer hiring
website, and websites that pay individuals for completing online surveys.

8.4 ECOMMERCE ON SPECIFIC CHANNELS

eCommerce refers to electronic business transactions across the entire internet. There are
some specific channels on which ecommerce is gaining popularity, namely mobile and social
commerce.

                                                                                                                                    213
           CLAIMING

                                            Figure 8.4 The guru.com homepage
       With mobile becoming the channel of choice for accessing the web and with Facebook,
       along with other social media platforms, continuing to dominate the time users spend online,
       businesses need to ensure that they operate in these spaces if they want to continue to appeal
       to and retain their users.
       In short, having ecommerce that operates across mobile and social is an online business
       necessity. Failure to move into these spaces means users may simply look for alternatives that
       facilitate ecommerce through these channels.

    8.4.1 Mobile commerce (m-commerce)

       Mobile commerce (m-commerce) is the use of wireless handheld devices such as cellular/
       mobile phones to conduct commercial transactions online. According to Statista, in 2021,
       more than 70% of global ecommerce was generated via m-commerce. This trend is driven by
       mobile-first economies, where there are emerging ecommerce markets. The importance of
       m-commerce is undeniable and should be included in every business' ecommerce strategy.
       Consumers use mobile for a host of transactions (e.g., mobile money transfers, electronic ticketing
       and boarding passes, digital content purchases and delivery, mobile banking, contactless
       payments and in-app payments, location-based services, mobile marketing, and loyalty cards).
       A December 2021 survey by PwC asked consumers how often they have bought products, such
       as clothes, books, and electronics, in-store vs. using their smartphones. They discovered that
       41% of respondents shop via mobile or smartphone daily or weekly, compared to 12% in 2016.

           CLAIMING

     Reasons for growth in m-commerce

       M-commerce transactions continue to grow as a result of the following:

       · The number of global mobile users is steadily increasing every year, resulting in an
           increased demand for mobile websites and applications.

       · The rapid adoption of ecommerce means that evolving customers are looking for more
           options across more devices.

       · Improved technology has given mobile devices advanced capabilities and faster internet
           access enabling m-commerce to be available on even the most affordable devices.

       · Broadband technology and lowering data costs mean more consumers have access to
           m-commerce even on affordable devices and data plans.

       · Mobile users are looking for instant gratification online; this includes their online shopping
           needs. An increase in m-commerce for fast food, fresh produce, and basic household items,
           such as toilet paper, nappies, bread, and eggs, have been driven by this need for customers
           to get what they need, when and where they want it.

     Benefits of m-commerce

       M-commerce has a range of benefits over traditional ecommerce. These include:

       Access: Gaining access to the internet through mobile is easier and more affordable than
       desktop options. The falling costs of data and improved internet access on mobile mean more
       and more users have access to the internet via mobile than any other device.

       Convenience: Mobile phones are always with us; being constantly connected enhances the
       benefits of anytime, anywhere use with no need to plug in to or log in to computers wherever
       they are situated. Mobile is an appropriate name as these devices are with us wherever we
       go, making it easy and convenient to transact online at any time convenient to the consumer.

       Costs: Mobile devices are more affordable than computers and offer multiple uses reducing
       the need for an additional computer. Calls, messaging services, social media, and news content
       are just a few of the reasons consumers would prefer to use a single device, making mobile
       phones the obvious choice.

       Ease of use: Mobile phones are relatively easy and simple to use, and there is no need for a
       particularly digitally skilled consumer. They allow consumers to make instant purchases with
       little technical skill.

       Mobile payments: Security around online payments remains the biggest barrier to ecommerce.
       Mobile payments allow alternative options for transactions via mobile currencies, mobile wallets,
       and alternative mobile only payment methods. Such easy and secure payment options make
       mobile the preferred choice for many users.

       Rich content: The advances in mobile processing power and cheaper data rates mean GIFs
       and videos can be easily used on mobile web and mobile applications (apps). Such rich media

allows brands to better demonstrate a product's key features, to share testimonials of happy
consumers, and to showcase the use/look of the product or service.

However, this does not mean that mobile apps are not important. Just because most traffic
is through mobile browsers, doesn't mean that your business cannot operate mainly through
the app. Mobile applications should be considered, and, if applicable to your business, used
in conjunction with mobile websites to enhance consumers' overall shopping experience. If
most of your mobile traffic is through apps, then you will need to consider using the app as
your primary m-commerce platform.

spending their online time in these social media

spaces, bringing ecommerce to where users are spending most of their time, makes good

business sense.

When customers are satisfied with your business, social media makes it easy for them to
share and recommend your brand. Because of this shareable nature, social media is a place
where content goes viral. This is known as social influence. Social media channels play a very
important role in driving conversions if you have happy customers. However, such channels
can also cause brand degradation if a customer is unhappy. Companies with the worst ratings
are often those who offer poor customer support.

     Social media enables conversations to spread at lightning speed. How you will harness these
     conversations to drive sales, needs to be considered as part of any ecommerce strategy.
     Enabling users to purchase the products and services that are being talked about and shared
     on social media, is the most effective way of using the platform to drive conversions. Various
     platforms now enable users to buy products directly and instantly through the platform. On
     Facebook, for instance, a `Shop now' button is displayed, and on Pinterest users can buy
     highlighted items directly.

     to plateau and is forecast at 3.7% from 2023 to 2025 (Oberlo, 2022). One of the most

     important considerations for any ecommerce business is how to reach and sell to its target

     customer audience. From these statistics it is safe to say that a large proportion of any

     brand's market is on social media.

     · Higher search engine ranking: Using social media for s-commerce increases traffic to
         your website which will influence your ranking on search engine results. Sharing links to

     products and content on your website through social media is an excellent way to drive

    liking or sharing it, and to reach an even larger audience.

· Authentic engagement and traffic: The most significant benefit of using social media for

    s-commerce is the engagement and reach that businesses can get whenever they share
    content. By appearing in followers' updates or feeds on a regular basis, you're participating
    in a powerful branding opportunity. Users who have regular positive contact with a company
    are more likely to recommend that company.
· Two-way communication: Operating on social media encourages users to connect with
    a business through two-way communication. This allows customers to not only engage
    with your business on a commercial level, but also gives them the opportunity to use social
    media as an efficient customer service channel where it's possible to solve problems.
    Social media word-of-mouth (sharing/reposting) helps with audience building, as well as
    increased engagement and website traffic.
· Customer loyalty: S-commerce is not purely focused on selling but uses social platforms
    to help the business build relationships with potential and existing customers. Such
    relationships can deepen trust and loyalty between consumers and the brand. In turn, this
    creates happy, satisfied customers, likely to make repeat purchases, i.e. a loyal customer.

8.5 MULTI-CHANNEL COMMERCE TO TOTAL RETAIL

In addition to being available on specific channels, ecommerce also forms part of other retail
approaches. It is important to understand what these approaches are and where ecommerce
fits into the broader strategy of your business.

Multi-channel commerce

When your business operates across multiple sales and media channels, you are considered
to be engaging in multi-channel commerce. For instance, you might sell your products on
your website, a mobile app, via a call centre, in stores, on Amazon and on eBay, all while
communicating with customers via many types of devices and social media channels. You
utilise a variety of multiple sales and marketing channels to sell your products to different types
of users and, therefore, you're a multi-channel vendor.

      Cross-channel commerce

       When your business encourages its customers to interact with your business on more than one
       channel, you are engaging in cross-channel commerce. Essentially cross-channel commerce

is the strategic maximisation of customer relationships via the introduction of new channels
beyond the one that originally engaged the user.
A customer would have approached a brand via a specific channel to browse and initiate
purchase, and cross-channel retailers would encourage that customer to then make use of
other available shopping channels, such as the website, app, or social media platform, to engage
further with the brand. Cross-channel retailers encourage interactions on their terms. Such
interaction across channels increases the likeliness of additional conversions and future sales.

Omnichannel commerce

An omnichannel commerce strategy can be

defined as a retailing strategy that delivers     NOTE  An interersting read on omnichannel

experience is that with the latter there is true

integration between channels on the back end, including customer data (single view of

customer), inventory management, stock movement, supply-chain, fulfilment information, and

customer relationship management.

The customer's interaction with the brand is integrated across all channels. Customers can
seamlessly migrate from channel to channel with no interruption or loss of data, and can pick
up wherever in their customer journey they may be, irrespective of which channel they choose
to engage the brand.

Customers are becoming increasingly digitally savvy and expect to be able to engage with the
brand across a variety of channels, depending on what is most convenient to them. They expect

       A seamless experience across all channels should arguably be a point of parity, rather than a
       differentiator. However, with thousands of brands competing for business, there is a need to
       improve omnichannel and offer an enhanced and personalised online shopping experience if
       you want to satisfy and retain customers. In 2014, PwC termed this approach of providing a
       seamless, enhanced, and personal retail experience as going `Total retail' (PwC, 2014).

2. An integrated back office operating model with agile and innovative technology.

Figure 8.13 Total retail offers a customer-centred retail
 experience, delivered seamlessly across all channels

Total retail is a more customer centric approach than omnichannel. It still offers a seamless
experience to the user across channels, but it places the individual customer's experience at
the heart of all its business operations. The focus is on the customer, rather than the various
channels that can be used to reach the customer.

    8.6 SETTING UP AN ECOMMERCE SITE

       When deciding to set up an ecommerce website there are five main considerations:
       1. Which industry will you operate in and what products will you sell?
       2. How will you build your website?
       3. How will you physically ship your product and fulfil orders?
       4. How will you drive traffic to your site?
       5. What metrics will you measure to determine success, and which tools will you use?
224
                                                 eCommerce

Each of these considerations is important to having a successful ecommerce business. From
choosing your product through to analysing your performance, decisions you make here
will have a long-term impact on your business. So, carefully examine your options and make
informed decisions to ensure future success.

8.6.1 Choosing an industry and product

To make your ecommerce business a success, you need to be selling a product that consumers
will want and are prepared to buy online. You also need to ensure that you are making a
reasonable margin on your products to sustain your business' longevity, and that you will be
able to manage physically storing and delivering the product you choose to sell.

Here are some key factors to consider when choosing an industry and product:

· Price: If the product cost is too low, it will be challenging to reach a positive return on
    investment (ROI). If it's too high, there is a good chance that some customers will want
    to speak with someone or see, touch, and feel the product prior to making the purchase.

· Margin: Many products sold online have a gross margin around 30% to 35%. This can
    change drastically depending on the industry. For example, electronics and toys typically
    have smaller margins while clothing and apparel are often marked up by 150% to 200%.

· Competition: Generally speaking, it is easier to drive sales online when the product can't
    be bought in local stores or in a wide variety of online stores.

· Shipping costs: Larger products tend to have higher shipping costs which can negatively
    affect sales. Most customers not only want free shipping, they expect it. As a result, it
    can be difficult to sell a product with a hefty shipping fee. Many online retailers include
    the shipping cost in the cost of the product while raising the total price and offering `free
    shipping.' However, these increases in price can decrease sales.

· Passion: Love the product or service you wish to sell. Starting and growing an ecommerce
    website typically comes with a series of obstacles and frustrations. Passion for your industry
    can be a great source of motivation to push through any challenges that may arise.

8.6.2 Setting up the website

There are five important steps to follow when setting up your ecommerce website:

Step 1: Choose your domain name            NOTE  You can also check out this blogpost:

            CLAIMING

       Let's look at each step in more detail:

       Step 1: Choose your domain name
       To get started, you will need a domain name for your website. Domain names can be purchased
       through hosting companies or domain registrars. When choosing a domain name, remember
       your target market; will you be targeting just your local market or an international one? If you
       are targeting the local market, you can register a local domain, such as .co.za or co.uk, but
       if you are targeting a global market then it would be preferable to go with an international
       domain like .com.

       You can purchase domain names from companies like godaddy.com/en-uk or networksolutions.com.

       Here are some tips for choosing a good domain name:

       · Make it easy to type: Remember you want users to be able to find you easily. Slang,
            complicated names, or those with different spellings can make your site difficult to find.
            Choose words that are simple and easy to spell and type in your domain name.

       · Keep it short: The longer and more complex your name, the higher the risk users misspelling
            or mistyping it. Keep it simple.

       · Use keywords: Carefully think about words that describe your product and the keywords
            that users will type into search engines when looking for your brand or product. Using
            keywords will make your site rank higher on SERPs, which will drive traffic to your website.

       · Target your area: If you are running a local business, try including your location in your
            domain name; this will make it easier for local users to find you and may rank you higher
            on search engines. For example, users looking for electricians in Chicago are more likely
            to find ChicagoElectrical.co.us than ElectricianForU.com.

       · Avoid numbers and hyphens: Although using numbers or hyphens appear clever and
            make sense to you, they can confuse users who often type out the number or forget the
            hyphen. If you need to use characters, try to register the different variations to ensure users
            will still be driven to your site and not to a competitor.

       · Be memorable: There are already millions of registered domain names. Users are inundated
            with regular ordinary names, so coming up with a domain that's catchy and memorable
            will definitely help to drive traffic to your site.

       · Research it: Before you decide on a name, do your due diligence and research the name
            for any trademarks or copyrights. You also want to check that it is not too similar to any
            competitors. Failure to ignore trademarks and copyrights can result in costly legal battles
            and the potential need to rebrand later on.

       · Use an appropriate domain name extension: When registering your domain, you will
            need to choose the extension. Extensions are the suffix at the end of your domain name,
            such as .com, .net, and .org. Local options, like .za or .uk, are also popular. The .com or
            .net options are the most popular. However, because these have been around so long, it is
            often problematic to get a unique and relevant name with that extension. Extensions have
            specific uses, so be sure that you choose the right one for your business.

226
                                                                  eCommerce

Here are some of the most popular extensions and what they mean.
Table 8.2 Extensions and what they mean

.co    an abbreviation for company, commerce, and community

.info  informational sites

.net   technical, internet infrastructure sites

.org   non-commercial organisations and non-profits

.ac    academic institutions like universities and colleges

.biz   business or commercial use, like ecommerce sites

.me    blogs, resumes, or personal sites

· Protect and build your brand: When choosing your domain name, it is worth purchasing
    other domain extensions and spelling variations to prevent competitors or trolls registering
    other versions that will then direct traffic to these alternate sites. By owning all the domains,
    you ensure that customers are directed to your site, even if they use the wrong extension
    or misspell it.

· Act fast: Once you have decided on a name, you need to act quickly. Domain names sell
    fast, but they are affordable, so register your chosen domain name as soon as you have
    decided on it. If your desired name is already in use, most of the registrars will suggest
    alternate names to help you (Godaddy.com, 2015).

Step 2: Obtain a secure (SSL) certificate
If you are not using a pre-packaged ecommerce service, then alongside the domain name
you will also need to obtain an SSL certificate to protect and secure your website content.
SSL prevents malicious users from accessing your website to steal passwords, credit card
information, and sensitive data. There are many providers of SSL certificates, such as Thawte
or Symantec.

A list of SSL certificate reviews can be found on the following link: g2.com/products/ssl-com/

Step 3: Choose the right hosting package
All websites have to be hosted on a server somewhere. It is important to choose the right
hosting package regarding website speed, uptime, and cloud hosting.

· Website speed: Hosting your website in the same country that you are selling to can have
    an impact on how quickly the website loads. If you are selling to a global market, then
    consider the use of a content delivery network (CDN) to help localise your site to different

                                                                                                                                    227
     CLAIMING

         target countries. Google has hinted that site speed is a ranking factor in its algorithms, so
         there are SEO benefits to having a good host, as well as the obvious user benefits.
     · Uptime and performance: The reliability of the host to keep the website up and running is
         vital. At certain points during the year, such as peak-trading periods, the demand on your
         website will increase significantly. It's important to understand how the extra traffic will
         increase the load on your web server and the impact that can have on the site's performance.
         Too much traffic may even cause the server to trip over and crash, taking your site offline.
     · Cloud hosting: Provided via multiple connected servers, a network cloud, these hosting
         services are seen as preferable to a single or virtual server because of their:
         · Reliability and accessibility: The content is more easily accessible, and there is less

              chance of server failure.
         · Stability and security: The servers will interact to sustain the site, offering more stability

              and more security in terms of not losing any data.
         · Seamless scalability: With cloud hosting you are not limited by the size and capacity

              of your particular physical server. The sky's the limit, unlike physical servers where you
              will need to expand or move to a larger server once you maximise that specific server's
              capacity.
         · Cost efficiency: The cloud removes a lot of the costs of maintaining physical servers.

     Ensure that when choosing your host server, you consider user needs as well as back-end
     applications that need to operate in the background to facilitate orders and other processes.
     Think about your business objectives and if the hosting service you are opting for will be able
     to meet and facilitate your objectives.

     Step 4: Select an ecommerce platform
     When setting up your site, you need to use an ecommerce platform to assist you in building
     and hosting a digital storefront from which to actually sell your products and services. An
     ecommerce platform is the series of software technologies that enable this building and selling
     of products.

     There is a vast range of ecommerce platforms that you can use. These various options can be
     classified under four main types of platforms:

     Software as a service  Third-party providers host applications and make these available
     (SaaS) storefronts     to customers online.

     Open source            Examples include Shopify.com and BigCommerce.com.

                            Open-source platforms provide a more affordable option for
                            online businesses, and offer more control. However, you need to
                            manage the hosting and some expertise is needed.

                            Popular examples include Magento, WooCommerce and X Cart.

(PaaS)                  you opt for is dedicated to development.

                        Some popular examples include Oracle Commerce, IBM
                        Websphere, and the paid version of Magento.

                        PaaS is usually used for B2B where businesses are looking to link
                        their ecommerce to other systems that their customers already
                        have, such as SAP or Ariba. Such integration of systems allows
                        clients to link their purchasing systems directly to their online
                        sales processes, enabling automated purchase orders and stock
                        management. PaaS is ideal for large corporations with complex
                        procurement and distribution systems.

                        Azure.microsoft.com, and Salesforce.com are all examples of
                        PaaS ecommerce platforms.

Step 5: Select your payment gateway             NOTE  Read here about how more and more

2. Authorisation request

The bank's payment processor sends the
transaction data to the relevant credit card association. The bank that issued the credit card
will view the request, and either approve or deny the transaction.

3. Filling the order

Once the processor has received authorisation, it forwards this to the payment gateway.
The payment gateway then sends it on to the website to proceed with processing payment

                                                                                                229
     CLAIMING

     if approved, or to deny the sale if denied. The website interprets the data and creates the
     appropriate response for the user. If approved, the merchant will proceed with filling the order.

     This process takes only a few seconds, and is almost instant for the user. Gateways can also
     be used to prevent fraud and many have inbuilt fraud detection tools, such as delivery address
     verification, computer fingerprint technology, and geolocation, among others (BigCommerce, n.d).

     If you're concerned about online fraud, see this helpful article by Chargebee on types of online
     fraud and how you can protect your site: chargebee.com/blog/protect-startup-online-fraud/.

     When considering payment gateways for your ecommerce site, you have two main options:
     onsite or offsite gateway.

     An onsite payment gateway (also known as a non-hosted payment gateway) means the
     gateway is integrated into your site, and users do not need to leave your site to complete their
     transaction. Iveri and Stripe are examples. Note that to receive online payments, you will need
     an SSL certificate and a merchant account.

     An offsite payment gateway means the

     complete their payment, especially if the process is slowed down by the redirection, and/or

     the user any security concerns about the redirection (GoCardless.com, n.d.).

     8.6.3 Shipping fulfilment

     Fulfilment is a big part of running a successful ecommerce store and can have a huge impact
     on your customer experience. The fulfilment process starts when the order is placed and ends
     when the customer receives the product successfully. There are six stages to the fulfilment
     process:

     1. Inventory management: Ensure your

     stock-level information is accurate and         NOTE  Shopify has a great blog post on eight
     up-to-date. Accurately forecast customer              inventory management techniques to

     levels and plan order appropriately.                  retail/inventory-management.

     2. Warehouse management: Ideally integrate

     your warehouse and stock management with a warehouse management system. This is a

     software application that supports the day-to-day operations in a warehouse. It will monitor

     stock arrivals, warehouse-store transfers, and departure points. The correct and precise

     allocation of stock within the warehouse is critical for fast, and accurate fulfilment. Some

                                                                        eCommerce

    popular examples of warehouse management software include EZOfficeInventory and
    Zoho Inventory.
3. Order management: Ensure you know the order status throughout the fulfilment process
    and integrate notifications of delays/disruptions in the order management process.
4. Destination: To offer customers a successful, fast, and accurate delivery, it is important to
    understand the destination:
    · Home delivery: Delivery to an individual's house, apartment, place of work
    · In-store collection (also known as `click and collect'): Online orders are delivered to

         a physical store, in the customer's chosen area, for later collection by the customer
    · Inter-branch transfers: Stock is transferred from one store to another and purchased

         via an online order or point-of-sale.

5. Returns: To ensure a seamless customer experience, a returns policy should be available
    and well communicated to potential customers. Any returns process should be easy and
    convenient for online shoppers.

6. Order tracking: All orders should be tracked and their progress frequently communicated
    to the customer. Communication should include the status, expected delivery date, and time
    of the order. Any changes to estimated delivery dates or times need to be communicated
    as soon as possible. As mentioned before, customers expect a free, fast and seamless
    delivery which entails more than just pick, pack, and ship.

8.6.4 Driving traffic to your site

To make sales, you need users to visit your online store. Driving traffic to your store is a prominent
marketing and advertising specific objective. Many of the techniques discussed in the section
below will be covered in greater detail in the rest of the course.

You can drive traffic to your store by using the following techniques:

Content marketing strategy: Highly targeted        NOTE  Read more about content in Chapter 10:
and quality content can result in positive social        Planning your content.
influence and ultimately drive traffic to your

website. It is important to create meaningful

content with your customer as the main subject in your storyline. Positive customer feedback

can influence other customers and drive them to your online store.

Product videos: Include videos/360-degree views of your product. Visually experiencing the

product closes the gap between the `touch and

feel' benefits of in-store shopping and the        NOTE  Read more about using video in

                                                                                                        231
CLAIMING

Alias domains: To grow the traffic to your site, it is necessary to capture all potential customers
trying to reach you. Whether they have misspelled the brand name or entered the wrong/similar
name directly into a search engine rather than the address bar; it is important that they still
reach the destination and that this does not become lost traffic.

There are two strategies to owning alias domains:

1. Purchase any misspelled domain names for your brand. For instance, if you type amazonn.
    com, your browser will automatically take you to amazon.com.

2. Own the alias search terms for your brand.

Social media campaigns: There are so many           NOTE  Read more about advertising on social
channels to choose from when opting for social            media in Chapter 17: Social media
media, but it is important to use the right social        advertising.
media platform for the right type of advertising:

· Use images or videos to demonstrate the benefits and details of your product. Good platforms
    for this include Facebook display ads, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat.

· If your product or service targets a professional customer, use professional networks, such
    as LinkedIn or Twitter, to drive thought leadership or content marketing strategy.

· For products or services that rely heavily on social influence, understand the audience,
    then re-target to the happy customer's network.

Customer reviews: Research indicates that customers like to read reviews of a product
or service prior to making a purchase. Encourage customers to leave reviews about their
experience or the product itself.

Customer reviews also provide meaningful feedback to the retailer indicating the response to
new and changing product lines, which products to promote and potentially, which product
to remove from the offering.

Product merchandising and SEO: All elements of online merchandising affect your search
optimisation and directly influence the sale. Product names must be short, searchable,
and descriptive. Product images must be inspiring, detailed, and include specifics. Product
descriptions need to be engaging and original. Text descriptions with well-chosen keywords
will be picked up by search engines. Unique descriptions will prevent you from being filtered
out as spam by search engines.

Landing pages: Direct paid media, such as search, email marketing and display media, should
lead users directly to the relevant product pages and not to the homepage. These pages are
called landing pages. Matching product or category landing pages to users' intent will improve
drop-off rates and increase conversion rates.

       Search: Besides optimising the site for search engines and buying paid search media (Search
       Engine Marketing - SEM), it is critical to include site wide search on your page. To ensure the
       user finds the product, service, or information that they are looking for, include an easy-to-find

232
                                                                                  eCommerce

and easy-to-use search function. Users expect this to be at the very top or top right of your
site, across most pages.

Site speed and performance: To avoid page-abandonment, ensure that the site loads quickly
with the most important elements loading first. Fast engagement time and performance are
essential to keeping the user engaged, and if not considered during development and monitored
on an ongoing basis, could result in a poor user experience or lost customers.

Registration and checkout: The registration process needs to be quick and relatively painless
for the user. It should only request essential information. Sites that ask for too much or
unnecessarily personal information will lose traffic and result in increased drop-off rates.
Checkout needs to be slick, simple, secure, and informative. Checkout needs to be supported
with transactional emails that confirm the user's order ID, order details (product and price
paid), as well as delivery and tracking information.

8.6.5 eCommerce analytics

As with all digital interaction, ecommerce activities can be easily tracked. There are certain
key pieces of information that you need to be aware of and should be tracking. These include:

· Supply-chain management: Information about the products and the process from the
    warehouse through to delivery to the customer.

· Product analytics: Details around how many times a product is viewed, positive or
    negative reviews, social sharing, loading of detailed information on a product, and actual
    conversion rates.

· Online marketing analytics: Success, or conversion rates, of your marketing initiatives that
    enables optimisation of spend for paid campaigns and strategy optimisations for earned
    and owned campaigns.

· Tracking the ecommerce funnel: Can customers find the products they are looking for?
    Can customers add products to cart and check out successfully? Analysing this data
    highlights site speed and performance as well as detailed information about traffic sources,
    high-traffic times of the day, and related conversion rates.

The most popular ecommerce analytics tool is Google Analytics: analytics.google.com. A
powerful and detailed analytics tool, the platform offers many benefits, including:

8.8 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

Throughout this chapter we have discussed some of the benefits of using ecommerce. In short,
with online retail already a trillion-dollar industry and growing each year, to stay in business,
businesses need to be operating online. It is no longer simply nice to have, but is an essential
part of business in the 21st century.
The beauty of ecommerce is that it is easily tracked and monitored. Analytics tools provide
incredible data that can be monitored in real time, and changes can be implemented quickly. It
makes this space dynamic but also incredibly competitive. Online shoppers have more variety
and options than any shopper has ever had before, and catching their attention is more and
more difficult. But, once you have caught potential customers' attention, your ecommerce
platform has to be good enough to keep their attention and guide them through to completing
their conversion.
Besides stiff competition, and being an incredibly dynamic and fast changing environment,
ecommerce has other challenges. There are many factors operated by other service providers,
or that are simply beyond your control. Issues, such as crashing servers, slow data, errors on
external payment gateways, or faulty links in display ads, all impact negatively on your brand,
even though you have little to no control over such issues. If a user is trying to access your
online store, and these issues negatively impact their experience, it is your store that they
associate this experience with.
Choosing appropriate service providers who can meet the needs and future demands of your
site is key, so take time to carefully consider and review your options when setting up your site.

   When Chipotle rolled out a mobile app, it did not properly consider its impact on the
   stores; they started to examine how to leverage the app to add value to customers, rather
   than contributing to their frustrations.

                                                                                                                                    235
            CLAIMING

       The problem

          Chipotle was growing at a rate of 200 restaurants per year in the USA, but the introduction
          of a mobile app was resulting in long waits and queues for people using the app, as well
          as customers wanting to order in-store. The company's CEO, Brian Niccol, said:

              We also solved another problem that had been hurting our reputation: Those waiting
              in line could see when employees stopped serving them to put together an online
              order, and it annoyed them.
          Chipotle's marketing budget was $150 million per year, but the ROI did not seem worth
          the expense.

       The solution

          The executive team realised that the mobile app did not add value for customers if they
          did not align their in-store experience with the ease of ordering. For this reason, the stores
          were reconfigured in two important ways:
          · Grab-and-go shelving next to the cash registers, where customers can easily grab

               their food. This was instituted along with customer education about how to go about
               finding their food.
          · The creation of a second `kitchen' with separate staff at the back-of-house, which
               focused exclusively on online orders.
          When the pandemic hit, Chipotle also extended their food delivery service to include
          food delivery apps, such as Uber Eats and Grub Hub, which allowed them to reach even
          more customers.
          Chipotle's marketing strategy was also refined for efficiency and `bang for buck.' Moving
          away from local `buy-one-get-one-free' deals, which, according to Niccol, were `defensive,
          expensive, [and] promotion-focused,' Chipotle shifted their marketing to social media and
          marketing.

       The results

          In 2020, Chipotle's digital sales grew by 174.1% to $2.8 billion. This represented almost half
          of all the brand's sales in that year. This was driven by their expanded partnerships with
          food delivery service companies, as well as the use of the mobile app to order ahead and
          collect at the drive-through.

8.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

eCommerce is an important part of operating a business in the 21st century. Not having an
online store can be detrimental to your business. Your ecommerce store needs to operate
alongside your website and online presence.

                                                                                                                                    237
            CLAIMING

       The aim of almost all of your digital marketing tactics is to direct potential shoppers to your
       online store to ultimately convert. Your online store needs to be consistent with your other online
       messages and should provide a seamless experience for the user. The overall user experience
       with your ecommerce platform needs to be sound, simple, and efficient.

       It is also important to note that if your ecommerce platform falls short, and does not provide a
       pleasant user experience, it means all your other marketing efforts have been in vain. Directing
       traffic to your online store is not the ultimate goal; the ultimate goal is conversion. A sloppy
       online store can put potential shoppers off your brand, not just in this instance and online,
       but as a whole.

            CRE ATING

    INTRODUCTION TO CREATING

       Effective marketing is made up of engaging content. This is true for digital marketing, too.
       However, it is not as simple as typing up a description of your product and hoping for the best.
       Rather, an effective marketing strategy is needed to ensure that your content - whether it be
       information, inspiration, or entertainment - is hitting the mark and is aligned to your customers'
       values, desires, and needs.

        In Creating you will see that crafting appropriate content, based on your consumers' recep-
       tiveness, needs to deliver to your brand's promise. The first place to start is to consider your
       brand essence - who are you, and what are you trying to say? Once you've worked that out,
       you need to think about the resources available to you to develop and create content.

       In Chapter 9: Content marketing strategy, you will focus on the role that content marketing
       strategy plays in the marketing strategy as a whole, and the steps you need to take to put this
       in action. Bad content is as effective as no content; in fact, bad content is probably worse than
       no content. Be mindful of this before hitting Publish on a web post or video upload.

       Closely linked to the creating process is the importance of content-related research. In
       Chapter 10: Planning your content the focus is on reaching your target audience, from
       creating a content planner to the execution where you customers click on the CTA button.
       You will see how publishing in the right channel in the right format is important. For example,
       if you're targeting young, wealthy executives, email will probably be a waste of your time, as
       they generally don't have the time or headspace to engage with marketing emails.

       Chapter 11: Content creation: Copy focuses on online or digital writing, where customer
       personas determine your style and format of your ad copy. You will see that targeting early
       adopters requires a different language, but that all copy needs to be strong, clear, and easily
       readable.

       In Chapter 12: Content creation: Video the differences between copy and video content, both
       requiring different skills sets and considerations to be truly effective, are discussed.

       In Chapter 13: Social media you will see that this landscape facilitates the conversation
       between brand and customer, where the connectedness can either be useful or negative. You
       constantly need to monitor your brand advocates and influencers since they are powerful allies
       in building your brand reputation online.

       By the end of this section, you will understand that all your marketing efforts should feed into
       building your online brand community. You will have a better understanding of what goes
       into creating a compelling content marketing strategy, and how to leverage this for maximum
       engagement with your customers.

     CRE ATING

     9.1 INTRODUCTION

     While the phrase `content is king' has been referenced for some time, it is only in the last
     decade that content marketing strategy has been solidified into a discipline of its own. Defining
     content marketing strategy can be tricky, however, with some practitioners focusing more on
     the role it plays in information architecture, and others believing that it should be considered
     on a campaign-by-campaign basis.

     This chapter looks at content marketing strategy from a holistic perspective, as a process
     that includes an understanding of all the content your brand is creating, those for whom it is
     intended, and for what purpose. Content marketing is important for positioning your brand
     in the minds of consumers. As a content marketer, you need to understand the brand and
     consumer context and be able to craft appropriate content based on user receptiveness and
     channel appropriateness. You also need to select the best route to customer in terms of tactics
     and understand how content marketing fits and contributes to your overall marketing strategy.
     Ultimately, the design and the content should motivate the user enough to share the content
     with others.

9.3 DEFINING CONTENT MARKETING

Content marketing is an umbrella term that focuses on matching content (information, inspiration,
or entertainment) to your customer needs at whichever stage they are in the buying cycle or
customer journey. Unlike TV, where the advertiser pushes messages to a captive audience, the
focus is on engaging content, which means that marketers must think like publishers (attracting
an audience) rather than seeing themselves as advertisers (buying an audience) of a product.
The internet has, in many respects, cut out the middleman. Consumers and brands can now
connect directly through a number of easily accessible online platforms.

Defining this form of marketing, the Content Marketing Institute offers the following definition:

   Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing
   valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience
   -- and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action (Content Marketing Institute, 2017).

This description applies to all the spaces you share content: both traditional and digital. This
includes printed magazines, booklets, and promotional material, as well as your social media
space, website, campaigns, competitions, and company blog. The way that information is
shared is also important.

Kristina Halvorson (2010) suggests this model for approaching the different areas of content
marketing strategy:

                    Substance                 Workflow

                               Core strategy

                    Structure                 Governance

Content components                                        People components

Figure 9.1 A model explaining content strategy

                                                                                                                               247
            CRE ATING

       When creating content it is necessary to ask and answer the following questions:

       Content components
       · Substance: Who are you trying to reach, and why?
       · Structure: Where is your content? How is it organised? How do people find your content?

       People components
       · Workflow: How does your content happen?
       · Governance: Do you know the politics, guidelines, and standards that your brand operates

            in? (Halvorson, 2010).

       As you can see, Halvorson suggests that one consider the bigger picture of content creation
       rather than just the product, which is the end result. Content marketing looks at staff, tools,
       processes, and outcomes. The end goal for these processes is conversion. All content should
       be created with a strategic outcome in mind. Such outcomes could include talkability, referral,
       affinity, and, ultimately, purchase or increased usage of your product or service.

    9.4 STRATEGIC BUILDING BLOCKS

       Before you create any content, you need to look at the strategic building blocks that underpin
       your company's narrative. Let's unpack this.

     9.4.1 Translating your brand essence

       The brand essence sums up the unique attributes of a brand and the basis for its emotional
       connection with customers. Remember that your emotional connection with your customer is
       the very thing that differentiates your brand from your competitors. Your brand essence should
       help to define a tone of voice for your label and the style in which it engages with its customers.
       The brand essence can be a useful guide for ensuring that the content you create (and your
       marketing activity) represents the brand appropriately. You can relate this to your brand story.
       What is your reason for being? How do you connect that with the interests of your customers?
       What is the value you add to your customers' lives? Is it convenience, health, status?

       Consider a brand like Mercedes Benz. Their essential product is transportation, but the brand
       offers so much more than that to its customers. For example, it provides a sense of safety and
       security; customers know they are driving a car with the latest safety technology. But the brand's
       most powerful aspect is the sense of achievement and status that owning a Mercedes Benz
       provides. The value of the brand is less about the product itself and transporting passengers,
       and more about the feeling and status the customer gets by owning the product.

       `Will It Blend?' is a video series by Blendtec, which builds on this principle. Blendtec produces
       industrial blenders. Their value proposition is that they can blend anything. Their viral marketing
       campaign consists of a series of infomercials demonstrating the Blendtec line of blenders. In
       the show, Blendtec founder Tom Dickson attempts to blend various unusual items in order to
24 8 show off the power of his blender.

             Figure 9.2 Blendtec produces a series of entertaining videos focused on
                   blending objects discussed in popular culture, such as iPhones

9.4.2 Market research and consumer personas

The sweet spot for content marketing lies in an intercept between the marketing goals of a
brand, the brand personality as it guides and differentiates that brand in the marketplace, and
the consumer motivation for paying any attention to a brand at all. One device that is used in
addressing consumer needs is the development of a consumer persona.
A persona is a profile that a writer creates to embody the aggregated characteristics of the
target audience for whom they are writing. It helps to personalise the brand. Personas are
based on the profile of users of your content. Creating a profile is all about considering the
characteristics of your customers and their needs and desires.
For example, a brand like Philadelphia Cream Cheese could have a couple of customer personas.
On the one hand, it can represent a busy father, who works full time, but still wants to provide
healthy and nutritious lunches for his family.
On the other hand, it can represent a young foodie, who wants to try new recipes she finds
online from international celebrity chefs to impress her friends at dinner parties.
Each persona would require slightly different approaches when developing content. Both
would benefit from videos featuring recipes. But while one would likely appreciate regular,
basic options for lunchboxes, the other would probably prefer a celebrity endorsement or a
celebrity-hosted video featuring finer, more elaborate meals.
It's important to focus on the motivations of the persona that you may create, rather than
exterior signifiers that lead to the creation of a stereotype. With this in mind, reconsider
the above personas. A busy father, who works fulll time, may still be interested in creating
elaborate, healthy, and nutritous lunches. Similarly, consider the gendered binary here (i.e. men
don't have time to cook, women have all the time). The persona assists you in segmenting

                                                                                                                                    249

and understanding your target market and is a framework through which you can guide any
content that you create.

9.4.3 Creating content themes

Linked to the brand identity are certain themes or concepts. These are areas of focus that
support the creation of content that match a consumer's interest. These themes must be true
to the brand essence, not focused directly on sales, and should also speak to the interests of
the audience.

               Figure 9.3 Content themes can be considered in line with the brand's
                      essence, and then situated within the context of the reader

Consider Coca-Cola, for example; consumer interests filtered through the brand essence of
`taste the feeling' could result in themes such as refreshment, joy, friendship, and enjoyment.

These themes are then used as the basis on which to develop content ideas.

                         Figure 9.4 Coca-Cola expresses their brand essence in all of their
                                communications, as demonstrated in the Tweets above

In the above tweet, we can see how a particular content theme was translated into a question
that is focused on relationships and family. It also encourages engagement from the audience
by asking for their input.

Another example which demonstrates this is how Corona beer brought their brand essence to
life through an interactive documentary. The essence of the brand is to live the extraordinary
and provide amazing experiences to its customers. The documentary depicted a group of
people from Bulin in China, officially the town furthest away from any ocean in the world,
encountering the ocean for the very first time. A truly extraordinary and amazing experience,
facilitated by Corona. You can view it here: coronaextra.eu.

9.4.4 Matching content formats to objectives

Information can be presented through any number of mediums, which is both an opportunity
and a challenge faced by content marketers. Traditional print distribution allows for magazines,
pamphlets, and even events. Digital distribution allows for videos, images, interactive info-
graphics, GIFs, live photos, live video, cinemagraphs, and any number of other formats. To
gain and keep the attention of consumers/users, it's sometimes not enough to rely simply on
text-based forms of content. The role of the content marketer is to select the right medium
based on overall objectives, production capabilities, and the needs of the audience. Consider
Figure 9.5 on the next page, which illustrates different forms of content that support different
objectives.

As discussed in Chapter 4: Strategy, determining your objectives is an essential part of your
marketing planning; it should feed into your content marketing strategy, and ultimately the
business strategy. Understanding the journey your consumers go through as they approach
your sales goal will enable you to match content formats to their needs. A humorous video
may be successful in initially making potential customers aware of your brand. However, once
you have their attention, a research paper or useful case study could be more effective in
convincing them that you are the best choice in the market.

PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is one of the largest international financial consulting firms,
offering a range of financial services and advice across the globe. Every year they publish
valuable content and guides to assist their customers with tax and wealth management. You can

There are many examples of online journalism using multimedia to convey information most
effectively to their users. The New York Times has presented a number of different methods
for conveying complex information in an engaging manner. `Snow Fall' by John Branch is one
example: nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek.

The New York Times also often publishes infographics that demonstrate this principle powerfully.

Because users consume content across multiple screens, multimedia is necessary to ensure you
keep the audience engaged, and they do not get bored with your content. See this infographic
on the importance of exploring different types of multimedia with content marketing: blog.
marketingv2.com/the-importance-of-multimedia-content-in-your-marketing-strategy.

To take advantage of these various forms of content delivery, it is necessary to build the correct
capabilities. But how do you determine what forms of content you need?

9.4.5 The content audit

Once you have established your marketing goals, your brand personality, and a guiding
understanding of who you are trying to reach, the content audit is a necessary but sometimes
laborious next step. The content audit involves a review of all the existing content supplied by
the brand, such as the website, white papers, articles, videos, and content shared on social
media sites.

An assessment can then be made of how well these pieces of content match the strategic
needs of the brand, its audience, and the appropriateness to the chosen channel.

While you can either thoroughly immerse yourself in this process or attempt to get a more
time-efficient overview, the goal is to map what is currently on offer versus what is needed to
achieve the strategic objective. It is important not just to understand what you have and who
accesses it, but also how it is currently organised, through which channels, and how often it
is accessed by your audience.

Many practitioners suggest the use of a spreadsheet to achieve this. Content can be found
to be either mismatched to the goals of the organisation or spot on. Most importantly, you
can establish what is missing. Are your customer needs being addressed? Where do the
opportunities lie?

9.5 CONTENT CREATION

In 1995 Steve Jobs famously said: "There's just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in
between a great idea and a great product" (Harris, 2019). It can be easy to assume content
creators simply generate imaginative ideas, write (or record) them, and then publish them as
a blog post, email message, or other content piece. Let's dive deeper into creating compelling
content, and how to leverage this for maximum engagement with your customers.

9.5.1 Learning from publishers

Referring to a brand as a publisher refers to expanding the function of the marketer or brand
manager, and opening up additional opportunities to influence and/or convert. Rather than
focusing on the immediate sale or conversion, a publisher focuses on value and interest for the
user and building a relationship based on supplying information, inspiration, or entertainment that

                                                                                                                                    253

suits the customer's needs. Makeup.com by L'Oreal is an oft-cited example of a brand publishing
useful tips and content that does not link to a product or sales directly, but demonstrates how
the brand can facilitate the lifestyle consumers desire or aspire to. In content marketing, a
brand has to give customers more than just the product or service.

9.5.2 Resource planning - thinking like a publisher

Content marketing touches on a number of departments in an organisation. Marketing, sales,
customer service, corporate communications, human resources, and website management
teams should all be aware of the content marketing strategy for a business. Coordinating
content between these teams can be challenging, if not impossible, if turnaround times are
tight. This is why it is important not only to look at where content production should live in
your organisation, but also to map the workflow of content creation, an essential function. Are
designers involved? Where does quality control take place? Where can a piece of content be
adapted and reused on a different distribution channel?

Some organisations opt to have a central role for someone to oversee content; others build
in-house departments. Factors to consider are budget, creative control, approval and sign off
processes, objective perspectives, and full-time versus freelance resources. Whether you are
outsourcing to a publishing house or training a team in house, the decision must be made and
planned for so that workflow can be mapped to facilitate your strategic needs.

9.5.3 `Always-on' content planning

Given that a large part of the global population is constantly engaging with content via various
digital devices and platforms, it is necessary to consider content creation in terms of not only
short campaign bursts, but ongoing delivery and engagement. Consider the illustration below.

                  Content frequency // An `always-on' approach

By constantly engaging with audiences, which is well suited to social media, for example, it is
possible to build and maintain a relationship with customers/users. As illustrated in Figure 9.7
constant engagement is built by a constant presence and amplified by shorter-term campaigns.

9.5.4 Content models

Your organisation's content requirements and objectives should determine the structure of your
content teams. Do you have a need for ongoing content creation, or are there less frequent,
high-input forms of content that will benefit your organisation? There are many models that
are constantly evolving, so invest in some research around what will suit your organisation.
We have outlined two approaches below, namely stock and flow.

Stock and flow

Stock content refers to bigger, beautiful assets that require more investment and age well,
meaning that they will be interesting in six months as well as today. `Inside Chanel' by Chanel, is
an example of this. High-production value documentary type videos are created and sponsored
by the brand to achieve awareness and develop brand affinity across its target market. You
can visit the Chanel channel on YouTube here: youtube.com/user/CHANEL.

Figure 9.8 The Time of Chanel - Inside Chanel. Stock videos
        created to achieve awareness and brand affinity

Flow content has a lower production value and a quicker production and publishing time frame.
Images depicting what is going on at a business on any given day, for example, freshly baked
goods at a bakery, can be placed in this category. Weekly or even daily blogs, as well as event
and holiday themed content, would all be considered flow.

Both types of content should be considered for balancing out a content strategy. It can also be

useful to consider destination and distributed content, i.e., content that you are either sending

out to the world through various platforms and networks, or which pulls your user towards a

page on your website or an article on your blog. Rather than focusing solely on driving users to

your owned media spaces, such as your website, consider how to create content that engages

with your target audience in the spaces and platforms they use online.                                                         255

     9.6 CONTENT CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION

     There's no return on investment if your content doesn't reach viewers and readers. Engaging
     content needs to reach the customer, otherwise all your efforts are in vain. It is not a case
     of loading more keywords in your content; you also need to understand what constitutes
     high-quality content for the major search engine's algorithms.

     9.6.1 Algorithmic curation

     Algorithmic curation is a term that refers to the algorithms that platforms have created for dealing
     with information overload. Various platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, and the search engine
     Google, use algorithms to filter out the amount of information that is delivered to users. Each
     algorithm will use a number of factors to determine what is actually relevant and interesting
     to the user doing a search or looking at their news feed.

     One of the factors that influences whether a piece of content is considered relevant is how
     much an individual engages with the brand's presence on that platform over time. Posts shared
     by a Facebook page, for example, may reach only users who have previously engaged with
     posts from that page through commenting or liking. It is therefore important to create content
     that encourages engagement and sharing.

     Increasingly, SEO and content marketing have to work together if they are to reach their

     audience and achieve their objectives. Without good content, SEO will struggle, and without

     SEO even good content will not be seen. SEO approaches content differently to content

     marketing. SEO wants the content as narrow and focused as possible, so that they can give

     the right answer to the right user while users

     are searching. It also recognises the need for  NOTE  For more on aligning content marketing

     that focuses on the quality and exposing the

     content appropriately (Postan, 2016).

     Considering that people post 6000 tweets every second of every day (Polgar, 2021),
     algorithmic curation becomes a useful solution to package this massive amount of
     content into a manageable format. However, it also transfers the decision-making power
     from the individual to the platform. This is perhaps the biggest drawback of this process
     as the `platform assumes control of shaping a user's experience with the site and media
     diet.' We experience what some people call the `paradox of choice' which holds that too
     many potential choices degrade our ability to make a selection. Netflix is doing just that
     with their `Play something' function that will automatically play a movie based on their
     algorithm. In this case Netflix is deciding on your information diet (Polgar, 2021).

9.6.2 Understanding channels and platforms

Understanding the channels through which you share content is as important as the crafting
of that content itself. Reaching people effectively will only be achieved if the medium supports
the message and vice versa. Social media, email marketing, mobile marketing, and video
marketing are just some disciplines that form part of your content creation arsenal. The rest
of this book is dedicated to best practice in communicating effectively through the various
digital disciplines available to you.

9.7 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

In order to support the ongoing production of interesting content, it is necessary to have some
planning documents in place. Consider the following:

Brand style guides
This document guides anyone creating content for a brand at any time. What is the tone of voice
and brand personality? How is it best represented visually, and what are the brand colours
and fonts? This can be a challenging document to put together, and it usually isn't the content
marketer who is tasked with doing so, but is essential to aligning brand communications. It
is also a document that tends to be `live,' as it is constantly updated as the brand and content
landscapes evolve and new conventions come into play. Brand style guidelines are also referred
to as Corporate Identity (CI) or Brand Identity (BI).

Content calendars
Content calendars assist the content marketer in planning the material they will be sharing,
across which platforms, and when. The more advance planning is undertaken, the easier it is
to react quickly to tactical opportunities.

                                                                                                                                    257

     Workflow map
     A workflow map documents the path a piece of content takes when it is created. What are
     the steps in approval, how is it optimised for digital publishing, who has final sign off ? Is it a
     duplicate of existing content, and where else can it be used? A workflow map assists you in
     streamlining this process. It is useful to have this graphic overview of the process. The workflow
     map stipulates the order in which the work is to be completed, and show who is responsible
     at specific points.

9.8 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

Content marketing can position your brand as an expert through the sharing of useful content
in your specific field. It also enables you to reach the customer who has a fragmented attention
span spread across many devices and content touchpoints.

One of the more powerful benefits is that you can learn a lot about your target consumer
through the content with which they do or do not engage. The more targeted and ongoing your
content, the more data you can gather about how effectively you are reaching those you need to.

One of the great challenges in content marketing is providing content that is truly interesting
and engaging to the right people with the right mix of subject matter and brand. Matching
content to the required outcome for your strategic purposes takes dedication and focus. In the
context of ongoing content production, it can also be a challenge to maintain levels of quality
over time, which is why process and quality assurance steps must be put in place. Consider
that the goal is not to create as much content as possible; rather, it is to focus on relevance
and content that matches strategic outcomes.

                                                                                                                               259

      9.9 CASE STUDY: TOSHIBA AND INTEL: THE BEAUTY INSIDE

           Toshiba and Intel, two electronic giants, wanted to boost
           awareness of their respective brands.

       One-line summary

           Toshiba and Intel paired up to create an extremely successful social storytelling campaign
           that refreshed the `Intel inside' slogan and boosted awareness of the new Ultrabook.

       The problem

           Intel and Toshiba both wanted to create an opportunity to interact and raise awareness with
           younger consumers, aged 18-34 years old. They knew they didn't want a regular ad, but
           something that would really engage the audience and get them to interact with the brands.

       The solution

           The solution presented itself as an interactive social film called `The Beauty inside.' The film
           starred real Hollywood actors and was a film about a character named Alex, who wakes
           up every day as a different person. On the inside, he is the same, but on the outside, he
           looks like someone different. The story was about the fluid nature of identity and that
           despite outside appearances, it is what is inside that counts.

                           Figure 9.13 `The Beauty Inside' campaign for Intel and Toshiba
           The campaign included a strong social element. Due to the changing nature of Alex, he
           could be played by anyone, and fans were invited to audition via the brand's Facebook
           application for the role. Those chosen would star in the professionally filmed episodes
           with real Hollywood actors. Additional audience-created content was also shared in the
           Alex story on the Facebook page.

   · 97% YouTube approval rating

3. What, in particular, do you think drove the dramatic lift in brand perception for both brands?

9.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

Content is a significant component of many digital marketing disciplines. When creating
content, you should always keep the principles of writing for the web in mind.

Email marketing: This relies on great content since most people suffer from email fatigue. They
will only stop to read emails that they know are of high quality and that provide excellent content.

Social media marketing: This depends also on sharing relevant and valuable content with
social fans. While your brand promise may get users to your social page, your ongoing stream
of quality content will encourage customers to interact and share, spreading the word about
your company. If your content is great and really resonates with your audience, it could go viral.

Search engine optimisation: This is strongly influenced by the quality, frequency, and value
of content. Not only will search engines favour your site, but others will choose to link to your
content, creating a valuable referrer for your brand.

                                                                                                                                    261
            CRE ATING

       Video marketing: This is a whole new approach to content, in which you create dynamic and
       shareable videos specifically tailored to the interests and needs of your audience.

       Mobile marketing: This requires that you consider the unique requirements of your audiences
       across a series of devices. If you understand the role that each device plays in a user's life and
       buying cycle, you structure content according to user purpose and frame of mind.

    9.12 SUMMARY

       Content marketing presents a pull mechanism for the marketer rather than a push one. It's
       a gentler approach to traditional advertising and product or price promotions. Brands must
       consider their brand identity and the market they are trying to reach in order to create targeted
       and valuable brand content that delivers on strategic objectives.

       It's about more than creating a piece of content. Content marketing strategy looks at how you
       structure your organisation to create that content and how you match specific types of content
       and methods of delivery for achieving strategic outcomes.

       These ideas need to resonate with people rather than simply existing across an array of media
       with which they are presented.

    9.13 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

       1. What is content marketing strategy? How does it compare to business strategy?
       2. Why is the customer journey or buying cycle relevant to content marketing strategy?
       3. How do you decide what new forms of content your brand needs?

     10.1 INTRODUCTION

     Now that you have a solid understanding of the role of content marketing and developing
     your content marketing strategy, it's time to start planning. You would have learned about the
     overarching themes, messages, brand essence, and other guidelines that derive from your
     brand and marketing strategy. For consistency and brand alignment, your content must always
     adhere to these strategies.

     As part of successful content marketing, developing a content plan that produces engaging
     content is essential because it provides the structure that decides what, when, where, why, and
     how an activity or initiative will be executed to meet the marketing objectives. A content plan
     relies on the content strategy to guide its deliverables because it outlines your goals based on
     your audience, industry, and competitor analysis. Your plan will focus on the details that show
     what you are going to do and how you will use the resources to achieve the expected goals.

     In today's always-on, technology-driven environment, it is essential for any business with a
     digital presence to connect with people with the right message at the right time. This chapter
     looks at how to create a content plan that delivers, reaching and exceeding these goals.

10.3 DEFINING CONTENT PLANNING

The content plan is a complete structure that documents how you will create and disseminate
your content for optimal audience engagement and reach. It also outlines who is responsible
for creating the content, what the content's purpose is, and how it will impact your overall
content strategy. The content plan includes all your marketing assets and data needed to
achieve your business goals. You'll use it to research, create, publish, and track your content.

The purpose of content planning is to create meaningful, relevant content that will connect,
engage, and inspire your target audience to buy your product or service. It will focus on
growing the audience either in numbers or in support of the brand. A successful content plan
will consistently attract customers and build brand loyalty over time.

The diagram below shows a content planning approach from the theme through to execution:

         Content planning approach

                 essence

Figure 10.1 Content themes are considered in line with the brand's essence in the context of
                                                      the reader

When planning your content, use your theme as the basis for your topics to target your
audience. Your brand positioning and promise will determine the essence, tone, and style
of your content, and the environmental context will influence the point of view (POV) and
execution of your content.

· Fun and enjoyment                                 branding/brand-essence-examples/.

These themes are then used as the basis on which to develop content ideas.

                                                                                                  267

       Content strategy focuses on application to achieve your objectives. It may also be more

       comprehensive than the content marketing strategy, because it should include all the content

       that exists in the business, in addition to the content that you will be creating.

· Who oversees your content?
· Who will produce your content?
· Who is going to maintain your content?
· Who is responsible for the results?
· What is your destination?

Your content plan will put all the answers to these questions into action.

10.4.1 Content themes

Content themes, or pillars, should form part of your content strategy. You can focus on key
themes or topics to guide your content production rather than trying to write about everything
under the sun. Make sure they are themes that tie back to your brand in some way; relevance
is key in building your brand's community through content and storytelling.

The themes you choose should be underpinned by your brand essence, which acts like a
branded `filter' through which you view that content theme. This way, whenever you create
content, it ties back to the brand via one of the content themes.

A brand could, for example, have innovation, sustainability, and people pillars - these would
tie into the brand essence, and each piece of content they create would relate to one of these
themes in some way. A car brand and an alcohol brand could both use sustainability as pillars,
but their content execution would differ based on brand essence. You need about three to
five pillars to give you enough structure but also some leeway in the content you can create.

          focal point of every content theme you create

CRE ATING

How do you create your content themes the right way? In earlier chapters, you learned about
your brand essence. What is your reason for being? How can you connect that with the interests
and needs of your customers? How can you create an emotional connection with them? This
brand essence will contribute to your choice of content themes.

The themes also need to be relevant to your target market. For example, a financial institution
isn't going to offer information about new recipes - this could have a negative impact on their
credibility. However, a small business with a lot of face-to-face interaction with customers
could share some behind-the-scenes insights on a regular basis.

Let's look at an example. A brand selling energy drinks has the brand essence `energy for
people on the go.' The target market is adults who work hard and play harder, and who earn
enough to have some luxuries in life. The content pillars will focus on this. They could choose:

· Extreme sports
· Work life
· Living the high life.

These themes will give you direction for the        NOTE  Read more about content pillars here:

10.5 CONTENT RESEARCH

Before you start to think about creating your own content, you need to do some research to
make sure you know exactly what you want to communicate, to whom, when, where, and how.
To do this, you will use the information from your content marketing strategy that will include:

· Your brand essence
· Your audience
· Your customer experience
· Your marketing objectives and goals.
What's left? You still need to know what kind of content you already have so that you can
decide what you still need to create. This requires a content audit.

10.6 CONTENT AUDIT

A content audit is a thorough account of all the content your business currently has, where the
gaps are, and what needs to be created going forward. As with any project, it's vital to figure
out where you stand before you can start moving forward. Here's the step-by-step approach
to performing a content audit:

Step 1: Make an inventory of existing content
Examine all the brand's existing channels, including online, mobile, offline media, advertising,
brand collateral, and any content published elsewhere on behalf of the brand, like press
releases or interviews.

Look for any content publishing or output channels that are already in operation. For example,
you may have a monthly email newsletter for which you create content articles or news pieces.
Social media is another channel that may already have a content production process in place,
even if it has not been formalised under this name.

Any manuals, handbooks, help guides, or other customer support materials that your company
has produced are also content.

List all the content that you find in a spreadsheet and be as detailed as possible. Include the
following:

· The subject matter of the content
· Its format (e.g., image, video, infographic, research paper)
· The channel it is published on (e.g., website, blog, brochure)
· The quality of the content
· The purpose of the content (e.g., educational, promotional, informational)
· Whether the content is still current and relevant or out of date
· Whether the content can be reused or not (considering any rights or exclusivity deals)

                                                                                                                                    271
            CRE ATING

       · For online content on your website, include some web analytics data, like how many views
            and links the specific web page has.

       Step 2: Identify gaps and problems
       As you catalogue your content, you will pick up problematic content and areas where something
       is missing. You may find no content that addresses a key customer persona, or you may have
       discovered that you have focused too much on awareness without creating excitement and
       purchase intent.

       To help you identify any problems as you work, ask:

       · What are the business goals and objectives for each channel? Are they being met effectively?
       · What are the customer's goals and needs from the channel or content? Have these been

            addressed?
       · Are there any likely problems, points of confusion, or complexities that the customer is

            likely to face? Have these been explained or mitigated adequately?
       · Is existing content valuable, interesting, and relevant? Can it be improved, perhaps through

            multimedia like images, videos, interactive tools, or downloads?
       · Is the content formatted to be accessible on the relevant devices that customers are likely

            to use?
       · Is the level of information uniform? For example, do all product pages have a help guide,

            features list, or explainer video?

       Make note of any kind of content that the brand needs but doesn't have. Perhaps a new product
       lacks a user guide, or the company's `About us' page is entirely out of date.

       Step 3: Fix the problems
       Now that you know what the problems are, you're unlikely to have the resources to tackle them
       all at once. To begin, catalogue them in order of urgency and importance. Three categories
       should do it:

       1. Must be fixed immediately: Some gaps or problems need to be addressed straight away,
            like missing key product information or customer support materials. These should be
            addressed by engaging your content creators and providing them with the business need
            and persona to address as soon as possible.

       2. Can be addressed through ongoing content creation: Since you're about to embark on
            a long-term content strategy, think about whether any of the problems can be addressed
            by the content you plan to create, and move this up the queue. For example, customer
            support materials can be generated through blog posts, forums, videos, and more. You
            could even make this a regular content feature (`top questions of the week').

       3. Not urgent: This is a `nice-to-have' that can wait until someone has a free moment. It can
            be slotted into the content production schedule without disrupting existing workflow.

10.7 CONTENT MARKETING WORKFLOW

Once you've done your content audit and know what elements need to be added to your
overall content plans, you will still need to know exactly what process any piece of content
goes through when it's created, and who's involved. That's the content marketing workflow.
You should identify three phases:

1. Planning: Major decisions will be made and research performed here. Consider timelines,

content types, objectives, possible destinations, and consultation with experts.

2. Creation: The content team works on producing the content. Different media has different

timelines and production processes. For example, a blog post can be written in a few hours,

a video could take days or weeks, and a conference could take even longer.

3. Quality control: The finished content

should be checked and approved by           NOTE  Online tools like Percolate by Seismic.com

is published.

Think about this example: A free online guide would start with expert consultation and
research, an outline that would need to be approved by the expert and the marketing
manager, and images that would need to be briefed in with the designer and scheduled
with their line manager. Several drafts of writing later, you'd need to do some copy
editing, layout, expert review, managerial approval - and then, assuming no changes
are necessary, you could publish it.

10.7.1 Planning

Content planning requires examining multiple aspects of where your content will be placed,
what will go into it, and how often it will be created. Your end goal is to create a content
calendar and conversation plan.

Know what you have

You can't create content without the right resources to do so. Know what you have available,
and what you might need for any content you come up with. The Content Marketing Institute
points out three components you'll need to consider:

1. Talent: You need writers, researchers, developers, designers, and outreach specialists
    (relationship-builders)

2. Tools: You will need tools to help you manage and collaborate as a team
3. Operations: You need to consider the following:

    · Organisation: Focus on strong objectives and have processes written out
    · Measurement: Measure according to established metrics
    · Feedback: Consult with your team; should be able to provide feedback as well. Don't

         rely only on metrics.
                                                                                                                                    273

Matching content formats to objectives

Information can be presented through any number of mediums, which is both an opportunity
and a challenge that content marketers face. Traditional print distribution allows for magazines,
pamphlets, and even events. Digital distribution allows for videos, images, interactive info-
graphics, GIFs, live photos, live video, cinemagraphs, and any number of other formats. To
gain and keep the attention of consumers/users, it's sometimes not enough to rely simply on
text-based forms of content. The role of the content marketer is to select the right medium
based on overall objectives, production capabilities, and the needs of the audience. Consider
the illustration below:

           Awareness  Purchase

Emotional

Rational

                      Figure 10.5 Different forms of content will support different objectives

       As discussed in Chapter 4: Strategy, determining your objectives is an essential part of your
       marketing planning. You should feed into your content marketing strategy and ultimately, the
       business strategy. Understanding the journey your consumers go through as they approach
       your ultimate sales goal will enable you to match content formats to their needs. A humorous

      Editorial calendar (content plan)

       We're about to introduce you to the terms editorial calendar, content calendar, and conversation
       plan. These terms are often used interchangeably by content marketers, but we've done our
       best to differentiate them for you.
       An editorial calendar, or content plan, is a broad, longer-term outline of the content the brand
       plans to publish, based on its content pillars or themes. It has many benefits:
       · You can schedule content in advance, ensuring that everyone agrees with deadlines,

            format, and theme.
       · You can identify gaps in your content schedule so that you can fill them before it becomes

            a problem.
       · You can plan around key company news and other scheduled events, like a conference,

            public holiday, or historical date. You can also keep track of significant sports events,
            festivals, holidays, and more.
       · You will have room for structured flexibility. For example, if you have two product reviews
            planned for month end, and one product makes the news, you can change the order in
            your schedule without any confusion.
       · It creates and manages audience expectations. Regular posting of specific kinds of content
            on specific channels and themes can give your fans a sense of familiarity, confidence in
            your brand, and anticipation.

some room for changes and flexibility - but you should list at least a few planned posts per
week for a month. Conversation plans can be created in a table as a word document or in an
excel spreadsheet and should include some basic information.

10.7.2 CONTENT CREATION

Once you have all your research done, it's time to start thinking about content creation. You
can have a vague idea of the content you want, but you shouldn't start developing until you've
thoroughly planned out your content. In the content creation process, you will identify a new
topic that you want to write about, in line with your brand and content theme, and decide the
form you want the content to take before creating it.
There are a few easy steps you can follow to create content for your brand and marketing
objectives:
1. SEO research: Write quality content over a long period of time to ensure your brand ranks

    high in search engines. Keyword research will also help you decide on what content you
    want to create based on your search for specific phrases online.
2. Ideation: Once you've decided on the keywords you want to target, it's a good idea to
    brainstorm some content ideas. These will follow the content themes and topics in line
    with your brand and marketing strategy. Using all of your ideas, you can start populating
    your content calendar.
3. Writing/Creating: Always remember to write to your customer. Use titles and keywords
    that would appeal to your audience in ways that resonate. Think about creating something
    unique, but stick to one idea that will successfully carry through your message.
4. Editing: This process is important to maintain your tone, style, and brand persona. It also
    ensures consistency in how you communicate with your audience and what they have
    become accustomed to hearing about from you. Consider having someone else look at
    your content too - you may find the feedback useful.
5. Uploading: Once you have your content written and ready, share it on a common drive
    or content management system for the team to view, or to simply store it for later. This is
    valuable for storage, tracking, and measuring.

                                                                                                                                    277
            CRE ATING

       6. Publishing: This step of the process seems simple enough but often, requires some thought.
            You may want to publish your content immediately or save it for the optimal time to publish.
            You may also use this step to plan ahead for future announcements, reminders, or similar.

       7. Promoting: To promote your content, think about where your customers are and use those
            channels. Whether they are on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, it's important to
            advocate your content to reach, connect, and engage.

     Writing tips

       We have already covered copywriting basics in an earlier chapter. Here are some reminders
       and few quick tips:

       · The length of your content should match the platform. Twitter needs shorter text posts than
            Facebook (though Facebook posts should be short as well!). YouTube can support longer
            videos than Instagram or Snapchat. Blogs can support longer articles than social media.

       · Make your writing scannable.
       · Write content that your audience wants to see. Do some research to find out what they're

            lacking.
       · The topic of your content should match the platform. Snapchat and Instagram are both

            highly visual, but Snapchat is far less formal and carefully arranged.
       · For longer content, make sure your headline or subject line (for emails) is enticing and

            exciting.
       · Write content at a frequency that matches your chosen channel.
       · Research hashtags before you use them. Several tools can help you find hashtags that are

            current and will help you get your content found.
       · Use keyword, and theme your content.
       · Check spelling and grammar! Very little makes a brand lose credibility faster than simple

            misspellings, particularly on short content.

     Curation vs. creation

       Creating content means producing your own tailored content for your brand. Curating, however,
       is collecting content from other sources and posting it - with the correct attribution - on behalf
       of the brand.

       A mix of curated and created content takes pressure off the content team to constantly create
       something new, especially in a market where it's difficult to come up with completely fresh
       and unique material. It also allows the content team to spend more time and resources on the
       brand's created content.

       Curating content in the age of social media is standard practice if you give proper credit to the
       authors. Trusted curators can amass a large following because they provide the valuable service
       of condensing a lot of digital noise into a few hand-picked pieces. Even without creating your
       own content, curation can help you become an opinion leader and key influencer.

                                                         Planning your content

Although it can be faster and easier than creating your own content, curation takes time,
diligence, and care. You have to find the best sources and consult a really wide variety of
resources, as well.

Technology can help you with curation and creation. Listening to online conversations, by
following them on social media, researching Twitter hashtags, or doing general social listening,
can give you a great idea of where to start.

Twitter lists are curated groups of Twitter accounts. Consult the following website and create
your own: help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists.

Google Alerts is a tool that helps you check for internet activity around certain keywords or
search terms. You can find their guide here: wikihow.com/Use-Google-Alerts.

Even when you're sharing other people's content, make sure you include your own take on it.
Your followers need a reason to be following you rather than the source of the content. Don't
be afraid to take a stand and add your own insights.

10.7.3 Channel planning

A channel is the place where your content will be published. This can include, among others:

· Email newsletters
· Social media (which includes all social media platforms, from Facebook and YouTube to

    Pinterest, TikTok, and Google+)
· Your website
· Blogs.

Social media is one of the most important channels to consider since it takes up a huge amount
of people's overall time online. Most consumers expect brands to be active on around three
social media platforms, with Facebook topping the list.

about who uses each platform and whether it

fits in with your objectives. Research to find

out where your target audience is. Remember, you need to go to them rather than expecting

them to come to you. Get to know your audience; you should know that Gen Z or Zoomers are

extremely online. Zoomers use social media to learn about new brands, whereas 73% of Baby

Boomers use it to stay connected with family and friends (Sproutsocial, n.d.).

You might find that the organic community that forms around your brand on a social platform
is not your intended audience, so you'll have to think carefully about how to appeal to your
target users. People use social for many reasons, and it appeals to a variety of personality
types. You'll probably want to target different types of social media users. Consider who you're
looking to attract, and remember that this will have an impact on the kind of content you create.

annoy them. Some research shows that for smaller businesses, posting more often means a
higher number of overall clicks, but reduced engagement per post.

     networks, but Facebook is popular across generations

You will need to test to see which frequency works best to maximise engagement for your brand.
Remember that the ideal frequency will vary by platform. The following posting frequencies
are a good place to start:

· Facebook: 2 posts daily                        NOTE  Buffer Social gives some more detail in

     of each channel and platform, like word or character count. For social media, tag other brand
     profiles referenced in your post by adding the brand handle and including the @ sign. You could
     even include the list of hashtags you'd like to include for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
     If your post includes a link (URL) alongside your copy and an image, use a customised link
     shortening tool like bitly.com to make the link destination clear to your audience. For blog posts
     and email newsletters, hyperlink anchor text so that the link destination is clear.

     10.8 APPROACH

     Now that you know which channels you want to use, you can't just jump in and start posting.
     You need to know what kind of approach you're going to take. There is no definitive approach
     to content marketing. Let's look at a few models, though sometimes contradictory, so that you
     have some idea of how to apply, merge, and adapt them to your brand.

     10.8.1 Stock vs. flow content

     Stock content is your brand's permanent, timeless, and often expensive content. This is usually
     created with high production values, made to last and to represent the fundamental qualities
     and values of your brand. This might include an `About us' video, a prospectus, or a brochure.
     This content populates websites and offline marketing materials.

     Flow content is the fun, quick, and disposable content that the brand creates. It tends to be
     cheap to create and is intended to be timely and shareable so that the brand can produce
     it regularly. The content shared on social media, blogs, and email newsletters is usually flow
     content, which can include short text posts, photos, and low-production-level videos.

     Flow content can move at different speeds, depending on the medium. Twitter and Facebook
     posts, for example, generally become obsolete in a matter of minutes, while a blog article can
     be shared and relevant for a week or more.

     If you're not sure whether a piece of content is stock or flow, simply consider whether it will
     still be relevant a year, two years, or even ten years from now. If it will be, it's probably stock.

282
                                                       Planning your content

Look for the difference between direct brand promotion and contextual content. If it's based on
current events, competitions, user-generated content, or short-term how-tos, it's probably flow.

10.8.2 Always-on vs. flighted

A flighted marketing campaign is a specific, once-off marketing push to promote a specific
product, special, or deal. Someone who sells flowers will probably have a Valentine's Day-themed
campaign in early February. Flighted campaigns carry a specific message and are time-bound.
They end after the objective has been achieved.

Always-on content is not built around a          NOTE  dennysdiner.com has an excellent

online, including social media, blogging, and
email newsletters.

As a content marketer, you have three options for how to allocate your content marketing budget:

1. Always-on or continuous content
2. Flighted content
3. A mix of both, also known as pulse content.

In digital, you will find that a mix of both is

probably the most effective, which means         NOTE  onedayonly.co.za has some great pulse

customer-focused campaigns. The always-on

content keeps customers engaged and maintains your share of voice in between your bigger

marketing pushes, keeping general engagement higher and reducing the intensity of the dips.

Refer to Figure 9.7.

10.8.3 Tactical marketing

Tactical marketing (also known as real-time marketing) is challenging, but it can be a worthwhile
content approach if you can devote the time and resources to getting it right. Tactical marketing
means creating real-time content around events, trends, and memes that are currently happening
to take advantage of the buzz.

Great real-time content should be:

· Relevant: Trends change fast; don't miss the moment. Make sure your trends are relevant
    to your audience, as well.

· Insightful: You need to add something to the discussion or add some kind of value, even
    just humour, rather than take advantage of it.

· Tasteful: The content you create needs to be sensitive to the trend you're capitalising on.

                                                                                                   283

    10.9 MEASURING YOUR CONTENT

       It is impossible to know whether or not your content is achieving the objectives you've set out
       without measuring its performance. Measuring content performance against your goals will
       help you decide what works and what needs to change. We cover some of the most effective
       ways to measure content in this section.

     10.9.1 Objectives and KPIs

       In general, the objectives and KPIs of the content plan will be specific to each business and
       are derived from your marketing plan. As a standard, when it comes to your content strategy,
       you need to know what you want to achieve to measure the following:
       · Audience reach through views, page visitors, and time spent on the platform
       · Audience engagement and activity, including likes, comments, shares, and conversation
       · The number of leads reached and generated (sign-ups and/or sales).
       Let's examine this in a bit more detail.

10.9.2 KPIs and metrics

Whereas KPIs measure progress toward specific goals, metrics relate to the performance of
your content.

KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a metric that you use to see whether your tactics are
meeting your objectives. Deciding which KPI is important for each objective will help you focus
on what matters to a campaign.

KPIs answer the question: "What data do we need to look at to see if goals are being completed?"

KPIs are determined per tactic with an eye on the objective.

The goals for our website traffic campaign were:

· Arrive on the website (this is the most important one!)
· Spend at least 2 minutes on the website
· Click/act on a CTA.
What do we look at to see if it's achieving these goals? What are our most important metrics?
Overall, we would want to look at:

· Number of website visitors
· Average time on site
· Number of conversions (clicks on a given CTA).
We also want to look at metrics specific to the tactics we're using, though, as long as those
are also relevant to the objective we've chosen. So we may want to consider:

· Content marketing
    · Most frequently visited page (to indicate which content is most successful)
    · Time spent on specific pages

· Social media (with paid promotion)
    · Reach
    · Shares
    · Clicks to website
    · Cost per click or cost per mille (CPM - cost per thousand views)

· SEO
    · SEO ranking.

Note that none of these are about how many people liked or commented on the posts or
how many followers we have. There's an important difference between vanity or ego, metrics,
and performance metrics. A vanity metric might make you feel good about the content you
posted, but it doesn't really have any impact on ROI. A performance metric is how you establish

                                                                                                                                    285

       whether your content marketing is effective. While the exact figures have changed since this
       was published, the Content Marketing Institute's annual study underlines this difference.

      Metrics

       A metric is something measurable that relates to the performance of your content. To measure
       in line with your business objectives, it is important to start by setting clear goals. Once
       you've completed your content audit, you will be able to set specific, measurable, achievable,
       relevant, and time-based (SMART) objectives for your content. Semrush.com published the
       Essential Content Metrics to Track in 2021 that provides a guide to measure and analyse
       content performance for success:

286
                                                                                                           Planning your content

                               Figure 10.12 Content metrics to track in 2021
These metrics show you the different ways to view and measure how your content is performing.
Each essential metric groups key factors that you will use to monitor and track how your
audience is connecting with your brand:
· User behaviour: Measuring how your users are engaging with your platforms can help you

    understand which pages attract them to your site in the first place, and which pages they
    interact with the most. This is also how Google measures your brand's relevance. You can
    understand your users' behaviour through statistics that tell you the number of page views,
    users, new and returning visitors, average time on pages, bounce rates, pages viewed per
    session, and sources of traffic.
· Engagement: These metrics show how your content is connecting with your users. Often
    considered the most important measurement for effectiveness, engagement considers
    upvotes, likes, and shares that show how popular your content is. Shares and comments
    also contribute to your online brand reputation - they should be managed closely to ensure
    it contributes positively to your brand, rather than ruin your reputation.
· SEO outcome: Metrics like organic traffic, dwell time, backlinks, and keyword rankings are
    important activities to track because, not only do they show where your users are located
    and how many found your web page using a search engine, they also measure how long

                                                                                                                                    287
     CRE ATING

         users spend on your web page, links that point to your web page and the quality of the
         domains, as well as how your web page ranks in keyword search.
     · Company revenue: Content that is relevant and engaging for the audience leads to traffic to
         your website and enables you to generate revenue. Although content does not necessarily
         translate to financial metrics and sales, the activities that you should track to measure ROI
         include conversion rates, nurturing existing leads of users who interact with your web page,
         the number of new leads who sign up, and Cost Per Acquisition that will show how much
         you have spent to acquire a new lead.

     These are only a few of the essential metrics to measure your content performance. As you
     can see, there is a lot to view as far as your content and audience are concerned. To ensure
     you stay on track with what you set out to achieve, you should choose the ones that you want
     to focus on.

     10.9.3 Targets

     Once you have decided on an objective, tactics, and KPIs, it's time to set targets. Targets are
     the specific, measurable values that the KPIs need to reach for the objective to be achieved.
     For our chosen objective, we want to reach 1200 website visitors per week by the end of this
     marketing effort. That means our most important KPI, number of website visitors, is very easy
     to assign a target to:

     · Number of website visitors: 1200 per week.

     We also know how long we want people on site:

     · Average time on site: 2 minutes.

     The other KPIs may have flexible targets based on historical performance, current performance,
     and recency of content. You can always change targets as you go. For now, let's set our targets
     like this:

     · Number of conversions: 60 per week
     · Reach on Facebook: 1000 people per week
     · SEO ranking: Top three in Google search engine results pages (SERPS).

     How do we decide which numbers to aim for with our targets?

     10.9.4 Benchmarks                             NOTE  Read more on benchmarks here:

You should examine industry benchmarks to get some idea of how your business is performing.
Make sure to look at your specific industry, since benchmarks can vary widely.

However, what you really want to do is benchmark against your own past performance and
your competitors, where available. Look at what kind of targets your content has met in the
past, and see if you can exceed those. You can also look at the performance of your competitors
and benchmark against that.

Remember, this whole process should be iterative. If your tactics aren't helping you reach your
objectives, change them. If your KPIs aren't helping you measure your success, change them.

10.9.5 Tracking

You can't just decide on KPIs and targets and then wander off into the wilds of content marketing,
never to think about them again. Nor can you post your content and then ignore it completely.
Instead, you need to track your content carefully - the way people react to it and what kind of
responses it encourages - so that you can assess how well it's working and adjust accordingly.

For a thorough look at your content's performance, you may well need to use multiple tools
for different views:

· Google Analytics is a free tool that can tell you a lot about how people act on your website
    and how people arriving from different sources perform in comparison to each other.

· Most social media platforms have their own analytics tool, like Facebook Insights or Twitter
    Analytics.

· Email providers can give you information about how content emails are received.

10.9.6 Engagement vs. influence

Why is it so important to track performance metrics over vanity metrics? Engagement with
your content is great, and you can use it to learn a lot about your target audience, which can
make it valuable as a research tool. However, it doesn't prove that your content can exert any
kind of influence over your consumers. For that, you need to look at performance metrics.

It's tempting to fall into the vanity metrics trap, but now you know enough to avoid doing it!

10.10 CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND AMPLIFICATION

Writing the best content in the world means nothing if you don't put it out in the world and
make sure people can get to it. Content distribution involves selecting the right channels for a
given content piece, and amplification is about using the right methods to increase its reach.

There are many ways to get your content out there. You need to consider the distribution
channel right from the start. The content you produce will all be affected by limitations, like
character restrictions, and practical considerations about what works best where and when.

                                                                                                                                    289
CRE ATING

Remember, you shouldn't launch into the first half-dozen channels you come across. Choosing
the right one is a careful, research-focused process.

We're going to outline some possible channels below. This is not an exhaustive list, but it does
indicate the kind of channels available.

To help you understand them better, we've divided them into owned, earned, and paid channels.
Owned channels are ones the brand controls completely; earned are those where the brand
has worked to build a community (the most important, for most brands); and paid are the ones
where the brand pays a fee to list or promote content.

Owned channels service customers, providing

information and services. Paid channels       NOTE  Read this article on the pros and cons

may or may not be customers of the brand and

draw them in with relevant, valuable ongoing content strategies.

Not all channels fit neatly into one group. In fact, many share characteristics of several. For
example, on Facebook, brands create their own brand pages (owned) where they converse
with fans (earned) and drive traffic with targeted social ads (paid).

10.11 CASE STUDY: AIRBNB

Airbnb is an American company that runs an online marketplace
for lodging, homestays for short-term and long stay rentals,
and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the
platform is globally accessible via website and mobile app, facilitating professional and
safe transactions between hosts and guests for accommodation space.

One-line summary

The business has two primary target audiences - hosts and guests. To successfully build
a sound online reputation and value-driven platform to attract and retain their target
audiences, Airbnb needed a solid content strategy to shape the product experiences.

The problem

A year after it was founded, Airbnb almost lost it all when they realised that they needed to
improve the quality of their listings. With their focus on travellers and hosts, they needed
to attract more people to their platform across the globe. They needed to increase their
reach using content that would satisfy all travel needs.

The solution

More than the business decision to create value around their offering, as designers, the
founders understood the importance of content strategy and planning to guide their
customer experiences. As part of their strategy, they designed Neigborhoods, a guide to
help travellers decide where to stay, what experiences they will gain, and what places their
neighbourhood would have. Neighborhoods was published on their website and mobile
app. The guide included recommendations about food, stays, and nearby destinations
for every type of traveller!

The results

· 10,000+ estimated monthly organic traffic
· 100+ referring domains.
Airbnb prioritised the importance of offering customised content focused on the specific
needs of their customers. This helped increase their brand credibility and engagement.

                                                                                                                  (Source: MBA Knowledge Base)

    10.12 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. What did Airbnb need to understand before creating their content strategy?
       2. Why do you think Airbnb achieved the outcomes that they did by implementing their

            strategy?
       3. Do you think Airbnb would have been as successful if they did not adopt this content

            strategy?

    10.13 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       Creating a strong piece of content or a content campaign takes a lot of research and planning,
       and a strong understanding of your brand and audience. You need to understand your brand
       strategy, create a content marketing strategy, and work to reach very clear SMART objectives.

       Fortunately, with a careful content audit and content map, you should quickly be able to identify
       gaps in your brand's content. You can use this knowledge when you create your content plan
       and content calendar so that you know you're putting in effort when it's really needed.

       Right from the start, of course, you need to know which content distribution channels you plan
       to use so that you can create content accordingly, rather than trying to fit it into the channel
       plan later on.

       By now, you understand that truly successful content planning is about more than just tweeting
       or posting on Instagram at random. It's about strategy, planning, and executing in a way that
       is relevant, consistent, and appealing to your customer.

    10.14 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

       1. What is content planning and how does it differ from content strategy?
       2. Why is it important to conduct content research and a content audit? What value does it

            bring?
       3. How do you determine the best way to reach your customer with your content?

     11.1 INTRODUCTION

     Online copy is a hardworking multi-tasker. It must provide information to visitors, engage with
     them, and convince them to take a desired action, while conveying brand ethos. It also has to
     provide context and relevance to search engines. It needs to achieve all this without seeming
     as if the author is trying too hard to push a particular outcome.

     You will see in this chapter that writing for

     digital is different from writing for more tra-  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 9:
     ditional media. Because of the sheer volume            Content marketing strategy.

     of information on the internet, quality content

     is king. Many people argue that content is one of the most significant determining factors of

     success for your online campaigns. This is not surprising if you consider that it is one of the

     most direct lines of communication with your consumers. Therefore, you will see many links

     between this chapter and Chapter 9: Content marketing strategy.

     Online or digital writing involves everything from the text on a website to the subject line of an
     email and all things in between. From PR articles of 800 words to four-line search adverts, if
     it's being read on a screen, no matter the size of that screen, from desktop computer to mobile
     phone, it's online copy. Writing for digital does not mean the traditional rules of writing need
     to be abandoned. By and large, the foundations remain the same.

11.3 CORE PRINCIPLES

There are a few things you need to take into account when creating written content for digital
marketing platforms. For effective content creation, it is important that you familiarise yourself
with the core principles that we unpack here.

                                                                                                    297

     11.3.1 Writing for an audience

       Knowing your audience is vital if you want to write effective content for digital platforms. It
       guides your content strategy, determines the topics they are interested in, and helps you
       organise information in a way that makes sense to them. It directs how you express your copy
       for your audience.

       Focus on writing your online content in active voice to convey your message clearly and concisely.
       When communicating online, avoid making your sentences too wordy because it can affect
       the meaning and cause confusion. Try to keep your message straightforward and to the point.

       Step one of writing for digital is to ensure you have researched your audience and understand
       what they want. Once you have a clear idea about this, you can figure out how to fulfil those
       needs using your copy. Smashing Magazine (2015) recommends answering the following five
       questions:

       1. Who are you writing for?
       2. What is the main message you want to get across?
       3. Where does the action take place (where will it be read)?
       4. When is it relevant?
       5. Why is it important (what's the goal)?

       For example, your answers might look like this:

       Who: First-time moms
       Message: Our baby kit can help you
       Where: Parenting forums/magazines/social media
       When: Immediately before and after the birth of a child
       Why: Because first-time moms need help (and because we want them to buy our product).

       When researching your audience, there are two useful concepts to bear in mind, the audience
       of one and personas.

     11.3.2 The audience of one

       According to Price and Price, audiences were traditionally thought of as a vast and vaguely
       defined crowd (Price & Price, 2002). Because the web provides a voice to individuals and niche
       groups, the concept of this mass audience is disintegrating.

       Price and Price (2002) go on to argue that the internet has led to an audience of one. What
       does this mean? While your audience is not literally one person (and if it is, thank your mum
       for reading your copy, but spend some time growing your readership), it is not a vast, vaguely
       defined crowd either. Instead, the web has many niche audiences who are used to being
       addressed as individuals. Indeed, The Economist Group (2015) confirms that personalised
       marketing is becoming more granular, helping to create specialised customer experiences
       that will keep them coming back.

The individual that you have in mind when you are writing could also be called a persona.
Take the time to think about how your digital content is consumed in the physical world. It's
usually an exclusive action, so write your copy this way.

11.3.3 Personas

A persona is a profile that a writer creates to embody the characteristics of the target audience
for whom they are writing.
Personas are based on the profile of readers of your copy. Creating a profile is all about
considering the characteristics of your readers and their needs and desires. When you are
building this profile, there are a number of things that you should consider about your audience:
· What gender identity do they identify with?
· How old are they?
· What are their other demographics and psychographics?
Once you understand these simple characteristics, you can ask yourself some more in-depth
questions. If you are selling something, questions could include:
· How do they make purchasing decisions?
· Do they compare many service providers before selecting one?
· Do they make lists of questions and call in for assistance with decision making, or do they

    make purchase decisions spontaneously based on a special offer?
Understanding the reader profiles of your readers is an important process and the best copy
usually results from extensive time spent figuring out your audience.
Tailoring your copy to your audience does not necessarily limit you to one persona.
Digital copy can be structured so that it caters to several personas. Your various marketing
channels may have different audiences, so ensure that you have a persona for each main
platform you use. Spend time understanding their needs before you write copy that addresses
these personas.

11.3.4 Types of online copy

The purpose of content is to communicate a message, whether it is long or short. Communi-
cation implies that the message has been both received and understood. The considerations
covered here are aimed at ensuring that when you distribute a message, it is communicated
effectively to the people you want to receive it.
Content written for digital platforms can be divided into two broad categories, short copy and
long copy. This division is in no way scientific.

                                                                                                                                    299

      Short copy

       Online, writers often have very little time and space to get a message across to a visitor, and
       to entice them to take action. This is especially true of banner and search adverts but is also
       important across all digital marketing disciplines. The most important short copy anywhere
       is probably the call to action.

Call to action
Users scan web pages and look for clues on what to do. Any time there is an action you want
a reader to take, a CTA should instruct them what to do. A call to action is a short, descriptive
instruction that explicitly tells a reader what to do, for example, `Click here' or, `Buy this now.'
Use active verbs when you write, and craft hyperlinks to be clear instructions that resonate
with your visitors at each step in the conversion process.

                        Figure 11.2 Screenshot of a Facebook social ad by MTN
In paid social media ads, CTA buttons are already built in when setting up the advert copy.
You will notice these on your social feed because `Sponsored' will appear directly beneath the
page name, as shown in Figure 11.2 above.
In other instances, it's important to know where to place your call to action so that it makes
sense to a reader's eye. For example, depending on the structure of your page, it might be
better to start with your CTA and then to qualify it. In other cases, ending the page with your
CTA may have a stronger impact on the reader as they may be more likely to act once they
have the information they need to do so. This depends on your product and the action you
want your audience to take.
Banner advertising involves clear calls to action, and they can also be used in social media
posts, search adverts, and content marketing. Call to action copy is not limited to short copy.

                                                                                                                                    301
        CRE ATING

     Email newsletters and promotions should also make use of calls to action. We even see them
     all over web pages. Each piece of online copy should be written with a CTA or at least with
     the question, "What's next?" in mind.

     Figure 11.3 CTAs should be clear and enticing

     A good call to action resonates with the action the users need to take, as opposed to the
     technical function that will be performed. For example, if a user has entered an email address
     to sign up for your email newsletter, the action button should say `Sign up' rather than `Submit.'
     Be sure to write your instructions for humans. Always think about what real people prefer to
     read and how they will benefit from their action. In this instance, the CTA does not need to
     read `Sign up.' It could also read `Stay in touch,' `Count me in,' or similar, to make the reader feel
     like they need to be included for fear of missing out.

     Also consider what actions mean offline. For an email newsletter, `Sign up' can have very different
     connotations from `Subscribe.' Furthermore, `Subscribe' is very different from `Subscribe for free.'

     Whereas subscriptions have connotations            NOTE  Since the call to action is key to

Titles, headlines, and subject lines need to be both persuasive and enticing. Consider what
need your copy is meeting for your readers, and express that first. Highlighting a benefit to
your readers upfront means they are more likely to engage, even if they don't necessarily need
your product or service at the time.

Search adverts                                   NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 18:
                                                       Search advertising.
Search adverts have very limited space and
time to get a message across and there is
plenty of competition for a reader's attention.
These few lines of copy need to work hard to
ensure a top return on investment.

Search adverts typically follow the same basic structure and have strict character limits for
each line.

It can seem daunting to communicate information that entices the right people to click through,
and also differentiates you from your competition with a limited character count. Testing
variations of copy is the best way to determine what works best for your campaign. While
content writers are not generally responsible for writing paid search ads, they are often brand
custodians and should review all copy representing a brand.

Ad extensions

An ad extension is simply an extension of your ad. It offers more information on your business,
service, or product that can add value to your target audience. Some of the benefits of using
ad extensions are maximising text on your ad, like including your location or contact number
that gives browsers the necessary details to act. It also allows you to add your key messaging
to attract the right audience.

                                    Figure 11.6 An example of a Google Ad extension

       There are several ad extensions to choose from, including sitelinks, callout extensions, and
       snippets. Including an additional sitelink to your ad will direct browsers to the page that
       you want them to visit, while a callout extension offers you the opportunity to highlight
       special keywords that get you to stand out from your competitors, such as `Limited Edition,' or
       `Convenient location,' or `Free delivery.' A snippet extension, however, gets into the specifics
       of your offer and may include details that you know your audience will buy, such as special
       product features or benefits.

Social copy
Social media allows brands to have conversations with their customers and fans. It's an oppor-
tunity to engage and connect meaningfully with your audiences, which is why it's important
to write your copy like your customers speak.
Using some colloquialisms and jargon that your customers will understand is one way of
personalising your message. If your brand is targeting audiences from different parts of the
world, continent, or country, adopting language localisation in your social copy will allow you
to get closer to customers in the targeted regions. Remember, you want your audience to feel
like your brand understands their pain points, challenges, and needs.
Social conversations give consumers a powerful voice and the ability to tell brands what they
want. There are a few considerations to keep in mind when creating content for social media:
· Do your research: Understand what type of content community members want. Meaningful

    and relevant content is more likely to be shared. Hashtags are fairly important for many
    platforms. Research any hashtags you use to avoid making costly mistakes, like DiGiorno
    did with its use of the #WhyIStayed hashtag. This hashtag was part of an awareness
    campaign for domestic abuse and was used in tweets explaining why users had chosen
    to stay in abusive relationships.

                                       Figure 11.7 DiGiorno research fail
· Remember that it's a conversation: Be personable and appealing. Use personality and

    convey the humanity of your brand in order to generate conversation and encourage
    comments.
· Write shareable content: Offer value and be insightful. Ultimately, you should aim to
    create an overall perception that your brand is the thought leader in its industry. Shareable
    content is credible content.

                                                                                                                                    305
CRE ATING

· Avoid overly promotional content: Think about how your content can be used. Community
    members are likely to see right through a sales pitch. Remember, with content, value to

the reader should come first, with value to the brand as a secondary consideration.

· Implement a solid communication                NOTE  All of these points are covered in more

    organisations to follow on how they use and        Chapter 14: Social media strategy.
    communicate on social media platforms.

This also ensures consistency, which is very

important for creating a brand personality for readers to engage with.

                                 Figure 11.8 Relevant and on-brand social media copy

      Long copy

       Online content writing is not just about short, sharp calls to action and attention-grabbing
       headlines and adverts. It also covers longer pieces of content.

       Longer copy has advantages. Primarily, it allows you to provide more information and encourage
       the reader to convert. You can foster a relationship with a reader, whether it is on a blog, through
       email communications, or through articles and news releases. With more words and space
       available, you are able to build a voice and a personality into your writing.

       The expression `long copy' is somewhat misleading. As online readers behave slightly differently
       from offline readers, it is unlikely that a skilled writer will be called on to create copy for the
       web that is longer than 800 or 1000 words per page, although, there are exceptions to this.

       Long copy needs to be structured and formatted so that it's easy for attention-starved web
       readers to digest. Web users tend to scan pages quickly to determine whether or not they will
       read further. Specifically in longer copy, you need to take this into consideration.

There are many types of long online copy - including website copy! Here, we will focus on a
few that are useful for marketing, such as news releases, articles for online syndication, emails,
blog posts, advertorials, and websites.
Bear in mind that this is by no means an exhaustive list.

News releases
News releases are a staple of public relations. As the internet grows, so does the overlap
between PR and marketing. Therefore, many content writers are called upon to write news
releases for online distribution as this is a standardised format for releasing information. Originally
intended to provide information for journalists, news releases are increasingly being read by
users bypassing the journalists. This means that they should be written in the brand tone, be
accessible to the general public, and be optimised and formatted according to the principles
of good online writing (more on those later). Also remember to focus on a compelling headline
to win over your reader.

Emails                                             NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 16:
                                                         Direct marketing: Email and mobile.
Email as a channel is an integral part of many
online marketing strategies. Of course, content
is a huge part of this; it comprises the words in
an email with which a user engages.

Emails are the ideal medium for communicating and building relationships with your consumers.
This customer relationship marketing helps to increase retention. Successful email campaigns
provide value to their readers. This value may vary from campaign to campaign. Newsletters
can offer humour and entertainment, research and insight, information and advice, as well as
promotions and special offers.

helps to foster a community around a brand and provides an opportunity to garner immediate
feedback. This is an audience made up of players vital to the success of a company, which is
why it is important to get blogging right. The quality of your headlines is a key consideration.
You have to convince your reader to grant you their attention.

There is plenty to be gained from the process of blogging and obviously, the value, as with email
marketing, lies in the content. This communication channel provides an opportunity for you
to foster an online identity for your brand and gives your company a voice and a personality.
This happens through the content you distribute, as well as the tone you use to converse with
your readers. There is more information on blogging in Chapter 17: Social media advertising.

11.3.5 Website copy

Website copy is a type of long copy. Therefore, the principles that apply to long copy in general
also hold true for websites. Digital copywriters need to structure content effectively so that
users want to engage with the site and read on. This is especially important when people
access a site from their mobile phone, where the small screen size drastically reduces the
content users will see before they scroll. Some ways to create digital copy that is usable and
appropriate for an online audience include:

· Writing text that can be easily scanned
· Using meaningful headings and sub-headings
· Highlighting or bolding key phrases and words
· Using bulleted lists
· Maintaining a well-organised site.

It is important to take these other considerations into account:

· Limiting each paragraph to one main idea or topic: The leading sentence should give a
    clear indication of what the paragraph is about. Readers can scan each paragraph without
    missing any essential information.

· Cutting the fluff: Get rid of meaningless turns of phrase and words that unnecessarily
    bulk up copy.

· Removing redundancies: These often creep into writing by accident, but you should work
    to eliminate them in order to get to the point.

· Including multimedia wherever relevant: Some readers may be more partial to video
    than reading, for example, see nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek.

as their perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency is important when writing for mobile.
Here are some points on creating digital copy for all screen sizes that encourages interaction
and achieves marketing and business goals:

· Get to the point: With limited screen space, there really is no room for wordy text. You need
    to determine exactly what your message is and get to the point quickly! This is particularly

true for content above the fold.

· Put the important bits upfront: This includes contact information and navigation links.
    Word these clearly so that people know what action to take.

· Condense information to its simplest form: Ensure that it still makes sense and is
    grammatically sound.

· Use a call to action upfront: Mobile web       NOTE  Once users have decided to navigate
    users are goal-oriented. Therefore, provide        further into your mobile website, you

    them with the next step early on.                  pages.

· Make use of headings and subheadings:
    Breaking up the copy with headings and

sub-headings allows the reader to scan

before committing to the full read of the text.

11.4. IMPLEMENTING WRITING FOR DIGITAL

Apart from the information already covered, writing good copy involves a number of points
and best practices that you should keep in mind.

11.4.1 HTML for formatting

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the foundation of documents on the
web. HTML formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. They allow you
the ability to format text without using CSS. They tell browsers how to present content. HTML
tags are written in brackets that look like arrows < >.

Basic HTML is not difficult to use, and will help you format your content. Here are some basic
HTML tags:

          To bold: <b>phrase you want to bold</b>
          To italicise: <i>phrase you want to italicise</i>
          To underline: <u>phrase you want to underline</u>
          To list: <li>lines you want to list</li>
          To create a paragraph: <p>paragraph text</p>
          To insert a line break: <br>
          To insert a link: <a href="page url">phrase you want to link</a>
          To insert a heading: <h1>Level one heading</h1>
          To insert a subheading: <h2>Level two heading</h2>

                                     Figure 11.12 Mobile-optimised copy
A good digital content writer will also be able to use basic HTML to lay out copy knowing that
the appearance of the page will get their words read. It should be easy for users to skip and
skim the copy, and it should be easy for them to find the parts that are most relevant to them.
When writing online copy, you can use an HTML editor where you insert the tags yourself or
a `What You See Is What You Get' (WYSIWYG) editor, which works in a similar way to a word
processor.

                                                                                                                                    311

     The tags also help search engines to identify      NOTE  Right click on any web page and click
     how the content has been laid out on the page.           'view source.' Can you find the paragraph

     The best way to get to grips with HTML is
     to start using it online, where you can see
     first-hand how the tags work.

     11.4.2 SEO copywriting

     A good online copywriter will have a thorough understanding of SEO and how this can be
     integrated into their writing. Key phrases can be used in long and short copy alike, to great effect.

     Optimising for human and machine users

     One of the most notable differences between        NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 21:
     writing for print and writing for digital is that        Conversion optimisation.
     when it comes to the latter, you are writing not

     only for an audience, but also for the search

     engines. While your human audience should always be your first priority, your copy also needs

     to speak to the search engines in a language they can understand. This digital tactic is covered

     in greater depth in Chapter 21: Conversion optimisation.

     Optimising your copy for search engines is important because your target audience is most
     likely to be using a search engine to find the products or services you are offering.

     If the search engine is not aware that your content can give users the answers they are looking
     for on a particular subject, it won't send traffic to your website.

     Optimising your content for search is the process of telling search engines what content you
     are publishing. Keywords, key phrases, and themed pages are an integral part of this. Google
     is becoming increasingly semantically aware and can recognise synonyms, so repeatedly using
     specific keywords is no longer important; instead, good SEO copy focuses a page around
     particular themes, using keywords relevant to those themes.

     SEO copywriters need to know how to blend keywords into their content and how to use them
     in conjunction with text formatting and metadata. In addition to assisting you with structuring
     your content, these tags indicate relevance and context to search engines. Some of the tags
     are used by screen readers, and so they assist visitors with technical limitations to access
     your content. The meta description can also be used by search engines on the search engine
     results pages (SERPs).

     Key phrases                                        NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 21:
                                                              Conversion optimisation.
     A keyword refers to a single word used in a
     search query, while a key phrase refers to more
     than one word used in the search query.

                                                      Content creation: Copy

Key phrase research is an important element of digital copywriting. It is covered in detail in the
discussion on SEO in Chapter 21. Having identified the themes of your web pages, keyword
research should be used to identify what phrases your target audience use when searching
for you. It is important to know what people are searching for, so that you can provide what
they need.

Once you have a good idea of the words people are using to find information online (online tools
exist and can guide you), you can create pages themed around the use of these phrases and
their synonyms. A good copywriter is able to develop these themed pages and use keywords/
synonyms seamlessly, so that the reader cannot detect that they have been included.

Key phrases can be integrated into nearly every type of content that you write for the web.
Below are a few places where Red & Yellow tends to include key phrases and synonyms on
our website.

Page title
The page title appears at the top of a user's browser and should be able to tell the user (and
the search engine spiders, of course) what the main theme of the page is. The page title is
usually limited to under 60 characters, including spaces. The key phrase should be used as
close to the beginning of the title as possible, followed by the name of the company or website.

Page URL
The main key phrase for the page should be used whenever possible in the URL for the page.
If you are using a blogging tool or content management system (CMS), the URL is generated
from the page title, so using the key phrase in the page title should ensure that it is in the
URL as well.

                   Figure 11.13 The Red & Yellow School homepage URL

Meta description

The meta description is a short paragraph       NOTE  Every page on a website must have
describing the page content. This summary             a unique URL, page title, and meta
is usually shown on the SERPs if it contains          description.
the search term, which means that it needs

to entice users to click through with a strong

CTA. The spiders use the meta description to deduce the topic of the page, so using targeted

key phrases is important here. Copy should generally be between 150 and 160 characters,

including spaces.

                                                                                                    313

                                        Figure 11.14 Example of a meta description

      Meta titles
       Meta titles should be less than 60 characters and need to include a keyword. Adding spacers
       that are low in character use help to keep titles short. Example: Freshly Baked Goods & Custom
       Cakes | Primrose Bakery.

      Meta keywords
       Meta keywords are the list of the words and phrases that are important on a web page. Using
       targeted key phrases is important, but remember, no keyword stuffing! The meta keywords
       are limited to 200 characters, including spaces. This is, however, no longer a major source of
       information used by search engines, though it certainly doesn't hurt to include these.

      Headings and subheadings
       Spiders assign more relevance to the text used in headings, so it is important to use your key
       phrases in the headings on your page. It also helps you to structure your content. Headings
       are created with HTML tags.
       Heading structures are set out like this:

                          · <h1> Main page headings

                                      · <h2> Sub-headings
                                      · <h3> Information under the sub-headings

                                               Figure 11.15 Heading structures
       Having a good heading hierarchy is important as spiders use it to move through your page and
       understand its relevance to the search query; it also helps human readers to scan your page.

      On-page copy
       For on-page copy, remember that you will be optimising for a theme rather than for a set key
       phrase. This means you want to use relevant synonyms, as well as your keywords, without
       being overt about it - they should not stand out too much.
       For SEO effectiveness, a page of web copy should be at least 250 words long. On this page,
       use keywords and synonyms that fit the theme as and when required.
       The page should not be so long that the user needs to scroll continuously to get to the end of it.
       If you find the page is getting exceptionally long, consider breaking it into different web pages

for different sections. In this way, you could add several pages of optimised copy focused on
one theme instead of one very long page. This will benefit your reader if they are looking for
something that is particular to the shorter page.

Images: Alt text and title tags
Alt text refers to the `alt' attribute for the <img> HTML tag: this is the text that appears in the
caption. It is used in HTML to attribute text to an image on a web page, normally to describe
what an image is about and display text in instances where the image is unable to load. While
this is handy for humans and aids accessibility, it is also used for another reason; namely,
search engine spiders can't read images, but they can read the alt text. The image title tag
shows when you hover with your mouse over an image, depending on your browser, and can
be read by the search engine spider. This will help users find your images on Google's Image
Search, which can be helpful in driving traffic to your page.

11.4.3 Best practices for online copywriting

Now that we have covered the basic theoretical principles of writing for digital, we need to
look at the best practices to apply whenever you are writing copy for publication on the web.
There are several things that you need to consider:

1. Does your copy convey a creative idea?
2. Does the layout of your copy make it easier to read?
3. Is your meaning clear and direct?
4. Does the copy convey the features and benefits necessary to make your point (if applicable)?

                                                                                                                                    315
     CRE ATING

     5. Will your readers clearly understand the content of your writing?
     6. Is the content of your message structured in a logical manner for desktop and/or mobile

         reading?

     The rest of this chapter will be dedicated to ensuring that you have the knowledge and tools
     to answer these questions.

     Conceptual copywriting

     Most of the points in this chapter have focused on the practicalities of writing online copy, such
     as getting information across and encouraging user actions and engagement.

     Copy should also be creative, beautiful, and thought provoking.

     Your copy should express an idea that grips readers. Conceptual copywriting is about making
     an idea memorable merely by using words to express it. The idea is central, and the words are
     the vehicles that convey it. Clever wording, smart ideas, and thoughtful copy should make the
     reader pause, think, and want to engage more deeply with your idea.

     While images are often used to express powerful ideas, words can be just as effective. Consider
     this famous example, which demonstrates how a small change in the copy can radically affect
     one's perception of an idea:

     A woman without her man is nothing.

     A woman: without her, man is nothing.

     Writing conceptually means conveying a brand message in a creative way to make an emotive
     connection with a specific audience. It's all about bringing a big idea or concept to life.

     Layout and legibility

     As we have mentioned already, readers process content differently online from the way that
     they read offline. On the web, readers tend to scan text rather than read every word.

     As a result, online copy is judged at a glance by its layout, not just on content. It needs to look
     as if it's easy to read before a user will choose to read it.

     Digital copy should be easy to scan. This means using clear and concise headings, bulleted
     and numbered lists, short paragraphs, bold and italics, and descriptive links.

     It's easy to see this in practice.

Language

The basic principles of good writing apply online, but because your audience's attention is
limited and often divided, it is best to keep it simple and tailor your language to your audience.

Tone: The tone of your content should be consistent with the brand for which you are writing.
Brands will often have full tone-of-voice documentation. If they don't, read some of the brand
material to get a feel for the company's style of communication. Compare the difference in
tone in the examples below.

Example of Tone A: Investec

Whether you are an individual, a business, or an intermediary acting for clients, our aim
is to create and manage your wealth. Investec provides Private Banking and Wealth &
Investment services for every stage of your journey.

Investec's strategic goals and objectives are based on the aspiration to be recognised as a
distinctive bank and wealth manager. This distinction is embodied in their entrepreneurial
culture, which is balanced by a strong risk management discipline, client-centric approach,
and an ability to be nimble, flexible, and innovative (Investec, 2022).

Example of Tone B: Nando's

The story of Nando's starts hundreds of years ago with the first Portuguese explorers
who set sail for the East in search of the legendary spice route.

Lured by the promises of our beautiful continent, they came ashore and there, under
our famous sun, they discovered the African Bird's Eye Chilli or as we know it (and love
it), PERi-PERi. Unique in its properties, they used it to create a one-of-a-kind sauce that
ignited the fires of passion inside them.

A few centuries later, in 1987, it was the same PERi-PERi sauce that inspired Fernando Duarte
to invite his buddy Robbie Brozin to a small Portuguese eatery in Rosettenville, South Africa,
to try some PERi-PERi marinated chicken. In his own words, "I knew nothing about the
food business. I just knew that it was the best chicken I had ever tasted" (Nando's, 2016).

                                                                                                                                317
           CRE ATING

       Active voice: Grammatically speaking, people expect characters to execute actions that have
       an impact on objects or other characters.

       For example: The girl ate a chocolate.

       · The girl is the subject.
       · Eating is the action.
       · The chocolate is the object that is affected by the action.
       This is known as the active voice. Unfortunately, writers often use the passive voice. This turns
       the object into the subject, forcing the reader to think more carefully about the sentence. For
       example: The chocolate was eaten by the girl. The human brain automatically translates this
       into the format that it expects. When writing for the web, it is better to use the active voice.

       Neologisms and buzzwords: Sometimes the World Wide Web is referred to as the Wild Wild
       Web, as it is an environment where anything goes. The ever-growing numbers of social media
       participants, for example, habitually play fast and loose with grammar.

       With new services and products being developed daily, it can feel as if the list of new words,
       and their uses, is growing faster than you can keep up with. Dictionaries and reference guides
       celebrate this regularly with a `word of the year,' usually one that has been in heavy use on the
       internet for the three years preceding its entry into a dictionary.

       For example, in 2021 the Oxford English Dictionary voted `vax' the word of the year to reflect the
       global COVID-19 pandemic which `injected itself into the bloodstream of the English language
       in 2021' (Oxford Dictionaries, 2021).

       Online services can quickly become verbs in everyday language, so we say `Googling something'
       instead of `searching on Google,' and `Facebooking someone' instead of connecting on Facebook.'
       Bing is still trying desperately to work its way into everyday conversation in this way.

       Always remember you are writing for your users so talk in the same way that they talk. If your
       content is aimed at cutting-edge early adopters, then pepper it with the latest buzzwords. If
       your audience does not know the difference between Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari,
       then be cautious when using a word that did not exist the day before.

       Features and benefits: Writing compelling copy means conveying to readers why they should
       perform an action. While features may seem all-important, you need to communicate the
       benefits of the features to the user.

       Communicate the benefits in a way that makes the user think about the product's role in their
       life. Write so that they imagine actually owning the product.

       · Feature: A prominent aspect of a product or service that can provide benefit to users. It
           describes what the product does.

       · Benefit: The positive outcome for a user that a feature provides. It can be the emotional
           component of what the user gets out of the product.

318
                                                                                                         Content creation: Copy

   Why would your audience want to buy your product or service? Put aside the features
   for a moment; what will compel your audience to buy on an emotional level? How does
   it address their wants and needs?

For example, consider a home entertainment system. Features could include surround sound
and a large, flat-screen television. The benefit is a cinema-quality experience in your own home.
Features and benefits are very different. Features are important to the company that provides
the product or service. Benefits are important to those who decide to use the product or service.
Persuasive writing makes use of features, benefits, and active verbs to create appealing
messages for your personas:
Enjoy cinema-quality movie nights in your own home with a surround-sound home entertainment
system.

Logic

The structure of online copy can be compared closely to the structure of a newspaper article.
The headline, usually containing the most important bit of information in a story, comes first.
Online, visitors decide quickly whether or not to read a page. As a result, the most important
information needs to be at the top.
Start with the news lead which is the main idea of the article.

                                                                  News lead

                                                                   Key facts

                                                                Less-important
                                                                    details

                                      Figure 11.18 Information hierarchy
While clever word play in headings can attract some attention, these need to be written in line
with the objective you want to achieve. The copy is multitasking; not only is it informing visitors
of what to expect, it is also telling search engine spiders what the page is about.

                                                                                                                                    319

     11.5 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

     The advantages of good digital copywriting are simple, your content will work better, your
     SEO will benefit, and your customers will find it easier to absorb your material. Clear calls to
     actions can also help to increase response rates.

     However, some challenges do exist. The primary challenge is learning what, exactly, good
     copy is. This is important because bad content can really turn off your customer. Meeting
     SEO requirements without being spammy can be tricky, and you need a clear set of writing
     guidelines for your organisation to follow.

     11.6 MEASURING SUCCESS

     Measuring copywriting performance is important. How else will you know what is and is not
     working?

     Brands often use conversions as the primary way to measure success. If your copy doesn't
     convert, what's the point? The goals that you measure will depend on the goals of your copy.
     If you want to boost subscribers to your newsletter or blog, then the number of subscribers
     will be your measure of success. If you want to increase sales, then the number of sales will be
     your measure. Because digital copywriting applies to almost every aspect of digital marketing,
     you can only measure its success if you have a clear idea of your goals.

     However, copy isn't always just about converting. You can also use impressions, time on page,
     and bounce rate to see whether your copy is keeping people interested and on-site.

     11.7 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

     The Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) formula from Harry McLaughlin can be used to
     calculate the reading level of copy that you have written. A SMOG calculator, and instructions
     for use, can be found on here: readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php.

     Sprout Social has also published a social media character counter to test the length of
     your posts before posting. Take a look at their guidelines here: sproutsocial.com/insights/

11.8 CASE STUDY: YELP

Yelp is an American company that publish crowd-sourced reviews about businesses.

One-line summary

A Yelp salesperson tripled her B2B email marketing
response rate by personalising and humanising email copy.

The problem

Yelp's sales email templates were dry and unengaging. They failed to consider the audience
to whom they were writing, as well as features and benefits. This caused a disconnect
between the brand and its audience. The emails made the salesforce sound, "Like a bunch
of robots ... with no personality" (Medhora, 2015).

The solution

One Yelp salesperson tested a number of more personalised emails and came up with
a formula that increased response rates considerably. She focused on showing that she
was a real person and on building a sense of urgency, and looked like this:
Feature + Benefit + Value + Human Factor = Email more likely to earn a response
For example, for the feature, she would link to a business's Yelp pages. The benefit would be
a description of how the business could grow through Yelp. The value would be indicating
how many leads the business had found through Yelp, and the human factor involved
casual subject lines and the use of emojis. The subject line for the email below was "Re:
Yelp Email Per Your Request - A Response Would Be Appreciated ."

                     Figure 11.19 A personalised Yelp email and its response
                                                                                                                                 321
            CRE ATING

          The salesperson ran a few experiments to measure the success rates of personalised
          emails against Yelp template emails, added some important factors to consider - how the
          copy attracted attention, ignited interest and desire, and encouraged action - and then
          made sure that the email was interesting as well. She also tested a number of headlines,
          or subject lines, to see which had the best response rates.

       The results

          · Her response rate rose from 3.33% to 11.43% (even if some were negative)
          · She learned some important lessons about how personalising your copy, thinking

               about features vs. benefits, and writing for an audience of one can improve responses.

    11.9 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. Why would bad copy in emails prevent users from signing up with Yelp, which aims to help
            businesses grow?

       2. Why do you think the more targeted copy performed better than the more generic copy?
       3. Identify the writing for digital principles (including audience considerations) that improved

            the response rate for the Yelp emails.

    11.10 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       It should be clear by now that online content touches every other digital marketing tactic.
       After all, they all need to communicate messages in text format, whether that's a CTA button
       on a website, a video description, or a long-form press release written for digital PR purposes.
       While content marketing strategy may tell you what content to create, knowing how to create
       it comes down to great online writing skills.
       Writing for digital overlaps strongly with SEO, since copy is the basis of all web optimisation as
       search engines can't read images, videos, or other rich media content. It also overlaps with UX,
       since making a website easy to navigate involves ensuring that your copy matches user needs.

    11.11 CHAPTER SUMMARY

       Online copy is the foundation of a website. It is constantly in view and is usually the focal point
       of a page. Good online copy can also make the difference between a site attracting regular
       traffic and becoming stagnant.
       First and foremost, your writing needs to have the reader in mind. The copy should be strong,
       clear, and easily readable (remember the principles of scannability, including bullet points,
       bolding, short paragraphs, and headings), while still making maximum use of key phrases.

    12.1 INTRODUCTION

       Video is considered the `go-to' form of communication. It offers a rich, engaging, and stimu-
       lating experience for viewers. With the increased availability of bandwidth and improvements
       in video technology, people have started watching and sharing videos on a scale never seen
       before, and it is increasing every year. From music videos to funny clips of animals to reviews,
       how-tos, video streaming, and movie trailers, users are turning to video for entertainment,
       information, and education.

       As a result of the global Covid-19 pandemic, people are watching more videos online than
       ever before, and the amount of online video that people watch has almost doubled since 2018.

       According to Statista (2022), the most popular forms of online video content are:

       · Music videos (51.4% of users)
       · Comedy, meme, or viral videos (37.1%)
       · Tutorial or how-to videos (31.3%)
       · Video live stream (30.4%).
       Google remains the world's largest desktop search engine, with a 92% global market share
       (Statcounter, 2022). The second most popular website by total visits is YouTube, the online
       video-sharing and social media platform. YouTube boasts over 2.1 billion unique users (Statista,
       2022). This indicates that users are turning to YouTube with precise, intent-driven behaviour;
       they're not just browsing randomly or waiting for a link to land in their inbox.

       Understanding how to create and optimise videos for search is an important part of any digital
       strategy since more and more people are using search engines to find video content.

       Every day, about 1 billion hours of video are watched on YouTube, more than half of which
       come from mobile devices. Every minute, 500 hours of video are uploaded (Statista, 2020).
       Other social media sites are getting in on the video action as well. More than 4 billion video
       views happen on Facebook every day (Hootsuite, 2022).

       The introduction of live video streaming websites, applications, and software that allows users
       to broadcast live videos, such as YouTube Live, Twitter Live, Facebook Live and Instagram Live
       have changed the video game. Users spend 10 to 20 times longer watching live video than
       they do pre-recorded video. The element of real time viewing and engagement offers exciting
       interaction for audiences.

       Videos can come from anyone and from anywhere. Small videos can experience massive global
       reach, as was the case with the popular `Charlie Bit My Finger' video, which had accumulated
       886 million views by July 2021.

       Brands use video-sharing platforms to connect with their customers, who are increasingly
       interacting with their brands by creating opinion videos, parodies, and responses. Individuals

have the power to market themselves, their ideas, who they are, and what they do. Video content
helps you connect with your audience, creating an experience and encouraging engagement.

             chosen topic on a video-enabled blog.

    12.3 VIDEO CONTENT STRATEGY

       Videos are powerful because they can have a strong emotional effect on viewers. It's no secret
       that funny, shocking, amazing, and inspirational videos do particularly well online. Video is
       the ideal tool for experiential marketing, giving viewers the chance to experience something
       alongside the onscreen actors and to consider how they would feel or act in that situation. It
       also helps to show off a brand's personality, tone, and communication style.

       Video content is a necessary part of the digital marketing mix. Dr James McQuivey (2014)
       famously exaggerated that, "Video is worth 1.8 million words." Exaggeration or not, video is
       more engaging than any other form of content. Consider these statistics:

       · Video on social media generates 1 200% more shares than text and images combined
            (WordStream, 2021).

       · Companies using video have 41% more web traffic from search, and video can cause a 157%
            increase in organic traffic from search engines (Small Business Trends, 2021).

       · Video on a landing page can increase conversions by 80% or more (Wordstream, 2021).
       · Businesses using video grow revenue 49% faster year-on-year than those that don't use

            it (WordStream, 2021).
       · 59% of company decision makers prefer to watch a video than read an article about a

            product (Forbes, 2017).

       Many people are still under the misconception that online videos are expensive and difficult
       to produce, which is not necessarily true. While the most popular videos are professionally
       produced, for example, the Despacito music video has accrued around 7.7 billion views, the
       many millions of successful home video bloggers - vloggers - and marketers prove that
       low-cost videos can still make an impact.

       Unlike content made for TV, web video content can be filmed at a much lower cost and quality,
       using readily available home video equipment. Affordable high-quality cameras have made
       quality content production a reality for everyone. Viewers don't necessarily expect a super-slick
       offering (though even this is possible with some basic video editing software). To get started
       with making video marketing content, you will need:

       A camera: Depending on what you can afford, this can range from a simple webcam or your
       mobile phone's camera to a (top-of-the-line) professional camera, though there are many
       excellent mid-range options available at a low price.

A microphone: While some cameras have a built-in microphone, it is worthwhile investing in
a proper mic to ensure that you capture better sound quality as built-in microphones tend to
catch a lot of background noise at the expense of the main audio.

Video editing software: You will need a

After Effects), which can be more costly. YouTube also offers an online video editing tool, and

12.3.1 Video content versus video ads

Video marketing covers two approaches.

1. Video content: These are videos made to entertain, inform, share updates, enlighten, or

delight the viewer. Much like syndicated articles or blog posts, these are usually not directly

promotional, but instead provide shareable content that gives value to the viewer. Some

examples of video content include:

· How-to guides, tutorials, and explainer videos

· Conference talks

· Video presentations where video should be used to:

· Inspire, emotionally connect people

· Educate in a fun, informative, and entertaining way

· Reveal the unexpected

· Valuable industry updates                        NOTE  If your company or brand wanted to
· Educational lectures                                   create content videos, what format and

· Product reviews and advice                             approach would you use?

· Entertainment.

2. Video ads: These are simply adverts that are filmed and formatted for online use. These
    can be existing TV commercials that are shared online or custom ads made specifically
    for the web. Statistics about video consumption make a compelling argument for the latter
    over the former. We'll cover a range of options for posting your video ads below, in Section
    12.5.2 Paid video promotion.

12.3.2 Is it possible to go viral?

The Holy Grail of video marketing and, in fact, any marketing on the web, is word of mouth -
having a piece of content `go viral.' This means that the content spreads from person to person
through the web at a very high rate, attracting an exponentially growing audience as it gains

                                                                                                   329
            CRE ATING

       popularity. The key to this viral effect is social media, where each user is connected to a wide
       network of others and can easily share content with their friends. Because this is a trusted
       social referral, it's more likely that they will view and share it themselves, if it's good enough.

           Figure 12.1 A screenshot of the most popular Will It Blend video on YouTube, indicating
                   the number of times it has been viewed since it was uploaded in April 2010

       Nobody quite knows the secret recipe for getting content to go viral, and quite possibly there
       isn't one; the sheer variety and scope of viral videos shows that almost anything might catch
       the interest of the internet on the right day. This means that it's very difficult to craft a video in
       order to make it go viral. Instead, focus on making great content that you and your audience
       will love and that speaks to their wants and needs and then, if you're lucky and your stars align
       just right, your video might go viral. Consider the following:
       · Address a currently trending topic: Find something that users are already excited about

            or interested in, and see how you can contribute meaningfully to the conversation. For
            example, make your own edited version of a viral video.
       · Make it enticing: Craft the video's description, title, and thumbnail so that they draw attention.
       · Make it remarkable: Whether it's funny, astonishing, scary, shocking, or informational,
            your content has to have value for your viewers, and it has to give them social capital for
            spreading it.
       · Make it unique: The internet loves new, fresh, crazy ideas, so don't rehash somebody else's
            success or stick to a formula. Be truly creative and inventive.

· Make it shareable: Include the tools and incentives to make your video easy to share;
    consider social media chiclets, video cards, and encouraging comments.

· Make it short: With very few exceptions, successful viral videos tend to be short, impactful
    clips. Users have short attention spans. You lose around 30% of your audience in the first
    two minutes, with a sharp drop off between 2 and 6 minutes, so make sure you get the
    message across quickly (Wistia, 2016).

12.4 VIDEO PRODUCTION STEP-BY-STEP

Creating video content for the web can be easy and cost effective, but it will always involve
a lot of research, thought, and planning before you even get started with filming. Remember,
you are not making a video series/podcast for a brand you work on or a brand you know. The
content you are creating is the brand.

12.4.1 Know your audience

As always, you first need to identify the audience for whom you are creating this video content.
What are their wants and needs? What video content are they already consuming? Where
are they consuming it? How can you engage their attention, provide something valuable that
fits the platform, and promote your brand at the same time? Some solid market research will
reveal the answers to these questions.

12.4.2 Planning and conceptualising

Planning is your priority for successful video production. Brainstorm some ideas. You will need
to come up with the core concept for the video, which will be determined by what your target
audience wants. If you don't yet know what that is, go back to your target audience and ask
what they need. A few questions you may ask yourself here are:

· Why would they watch/listen to your product?
· What do they need from it?
· Would they be likely to share it with others?
Decide on the best style and tone in which to convey this and then get into what each of your
episodes is going to be about. It should be a logical narrative, each one closely related to your
specific angle. Your episodes can be part of a continuous story, like in a podcast that's about
one story, or different aspects under your topic umbrella.

Once you have decided these aspects, you have what you need to start planning your actual
video shoot. Write a script, or at least prepare a breakdown of what the video should include,
and schedule the shoot. Consider the venue, crew required, actors, and any other props or
elements you will need. How long this takes will depend on the complexity of the video you're
planning and your budget.

                                                                                                                                    331

      Give your product an identity

       Make sure you have a logo for your title. Try not to make it too complicated; a good, strong
       font may be all you need. Just make sure that it's legible. It should look as polished and clear
       as possible.

       For a video series, it's a good idea to have an introductory screen/animation to introduce your
       video. Simply make use of a title screen, but remember to include it in front of every episode
       to give your series consistency.

       If you're making a podcast, add music in the same way you would for a video title screen.
       Choose a signature piece of music for your podcast so that it becomes part of the identity.

           Important: Use music from royalty-free sites. You can't use a popular song unless you've
           actually purchased the rights to it. You can choose from loads of royalty-free music online.
           Check out freemusicarchive.org and filmstro.com. With a little research, you will find there
           are many others to choose from.

       For either video series or podcasts, you can also design cover art. This is the thumbnail that
       comes up in search and as the `profile picture' of your videos and podcasts.

      Watch your sound

       Whether you're making a video series or a podcast, always prioritise your sound.

       Hot tips for getting the sound right:
       · Avoid recording voices in a noisy area. Unless you're a master of audio editing and you know

            how to change the volume on every track, you will struggle to drop the noise behind your
            speaking parts. Resist the urge to record or film interviews in coffee shops or anywhere in
            public where there may be a lot of background noise.
       · If you don't have access to a `dead' sound area (and most people don't), you can record on
            a mobile phone microphone under a duvet in a quiet room for a pretty pro-sounding effect.
            Alternatively, a decent quality of sound can be created in a car parked in a quiet area with
            all the windows and doors closed.
       · Don't run music throughout your podcast. Listeners get very irritated by a constant low
            thrum of music underneath speech. By all means, drop in bits of music for atmosphere, but
            avoid a music `bed' running in the background.
       · If you do use music in your video/podcast, make sure that it doesn't overpower the speech.
            You don't want anyone to strain to hear what is being said.

      It's not just interviews

       Interviews can be great but they seldom make very compelling content. If your video series/
       podcast is merely a series of interviews about your topic, give it some more thought. Unless

332
                                                     Content creation: Video

it is exactly what your target audience wants, there's nothing very engaging about listening to
people being asked questions over multiple episodes, unless every episode stimulates thought,
interest, or entertainment.

To improve how it will be consumed, consider using one or two interviews, interspersed with
some scripting and interesting narrative. Have you really chosen the most original angle you
could have, or is it a bit of a seen-before?

If you are going to use an interview, think about how you could present it. A lot of times, the
part where you ask the question is cut out and the answers given by the interviewee are edited
together into one piece. This helps to make the format a little more compelling.

Remember to tell a story

Share a story or a series of stories but avoid a dry statement of facts. Make sure that you've
done your research for your audience. For instance, few people need to know how to eat a
strict keto diet again. There are a million other video series just like it. Maybe they want to
know how to eat a strict keto diet with practically no money - your research will give you the
cues you need to direct the story.

Be brutally honest with yourself

When it comes to creating digital content, being honest with yourself is very important. After
you've watched/listened to what you've created, and you ask yourself "Would somebody really
download this?", answer honestly. There is no point in creating average content when it's your
product. We're in the business of making content that sells. If it's just okay, go back and see
how you could make it good. If it's good, go back and see how you could make it great. Don't
be content with the ordinary.

Spend a lot of time watching and listening

Watching how other people create successful content is an excellent way to pick up tips and
follow best practice. Look at what they do well, what they don't do so well, and what they could
do better. Then, bring your own production up to speed.

12.4.3 Producing and editing may take some time

It's time to get filming. Once you have all    NOTE  For some helpful pointers and advice on

for editing. Adding any special effects and

other elements to your production can take

time, especially if you want the end product to look and sound professional. Be pedantic and

fussy with your editing process, because you want smooth editing with no jumps, skips, or

disconnects. It may take a few tries to get it right, which is perfectly normal.

     12.4.4 Choosing and uploading to platform

       Once you have the video, you need to decide where you will have it uploaded. There are two
       options for making your video content available online. These are not mutually exclusive and
       there are techniques for both to ensure the best distribution and search coverage for your
       video. For example, you could be embedding videos posted elsewhere on your site or on social
       media, which is where a massive amount of video is being consumed.

       Online video can be hosted on your own site, or it can be posted to one or many video distri-
       bution channels. If you post your video somewhere such as YouTube or Vimeo, it is then easy
       to embed it into your website as well.

       The main advantage of posting a video to a third-party site is the opportunity to quickly exploit
       an already existing audience. These websites also usually have a built-in social and viral media
       aspect to their user experience. Video-sharing sites tend to have simplified algorithms which
       are easier to take advantage of, leading to more rapid universal search exposure.

       Many third-party video hosting options exist. Short-form video platforms like TikTok, Instagram
       Reels and Snapchat have emerged to challenge existing industry giants like YouTube and,
       increasingly, Facebook.

       To gain the most views for your videos, you need to find out where your audience is consuming
       video. Once you discover the platform of their choice, create videos for those specific platforms
       and post them accordingly.

       As mentioned in the planning and conceptualising bullet, you should brand your channel. Many
       platforms encourage adding a logo, branded elements, a brand description, and links to your
       other web properties. You can customise your page as you see fit. Some platforms also have
       a range of analytical features for you to measure engagement and, as an added bonus, they
       work well on mobile devices, too. Using YouTube can help you gain many benefits in ranking
       well on the world's most popular search engine, Google.

       A few more good options for free video hosting include:

       · Facebook: facebook.com
       · Vimeo: vimeo.com
       · Dailymotion: dailymotion.com/us.
       If your video is hosted on your own website, the obvious advantage is that you have control
       over the whole website and the environment in which it is hosted, from the look and feel to
       on-page text, metadata and user experience.

       When it comes to advertising and related content, you control both, and you decide how to
       monetise it.

     You would have learned more about this in Chapter 5: Search engine optimisation. Optimising
     video for search involves understanding the basics of SEO, as well as the particular challenges
     and tactics of optimising video content.

     Search engines rely on being able to use text in the content to determine what it is about,
     and other indicators to determine how relevant that content is. When it comes to web pages,
     search engines can `read' the text on the page to determine what the page is about. Moreover,
     they can measure the links coming in to determine how relevant the page is.

     When it comes to video, although the search engine cannot `watch' or `read' the video in
     the same way that a human can, there are technological solutions that are starting to make
     this possible. For instance, Google Search tries to automatically detect the segments in your
     video and show key moments to users, without any effort on your part. Alternatively, you can
     manually tell Google about the important points of your video by visiting this site: developers.
     google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video.

     To do so manually, it is good practice to include metadata to determine what the video is about.
     The search engine also needs to look for ways to measure relevance.

     Marketers and website owners now need to optimise all forms of content, whether it be for text
     pages, images, or videos, in order to achieve better rankings. Video search engine optimisation
     (VSEO) involves the use of basic SEO foundations and additional creative optimisation methods
     to ensure that online video content appears higher up on the SERPs.

     Optimising video for video-sharing sites such as YouTube means that your video will appear
     in search results on the video-sharing site and also on SERPs such as Google. While each
     video-sharing site will use its own algorithm, the guidelines below can be considered best
     practice across most of the video-sharing sites.

     Video titles are very important

     A video title is one of the first things a user sees  NOTE  If you are creating a video series, use a

     determine the relevance of your video to the

     search query. Your most important keywords

     should appear in the first three words of the title. Longer, descriptive titles are better than

     short, concise, and obscure, ones.

     If you have a great title, it will grab the attention of the audience and you will get a lot
     of views. Promise value to the user with the title, and sparkle interest. A power word or
     two will grab the attention, but make sure it is not sensational or misleading. Steer clear
     of clickbait, such as `How to get fit without exercise.'

      Use informative, long descriptions

       Descriptions will contain key terms that search engines should be looking for to determine
       what the video is about. Use your most important keywords here. Include as much information
       as possible but use the most important information in the first 25 characters. Also include a
       link in your description to direct users to other content that you have.

Encourage comments, subscriptions, ratings, embedding, and sharing

Get users to engage with your video in any way you can, and don't forget to respond to relevant
comments. It's critical that your budding audience community feels that they matter and that
you are taking them seriously. This is a key point to remember if you want to create a thriving
community. Engagement is a massive factor in search engine rankings, so it is very important
to focus on content; strong optimisation is no substitute for weak content.
To incite discussion, consider posting a comment as soon as you have uploaded a video, or
adding a video card to encourage feedback. Pose a provocative question to spark discussion
and lead the conversation. Engagement is the absolute key to success in the social media space.

     Consider adding an enticing thumbnail frame. YouTube allows you to choose any moment
     in the video to be the thumbnail. Many other video platforms also give you this opportunity.
     Simply optimising the thumbnail image can encourage increased clickthroughs and views,
     which help to increase search visibility.

     properties. Cards allow you to add text boxes           A great way to use end screens is to link

     practice to include them in a video as soon as

     it has been uploaded. It's also a great way to encourage viewers to subscribe to your YouTube

     channel.

     The nature of YouTube is such that the number of views for pages on which videos are watched
     is always higher than channel views. However, if there is a paid search campaign running, the
     option to play clicked videos on the channel page exists. This is optimal to boost interactions
     with the branded channel header image, increase engagement with the playlist, and raise the
     channel view stats.

     Upload videos regularly

     Upload videos regularly to ensure continuous channel activity and topical interest. Consider
     the nature of the brand and what you are trying to communicate to your viewers. Decide how
     often videos are uploaded but remember, the more videos you upload, the higher your channel

will rank as a result of Google picking up on your fresh content. Think of it like a TV schedule
that lets users know when your `show' is on so they know when to come back.

It also helps to delete videos that are not successful. The amount of content you upload is also
dependent on the service or product your brand offers and your video budget. It's a careful
balance of not overloading your channel with useless media and keeping content fresh and
engaging.

12.4.6 Engaging the community

It's always essential to engage with your community. Respond to any comments or questions
in a timely manner, and take feedback on your content into account when planning new videos.
There are millions of new videos being added every day, and your audience will not necessarily
stay hooked for very long. That is why it is important to ensure that you engage with them to
create a sense of community, to relate to them, and to show genuine interest.

12.4.7 Reporting

As with all digital marketing tactics, in video marketing it's essential to track and analyse data
about your activities, and then to optimise your strategy accordingly. When creating video
content, use the various measurement options available to determine what you can do better
going forward.

YouTube Analytics is a free tool that enables anyone with a YouTube account to view detailed
statistics about the videos they upload to the site. You can see how often videos are viewed as
well as how popular they are relative to all videos in that market over a given period of time.

You can also delve deeper into the lifecycle of videos, such as how long it takes for a video to
become popular and what happens to video views as popularity peaks. YouTube even breaks
down the specific second when users stop watching the video.

Using these metrics, you can increase your videos' view counts and improve popularity on
the site. For example, you might learn that your videos are most popular on Wednesdays, that
they have a huge following in Spain, or that new videos that play off previous content become
more popular more quickly. If you see users dropping off halfway into the video, add a video
card to mix things up. There are many creative ways to approach this.

With this information, you can concentrate on posting compelling, fresh content that appeals
to selected target audiences, and post these videos on days when you know these viewers are
on the site. You could even go a step further and customise the video, dubbing it in Spanish,
closed captions also support SEO efforts. The range of possibilities to customise and optimise
your content is limited only by the brand's level of willingness.

Furthermore, you can access a breakdown of how viewers discovered a specific video, which
can then be used to optimise the keywords, tags, and descriptions of videos.

    12.5 VIDEO PROMOTION

       There are four main ways in which users find content and video online:
       1. A user knows what sort of video they are looking for and goes directly to a search engine

            to search for content. This relies on SEO or search advertising, if you decide to promote
            the content on Google.
       2. A user follows recommendations from others, found through emailed links, social bookmark-
            ing and sharing services, or social media such as blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.
            This relies on social sharing.
       3. Someone knows exactly what they are looking for and navigates to the appropriate URL
            directly. This relies on good branding and market awareness.
       4. The user finds the video through paid advertisements and promotions. This relies on paid
            advertising.

     12.5.1 Earned video promotion

       We covered the general guidelines for optimising your video for search earlier in this chapter.
       Here are some specific considerations for YouTube search optimisation, as well as social sharing.

YouTube video search optimisation

YouTube, which is owned by Google, is still the dominant player in the video-sharing market,
despite increasing competition from social media sites. While we focus in this section on
optimising for YouTube in particular, many of the same approaches apply to other video-sharing
sites.

Once you've determined how users are already accessing your videos and where they appear
in SERPs, you can use various techniques to improve your rankings. While YouTube, like Google,
keeps its search algorithms a closely guarded trade secret, digital marketers can speculate
and experiment to see what works and what doesn't.

Firstly, the following components are evaluated on a keyword and key phrase level by the
search engine spiders:

· Titles
· Descriptions
· Tags
· Playlist additions
· Inbound links.

Additionally, YouTube defines relevance in accordance with the popularity of a given video,
as well as the interaction taking place around it. The following factors play a dominant role in
the algorithm:

· Video views
· Channel views
· Ratings
· Comments
· Shares
· Embeds
· Subscribers
· Age of video.

Keeping YouTube content current and entertaining is vital if a video is very new. This will allow
the video to engage with viewers. Remember, a new video growing in popularity (that is, views),
will take preference in the SERP over an older video with more views.

Social sharing

You should initiate and encourage social sharing; ask your viewers to post your video on social
networks, aggregators, social bookmarking sites, and other channels. The more users share,
the wider an audience you can potentially reach, and the more likely your video is to go viral
or, at least, spread far and wide. Social sharing and recommendations are also increasingly
relevant ranking factors for search engines.

                                                                                                                                    343

     12.5.2 Paid video promotion

       In the same way as with Google's search advertising, you can pay to have your video recom-
       mended on YouTube. You are able to bid on searches or popular videos, show pre-rolls on other
       videos, and have your video content displayed alongside the search results of other videos.

       Paid promotions on YouTube are a cost-effective and quick way to promote video content,
       especially if the content is topical. It's targeted and controlled. For InStream, you pay only
       when a user watches 30 seconds or more of your video or, if your video is shorter than 30
       seconds, you'll pay only if they finish watching the entire clip. For InSearch and InDisplay, you
       pay-per-click on your video. This is a great opportunity for brand awareness, coupled with a
       potentially lower cost.

       However, some users find this form of advertising highly intrusive, particularly in markets where
       bandwidth is slow and expensive, and it may take several seconds for the ad to load before it
       can be skipped. Some ad blockers block YouTube advertising.

       Besides standard Display Ads, YouTube offers a wide variety of video ad types:

       · Overlay ads: Only available on YouTube's desktop platform. They are 468 × 60 or 728 × 90
            pixels and will appear in semi-transparent state over the lower 20% of the videos you choose
            to target. The ad can be text or images.

       · In-search ads: Appear at the top of the search results page in YouTube, above the organic
            results and with a yellow `Ad' icon.

       · Discovery ads: Thumbnail image ads that appear in the upper-right corner of the search
            and watch pages.

       · Sponsored cards: Appear during your video to display relevant products featured in the
            video.

       · Bumper ads: Non-skippable ads up to 6 seconds long that must be watched before a
            video can be viewed.

       · Video ads: Appear at the start of, or during, regular YouTube videos. These ads can be
            skippable after the first five seconds - in which case the full video can be 60 seconds
            long - or non-skippable, in which case the full video can be 30 seconds long. With this
            format, brands can include a small banner ad next to the video for free. Be sure to check
            out the YouTube Trends dashboard (youtube.com/feed/trending) to stay on top of the most
            popular videos at any given time.

           The video you use for these ads doesn't have to be an advert in itself. You could choose
           to promote some of your regular content, too. Ensure that the key message appears in
           the first few seconds to get viewers intrigued enough to keep watching. Check out this
           useful article on why the first 5 seconds of your video are very important: hound-studio.

12.5.3 Owned video promotion

If you are hosting your video content yourself, you can and should still optimise the content
around it for best search opportunities. As with posted video, it's the text content on the page
with the video that is so important.
Make sure that your page title is descriptive, as well as the video title and the video file name.
The text on the page with the video is important, so optimise it to reflect the content of the
video. You can also use speech-to-text software, such as otter.ai or veed.io, to transcribe the
video. The text can then be used in the video metadata.
Use social media sharing links to make it easy for visitors to share the video on their social
networks, aggregators, and blogs. If you have a Facebook page, post it there or upload it natively
to Facebook. If you have a Twitter account, tweet about it! Don't forget to drive website visitors
to your video content. Include a link or strong call to action on your homepage or main landing
pages to encourage visitors to view and engage with your videos.

12.6 FACEBOOK VIDEO

While this chapter focuses on YouTube as the biggest video-only network, it faces a rising rival
in Facebook. Although Facebook is a social network, it was boasting more than 100 million
hours of video consumption per day back in 2016.
Facebook and YouTube are very different. People on Facebook don't have the same kind of
intention when they come across a video as people who deliberately search YouTube might.

                                                                                                                                    345
            CRE ATING

       Facebook videos also disappear from the feed comparatively quickly, while YouTube videos
       remain easily findable. The most important difference for marketers is what counts as a view.
       On YouTube, 30 seconds counts whereas on Facebook, just 3 seconds registers as a view.
       Given that Facebook often autoplays videos, this can be reached before a viewer even notices
       the video in their feed.

       Your approach to videos on Facebook can't be the same as YouTube. Some tips for Facebook
       Video:

       · Videos need to be short (under 60 seconds). Facebook users want a distraction, and they're
            more likely to like and share shorter videos - which results in increased newsfeed exposure.

       · Facebook users have short attention spans. You have 4 seconds to catch their attention
            and keep it. Make the first 4 seconds of your video count.

       · Play around with Facebook's various video options. Live video gets considerably more
            engagement than pre-recorded.

       · Let your viewer know what to expect in the post to entice them to click.
       · Include a call to action early on.
       · Thumbnails matter. Choose them carefully.
       · 85% of video is watched without sound.' Most videos on Facebook are watched without

            sound - keep that in mind, and include closed captions (Vrountas, 2020).

       Remember, relevance is key for Facebook videos, so make use of the Facebook targeting
       options (discussed in Chapter 13: Social media) to make sure your video reaches exactly
       the right people.

       Don't forget that Facebook allows you to create video ads. It is one of the options on Facebook
       Ads Manager. Facebook also allows you to create short mid-roll ads that play in the middle of
       another video. The viewer must finish these before they can continue with the video.

    12.7 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

       Posting regular video content shouldn't result in any push back, provided it is done in a
       focused, engaging way. Videos are great for engaging viewers and growing your social media
       community. However, 62% of consumers are more likely to have a negative perception of a
       brand that published a video they considered poor quality (Adelie Studios, 2016). Focus and
       engagement are important.

       By studying analytics, platform insights, and comments, you can see which videos on your
       channel are providing users with what they're looking for. You can then choose to advertise
       your best videos with the various formats that YouTube and Google have on offer and optimise
       future videos using this information.

       Starting out with video production can be a bit challenging as you learn the ropes of what
       makes a viewable, entertaining video. It can also be difficult to come up with constantly new

and interesting ideas, but this will become easier with time. Optimising video can also take a
while to show results (as with normal SEO).

12.8 MEASURING SUCCESS

The number of views you get is an important factor in getting ranked or featured on YouTube
and, by pushing your best content through the paid medium, you can get the ball rolling and
significantly increase your chances of picking up organic traction (both within YouTube and
Google's universal SERPs).
Number of views is far from the only important metric, however; you will also want to track:
· Average view time
· Conversion assists
· Clickthrough rate on the CTA
· Viewer engagement
· Drop off points (where the viewer stops watching).
All of these and more will help tell you whether or not your video is successful and where you
can make changes to maintain or bolster viewer engagement.
Here is a handy guide from Buffer on Video Metrics (BufferSocial, 2017b).

    12.9 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

       A wide range of tools are at your disposal to help with your video marketing efforts. Most of these
       are listed in the chapter already, so look at the relevant sections for pointers on what to use.

       YouTube is the giant of video content marketing and offers a full suite of tools from video hosting
       and optimisation to paid advertising, analytics, and social promotion. Google Ads for Video
       (support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375497?hl=en) is a feature that allows you to link
       your existing Google paid advertising account to your YouTube channel, and manage all your
       YouTube advertising from a single interface.

       TubeMogul (launchdigitalmarketing.com/tubemogul-video-advertising/) is a video advertising
       tool that lets you buy paid video placements across the web. It simplifies the process of placing
       and paying for video adverts.

       Brightcove (brightcove.com/en/products/online-video-platform/) is a leading video hosting
       and publishing platform. Brightcove Video Cloud gives you everything you need to deliver
       professional quality video to audiences on every screen.

      12.10 CASE STUDY: NIKE DREAM CRAZY

           Nike's famous `Just Do It' strapline has been at the centre of many
           iconic adverts over the years as the brand has gone on to be
           revered as one of the most innovative advertisers in the industry.

       One-line summary

           Nike released the video advert Dream Crazy in September 2018, featuring a former NFL
           quarterback with the slogan: `Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.
           Just do it.'

       The problem

           On the back of Colin Kaepernick's decision to take a knee during the national anthem at
           NFL games that put his career at risk and sparked national debate about the appropri-
           ateness of bringing politics onto the field, Nike backed the former NFL player by making
           him the face of their Dream Crazy campaign, featuring him with sports stars like Serena
           Williams and LeBron James to illustrate how athletes have defied expectations to make
           seemingly insane dreams a reality.

       The solution

           Although the ad sparked massive criticism for its political stance, the advert was inspiring
           and motivating for celebrating the power of sport to move the world forward. As they
           usually do with the motivating and inspiring ethos, Nike followed some important best
           practice principles when creating this video:

                                                                                                        Content creation: Video

          Figure 12.12 The Nike Dream Crazy ad focused on the message, uses subtle
          branding and good annotations (the Nike swoosh) to include a call to action
   · The ad produced great content with a focus on belief rather than status for the consumer.
   · It was relevant. It was topical and timed well and also connected emotionally and
       culturally to the company's target audience.
   · The campaign engaged with users on social media to drive traffic to the video and
       shared the video itself on social media as well.
   · It prioritised effective research to understand what would appeal to their target market.

  The results

   · Nike earned outstanding commercial at the Creative Arts Emmy's for Dream Crazy - a
       first for Nike.

   · Nike's stocks rose by 5% a week after the advert was released.
   · As of 2018 the video has been viewed 21.1 million times since it was published.
   · Online sales grew by almost a third within a week and saw a 31% increase in online sales.
   · Although it initially received mixed reactions, the Dream Crazy ad earned Nike global

       PR coverage worth $43 million and 2.7 million mentions within a week of release.

1. When producing video content, what key points do you need to keep in mind?
2. How did Nike use best practices when creating their video?
3. How did online and offline channels work together to contribute to the success of this video?

    12.12 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       Video marketing can form the cornerstone of a great content marketing strategy, linking closely
       with the other content that you create to engage and provide value to your customers. Videos
       can also be added to marketing messages, such as email newsletters, to improve engagement.

       Because search engines serve a range of media types on their results pages, video content
       plays an important role in search engine optimisation. Not only can optimising videos for
       search increase your search engine ranking, but data show that it increases clickthrough rate
       from the search engine results pages, these visits are longer and more engaged than other
       search visits and more likely to result in conversions. Social media provides a great tool for
       spreading your video, and video content can be a strong driver for users to join your social
       media platforms. Make sure that you provide users with great value.

    12.13 SUMMARY

       Video has become an integral part of the online world. The potential for exposure, as well
       as interaction, is massive and brands that fail to capitalise on this, risk being left behind as
       competitors build thriving communities.

       As with most content, it is up to the brand to decide how to represent its video content. Videos
       can be hosted on popular video-sharing websites to capitalise on already existing audiences
       and developed interfaces, or on bespoke websites that allow for free reign in customisation.
       Brands should then aim to optimise their videos on the chosen platforms to increase their
       visibility on search engines.

       Creating a healthy community is also important in increasing exposure. Very rarely, if ever,
       does an audience come to video content without input from the creators. On top of optimising
       for search and other tweaks, brands should upload content regularly or risk losing any ground
       gained. Social media should be considered as its platforms allow for the sharing of content,
       and commentary. Overall, brands should be aware that there is no quick fix for video. It requires
       planning and investment, as well as long-term commitment to creating brand advocates.

    12.14 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

       1. Why should commenting on videos be encouraged?
       2. What sort of personalisation would the self-hosting of a video allow?
       3. How do you feel social media affects video marketing? Justify your answer.
       4. What possible obstacles could a brand face when seeding a viral video?

    13.1 INTRODUCTION

       Social media has become an integral part of modern-day life. It is virtually impossible to engage
       in online activity without experiencing it in one way or another. In fact, it is even tricky to avoid
       social media offline because brands are now using their handles, hashtags, and snapcodes
       on posters, radio, and television shows to send viewers to their social media accounts for
       further engagement.
       The internet has changed how we see and engage with media. We can now collaborate, publish,
       and share content and ideas much more easily than ever before, in real time, and with people
       all over the world. All this online sharing and collaboration is facilitated by social media.

           According to Chaffey (2022) there are 7 key areas that are crucial to understanding
           consumer use of social networks, namely: what is the overall popularity of social media,
           which are the most popular social networks, which are the fastest-growing networks, how
           do social media users interact with brands, what are the different engagement metrics
           based on consumer behaviour, how do consumers interact with different post formats,
           and what are the most popular times for consumers to use social media.
       To succeed in social media, you need to understand the various platforms available to you,
       which objectives social media can help you to achieve, and how to create a strategy using social
       media to reach these goals. This chapter will walk you through some of the larger platforms,
       and the following chapter on social media strategy will demonstrate how to use social media
       strategically to achieve your marketing objectives.

13.3 MARKETING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA

Social media has changed the world of marketing. It has evolved so much that the function
often requires the capacity of an entire department to successfully and effectively create,
connect, converse with, and share content online, while engaging audiences and growing
online communities. Social media forms an integral part of the marketing team and ultimately,
the business and brand.

The team in a social media department is structured with full-time roles that typically include
the head of social media, a social media strategist, manager, as well as a social media analyst
and community manager. Each role has key responsibilities and duties to fulfil the brand's
social objectives.

To keep up with increasingly digital audiences, traditional media has had to adapt. This has
changed the way content is published, both online and offline, and how advertising is sold.

For example, many newspapers now publish their content online as well as in their print
publications. Online, they can get instant commentary on their articles, learn what their readers
think, and use this information to make editorial decisions. News also comes from citizen
journalists, ordinary people who post instant updates to social media about events unfolding
around them. Often, news breaks via Twitter rather than news outlets.

Social media has evolved significantly over the last two decades. Initially, it was based primarily
on earned media, but brands soon started to claim ownership of their social pages, profiles,
and channels across the various platforms. More and more paid options have also arisen for
brands to promote themselves on social media.

With an ever-increasing number of players entering the social media space, brands need to
spend more to promote on social media for users to see and engage with their content. Social
media is a mix of owned, paid, and earned media options for marketing. Knowledge of how
each of these are managed and planned is integral to developing and maintaining a brand.
Working with social media can be broken up into three phases, as depicted in the image that
follows below.

                                                                                                     359

     The process is cyclical. Analytics of the current content and engagement feed back into the
     strategy. Depending on results, this alters the content created and shared, as well as how the
     brand engages with the community. These changes, in turn, are analysed and the cycle continues.

     In October 2021, founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
     announced that the platform would move under a new company
     called Meta with the intention of forming part of the metaverse
     that will be created. The iconic social networking app is the most
     dominant in the world.

     13.4.1 Introduction and stats

     According to Statista (2021), Facebook had      NOTE  As of September 2021, there were over
     "roughly 2.89 billion monthly active users as         28.3 million Facebook users in South
     of the second quarter of 2021. During the             Africa and a projected 35.92 million
     first quarter of 2021, the company stated that        users by the year 2026 (Statista, 2021).
     3.51 billion people were using at least one of

     Meta's core products (Facebook, WhatsApp,

     Instagram, or Messenger) each month". Because users are spending so much time on Facebook,

     advertisers and marketers want to capitalise on this audience.

     Facebook has a number of ways for brands and organisations to use the platform to connect with
     potential customers. These include business pages, adverts, promoted posts, app promotions,
     and now even direct online sales. Such marketing efforts are especially helpful to small
     businesses. Facebook enables content creation and distribution and allows brands to engage
     with their customers in real-time, two-way conversations through their `page.' Facebook is a
     powerful platform for the implementation of a digital marketing strategy.

According to Zuckerberg, the metaverse will

This move however, is still in the making and the technology does not yet fully exist. It will
take time for the business to garner support for early adopters and to refine the technical
challenges. That said, it shows the forward-thinking nature of the business to plan for future
developments and adopt future trends.

13.4.2 Features

Facebook offers numerous features, the first of which is the ability to organise your newsfeed
and contacts. Other features are discussed below:

Pages

Personal profile pages often remove much of the anonymity of the internet. Users of social
networks reveal a great deal of information about themselves, from basic demographics, such
as age, gender, and location, to nuanced lists of interests, likes, and dislikes. By divulging this
information to the network, they are sharing it with the networks' advertisers. For marketers,
the accessible personal information is like gold and can be used for targeted marketing.

While only de-identified data can be accessed     NOTE  To see how much of your data is being

Businesses use Pages to share contact infor-
mation, post updates, share content, promote events and releases, and to connect with their
Facebook audiences. For brands, a Page is the profile for a brand, organisation, or celebrity.
It looks very similar to a personal profile, and users can choose to connect with a brand on
Facebook by liking its Page.

Users tend to expect that a credible business would have a Page on Facebook. Therefore,
neglecting a well thought out presence on the network can lead to lost opportunities.

Reaction buttons

      Figure 13.5 Reaction button icons

The Facebook reaction buttons allow users to share their feelings about a certain piece of
content with their social circle. The reactions include the original iconic `Like' button, as well
as `Love,' `Care,' `Haha,' `Wow,' `Sad,' and `Angry.'

The `Like' button can also be used on websites outside of the Facebook ecosystem, allowing
visitors to recommend this site and content easily and to spot if friends have liked the same

reason, the number of likes on a brand Page
can be seen as a vanity metric.

Metrics can't identify who actually read a post, but they can show how many users were
reached, shown as impressions, through either paid or organic search. Impressions, shares,
or comments are much more reliable measures of reach and engagement.

Feed

Formerly known as the News feed, Feed is the      NOTE  You can read how Facebook algorithm

show users stories that are meaningful and

informative, with a selection of recent posts

and updates from friends and brands with which they have connected on Facebook.

Facebook uses an algorithm to determine what information to show in each user's Feed. The
following factors are considered by the algorithm before it displays content in a user's news feed:

                                                                                                                                      363

     · Who posted it? If you engage regularly with this person or brand, Facebook will show you
         more of their content.

     · Type of content: Whether the content is a photo, article, or video, it can carry different
         weight in the algorithm.

     · Interactions: How does this impact the algorithm and/or user experience?
     · Recency: How does this impact the algorithm and/or user experience?

     Stories are ordered, or shown, according to the relevancy score that is calculated from the factors
     listed above. It's based on what the algorithm believes is important and meaningful to the user.

     A user is more likely to interact with content that is displayed in their Feed, so it is vital to
     ensure that your page content takes this algorithm into consideration. Brands are spending
     on ad campaigns and promoting their posts to compete with the algorithm. It is, however,
     recommended to work with it instead. Learn about what your specific audience finds important
     and meaningful to create content that will resonate with them. In turn, you will send positive
     ranking signals to the algorithm.

     There are five things publishers can do to optimise their potential for appearing in user Feeds.
     These are:

     · Use compelling headlines
     · Avoid being overly promotional
     · Try a range of media forms and monitor which is most appreciated by the audience
     · Utilise publisher tools to provide Facebook with audience optimisation and audience

         restriction information
     · Use boosted posts or paid ads to gain exposure.

     Doing the opposite of the above can cause users to hide, block, or `unsee' content that you
     publish. Remember to be sensitive and avoid overpromoting your brand.

     anyone with a page or profile on Facebook. Viewers can react and comment in real time on

     videos as well, which can then be viewed like any other Facebook video.

more advanced, which means it is providing

more and more searchable keyword information for market researchers as well.

The social network collects demographic information that consists of statistical data like your
age, gender, and income, as well as psychographic information like attitudes, aspirations, and
other psychological criteria. This is valuable to advertisers because it allows them to target
their adverts to a very specific audience segment.

Facebook ads that use `conversion' objectives     NOTE  Refer to Chapter 17: Social media

as `Buy now', amongst others, are the most
effective and can be tracked to monitor your
conversion rates.

A conversion objective encourages users to take some form of action, such as clicking
through to your site, signing up for a newsletter, browsing your product catalogues,
making purchases, and even driving to visit your physical store. Remember that there
is a difference between conversion and traffic. If making a sale is your ultimate goal, the
website will significantly benefit from increased traffic; conversion, however, is the point
at which the user takes the desired action.

                                                                                                   365

13.4.4 Selling on Facebook

Facebook is not considered a hard sales platform and is predominantly used for gaining
awareness and reach, recruiting leads, or channelling users into a database from which they
can be targeted in future marketing, ultimately leading to a sales conversion.

For the majority of businesses, the Facebook Store (or Shop) is the ideal choice to
showcase and sell items from your business' social profile, whereas Marketplace is
arguably targeted more at individuals looking to sell items (entyce-creative.com/
the-difference-between-facebook-shop-tab-and-facebook-marketplace).

Facebook Shop

Introduced in late 2015, early 2016, Facebook Shop (or Store) enabled brands to import their
online store onto their Facebook Page, or business owners could list and sell products that
users could shop and purchase without having to leave Facebook. This allows you to easily

                                                                                                                                    367
            CRE ATING

       tap into your existing Facebook audience and reach a larger customer base. It is considered
       the ideal choice to showcase and sell items from your business' social profile, with the added
       benefit of connecting to Instagram too.

       With Facebook Shop, customers can view and purchase your products directly from your
       Facebook Page and check out without ever leaving Facebook. It also allows for customers to
       be redirected to your external ecommerce store or site if needed.

      Facebook Marketplace

       Facebook Marketplace was introduced in 2007, giving users the option to post classified ads.
       It was removed in 2014, because it didn't gain enough traction. In 2017, Facebook reintroduced
       Marketplace with much higher prominence, placing it closer to the top on the desktop site
       and mobile app. Initially, a customer-to-customer platform, Marketplace started taking off as
       a business to customer platform in 2019.

       Sellers list their products and buyers make contact to purchase, negotiate, or inquire about
       the product. It acts as a site for sellers to connect with buyers and vice-versa. There are no
       transaction gateways to make payments on Facebook Marketplace because it does not support
       payment processing. Primarily, Marketplace allows you to list, find, and advertise products with
       a price, whether you are an individual, seller, or manufacturer.

           If you are trying to decide which one to use, Facebook Marketplace or Facebook Shop,
           consider both because, if you have a Facebook Shop, you can add Marketplace as a sales
           channel and reach more people who are in search of specific items and shopping there.

           You also don't pay any seller fees on Facebook. In this regard there's no difference between
           Facebook Shops and Facebook Marketplace. You can set up a Shop with checkout on
           Facebook which allows you to choose how you want to accept payment. Learn more
           here: facebook.com/business/help.

     13.4.5 Facebook Analytics

       Analytics are the key to informing social media strategy, so monitoring your posts and marketing
       efforts is essential. Facebook Insights is available to business Page administrators. It provides
       data on how users are interacting with your content and your page. This includes demographic
       information about the users connecting with your content (age, gender, and location breakdown),
       which tabs and which content posts are seen and interacted with, and how many users hide
       your content from their news feed, and when.

       With the inclusion of Facebook Video, Facebook also created Video Insights, which provides
       metrics for video uploads. You can see unique views, duration, and audience retention which
       help you to understand how your videos are performing. Video Insights help you to refine and
       revise your video strategy.

13.4.6 Facebook summary

Because of its sheer size, 2.91 billion users and counting, Facebook is a popular marketing
choice for many brands. It offers incredible reach and is particularly powerful for brand
awareness. Other social media platforms seem to appeal predominantly to younger markets,
while Facebook has a broad appeal across age groups, making it a clear winner for brands who
want to market to a more mature audience. The accessible analytics, helpful business tools,
diverse ad options, and detailed assistance have all helped to make Facebook the number
one social media choice for many marketers.

     13.5.1 Introduction and stats

       YouTube attracts an enormous audience. Often marketed as the second largest search engine
       in the world, YouTube has 2.1 billion users worldwide. It is owned by Google and thus has the
       benefit of receiving prime results in the Google SERP.
       YouTube encourages the distribution of its content and allows videos to be embedded easily
       into other websites and shared to other social platforms.

                                         Figure 13.10 Sharing options on YouTube
       Online video consumption continues to grow year on year as bandwidth gets faster and
       cheaper. Sharing video content is easy with YouTube. Anyone can upload videos captured on
       simple devices such as webcams and mobile phones or on high-end professional cameras.
       Some stats on YouTube:
       · Over 2.1 billion users worldwide and 1.7 billion unique monthly visitors
       · Approximately 53.9% of users are male
       · 37.5% of users are between 25 and 44 years old
       · 500 hours of video are uploaded every minute
       · 694 000 hours of video are streamed on YouTube each minute
       · More than 3 billion hours of content are watched each month
       · More than half of YouTube views come from mobile devices.

13.5.3 YouTube Shorts

YouTube Shorts gets 15 billion daily views. Launched in 2020, YouTube introduced short-form
video that allows users to record 15-60 second portrait clips using a smartphone for upload to
the platform. The platform features editing functions, like adding animated text, editing multiple
15-second clips together, and controlling the speed of the video. Users can also like, dislike,
and comment on your videos and subscribe to your channel. Licensed music and captions
may be added to uploaded videos too.

With all of these features and functions in place, Shorts has proven to be a massive hit;
challenging newcomer, TikTok, and demonstrating that viewers enjoy short content, wherever
they're consuming video. Since launching, YouTube Shorts has accumulated 5 trillion views as
of January 2022, according to Variety (2022). You can view it here: variety.com/2022/digital/

13.5.4 Marketing and advertising on YouTube

There are two aspects to marketing through YouTube. The first is paid advertising by promoting
video content next to, or during, other content on the site. The second is having a brand channel,
which provides analytics and community features.

YouTube has a host of advertising options. YouTube Promoted Videos and YouTube Ads are just
two of the many ways the site can be leveraged for promotion. Adverts can also be managed
through Google AdWords. See more about this in Chapter 17: Social media advertising.

                                                                                                    371
     CRE ATING

     Having a brand channel is perfect for content marketing. Content shared on your brand channel
     should not be too promotional, but should offer value to your viewers. Some promotion is
     expected and accepted by viewers, but if you want to entertain viewers and encourage them
     to subscribe and continue to tune in to view your content, it needs to offer value.

     Using social platforms such as YouTube allows

     brands and video creators to tap into an existing  NOTE  Refer to Chapter 12: Content creation:
     community of avid video viewers. For example,            Video for more information on marketing

     commercials. Marketers have shown that if

     an advert is good enough, many users will choose to watch it. Super Bowl commercials, for

     example, are highly anticipated each year, and the best ones receive millions of online video

     views. These are users who have chosen to watch this advert at a media cost of zero. Other

     advertisers have realised that far longer adverts can be created and uploaded. As long as the

     content is good, users will watch, and hopefully share. Time constraints online are not the

     same as they are for television networks.

     Online video sharing also makes it possible for conferences to generate a far greater audience
     than ever before. The companies that run these conferences are able to engage with a massive
     audience by posting videos of the conference presentations, an excellent example of content
     marketing. TED and Nokia, which runs Nokia World, are excellent examples of organisations
     that increase interest by making their remarkable presentations available for free.

     YouTube's Community tab

     YouTube has created the Community tab, which allows viewers to respond to a creator's posts.
     It allows users to reply to messages with text to react and share their thoughts. Brands can
     make posts consisting of text, image, polls, or video, and users can respond to these, making
     YouTube a far more social platform than before.

     13.5.5 YouTube Analytics

     YouTube Analytics is available to all YouTube users for their videos and channels. There are
     different tabs to view for each report that shows you how the video or channel is performing.
     These include the following:

     Overview tab: Provides a summary of how the channel and videos are performing. In this tab,
     you will see reports for your channel's typical performance, top videos, real-time (performance
     over the last last 60 minutes or 48 hours), how the last 10 videos have been performing, and
     stories over the last seven days. If you're in the YouTube Partner Programme, you will also be

YouTube offers brands and businesses a great platform to share content with their customers.
Being able to personalise and brand your own YouTube channel helps to develop your brand's
online presence and assists with SEO. Your own brand channel means having an online collection
of all your video content that users can peruse in their own time. And through analytics, you
can observe what types of content resonate more with your users. You can optimise your
efforts by sharing popular content on other platforms or even paying for promotion of popular
content to get further reach and awareness.

       To create an account and set up, users only need a mobile telephone number and internet
       connection. WhatsApp prides itself on offering end-to-end encrypted messages and calls. Each
       message has a unique lock and key that only senders and recipients can read the contents -
       not even WhatsApp (CM, 2021).

     13.6.2 Features

       WhatsApp is simple to use. While its primary function is to facilitate voice and text messaging,
       the features offer a host of functionality and convenience for customer communication. More
       than 5 million business users take advantage of this popular messaging platform today. Here
       are a few of the features that keep the social platform so popular for marketers.

     13.6.3 WhatsApp Business

       The large number of active users on WhatsApp makes it easier for businesses to communicate
       directly with their customers using WhatsApp Business. Because people are accustomed to
       using the app, it can be used easily as a tool for marketing, brand awareness, and customer
       service purposes. Here are some of the reasons the platform is effective for marketing:

       · Convenient communications: WhatsApp Business gives companies a way to engage in
           two-way messaging with their customers through an app they're likely already using for
           everyday chat conversations. It offers businesses a convenient and direct way to share a
           variety of customer communications and campaigns.

       · Improved customer care: With the dawn of technology advancement and digital com-
           munication, WhatsApp Business enables companies to communicate directly with your
           customers in a personal, real-time environment. When used correctly, WhatsApp Business
           allows you to have control over what information is shared with your customers and how
           your business builds and fosters loyalty and trust with them.

       · Brand-verified conversations: In order to complete your WhatsApp Business account
           setup, every business must create a `business profile' on WhatsApp. This will become
           a unique business identity that incorporates your brand elements into your WhatsApp
           conversations. You can add contact numbers, website URLs, store locations, promotional

    details, and more. WhatsApp Business also lets you add multimedia to messages, including
    images, videos, and documents.
· Global reach: WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in more than 100 countries,
    with a global customer base of more than 2 billion. This makes it a perfect channel for
    businesses to reach captive audiences.
· Automatically initiate more conversations: Once users have opted in to receive WhatsApp
    messages from your business, you can create templated messages that notify customers
    to take the next step and start a conversation. Bear in mind, there are controls in place
    to ensure that users don't receive spam or irrelevant communication. WhatsApp requires
    that business users respond to incoming customer messages within 24 hours using a
    non-templated message. This preserves the integrity of the service.
· Added security with customer messaging opt-in: WhatsApp has security features
    like end-to-end encryption and two-factor authentication to keep both customers and
    businesses safe. Managing privacy regulations and compliance laws can be cumbersome
    for businesses, which is why WhatsApp Business also verifies your business account when
    registering, it assures customers of your identity when they opt-in to receive your texts
    and communications.

13.6.4 Marketing and advertising with WhatsApp

Because of the widespread use of WhatsApp globally, people have become accustomed to
connecting with each other using the platform. This is why, when you use the app to market or
promote your products and reply to your consumers' queries, it becomes the most personalised
form of communication and customer experience.

WhatsApp marketing has proven to be very effective and beneficial with these features:

Message templates: Allow you to send pre-written messages, such as appointment reminders,
delivery updates, and confirmations to customers.

Quick replies: Save time by creating quick replies related to your business. It allows you to
write a customised message for customers, without having to type out the same answer each
time for different customers.

Automate messages: Respond to customers 24/7, so they never feel ignored. Creating a
welcome greeting to new customers helps your brand promote a positive image while sharing
introductory information about your business.

More time-saving messages include:

· Notify customers of wait times
· Follow up with links to FAQ resources
· Prompt users to schedule a time to chat
· Gain peace of mind with built-in security.

                                                                                                                                    375
            CRE ATING

       Create a branded business profile: WhatsApp Business prompts you to enter information,
       like your business address, contact information, and website URL, to inform customers how
       to find you online and reach you in person.

       Organise your chats: WhatsApp understands that mobile messaging moves quickly. To ensure
       no customer messages go unseen, you can label your conversations. Add colours or labels to
       designate departments, sort by conversation types, and quickly retrieve messages.

       Get delivery data stats: Know if and when your messages have been received or read. This
       information gives you valuable feedback on your delivery and messaging efforts.

       Create a catalogue: Promote up to 500 products or services with a catalogue displayed on
       your WhatsApp Business profile. Catalogue links may also be shared on social media to help
       customers discover your business and contact you directly for sales and support questions.

           The first strategy should definitely be to create a resonating brand persona on WhatsApp.
           Create a character that reflects your brand and also connects with the audience at the
           same time. This will make users feel like they are talking to your brand directly and not
           with a robot (Dhapai, n.d.).

       Integrating your digital marketing with WhatsApp marketing can be the best decision for your
       business because, even if you don't yet have a website, you can still run social media ads and
       gather a captive audience. All you need to do is direct your leads to your WhatsApp number
       to proceed with the sale. Simply add your WhatsApp business link to your CTAs.

     13.6.5 WhatsApp Analytics

       WhatsApp Business statistics allow you to track your customers' engagement by the total
       number of messages sent, delivered, read, and received. This measures the performance of
       your interactions and conversations with customers.

       To view your statistics, open your WhatsApp Business, tap on More options, then Business
       tools, More options, and Statistics.

       According to Interakt.shop (2021), the following is what you would want to measure when it
       comes to WhatsApp analytics:

       · Total number of chats sent: The total number of chats that you have had with your
            customers on WhatsApp during a specific period (a day, week, or a month) will help you
            gauge the effectiveness of a WhatsApp campaign, because it will show a direct increase
            in the total number of chats.

       · First response time: The first reply time is the amount of time it takes to respond to a chat
            request. It should ideally be 6-15 seconds long to successfully facilitate instant commu-
            nication between you and your customers. The longer the response time, the unhappier

                                                                                                                       Social media 

    your customers will be. It simply means that your customers are made to wait longer to
    get a response from one of your agents.
· Average response time: The average amount of time it takes to respond to a message
    is calculated by dividing the total time that has passed until a chat reply was sent by the
    total number of chats held. If the average chat response time is long, it means that either
    the number of chats coming through are overwhelming or that there is a challenge finding
    solutions or answers to customer queries. On the other hand, faster response time leads
    to increased customer satisfaction and lower cart abandonment rates.
· Average resolution time: The time taken to successfully resolve a customer's query. You
    may find that you or your team are handling between 1 to 3 conversations at a time. Even
    if you can multitask, customers connecting with a business still expect a faster resolution
    time. This metric is one of the most important metrics to track because it's a direct indicator
    of preparedness and operational efficiency. To calculate the Average Resolution Time (ART),
    simply divide the total resolution time across all chats by the total number of resolved chats.
· Chat to conversion rate: Another key performance metric to calculate is the chat to
    conversion rate. This is the total number of people who have performed a specific action
    (that indicates a conversion) out of the total number of people who have chatted. Conversion
    would vary from company to company depending on your business goals. This could be a
    purchase, a sign up for a newsletter, or a repeat purchase.

Your chat metrics will help you evaluate how well your interactions with customers are
performing. It helps you understand if you are providing the right solutions and messages to
customers, at the speed and turnaround time that they expect. These statistics provide insights
into the quality and effectiveness of your chat process, while highlighting what works, what
does not work, and where it can be improved. It also provides you with opportunities to serve
your customers better.

By keeping close track of your customer service agents and the chat process, you can deliver
an outstanding customer chat experience, get more happy customers, and accelerate your
business growth.

13.6.6 WhatsApp summary

WhatsApp, particularly for Business, allows brands and businesses to connect directly with
their customers quickly, easily, and effectively. It's free to use and, because the platform is so
integrated into billions of people's daily lives, it's a great way to communicate your business
promotions, transactions, and queries all safely and securely.

WhatsApp allows you to add a personal touch to customer experiences with direct access to
people using their mobile contact number. With a customised profile, you can maintain a level
of brand presence with your customers by keeping your products, services, status updates, and
catalogues updated. Being able to stay close to your customer is one of the top advantages
of using WhatsApp for marketing and customer experience.

     Instagram (instagram.com) is primarily a mobile-based photo and
     video-sharing app that allows you to take a picture with your phone
     camera, edit it as you wish, and instantly upload it to your profile. A
     desktop version is also available. People love sharing photos, images,
     art, and funny pictures online. Therefore, over time, the app has attracted
     a significant audience to the platform.

     13.7.1 Introduction and stats

     Over the past few years, Instagram has become one of the world's most important apps for
     social commerce.

     Some statistics on Instagram as of 2022:

     · 1.3 billion monthly users worldwide
     · 400 million daily active users
     · 18 to 34-year-olds make up the biggest share of Instagram's audience
     · 51% of users are female and 49% are male
     · 500 million people use Instagram Stories on a daily basis
     · Over 40 billion photos have been shared since inception.

Instagram video, reels, and stories

Before Instagram removed it in October 2021, Instagram Television (IGTV) was home to longer,
high-quality edited videos of up to 60 minutes that were recorded on web uploaders. People
would compare IGTV with YouTube because it offered a space for users to discover content
that covered a topic in detail (e.g., how-tos, educational videos).

IGTV was losing traction as a standalone app and, in 2020, Instagram dropped the button from
its homepage. Instead, Instagram Video is hosted alongside Instagram Live videos. Trimming,
filters, and tagging form part of the functions on Instagram Video when uploading content. It
worked similarly to IGTV in that, 60 second videos show a preview in the Feed.

With the introduction of TikTok to the social media scene and the massive uptake of short form
video by industry giant, YouTube, Instagram decided to prioritise the shift to video. It no longer
wants to be seen as just a photo-sharing app, which is why it is focused on making video a
more central part of the Instagram experience.

Instagram reels

Reels is Instagram's answer to TikTok videos. Its core purpose is to be entertaining, which is
why it is limited to 60 seconds in length. One feature of Instagram Reels is the built-in editing
functionality. You can also slow down (or speed up) your clip, add filters, mix in audio, include
a voiceover, add on music, and more.

It has proven successful for brands and businesses to get creative in the Reels arena, where
their brand may be seen by all Instagram accounts rather than only followers, because they are
far more discoverable on Instagram. They may not have the front-and-centre prominence of
Stories at the top of the Instagram app, but they are regularly featured in the Discover section.
The Reels tab appears on the primary navigation of the app.

Reels has a longer lifespan than Stories; it can be picked up by the Instagram algorithm
at any point, making them more likely to be found by new prospects. It is best to edit

                                                                                                                                379
CRE ATING

and create original content for IG, rather than recycling content from apps like TikTok,
because the Instagram algorithm will likely deprioritise the content.

In the first quarter of 2022, Meta reported that 20% of all the time being spent on Instagram,
was being spent on Reels. So, it comes as no surprise that Instagram is systematically looking
at consolidating their video elements. First, IGTV and Instagram feed videos were merged
into `Instagram Video.' Now, they are looking at doing away with video posts completely and
keeping Reels as their only video element (Malik, 2022).

Stories

The Stories feature on Instagram is quite similar to Snapchat. It doesn't exclusively include
videos; and can also be static images, text, or other animated content.

One thing to note about Stories is that it is far more interactive than Instagram Video or Reels.
While others can like and comment on Reels and Instagram Video, Stories allows you to create
polls, use timers, embed posts, or get feedback from your audience. Stories allows users to go
live too, in a similar way that you would with Facebook Live.

Of the three types of video, Stories is by far the most discoverable. While Reels is given its own
tab in the Instagram app and featured in searches, Stories is impossible to miss because it is
positioned in the middle of the screen, at the top when you open Instagram.

Stories have significant prominence in the Instagram app for your followers and allow you
to include links to external websites. You can also pay to promote Stories and feature it as
Highlights at the top of your profile - two things that aren't possible with Reels.

If you're trying to decide which option of video to use for your digital marketing efforts, the
best option is to try a combination of all three. Since people use Instagram in different ways
and have varying preferences for the kind of content they like to engage with, test them all
out to see which one most suits your brand, style, and position.

13.7.3 Marketing and advertising with Instagram

Business pages and posts cost nothing to set up, but like other social media platforms, Instagram
is becoming a pay to play space. Brands need to use promoted posts to reach a more extensive
audience than they would with simple organic reach. Brands can promote posts without a
business page, but do not have access to analytics or data about their users and their
engagement with posts and ads.

linked to their Facebook Page. Their contact information will be imported directly and any
Instagram followers will be able to contact the brand through Instagram. Because Instagram
is owned by Facebook, it integrates with Facebook's advertising interface, making posting
across these channels seamless.

Brands need to ensure they connect with the right communities so that they reach the right
followers, but they also need to monitor competitors and their posts and followers. Brands
should use hashtags in every post, preferably those that are popular and actually used by their
audience. Hashtags enable tracking of mentions and shares and tends to make content dis-
coverable. Rare hashtags can make content less easy for potential customers or users to find.
But, only using popular hashtags means your content could get lost among a million other
posts. A more unique hashtag, marketed and publicised well, can make your content easier
to find. For example, #food renders millions of results, while #vegan will narrow these results.
Hashtags are also good for SEO. Understanding your audience is crucial as a brand, and
monitoring audience engagement is necessary to ensure that your posts are relevant.

Instagram is a great platform for brands that have a strong visual identity or who are able
to tap into this visual audience with beautiful, eye-catching content. Instagram can also be
managed through Facebook's Business manager, meaning you can share content and manage
ads and promotions seamlessly across both platforms from one place, if you link the accounts
on your profile.

Instagram is constantly updating its features, integrating Snapchat-like features, such as Stories,
Reels, Videos, and Filters, and providing a pin-board-type feature for brands to collect and
showcase their content and products. With the addition of Instagram Shop, there are new exciting
s-commerce opportunities for retail-based brands. Instagram is a popular mobile platform and
should be considered by any brand that wishes to engage with a mobile, millennial audiences.

    13.8 TIKTOK

       TikTok is a social media platform for creating, sharing, and discovering
       short videos. Created by Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, the app is
       widely used by young people as an outlet to express themselves through
       singing, dancing, comedy, and lip-syncing. It allows users to create Figure 13.15
       videos and share them across a community. Launched internationally TikTok logo
       in 2017, TikTok was always intended to be a video-sharing networking
       service that is similar to Facebook and Instagram, both of which are unavailable in China. With
       it reaching global markets, it certainly has taken the market by storm, pushing the technological
       edge of video creation.

· Outside of Asia, it is most popular in the US, Indonesia, and Brazil
· In 2021, it reached 3 billion downloads globally on both App Store and Google Play
· TikTok has 400 million daily active users
· Under 18 to 29-year-olds make up 63% of the audience
· 59% of users are female, 39% are male, and 2% identifying as other.

13.8.2 Features

TikTok is all about finding your own communities by interacting with other users online and
making videos you love. Here are the features that help users find content, communities, and
creators that are interesting to them:

For You

When you access your TikTok account, you will immediately find yourself on the For You feed.
This is the page that shows content that interests you. It is based on the interests you selected
when you created your account. The idea is to conveniently feed you the videos and creators
suited to your interests. The more you use TikTok, the more tailored and curated your feed
becomes.

Your For You feed is not general or universal to all users. Each user has their own, distinct feed
that is specific to them and their interests. As you find and interact with videos and creators that
you enjoy, you will begin to see more videos that interest you, as well as communities that are
fitting for your personality. You will also be able to view trends on TikTok on your For You feed.

How it works

Powered by the recommendation system that sends suggested videos that are personalised
for each user, the For You feed depends on a few factors that include:

· Your interactions: Including the videos you like or share, accounts you follow, comments
    you post, and videos you create.

· Video information: Such as captions, sounds, and hashtags.
· Device and account settings: Such as language preference, country setting, and device type.

Discover

When you tap on the search icon at the top of the screen, you will find the Discover page.
Discover highlights trending videos in the app, as well as the most popular trends on TikTok.
The videos that appear first under a hashtag are representative videos that may have started
the trend or other popular videos that are relevant to the trending hashtag.

If you are looking for particular creators, videos, sounds, or hashtags, you can search for them
at the top of this page. The top results for each category will appear first.

                                                                                                                                    383

      Profile

       As with all social media accounts, your profile page is all about you. To put your best foot
       forward, choose a good profile image or video and share a clear bio that best describes you.
       Make sure that with the information you upload, you're sharing information that communicates

       To make your bio relevant to the community, make it descriptive and clear about you as a
       creator. Remember that even on a private account, your profile information (photo, username,
       and bio) will be visible to others. You may choose to not share other information like your city
       or other personal identifiers, but there are other ways to express yourself in your profile.

      Following page

       On the Following page, you can view content of only the accounts that you follow. When you
       follow someone on TikTok, you will see them on this page. To view new trending videos you
       will need to have a look at the For You feed, where you will find different kinds of videos.

      TikTok LIVE

       TikTok LIVE is simply a live-stream video that creators publish to their fans. The function is
       limited to specific regions at this stage. Unlike Facebook and Instagram, TikTok creators must
       meet minimum requirements to make use of this feature in order to interact on the platform in
       real-time. Users that are 16 years and older can launch LIVE, while 18 years and older may also
       send and receive virtual gifts during a LIVE stream. Virtual gifts are offerings from followers
       that can be converted to cash at a later stage.

       To unlock this feature, a user must be at least 16 years old and have a minimum of 1 000
       followers (this number may range from country to country).

     13.8.3 Marketing and advertising with TikTok

       What makes TikTok unique is that its algorithm is different to that of Facebook and Instagram.
       It focuses purely on showing relevant videos. The user-centric design concentrates on what
       users like and dislike, which is what determines TikTok's recommendation as a relevant video.
       It is usually quite accurate and the For You feed is unique to every user.

       More of the benefits that make this social network popular with its audiences include:

       Content by everyday people for everyday people: Everyday people create most of the content
       and watch it, giving amateur creators the opportunity to become celebrities in their own right
       over time because of their popularity. The content is relatable and shares numerous examples
       where ordinary people have become internet sensations as a result of the quality of their videos.

       TikTok is user-friendly and keeps things simple: The app is effortless to use and has an
       eye-catching theme. It features some easy-to-use components like home, feed, search, inbox,
       and personal profile.

Find and follow the latest trends on TikTok: The TikTok community is a trendsetter. When
a video goes viral, video creators follow the concept, which is why we see so many unique
challenges, like dance challenges, become worldwide trends. From a fashion point of view,
users often take inspiration from the way their favourite TikTokers dress, setting the latest trends.

Users feel like they're part of a community: TikTok encourages and promotes interactions
among people that help create a bond. This is strengthened further when TikTok influencers
create physical events where people gather and interact.

Offers plenty tools for creativity: The all-in-one platform is the place to find videos related
to anything and everything. It gives users and brands the freedom to explore their ideas and
to get the creative juices flowing.

One of the best sources for memes and funny content: If you're looking for memes and funny
videos, the chances of finding it on TikTok are great. Creative minds are creating unique content
that makes people laugh for the fans' daily dose of comedy. Memers are taking over TikTok.

TikTok has content for all age groups: The content on TikTok has a universal appeal because
the relatable content caters to almost all age groups.

     13.8.4 TikTok Analytics

       To evaluate your success on TikTok, there are a few metrics you will want to monitor, such as
       follower count, likes, comments, and shares. In addition, with TikTok, you can measure weekly
       and monthly growth, video play time, as well as information about who is watching. Tracking
       your performance on TikTok will help you determine your next steps to tap into the one billion
       active accounts and enhance your marketing strategy on the platform.

       If you have a TikTok Business account, you will be able to view your analytics. There are four
       categories available for you to monitor, including Overview, Content, Followers, and LIVE.

      Overview analytics

            period.

       · Profile views: The number of times your profile was viewed over the selected period,

            brand is up to on the platform.

       · Likes: The number of likes your videos received in the selected date range.

Content analytics

This content analytics tab shows which of your videos were the most popular in the selected date
range. It provides information about each post, including metrics like views, likes, comments,

· Average watch time: The average time people have spent watching your video, which will
    give you a good indication of how successful you were at maintaining attention.
· Watched full video: The number of times the video has been watched in full.

    how well that worked.

    you created a post or marketing campaign for a specific location, this is how to tell if it
    reached your target.

Follower analytics

The follower tab provides information about your followers that includes a breakdown of gender
and what part of the world they're viewing from. You can also see when your followers are
most active on the app. Key audience demographic stats and your followers' interests make
this section a good source for content inspiration. Consider the following:

· Gender: View the distribution of your followers by gender here.
· Top territories: Ranked by country, here's where your followers are located. If you're looking

    into localising your content and promotions, keep this metric in mind.
· Follower activity: View the times and days your followers are most active on TikTok. When

    activity is consistently high, post regularly during that time.

    popular with your followers. Keep your eye on this section to see if it sparks any ideas for
    content. It's also a good place to scope potential collaborators.

     LIVE analytics

     This tab shows you insights on the live videos that you have hosted within the last week or
     month (7 or 28 days). These analytics include follower count, how much time you've spent live,
     and how many Diamonds you've earned. You will also discover the following:

     · Total views: Total number of viewers present during your live videos in the selected date
         range.

     · Total time: Total time you have spent hosting live videos in the selected date range.
     · New followers: The number of new followers you gained while hosting a live video in the

         selected date range.
     · Top viewer count: The most users who viewed your live video at one time in the selected

         date range.
     · Unique viewers: The number of users who viewed your live video at least once (in this

         statistic, a viewer is only counted once, no matter how many times they replay the video).
     · Diamonds: Virtual gifts that viewers can send when creators, over 18 years of age, host a

         live video. These diamonds can be exchanged for real money through TikTok. This metric
         shows how many diamonds you have earned in the selected date range.

     13.8.5 TikTok summary

     TikTok is set to continue growing and, in fact, will likely dominate the social media space (Forsey,
     2022). Whether TikTok naysayers want to believe it or not, the social network is ticking all of
     the right boxes as far as future trends are concerned. Brands and individuals using the creative
     and humorous entertainment platform to express themselves is certainly one way to capture
     a new audience and showcase their personality.

     13.9 SNAPCHAT

     Launched in 2011, Snapchat is a mobile messaging service that allows

     you to send photos, videos, texts, and drawings quickly and in a fun

     way. Snapchat gives you the power to record and share live videos,

     locate friends on an engaging map, experience augmented reality          Figure 13.16
     (AR), and more. But the message only lasts until you open it before it  Snapchat logo

13.9.1 Introduction and stats

Here are some Snapchat statistics according to Data Reportal (2022):

· Over 550 million monthly users worldwide
· Places 12th in world's ranking of most popular social networks
· 319 million daily active users
· The age range 13 to 24 makes up 60% of the audience
· 53.8% of users are female and 45.4% are male
· Over 9 000 Snaps are shared per second, averaging out to 400 million a day, and the

    platform receives 10 billion daily video views.

13.9.2 Features

Users have a profile and use the app to share Snaps. A Snap is an image that the user can
modify with filters or the drawing tool. A filter can denote the outside temperature, your speed,
time, and location, amongst other things. The Draw tool allows users to draw over the photo
or video, with a full colour spectrum, and Type allows them to annotate and add personalised
text. Users can also add Geofilters and sponsored lenses to the photos, both of which have
proven strong marketing tactics for brands.

Another popular Snapchat feature is Snapchatstories, a photo or video you post to your Stories
feed. Stories live for 24 hours, and people can view them as often as they want during that
period. Once the 24-hour time limit is up, Snapchat automatically deletes the story. Read about
it here: lifewire.com/what-is-a-snapchat-story-3486000.

13.9.3 Marketing and advertising on Snapchat

Snapchat can be used for sharing various content with your audience. This can either be value
added content in the form of how to's, latest industry material, and relevant tips; or it can be
storytelling content, taking your audience behind the scenes of your business or showcasing
aspects of your company culture and values and providing a glimpse into the brand. Geofilters
and sponsored lenses are also great ways to get your audience to engage with the brand on
the platform.

13.9.4 Snapchat Analytics

Just like any other platform, it is necessary to monitor your performance on Snapchat and to
continuously improve and optimise your content to drive a larger audience. Snapchat analytics
provide information on the number of total story completions, unique views and screenshots.
Seeing which type of content your users prefer means you can really optimise your efforts.

13.9.5 Snapchat Summary

Snapchat is proving to be a powerful marketing tool, albeit an expensive one. Paid marketing
efforts on the platform are mostly limited to big brands that can afford the high rates and the

                                                                                                                                    389

     development costs to create engaging and interactive filters. However, smaller independent
     brands can still make good use of the platform to share behind the scenes information, build
     up to events, and grow a loyal following, especially if your target market is more youth oriented.

     Twitter is the most popular microblogging service. Microblogging is
     a form of blogging that allows a user to publish short text updates,
     which can be viewed by anyone or restricted to a specific community.
     Twitter (twitter.com) was launched in July 2006. These posts, called
     tweets, are usually short thoughts or links to interesting articles.

     · On average, 500 million tweets are sent

         each day
     · 70.4% of users are male, while 29.6% are female.

     On Twitter, you can control the communication channel. To slowly develop your story and
     create a feeling of suspense, threads can be published one at a time. For a fully-formed story,
     as demonstrated in the threaded response above, this is an effective strategy to use. When
     planning your content, you are able to schedule the threads so that they meet your desired
     strategy, such as announcing the winner of the competition the next day! When using the
     threads feature, you can measure engagement and interest, what topics followers are interested
     in, and what got the most engagement.

Like Instagram, Twitter users use hashtags to categorise their posts by adding a word or phrase
prefaced with the # symbol (e.g. #DigitalMarketing). The hashtag will become a link that you
can click to see other tweets that share this tag. Users can also choose to follow a hashtag,
meaning that they will see all public messages with that tag, whether they follow the user
who posted it or not. This can be a very useful way of collating information at events such as
conferences. If you're not at the event, you can still follow messages from the event by following
the hashtag. For those at the event, all tagged messages can be broadcast in a shared location.

                                                                                                                                    391
        CRE ATING

     If a hashtag or keyword is used very frequently in a short time, it can become a trending topic
     and is displayed to the left of a user's tweet stream. Events of global interest usually feature
     heavily, but sometimes brands can trend too (although not always for the right reasons). If a
     tweet is considered noteworthy, it can be retweeted or quote retweeted. Retweeting means
     reposting somebody else's tweet to your own profile, along with their username. Twitter
     automatically displays this as a retweet. A quote retweet allows you to retweet another post
     and include a comment about the tweet as well.

             you to include a comment about the post you are retweeting

     13.10.3 Marketing and advertising with Twitter

     Twitter has become a popular and important marketing tool for many organisations, brands,
     and individuals. Many brands use it successfully for rapid customer service, for example,
     @jetblue, @klm and @dstvcare. It's also a great market research and consumer insights tool.
     The ability to search for brand keywords on Twitter and track indirect conversations offers
     huge insight to brands.

     Twitter's immediacy allows for news to be broadcast to dedicated followers and fans first,
     as pop star Lady Gaga has done with single releases (@ladygaga). Dell lists several Twitter
     channels, many of which exclusively release offer information (@delloutlet).

     Twitter has a series of self-service advertising options that are covered in detail in Chapter

Currently, Twitter Analytics are available to everyone that uses the Twitter API to provide
analysis. Here, you will be able to view your top-performing tweets, mentions and top followers

Hootsuite's Twitter management tools also have built in analytics that can provide insightful
data. Important metrics for Twitter include how many users interact with your content by
clicking through on links, how many reply to you, how many retweets you receive, as well as
hashtags and trends.

13.10.5 Twitter summary

Twitter remains a powerful platform for brands. It facilitates two-way communication with users
and provides great reach and awareness through possible retweets. The analytics are good,
and the hashtags enable great tracking of sentiment about your brand, products, and events.
The increasing number of ad options is also a great plus for marketers.

13.11 LINKEDIN

LinkedIn launched in 2003 and is primarily used for professional       Figure 13.20
networking and career development, allowing job seekers to post their  LinkedIn logo
CVs and employers to post jobs. As of 2015, most of the company's
revenue came from selling access to information about its members
to recruiters and sales professionals.

LinkedIn allows members (both employees and employers) to create profiles and connect
with each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional
relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a
connection. LinkedIn can also be used to organise offline events, join groups, write articles,
publish job postings, post photos, and videos (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn).

13.11.2 Features

LinkedIn is the ultimate destination for job seekers, experts, executives, mentors and more.
Apart from securing your privacy, saving you time and expanding your network, it offers the
following features:

Company page

A company page helps LinkedIn members learn about your business, your brand, and any
job opportunities in your company. A company page is a great starting point for developing a
reputation as a leader or player in your industry.

Initially, company pages were viewed as HR landing pages, but they have since evolved. They
can help drive business results, increase awareness about your business and its products and
services, and promote career opportunities. Your LinkedIn company page should be viewed as
a supplement to your company website and should help to drive traffic to your website. These
pages provide free marketing opportunities and can enhance the credibility of your company.
Good copy on your page should incorporate your key phrases and key words to ensure your
site is optimised for search engines.

Some key tips for a great company page include:

· Highlight your business entities with a showcase page
· Share engaging content regularly
· Optimise for search engines using keywords
· Target prospective candidates with a Careers tab
· Use an eye-catching cover image to grab user attention (Edgecomb, 2016).

Showcase pages are designed to build relationships with relevant LinkedIn members, and

marketing efforts.

LinkedIn Groups

LinkedIn Groups allows for your company to join with other professionals and businesses outside
of your immediate circle of contacts. It broadens exposure and connects your business with
others in your industry. It provides a platform for you to share industry expertise and establish
your business as a thought leader. Participating in Group discussions also potentially attracts
visitors to your company page.

                                                                                                                                    395
     CRE ATING

     Groups help extend the reach of your content and provide constructive feedback from relevant
     professionals. Groups share information about target audiences and provide market researchers
     with insights. It is important to join Groups that are relevant to your business and interests.
     Sharing company content on a Group increases traffic to your page and your website. To
     avoid being seen as overly promotional in Groups and only pushing your own agenda, engage
     in a courteous manner and share, comment, and use the opportunity to create meaningful
     relationships.

     Job postings

     LinkedIn is often the first place top talent look for work, so it's important that your job vacancies
     are displayed and kept updated. It is also useful for HR to recruit new talent by looking at
     potential candidates using LinkedIn and asking them to apply for specific positions.

     13.11.4 LinkedIn Analytics

     audience and engagement. It gives useful data on updates, reach, and engagement.

     `Updates' is a table showing the most recent developments, including:

· Total engagement.
Additional graphs showing the reach of the post include the trend on the number of times
updates were seen organically and through paid channels. Engagement is also illustrated on
a graph to demonstrate engagement across organic and sponsored campaigns for various
time lines (White, 2016b).

13.11.5 LinkedIn Summary

For B2B marketing, LinkedIn is definitely the platform of choice. The unique targeting and
search functionalities of the platform make it well suited to such marketing efforts. Additionally,
it offers a lot of unique options for B2C marketers, and can be leveraged nicely for professional
contacts and to gain acclaim within your industry.

13.12 OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA OPTIONS

There is a host of social media options for you to consider, whether you are a marketer, a
marketer looking to venture into social media marketing, or a business owner looking to leverage
social media. It is helpful to know about all the sites which will allow you to engage with the
right people, maximise your brand reach on social media, and achieve your social media goals.

13.12.1 Pinterest

Pinterest is an image sharing and social media service that allows user to discover and save
information in the form of images, animated GIFs, and videos for inspiration and ideas in
the form of pinboards. This highly visual virtual pinboard is not only used by shoppers and
hobbyists; the section on architecture and design are also well populated. Created by Ben
Silbermann, Paul Sciarra, and Evan Sharp, Pinterest has accumulated over 430 million global
monthly active users as at February 2022.

Each pin is an idea. This could be a recipe, an image, an article, or a quote that links back to
its original site. By including the Save button (or Pin It) button to your site, you make it easier
for users to pin your content onto their boards in Pinterest.

                                                                                                                                    397

     Marketing and advertising on Pinterest

     As a business, you can create your own business page with a host of tools, such as:

     · Analytics
     · Direct links back to your website
     · Easier pinning of your website content via the save button
     · Newsletters
     · Buyable pins
     · Options for promoting material
     · Widget builders.

     Business profiles should not only be providing boards of their products but should also include

     the lifestyle or essence behind the brand. A makeup business, for example, could include

     boards on high fashion, new trends in makeup, interesting use of makeup in movies, and even

     general skin care.

     and directing traffic to your website. Pinterest

     has also introduced buyable pins, which allow

     users to buy your products directly through Pinterest.

     Pinterest summary

     The visual nature of Pinterest and the ability to use boards as collections make the platform a
     good choice for retail brands. Brands that target women are likely to do well on the platform
     because women make up the majority of users on the app. Marketers who have used Pinterest
     comment on its higher than average conversion rate, with some attributing it to the fact that
     users of the platform are further along in the buying cycle. Pinterest is gaining in popularity as
     a social media space for marketing and should not be written off when considering platforms.

     13.12.2 Reddit

     Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.
     Registered members submit content to the site, such as links, text posts, images, and videos,
     which is then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organised by subject into
     user-created boards called `communities' or `subreddits,' which cover a variety of topics: news,
     politics, religion, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, fitness, cooking, pets,
     and image-sharing. Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit
     and, if they receive enough upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page.

     The top 6 Reddit statistics that you should know are as follows:

· Has 330 million monthly active users
· Top posts are under 120 characters
· Posts with questions receive the most comments
· External links are the most popular type of content
· Has one billion native video views per month.
Although considered a social sharing website, Reddit is not a typical social media platform.
Its users build the community and are good at spotting marketers. Value is important to the
community and if the selling proposition outweighs the value, you may simply get banned.

13.12.3 Twitch

Twitch is an American video live streaming service that focuses on video game live streaming,
including broadcasts of esports competitions, in addition to offering music broadcasts, creative
content, and `in real life' streams. It is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of Amazon.

who are drawn to Twitch. Learn more about advertsing with Twitch here: twitchadvertising.tv.

13.12.4 Blogging

A blog is a website where entries (blog posts) are typically displayed in reverse chronological
order. Blogbasics (2017), defines a blog as a `frequently updated online personal journal or
diary.' Blogs usually allow readers to comment on posts. A typical blog will feature text, images,
and links to other related blogs and websites.

                                                                                                                                    399

     Blogs for marketing can help you:

     · Create an online identity
     · Curate a voice for yourself or your company
     · Promote engagement with your audience
     · Build a community.

     Blogs can be very successful marketing tools. They're an excellent way to communicate with
     staff, investors, industry members, journalists, and prospective customers. Blogging also
     helps to foster a community around a brand and provides an opportunity to garner immediate
     feedback on developments.

     Corporate blog content should be:

     · Industry relevant
     · Appealing to your target market
     · Transparent and honest
     · Personal and entertaining
     · Related to what's going on in the blogosphere
     · Posted regularly.

     Search engines value regular, fresh content, and blogging can create just that. The more you
     post, the more often search engines will crawl your site looking for additional, relevant content.
     Basing your blog on the keyword strategy created during the SEO process can also ensure
     that your website ranks highly for key phrases. Blogs, by their social nature, can increase the
     incoming links to your website.

     Using a blog platform that is designed to be search engine-friendly is crucial to harnessing the
     SEO power of blogging. Some features of SEO-friendly blogging platforms include:

     · Each blog post should be assigned a unique page that can easily be accessed and indexed
         by the search engines (this is called a permalink).

     · It should be possible to tag pages with keywords relevant to your SEO strategy.
     · Each post should be able to have its own unique metadata (title, description and key phrases).
     · Social sharing and bookmarking functionality should be built in.

opportunities to learn about how others perceive your brand and to engage with the audience.
Some brands get this right; some get it wrong. Blogs can provide a snapshot of audience
sentiment regarding a brand. Marketers can also listen to blog activity around competitors to
gain market insights.

to become writers without having to deal with

a media channel controlled by someone else, podcasting has allowed anyone who fancies

doing so to become a broadcaster. Many traditional radio shows are now also available in

podcast format. Many liken the shift from traditional radio to podcasts to that of traditional TV

channels to on demand online services, but at a much faster pace. Users see podcasts as the

`Netflix for radio' (Main, 2016).

`Podcatching' software allows you to download the latest edition of any podcast you subscribe
to automatically. Most people use iTunes, go to podcasters.apple.com for loads more information
on podcasting and a huge list of available podcasts. You can listen on your computer or transfer
the file to an iPod or MP3 player. Podcasts are usually free, and the most successful ones have
very high-quality content and production value.

Podcasts are usually recorded and edited using home equipment and are created for the love
of it. Specialised podcasting software is available, such as Apple's GarageBand or Logic Pro,
and Audacity. These packages make it quite simple to record, mix, and format the audio files
correctly. Just like bloggers, though, many podcasters are trying to figure out ways to make
money from their podcasts and turn listeners into revenue.

Podcasts offer an incredible opportunity for marketers when you consider the following statistics:

· In 2022, 62% of the population 12+ has listened to a podcast and roughly 78% are familiar
    with the medium.

· Over one-third (104 million) of Americans listen to podcasts regularly.
· During COVID-19, podcasting experienced unprecedented growth, and podcast audiences

    diversified (Buzzsprout, May 2022).

                                                                                                    401
            CRE ATING

       The bottom line is that you now have a way of getting content to your target markets without
       having to persuade a media channel to carry it or to pay huge advertising rates.

       Podcasts are:

       · Targetable: You can create highly relevant, niche content and then promote it to a specific
            target market.

       · Measurable: You can see exactly how many downloads and subscribers you have.
       · Controllable: It's your content.
       · Responsive: Set up a blog alongside your podcast and alter content according to the

            comments; you are actually having a conversation with your market.
       · Boundary free: It's the internet.
       · Relatively inexpensive: The equipment, software and skills are readily and cheaply available,

            and there are few or no distribution costs.

       However, the content must be:

       · Excellent quality: Like anything on the internet, it is just as easy to unsubscribe as it is to
            subscribe. Quality content is what keeps listeners coming back.

       · Real and valuable: While there is value in having product or service information embedded
            in a website, there is no point at all in producing an audio version of a company brochure
            as a regular podcast. Even if editorial is not actually paid for, a lot of the time it has been
            influenced in some way by advertisers. Although there are podcasts that carry adverts, users
            can fast forward straight past them and the chance of real success lies in branded content.

       This is not about advertising or even just product information; it is about coming up with
       ideas for real programmes that, through informing or entertaining, enhance your customers'
       experience of your brand. Refer to Chapter 9: Content marketing strategy for mored on
       creating non-promotional content that generates real value for customers.

    13.13 ANALYTICS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

       As with any digital marketing tactic, you need to be able to track and measure your campaigns
       to understand how successful they are and what you can do to improve them.

       As we have shown, most platforms have native analytics, but because you do not actually
       host your presence, custom tracking is limited. Smaller businesses, in particular, rely on the
       built-in tracking offered by the various platforms, although new third-party tracking services
       are emerging and offering competitive and sophisticated tools, often for a fee. In some cases,
       it is also possible to integrate tracking to some extent if you are directing traffic to a web
       property that you own.

       Web analytics software such as Google Analytics can also be used for social media tracking.
       On Facebook, tracking script can be inserted in applications and tabs where content is served

402
                                                             Social media 

through an iFrame. When sharing links to your own site and content, campaign tracking
parameters can be used to track the source of visits and report on them in your web analytics tool.

13.13.1 Click tracking with URL shorteners for social media

URL shorteners offer analytics that show how     NOTE  Check out the list of URL shorteners

clicking, and where in the world they are. When        com/blog/best-url-shorteners/.
you share links on services like Twitter, you

should be tracking this data. When selecting a

URL shortener, consider whether or not they keep the click analytics private. URL shortening

services provide an easy way to share long links by generating a short URL that redirects

to the original link. This is especially important when sharing links in messages with limited

character counts.

There are several URL shortening services while some websites have their own bespoke
services, such as nyti.ms for The New York Times, which is excellent for reinforcing brand
recognition. Twitter also has their own bespoke service, and no longer requires you to use one
of the URL shortening services. Twitter will automatically alter the length of any URL provided
in the tweet to 23 characters. Some URL shortening services allow you to customise your link.

13.14 SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE PLATFORM

When choosing the most appropriate platform for your brand or business, you need to look
at three key questions:

1. Who is your audience?
2. How can you reach this audience?
3. What does your audience want?

Who is your audience?

You need to define your target audience as much as possible and research them well. Find
out as much about them as possible. Include their digital habits and typical online behaviours
in your research.

How can you reach them?

Once you know who your target audience is, you can analyse the demographics and psycho-
graphics of typical users of different platforms and choose the platform your target audience
uses and spends the most time on. Monitor and track your audience behaviour by tracking
their activity on your analytics. You may find that you need to post at different times or on
different days to reach different audiences.

                                                                                                     403

       Facebook and YouTube are popular choices because of their large user base and thus potential
       reach. However, more niche platforms, such as Pinterest or LinkedIn, may be better choices as
       your content will appeal to and resonate more with these refined target audiences, possibly
       resulting in more engagement than on one of the larger platforms.

      What are your goals?

       Certain platforms lend themselves to certain business and marketing goals. Do you just want
       awareness? Or do you want to build relationships and establish yourself as an industry expert?
       Are you looking for hard sales and traffic? Each platform will meet different objectives, and it
       is important to choose one that is most appropriate to what you want to achieve.

       As discussed earlier in the chapter, marketing on social media is no longer without costs.
       As more and more players enter the market, getting your content seen and noticed requires
       promoted posts, paid-for ads, and targeted marketing. Even if having a channel, page, or
       profile on a platform is free, creating content, especially videos, to put on the platform, costs
       money. It is important that the channel you use to post your content gives you the return on
       investment that you want.

    13.15 RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

       Social media implies a democratisation of information, and it requires authenticity and openness
       from those who deliberately use it for marketing. This means that good and bad stories spread
       easily and stay accessible. Jeff Jarvis had problems with Dell way back in 2005, and you can
       easily find all the relevant information about his ordeal with a quick Google search for `Dell hell.'

       Although you engage publicly with a wide audience when marketing online, marketers need
       to remember that they are communicating with individuals. While marketers should engage
       in the conversation, and ideally lead it, they cannot control it nor should they take over the
       conversation or risk getting cancelled.

       Ideally, marketers should follow a workflow protocol to manage the social community. This
       process is further discussed in Chapter 14: Social media strategy.

     13.15.1 Marketing to content creators

       Content creators can have strong followings on social media and are thus regarded as online
       influencers, who tend to hold a lot of sway. They are a great option for social media strategy
       to reach new audiences, but only if such collaboration fit into your brand strategy. If there is
       potential alignment, supply specific content creators with the tools and resources they need
       to talk easily about your product, including links to your social profiles, Twitter handles, and
       hashtags.

       Remember that, when acquiring the services of an independent person to deliver work for you,
       it's always advisable to have a contract in place to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

13.15.2 Marketing to content consumers

Social media allows anyone to have a say; the same tools that are available to individuals are
available to companies. Company blogs allow a brand to build an online personality and to
interact with their target market. Entertainment created and spread via social media increases
brand touchpoints. Using the same channels that are available to your consumer, aids in
understanding them, and levels the plane of conversation.

When using social media to reach out to content consumers, go to where they are. The media
you use is dictated by your users. For example, a nightclub for students can create a Facebook
Page to advertise its weekly specials and interact with fans, while Land Rover enthusiasts may
prefer to engage on a discussion forum.

With all interactions, marketing messages need to be clearly identified and labelled, with a
disclaimer added if necessary. Trying to hide them as something else will only decrease your
authenticity and probably your following.

13.15.3 Marketing to content sharers

Content sharers are content consumers who also pass your message on, whether it's by
chat or email, by sharing a link on a blog or by submitting your content to a bookmarking or
aggregating service. They are a crucial link in the chain that passes your message around.
Make it as easy as possible to share your content by making the post shareable using unique
and easy-to-read URLs.

13.15.4 Advertise on social media platforms

While marketers can use the tools of social media to convey their message, the characteristics
that define a social media platform are also important. Social media allows users to express
themselves, and this means that rich demographic and psychographic information can be
compiled for more useful and targeted advertising. This presents many opportunities for finding
creative ways to reach an advert-fatigued demographic. It also introduces the risk of dealing with
personal information, so make sure you're up to speed with the relevant laws in your country.

13.16 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

People are finding it easier to switch off or ignore traditional advertising, particularly through
traditional media channels such as TV or radio. Social media gives brands the opportunity to
interact with customers through relevant and targeted communications that customers can
choose to engage with on their terms. For example, a consumer may visit a branded YouTube
channel as opposed to deliberately ignoring advert breaks on television.

Social media's potential shareability can be one of its greatest benefits; if users like your
content enough, they may share it with their own communities. This is increasingly rare and
difficult to engineer.

                                                                                                                                    405
            CRE ATING

       Social media allows you to engage with an online community and connect your brand to
       the appropriate audience. Together these create an online community for your brand and its
       supporters. Social media has created a forum for brand evangelists.
       The interactions on social allow you to garner feedback from your communities. Such feedback
       helps drive future business insights and innovation, as well as marketing strategies. You can
       learn more about your audience's likes, dislikes, behaviours, and needs.
       However, companies need also be aware that bad messages spread as quickly as good ones.
       The connectedness that can prove so useful can also be a conduit for negative messages
       and brand attacks.
       Social media facilitates a two-way conversation between customer and company. This necessi-
       tates that the company shifts approach from `deploy and watch' to one of constant involvement
       with the audience.
       This new landscape is one in which the customer really is king, and any attempt to dethrone
       the king can have dire consequences. Efforts to control the conversation in social media are
       soon found out and can backfire horribly. Any company embarking on a social media strategy
       needs to be sure to monitor their reputation online regularly. It's crucial to know what is being
       said about your brand online and to respond timeously when communicating in the social
       media sphere.
       Finally, never forget that special rules and laws apply when you are dealing with personal
       information provided by users; be very careful how and where you use this data.

      13.17 CASE STUDY: HARLEY-DAVIDSON

           Harley-Davidson is the iconic motorcycle brand from the United States;
           yet there existed a perceived lower appeal for the brand among the youth.

       One-line summary

           Harley-Davidson Australia used Instagram to successfully reach a younger audience in
           the 18-35 year old millennial market.

       The problem

           Harley-Davidson is an iconic American motorcycle brand. The brand has come to symbolise
           freedom and individuality, but is associated with an older market. The brand wanted to
           raise brand awareness and engage a younger audience.

        Figure 13.22 An example of the 2016 Harley-Davidson posts on Instagram

The solution

Harley Davidson decided to use Instagram ads, for the first time, to reach 18-35-year-old
men in Australia and New Zealand.
Harley-Davidson used a series of illustrations to fit in with the visual nature of Instagram.
They wanted to appeal to young, adventurous people who appreciate the world through a
more visual lens. The brand identified three themes they felt resonated with their intended
audience, and tapped in to their own artistic heritage of seeing motorcycles as pieces of
art. The brand commissioned local Australian artists to interpret these themes.
The illustrations were displayed as carousel ads for each theme. When swiped, the images
connected to form a storyline. The visual style was designed to mimic tattoo-like images
and motifs that are popular in biking culture.

                                                                                                                                 407
            CRE ATING

       The results

           · Over a run of just over two weeks, the ads reached almost 1.4 million men, aged
               between 18 and 35.

           · The ad drove over 8 000 clicks through to the brand's website.
           · Harley-Davidson achieved their objective of resonating with a younger audience,

               ultimately expanding their demographic (Digital Training Academy, 2016).

    13.18 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. Why was Instagram an appropriate choice for Harley-Davidson?
       2. Why do you think the brand decided on illustrations?
       3. What other platforms would you have considered, and why?
       4. Are the themes the brand chose relevant to their target audience? Justify your answer.

    13.19 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       A strong digital marketing strategy draws successfully on various tactics, leveraging these
       together. Social media can complement tactics as follows:

       · Social media is inextricably linked to the content marketing strategy: Content is the
            foundation of any social media marketing endeavour, whether you're creating digital copy,
            images, videos, or other media.

       · Social media can have SEO benefits: By using social media services, either to create or
            share content, websites can attract links and generate engagement, helping to enhance
            search engine rankings. Signing up to several social media channels can help a company
            own a larger chunk of the search engine results page. Companies can also use their SEO
            keyword strategy to focus their social media efforts.

       · Social media can provide a targeted network for online advertising: Detailed demographic
            information can play a large role in media planning and buying. Advertisers should create
            targeted interactive advertising for these mediums to encourage engagement. Social media
            also provides affiliates with new avenues for targeted traffic, resulting in revenue growth
            for the company being marketed this way.

       · Social media plays a large role in online monitoring and reputation management, viral
            marketing and digital PR: Social media is used to express opinion. Any company that
            wants to communicate to this connected audience needs to listen to social media. Social
            media is also key to finding and accessing your biggest brand advocates and influencers,
            who can be powerful allies in building your reputation.

       All other marketing efforts should feed into building your online community. Shareable links
       and referrals to your social media pages should be included on all marketing material. Social
       media should in turn try to convince users to sign up for newsletters or loyalty programs to

get users to join your brand-owned CRM. If the user is simply following you on the platform,
their customer data lies on the third-party platform. Having their data in your own CRM allows
you deeper access to that data so that you can engage with your customers through other
mediums, such as email and mobile.

13.20 CHAPTER SUMMARY

Social media refers to the creation and sharing of content by consumers on the internet. It
gives all internet users, including brands and organisations, the opportunity to become both
creators and consumers of content.

Social media refers to a collection of sites and platforms that include the following activities:

· Creating and engaging in social networks
· Generating and sharing content
· Using other internet users' preferences to find content.

UNITING
           UNITING

    INTRODUCTION TO UNITING

       This section is called Uniting because now you are bringing your brand and the customer
       together. One of the worst mistakes a brand can make, is to deliver poor service; no matter
       how polished your copy, or how slick your videos. If you have a terrible relationship with your
       online community, they will go elsewhere. Consider the Pareto principle: 80% of profits are
       generated by 20% of customers, while 20% of customers are responsible for 80% of the brand's
       service problems.
       While most traditional marketing is one way (from brand to consumer), the internet offers
       exciting opportunities to engage meaningfully with your customers.
       Chapter 14: Social media strategy focuses on how you can engage with your customers on
       a level and at a speed that is not possible through traditional marketing platforms. You need
       to understand the landscape to implement and maintain your strategy.
       Once you have customer buy-in, the next step is to manage and maintain your brand's rela-
       tionship with the customer.
       Chapter 15: Customer relationship management (CRM) is critical for any business. It is
       especially important for a brand that has an online presence to understand the customer's
       needs, and foster long-term loyalty, which, in turn, can lead to gaining online brand ambassadors.
       Direct marketing is all about communication directly to the customer, and this involves email,
       and to some extent, mobile channels.
       Chapter 16: Direct marketing: Email and mobile focuses on how to utilise these two channels.
       Considering that 70% of the global population uses a mobile phone, and that most emails
       are opened on mobile devices, you cannot discount the power of these marketing strategies.
       However, you need to manage this relationship carefully; users see mobile as their personal
       device, and resent any intrusions on it.
       Social media is powerful, and mistakes are amplified. Remember that whoever has the social
       media network passwords represents your brand. Direct marketing can result in the highest
       ROI, but you need to be mindful of customer fatigue. Creating quality content and messages
       that will be read requires focus, dedication, and above all, ingenuity.

SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

In this chapter, you will learn:

· How to use social media strategically
· About the steps involved in creating a social media strategy
· About the documents and policies that you should have in place for social media success
· About the importance of effective community and crisis management.

                                                                                                                                    417

    14.1 INTRODUCTION

       In the previous chapter, we covered some of the major social media platforms, their statistics
       and features, marketing opportunities, and the three phases involved in using them to reach
       your customers. These included strategy, implementation, and analytics. Strategy is by far
       the most important, because it informs what and how often you post and how you choose to
       engage and relate to your audience. Strategy also informs how and what you will analyse. It is
       important that all these parameters are clearly established, and that your strategy is informed
       by the data and analytics you receive based on your content and engagement.
       Social media can be used to solve business, marketing, and communication challenges; it is
       an important part of digital marketing. With so many platforms and choices available in social
       media, this chapter will show you how to use these spaces strategically to address challenges.
       The last few years have seen a shift in social media strategy. The space is now considered a
       standard medium for advertising with a far better ability to target consumers. While it is still
       recommended to build a community on Facebook (or the platform of your choice), there are
       brands using the platform for effective advertising, without actually having any followers.
       Despite these changes, effective community and reputation management should remain key
       considerations in your social media strategy. Planning and thinking strategically, while leaving
       room to be flexible and respond to analytics and tactical opportunities, are essential to making
       the most of social media marketing.
       Kepios.com analysis shows that there were more than 4.62 billion social media users around
       the world in January 2022 - 58.4% of the total global population. Social media user numbers
       have seen strong growth over the past 12 months too, with 424 million new users joining social
       media, which is likely attributed to global lockdowns during the pandemic.
       The latest figures indicate that well over 9 in 10 internet users now use social media each month
       (DataReportal, 2022). Creating content for every social media platform is more important now
       than ever to reach and connect with your audience in a way that's relevant and appropriate.
       The figure below provides a high-level view of how to use each platform effectively:

     14.3.1 Communication and outreach

     Social media offers brands effective two-way communication and real-time broadcast channels.
     This bi-directional communication is what makes social communities so exciting (and challeng-
     ing). Just as consumers can communicate with each other and send messages to businesses
     and brands, so businesses and brands can use this medium to communicate with and reach
     out to the public. Social media is a highly effective public communications tool.

     Businesses, governments, and other organisa-

     tions use Twitter and Facebook to broadcast                 NOTE              Ideally, you want to be the trusted
     timely messages, allowing interested parties to                               go-to-source of information about your

14.3.2 Community management

Social media platforms are built around communities and are sometimes virtual representations
of real-world networks and communities. This feature of social media can be used to build and
maintain a supportive community around your organisation.

`Community manager' is a role that has risen to prominence as more organisations start using
social media, but it has always been an important role in any community, from groups that
thrive on forums, to communities run on Facebook.

This creates an environment where those fans can interact directly with the organisation, and
where the organisation can send messages directly to those fans and solicit their feedback.

                        Figure 14.3 Dove creating awareness and responding to customers
       Building and maintaining a community is a long-term project. It starts with determining
       what the best platform is for that community; something that already exists like Facebook, or
       developing a customised new community platform created for the specific brand's purpose,
       either from scratch, or using a service like Tribe (tribe.so).

     14.3.3 Support and customer service

       Social media is an additional customer service channel. Consumers are becoming increasingly
       comfortable transacting online, and they expect the businesses with which they transact to
       respond to their queries in the social space, as they would do through a call centre or email.
       Some customers have found that problems or questions on social media tend to be resolved

more quickly, as brands are wary of having unresolved issues left out in public. For any organ-
isation that runs a social community, customer service is often one of its primary functions.

   Figure 14.4 Hootsuite is one of the brands on Twitter that's doing customer service well
It's important that brands respond to customer queries or complaints on social media because
platforms like Twitter and Facebook keep track of response times. One of the factors that
contribute to a brand's online image is its responsiveness to customer comments. According
to Reputation X (Shah, 2021), "Answering a social media complaint can increase customer
advocacy by as much as 25%, effectively improving a brand's reputation".
Interestingly, social media customer service can be collaborative in that customers assist each
other and, in this way, reduce the reliance on the organisation for support.

14.3.4 Reputation management

Social media is a very effective tool for crisis communication and management. In some
instances, it is also the place where crises start. This can be due to offensive content, an

       employee saying something inappropriate, or even angry customers sharing their complaints
       and getting reactions. It is important that you manage this effectively to preserve your reputation.

      Social media policy and guidelines

       To preserve and protect your online brand reputation and presence, there are a few important
       things you need to put in place, and a social media policy is one of them. In addition, it is
       important to include the guidelines and protocols for your brand to ensure consistency and
       uniformity in how you assist your customers on social media.

       Hoodsuite describes social media policy as "an official company document that provides
       guidelines and requirements for your organisation's social media use. It covers your brand's
       official channels, as well as how employees use social media, both personally and professionally"
       (Newberry and Cooper, 2021).

       It is essential that brands develop a social media policy to manage what gets published on
       their social pages, especially when it comes to employees. The primary purpose of this policy
       is to manage the social media risks your brand may face.

       Your policy should include:

       · Employee roles and responsibilities
       · Security processes and protocols
       · Plan of action for a security or PR crisis
       · Outline on complying with the law
       · Guidelines for employees' social media accounts and posting
       · Advocacy guidelines.

           Hootsuite provides a comprehensive guide on "How to write a social media policy" that
           includes templates and examples that may be helpful: blog.hootsuite.com/social-me-
           dia-policy-for-employees/.

       To assist in setting social media guidelines, there are a few questions you should ask yourself
       to facilitate the process:

       · What is your tone of voice?
       · What is your ideal response time for each channel?
       · What FAQs you are going to include?
       · What is your process for miscellaneous customer issues and escalations?
       · Will you respond to positive feedback? How?
       You may also want to create templates to answer frequently asked questions in order to be
       proactive when responding to social comments and messages. Always tweak your templates
       to remain personable for each query and to maintain the brand tone of voice.

Social media is a great tool for monitoring what is being said about your brand, and to spot
a potential crisis long before it becomes one. Such a `heads up' allows your brand to mediate
the crisis by being proactive and preparing for the situation before it takes hold. Being ready
in any event is a great space for you to manage your communication because it enables you
to get your side of the story out.

14.3.5 Advertising and awareness

Where there is an audience, there is advertising. The more time users spend on social media,
the more brands want to advertise there. It's not only the large numbers of active users or the
time users spend social networks, it's the rich demographic and psychographic targeting
opportunities that make them appealing to advertisers.

Adverts can be targeted based on the profile

information that individuals provide, either    NOTE  Learn more about the advertising

overtly or through their actions on the social        options available on social media in
network. Most social networks offer a number          Chapter 13: Social media.

of advertising options that are accessible to

both small advertisers and big spenders. Social advertising is dynamic, with new advertising

options released regularly. To find the platform and ad type that works best for your audience,

you should experiment with the different formats and models offered.

14.3.6 Sales and lead generation

Adding a social layer to a commercial transaction can create a richer experience for online
consumers. These can be based overtly on social connections or on inferred connections
based on behaviour.

Amazon's collaborative filtering is an excellent example of the layer based on inferred connec-
tions. If you've browsed their website, you will no doubt have seen product information, such
as 'Frequently bought together.' In real time, based on consumer purchase behaviour, Amazon
presents products that you are likely to have an interest in, based on users who browsed and
purchased products that you like, or have selected to buy.

You may not realise it, but this is a social layer in the online shopping experience. Users benefit
because they are exposed to new items that they may not have thought about looking for,
making the shopping experience easier and tailored to their needs. The brand benefits from
the additional sale on items that the user may not have considered purchasing until they were
shown the options.

Social communities can also be lead generation or sales generation assets. You may find your
friends tagging someone (maybe even you) to a post that they believe will be interesting or
useful to them (or you). One way of managing your community to grow your audience base
and improve targeting is knowing how to engage with these leads to get them to follow you.

                                                                                                     425

     14.3.7 Search engine optimisation (SEO)

       Social media plays an important role in SEO. It provides additional assets that can be optimised
       so that a brand `owns' the results page for searches for their brand. A savvy SEO strategy will
       make use of social media assets, links, and likes for strengthening the position of other web
       assets in the SERPs.

        Figure 14.5 Coca-Cola's branded social media platforms appearing in Google search results
       With a little bit of planning and keyword research, a brand can use social assets effectively to
       own searches on their brand name. This ties back neatly to managing their online reputation, too.

     14.3.8 Insight and research

       Social media can be a very powerful insight and research asset, but the information needs to
       be judged in its proper context. When you are planning a campaign, social media can provide
       a rich source of data, both demographic and preference based. You can use the information
       users share freely to understand more about your market, brand, or product. ORM tools help you
       to track mentions and sentiment, giving you insight on how you are perceived by consumers.
       Using social network ad planners, like Facebook's Ads manager, can give you rich information
       about the size of your market and things that consumers like. You can measure sentiment and

the changing number of mentions to help you understand the impact of other campaigns.
Google Trends is another useful tool for people's search behaviour. It offers keyword-related
data based on searches by volume and geographical data.

Building your online community gives you a group you can reach out to for information and
feedback through an always-on online focus group. Remember though, that these users are
inherently biased just by the fact that they would join your social community.

Social data is valuable, but must be treated correctly. It offers qualitative and quantitative
information and, in many ways, provides secondary research. For research purposes, it can
and should be used to help form research questions to gain further insights.

14.4 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CREATING A SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

Social media is fast-moving, which means proper planning is vital to success. Effective social
media strategies come from embracing the fact that social media is a two-way communication
tool. Organisations need the resources to not only push messages out, but to quickly manage
messages coming in.

Planning is the foundation of success. Here is one method of approaching social media
strategically:

Step 1: Get buy-in

Getting buy-in for using social media is

essential. It may be seen as a free resource, but  NOTE  It is important to choose your platforms
even if you are not paying for exposure, there           wisely, and to consider the risks of not

number of stakeholders will need to be aware

of your social media plans, and these may be both internal and external. Of course, you will

need sign-off on any budgeting or additional resourcing requirements.

Addressing the various stakeholders will also force you to do the necessary research and
planning to take the next steps.

Step 2: Listen and understand the landscape
Social media provides a wealth of publicly available information and data that is useful for
your strategy. A good first step to understanding the full social media landscape is to listen
closely to conversations your target market is already having around your brand or industry,
and monitoring what your competitors are up to on their pages.

Some important questions to answer include:

· What conversation already exists around your brand, your industry, and your competitors?
· Do they have the facts?

                                                                                                                                    427
     UNITING

     · Where does it take place?
     · Who is doing most of the talking?
     · What are the emotions involved in conversations about your brand?
     · What are the motivations of those that comment on your brand online?
     · What can you, as a brand, add to this conversation? Is it valuable?

     Online monitoring tools, such as DataEQ (dataeq.com) can help you with the listening part
     of your planning but, in the early stages, you may want to start with free tools like Google
     Alerts (google.com/alerts).

     Step 3: Analyse

     Using all the data that you have been gathering, make the time to analyse. Think critically about
     social media and your brand, as well as your brand's broader marketing, communication, and
     business challenges. All of this should be considered in the context of the information that you
     already know about your local marketing and business environment.

     The outcomes that you should look at include:

     · A list of the social channels and platforms   NOTE  Discover the sentiment around your
         your brand should be on, based on who             brand and whether it is strongly positive
                                                           or negative. Typically, most comments
         your customers are, where they interact,          will be neutral or informational.

         and where they expect to interact with you

     · Non-official groups or communities that
         already exist, which may have been created

     by fans

     · An overview of the existing conversation (volume, frequency, and sentiment), as well as
         any content or conversation themes that occur

     · An overview of what your competitors are doing in this space
     · A list of potential brand evangelists and influencers in your industry.

     Step 4: Set objectives
     Your objectives are the desired outcome of your social media strategy. Your ultimate objective,
     as to what social media should achieve for your business, should be established upfront and
     be based on the context of your marketing and business challenges.

     Once the listening and analysing phase is complete, you can set specific social media objectives
     that will feed into your overall outcome. You need to identify exactly how you will use social
     media to reach the business objectives for your organisation, and then set SMART objectives
     that will help you to achieve these.

     To make them tangible and measurable, establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for your
     objectives, with benchmarks and targets where appropriate. Determine SMART objectives as
     shown below.

428
              Social media strategy

S  SPECIFIC   Details exactly what needs to be done

M MEASURABLE  Achievement or progress can be measured

A ACHIEVABLE  Objective is accepted by those
               responsible for achieving it

R REALISTIC     Objective is possible to attain
              (important for motivational effect)

T TIMED       Time-bound where period for
              achievement is clearly stated

   Figure 14.6 The various elements of a SMART objective

Your objective, for example, could be to grow a community of fans around your brand in a
particular country. Therefore, your KPI might be fan numbers, and you could set a target of
5 000 Facebook fans over six months. This gives you a measurable goal to achieve within a
given time period that can be monitored.

Step 5: Create an action plan

Once you have a clear idea of what you want, you can begin compiling an action plan to get there.

This is where you need to make sure that you have created the necessary documents and
processes that form the foundation of your plan. Remember to keep your chosen platform in
mind when making these plans. You will need to:

· Decide on the roles and responsibilities of the project team and other stakeholders
· Determine what social media tools you will use
· Commit to a frequency and volume of activity, and how quickly you will respond
· Develop a content calendar and conversation plan
· Create tone of voice guidelines, frequently asked questions, community guidelines, and

    content plans.

Step 6: Implement
Putting everything into action is the fun part. Now that you have all of your research and plans
in place, it's time to set up your platforms according to the specific guidelines for each. Most
platforms have helpful and informative guidance for businesses that want to be on their site.
They also provide brand packs and assistance in establishing yourself on the site.

Get your first followers on board by alerting your stakeholders that you are starting your
engagement plans, and make sure that you have tracking in place. Continue to monitor
mentions of your organisation and responses to your messages. Keep to your general plan,
but be prepared to adjust as needed.

                                                                                                                                    429
UNITING

Step 7: Track, analyse, optimise
The beautiful thing about digital marketing is that you can track every single user interaction
and use this information to learn from, and continually improve, your efforts. You should track
the success of your social media campaigns on an ongoing basis and set milestones for your
team at less frequent intervals (every couple of months or so), when you will sit down and do
an in-depth review.

There are several tools you can use for tracking social media. You will need to build a suite of
tools to suit your measurement and reporting requirements.

Platform insights

From the previous chapter, you saw how each major platform offers its own analytics to
businesses and brands that sign up for business pages or profiles. These are a useful starting
point for reporting on your social media efforts, from numbers of followers or fans, to time of
day when your audience is most active and interact with the content you share.

Web analytics                                       NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 20:
                                                          Tracking and analysis.
If you are using social media channels to send
traffic to your own website, you should tag the
links so that you can segment that traffic in your
website reports.

In Google Analytics (google.com/analytics), you would use campaign tracking parameters.

URL Shorteners

URL shortening services, such as bit.ly, goo.gl and Hootsuite offer usage data that will tell you
how many users click on links you share, when they click on them, and where in the world
they are located.

UTM parameters                                      NOTE  UTM stands for Urchin Tracking Module.
                                                          The name comes from the Urchin

you share in your social posts. They include
information about the link's placement and
purpose, making it easier to track clicks and
traffic from a specific social media post or
campaign (Newberry and Cooper, 2021).

       UTM parameters help you to analyse how each of the marketing channels you have invested
       in, such as search, display, or social, have contributed to your campaign. You will be able to
       see which channel sent the most number of users to your site, what the conversion rate of the
       various channels are, and which channel offers the best return on investment. You can also

Online monitoring software

Online monitoring software, also known as sentiment analysis or opinion mining software, is
an important measurement investment that you may need to make. It helps you to keep track
of all mentions of your brand and understand the sentiment and influence of those mentions.
You should be tracking your reputation for trends and changes over time. Some popular choices
are: DataEQ (dataeq.com), Brandwatch (brandwatch.com), SEMRUSH (semrush.com), and
Hootsuite (hootsuite.com).

Social media dashboards

There are a number of services that make it easier for you to centralise management of your
social media properties and make collaborative management easier. They also integrate
analytics data from a number of sources, making reporting easier.

    14.5 DOCUMENTS AND PROCESSES

       The foundations of social media success and your social strategy is likely to involve many
       stakeholders from across your organisation. Good documentation, processes, and guidelines
       ensure consistency across the various channels. These should be created, agreed on, and
       approved before you take any action on social media.
       Start with the documentation and processes you already have in place for marketing and
       communication, for example, brand and tone of voice guidelines, or PR policies. Build on these
       to create a robust foundation that suits this spontaneous, dynamic space.
       A good starting point is a social media checklist to make sure that you have everything in place.
       Examples of the checklist, conversation calendars, and escalation protocols are shown below.

14.5.1 Community guidelines

As well as a privacy policy and terms and conditions, it's a good idea to establish community
guidelines for the communities you manage, especially when the community is on behalf of
a brand. Community guidelines help to set the tone for the community and are useful to refer
to should members behave in a way that is undesirable. Guidelines indicate what will and will
not be tolerated, such as hate speech, profanity, discrimination, or other inappropriate content.
Community guidelines don't prevent such behaviour, but are useful to fall back on should you
need to remove comments or community members from your social page.
Guidelines should be friendly, with the tone in keeping with your community or brand.
Many social media platforms provide their own guidelines that all users, including brands, have
to adhere to. Failure to adhere to any of the guidelines may get you removed from the platform.

                      Figure 14.9 Part of YouTube's 2022 Community Guidelines
Guidelines should not only include information about how and who to report violations to, but
also recommendations for member's conduct and the types of material that can and cannot be
shared. Methods for members to protect their personal information and intellectual property
are important things to include.

                                                                                                                                    433

14.5.2 Content plan

Content plans help you to plan your community conversations and the messages you send. We
suggest aligning your content with your objectives. Decide on what you want to achieve with
each objective, by when, and what level of priority it is for your business. Map these objectives
weekly and monthly as necessary. Then create weekly or monthly content plans around these
objectives, based on each objective's relative priority for your business per week.

For example, if your objectives are brand awareness, sales, and app installs, you need to weigh
them according to their importance. If your main objective on social media is brand awareness,
make this 50% of your content plan. This means that 50% of all content you post will be aimed
at increasing brand awareness. If the other two objectives are equivalent, then content driving
sales and content driving app installs should each make up 25% of your content plan. If this
changes over time, so that in week three, you want app installs to be your most important
objective, then content driving app installs becomes 50% of your content plan, with content
promoting brand awareness dropping down to making up only 25% of your content plan.

Content plans are useful, centralised planning documents that ensure that various teams are
aware of each other's efforts and that communications are integrated. For any kind of content
and communication strategy, content plans are invaluable. Be sure your content plan speaks
to your objective, your brand identity, your chosen target audience, and the themes or topics
you have selected.

Reaching social audiences requires that you

create content that truly resonates with them.       NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 10:
Successful social content must be interest-                Planning your content.

ing, relevant, shareable, and authentic. It is

especially useful to plan and create social content around your content pillars, since this gives

you a solid structure and starting point to follow.

To start creating a conversation calendar, you should plot everything that is relevant to your
community. This could include public events, dates and anniversaries, or events and commu-
nications already planned by your organisation.

You should also use your conversation calendar for reporting. Keeping track of interactions and
responses to your planned posts will help you to determine what kind of posts your community
responds to, what days are best for posting, and what frequency works best for your community.

CoSchedule.com, a content marketing editorial calendar software, provides some guidance on
how often to post on each platform. Some platforms like Twitter and Pinterest require frequents
posts each day, while Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn require less posts (CoSchedule Blog,
2022).

       However, with platform algorithms changing all the time, the frequency of posts is becoming
       less important. A great post will circulate and appear in newsfeeds for much longer, because
       it has good relevant content.
434
                                                              Social media strategy

Brands should only post content relevant to their objectives, not to fill spaces on a content
calendar. Posting poor content to meet a prescribed number of posts may impact your brand
negatively. Because of the algorithms, competition for brands to create good content is becoming
intense, but ultimately the user will get to experience better organic content. Some brands may
have to resort to paid media to get their posts seen at all. The content you choose to create
and the frequency of your posts, should be informed by your community on each platform.

Planning the conversation helps to keep momentum, especially in the early days of building a
community. However, it should not replace spontaneity. You are creating a conversation, after all.

14.5.3 Communication and escalation protocol

An established communication and escalation protocol helps to ensure that all parties are aware
of procedures for handling social messages and can respond accordingly. This is especially
important for large organisations where several users might be interacting on social media on
behalf of a brand, or where several departments or agencies have a stake in the organisation's
social media presence.

A communication and escalation protocol should include:

· Anticipated messages, frequently asked      NOTE  Make sure that all stakeholders
    questions, and appropriate, standard            understand their roles and appreciate
                                                    that social media interactions often need
    responses for both positive and negative        to be handled quickly.

    situations

· Guidelines for determining the sentiment
    and risk of messages, which include a

flagging system for comments that need more senior attention

· The crisis management process to follow if a brand crisis erupts on social media
· An escalation plan for messages that need signoff or further consideration
· Contact details of relevant stakeholders
· Suggestions for responding, including response rate, standard messages, brand voice,

    and tone.

    14.6 DEALING WITH OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS

       The use of social media has equipped consumers with a voice and a platform and the ability to
       amplify their views and truly inform their decision making. The connected nature of the internet
       makes these views easy to share, and the accessibility of social media tools makes it easy for
       other consumers to find these views, respond, and build on them. All of this contributes to the
       perception of the brand.

       The best way to show that you are listening to customer comments, complaints, and questions
       online is the same as with a normal conversation. Comment when it's appropriate, listen with
       interest, be polite, be respectful, and add value wherever possible. Brands should become
       active participants in the conversation.

                                                                                                           Social media strategy

Brands that are successful in communicating with their audiences are constantly on the lookout
for opportunities to propel their brand forward. At the same time they keep their eyes peeled
for risks that may threaten their reputation. In both situations, the power sits in how the brand
responds. This response can range from direct engagement to full new marketing campaign.
Ultimately, it depends on how powerful the opportunity or risk is.
An extreme example of successfully grabbing a social media opportunity is Morton's, an
American steak restaurant chain. One weary business traveller jokingly tweeted Morton's
asking them to deliver him a porterhouse steak at the airport when he landed. The Morton's
social media team were listening and responded by ensuring that the customer was met at
the airport with a steak. This social media stunt garnered enormous media attention, a very
loyal brand advocate, and a hefty increase in sales for the following weeks (Stokes, 2013).

14.6.1 When to talk (and when not to)

Knowing when to respond or post on social media is important for any brand. Deciding when it
is ideal to comment requires an awareness and understanding before taking action. According
to an article on Clutch.co people expect brands to respond to social media comments within 24
hours. With living and growing up in a digital world comes instant gratification, expression, and
responses. Millennials, in particular, take this mindset to the world as a consumer (Sherman,
2018). They respond to marketing in different ways than previous generations. This is because
of the rise of online shopping, social media, and an overall sense of immediacy.

                                                                                                                                    437
     UNITING

     When everything being said is nice

     A great position to be in on social media is when every possible mention is overwhelmingly
     positive. However, that doesn't mean that there is nothing to do. During this time, the brand
     must do everything in its power to drive high volumes of conversation.

     Stakeholders are being positive about the brand because their expectations are being exceeded.
     Unfortunately, expectations change. Brands need to stay on their toes and constantly be on
     the lookout for new and innovative ways to meet and develop their brand promise.

     When everything being said is neutral

     If this is the case, it sounds as if the company is uninspiring, which is not a good way to get
     attention. If a company is playing it so safe that no one is commenting either praise or criticism,
     it's in danger of being forgotten. The next step is no one talking about the company at all. In
     this instance, it is important to review your social media strategy, content, and audience to
     understand why the content is not connecting and then, to come up with ways to interact
     with your audience.

     When negative things are being said

     Negative statements can often be understood

     as broken brand promises. If there is underper-   NOTE  Resolving a serious complaint to the
     formance on expectation, it must be resolved as         customer's satisfaction can gain you a

     need to be very careful not to stir up any more         first-hand experience that your brand
     conversation than is absolutely necessary. That         cares and goes the extra mile.

     said, it's certainly not all doom and gloom. If

     the conversation is broadly negative, it is normally because there is some underlying problem,

     and this information offers the business an opportunity to focus and resolve it.

     Complaints often come from stakeholders who have had dealings with a company that hasn't
     met their expectations. By complaining, the customer is, often unwittingly, giving the company
     the opportunity to make things right and probably indicating where the company can improve.
     Usually, the skilled customer service department should deal with these. They should also share
     resulting insights with the business strategy department so that the underlying problems can
     be prioritised and resolved on a broader level.

     If a complaint is online, the resolution should be there as well, although you can try to have it
     taken offline first. Customer service will likely take place either over email, by phone, or posting
     a personalised comment in a blog post, for example, which may demonstrate to the community
     that the company listens, responds, and serves the critical objective of actually resolving the
     underlying issues. Criticism need not necessarily come from customers, but it is important to
     be aware of it. If criticism involves false information, it should be corrected. And if criticism is
     true, then it should be dealt with accordingly.

14.6.2 RESPONDING

Responding involves recognising that consumers hold the upper hand in the relationship.
They are better trusted, there are more of them, and, in most cases, the barriers to exit from
a brand are relatively low.

Customers dictate the channels of communication. An organisation needs to go to the consumer,
not the other way around. Ignoring this will result in the business losing customers because
they are not willing to truly engage. This is why it's so important to research your audience
and tailor your strategy to them and not vice versa.

Responses to customers on social media               NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 3:
should be personalised for each individual.                Market research.
Do not use blanket responses.

When responding, be transparent, be honest,
and treat the person as you would like to be treated. At all times, remember that you are
engaged in conversation, not a dictation.

14.7 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR RECOVERING FROM AN ONLINE
BRAND ATTACK

The following rules to recovery provide a practical approach for brands facing an online threat:

Step 1: Be prepared
No brand is immune to an online brand attack. The best brands have strategies in place to
identify a reputation crisis immediately and respond to it quickly enough to stop the negative
word of mouth from spreading.

Keep your brand in front of consumers by engaging in the conversation. This can be done
by making use of blogs, communicating with customers, and being as open and honest as
possible. Engaging in and leading the conversation allows you to build an authentic voice. If
a crisis hits, you will be well placed to respond in a way that is authentic.

Step 2: Act immediately

The easiest way to solve most brand attacks is to respond quickly. A brand that shows it is
listening and does indeed care will go far when it comes to ensuring a solid online reputation.
Acknowledge what has been said and react accordingly.

Step 3: If what they're saying is false              NOTE  Cultivating a loyal community of fans
                                                           can help immensely when clearing up

     UNITING

     informed of future news. If the person doesn't react or respond, add a comment to the post
     that it has been addressed.

     Step 4: If what they're saying is true ...
     If the mention is negative but true, send your side of the story and try as best possible to take the
     conversation offline. If appropriate, apologise quickly and sincerely and offer to make amends.

     Step 5: Keep the negative pages out of the search engines

     Keeping more users from reading negative

     pages out of sight.

     14.8 SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY RISKS AND CHALLENGES

     Any social media strategy should account for the risks and challenges of interacting in this
     environment, and should incorporate a protocol for dealing with these risks. It can take a long
     time to recover from mistakes recorded online.

     Some of the common risks and challenges that you should note:

     No one cares: It can be difficult in the beginning to get the traction you want, especially when
     building a community from scratch. This is why understanding the landscape in the context of
     your organisation's market is so important. Make sure you are interacting in the spaces where
     your customers are, and where they are happy to hear from you.

     The social media space is used by unhappy customers (who are free to post detractive
     comments): Even if the only feedback you are getting is negative, it is input that you can use
     as an opportunity to do something about it.

     It requires ongoing attention and monitoring: Social media channels may be free, but there
     is still a time and resource investment required to make your strategy a success. Understand
     what your objectives are for using social media and budget the time required to meet them.

     It can be difficult to measure the impact of the campaign: Social media can be difficult to
     measure, but that does not mean your campaigns are not successful. Don't expect to find a
     solution (or success) overnight. Start with measuring things that can be measured easily, and
     watch for case studies in this space that will help you to turn your social media investment
     into revenue for your organisation.

14.9 CASE STUDY: APPLE: "#SHOTONIPHONE"

Apple's success lies in a strategic vision that transcended simple desktop
computing to include mobile devices and wearables.

One-line summary

#ShotoniPhone was a campaign that turned into a phenomenon, demonstrating how a
simple idea that resonated with the audience successfully generated long-term impact
for the brand (Adorno, 2021).

The problem

Today's smartphone cameras have far surpassed the point-and-shoots that some of us might
still have stashed away in the back of a closet. Each year, smartphone cameras get fresh
updates on resolution, lenses, and sensors. While many people may use their smartphone
cameras for selfies and food photos, both amateur and professional photographers know
the importance of a good camera.

The solution

Apple's ShotoniPhone campaign began as a simple UGC campaign challenge that took
iPhone users' photos, shared them on the brand's social media feeds, and put a select
few up on billboards, short TV ads, newspapers, and magazines, worldwide.

   Figure 14.13 The #ShotoniPhone campaign has over 24 million posts on Instagram

                                                                                                                                 441
            UNITING

       The results

           When incredible photos and videos were produced by real users, the resulting content
           made the iPhone camera quality much more convincing to others. The campaign currently
           has over 20 million posts on Instagram alone and is ongoing (Chen, 2021).

    14.10 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. How has this user generated content (UGC) campaign benefitted Apple over time?
       2. What do you believe has been the main contributing factor to the success of the #Shot-

            oniPhone campaign?
       3. Why do you think users are still participating in this campaign so many years later?

    14.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       What sets one brand apart from another is a solid social media strategy, and its successful
       implementation. It supports broader business goals, while incorporating customer feedback
       to achieve the set objectives. Since it has become the standard medium for advertising, it has
       also opened a variety of new ways for people to connect across networks and build unique
       relationships with brands.

       What is important to remember amid the planning, scheduling, social listening, and media
       monitoring is that remaining flexible for, and actively responsive to, your social communities is
       essential for long-term success. User-generated content and customer reviews are becoming
       more frequently used to verify what brands are claiming in the social space, which is why
       maintaining a positive reputation through effective community management requires brands to
       be authentic and sincere in their audience engagement, as well as their content and messaging.

    14.12 SUMMARY

       Social media can be used strategically in a number of marketing and communication challenges:

       · Community management
       · Support and customer service
       · Reputation management
       · Search engine optimisation
       · Communication and outreach
       · Advertising and awareness
       · Sales and lead generation
       · Insights and research.
       Creating a social media strategy requires careful planning, and a strong foundation that will
       allow you to be dynamic.

                       Figure 14.14 The steps involved in a social media strategy
Social media is a vital strategic consideration for any brand. Whether your organisation is
actively involved in social media or not, your consumers are. If nothing else, this means that
there is market data available to you if you are open to taking the time to find it.
Organisations that make a considered move in the social media space will find it both chal-
lenging and rewarding. The rapid feedback loop can often change preconceptions or even
marketing plans, as the voice of the customer is amplified through social media. In addition,
the collaboration with passionate customer stakeholders is extremely rewarding.

     15.1 INTRODUCTION

     Customer relationship management (CRM) has existed since people first started selling things.
     The first shopkeeper who stopped to chat with their customers, who knew them by name, and
     perhaps gave them a small `freebie' for continually using their services, was practicing a form
     of customer relationship marketing by making customers feel special. They were also probably
     seeing the favourable impact on their bottom line. It helped that customers were being served
     directly by the business owner. This meant it was easy for a shopkeeper to grow their brand
     perception and value through direct interaction with customers.

     Today, with businesses becoming more digitally remote and with person-to-person contact
     becoming sporadic, CRM is more important than ever. We need to build and maintain relation-
     ships with our customers. A faceless company is not personable or engaging and therefore has
     to work harder to fill the gap between attracting and retaining customers (and their goodwill).
     The relationship a customer builds with a company and/or brand is often the reason they return.
     Building those relationships today is more difficult than ever. Customers are smart and exercise
     their right to choose, and a competitor can be just a click away. Users expect companies to
     engage with them, interact and share meaningful content.

     CRM is a customer-focused approach to business, based on fostering long-term, meaningful
     relationships. CRM is not about immediate profit. It's about the lifetime value of a customer, their
     future purchases, the positive word of mouth they will generate on your behalf, and the loyalty
     they will show your brand. Effective CRM enables businesses to collaborate with customers
     to inform overall business strategies, drive business processes, support brand development,
     and maximise ROI.

     There are two approaches to CRM. Businesses can apply it either as an approach to communi-
     cation strategy, using personalised and segmented contact, or as a core business strategy, such
     as loyalty programmes. The size and goals of your business determine which one you choose.

     There is a truism that a happy customer tells one person, but an unhappy customer tells ten.
     With your customers' voices being heard on blogs, forums, review sites, and social media, they
     can talk loudly and impact your business easily.

15.3 A CRM MODEL

Many companies that practice CRM rely on a simple model to guide them strategically. In many
cases, this sums up exactly what CRM is about. Below is a simple model:

     business. One needs to identify the right touch-
     points and messaging to drive a customer
     further along this funnel.

     15.4 UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS

     Customers should be seen as the most important stakeholders in a business. Without customers
     purchasing goods or services, most businesses would not have a revenue stream. It can be
     difficult to shift from realising this important fact to implementing it in day-to-day business
     decisions and strategies.

     A successful relationship with a customer is based on meeting or even exceeding their needs.
     You need to establish what problems the customer has, and provide solutions, sometimes
     before the problem occurs. You also have to continually give the customer a reason to transact
     with your company above any other.

     CRM should not only mean implementing customer-centric processes and consider technology,
     but embracing customer-driven processes. Through innovations in digital technologies,
     enhanced customer engagement, social listening, and the introduction of mass personalisation,
     the customer can often drive the business.

with its customers. CRM can drive the anticipation of customer needs. Touchpoints can be
brand initiatied (e.g., an email newsletter) or customer initiated (e.g., a customer making an
in-story purchase).

A consumer touchpoint can be as simple as a print or banner ad. It can also be as multifaceted
as a conversation between a call centre agent and a customer. It can be a timely tweet, or an
outbound email giving the customer details about their account. Even statements and bills
are touchpoints and need to be managed carefully to ensure that the brand continues its
relationship with the customer successfully.

Customer touchpoints can generally be divided into three spheres or phases: pre-purchase,
purchase, and post purchase.

         Figure 15.3 Examples of touchpoints at each stage in the purchase process

Pre-purchase, or pre-usage, covers the various ways brands and prospects interact before
the prospect decides to conduct business with a company. The brand's goals here are to:

· Gain customers
· Heighten brand awareness
· Shape brand perceptions or highlight the benefits it offers over competitors
· Indicate how the brand provides value and fulfils the needs and wants of consumers
· Educate consumers about products and services
· Ignite the possibility of a relationship.

                                                                                                     451
     UNITING

     Purchase, or usage, covers the touchpoints at which the customer decides to purchase a
     product, use a service, or convert according to set criteria. It initiates the brand-customer
     relationship. The key goals are to:

     · Instill confidence
     · Deliver value
     · Reinforce the purchase decision
     · Heighten brand perceptions
     · Facilitate ease of purchase
     · Reduce post-purchase dissonance.

     Post-purchase, or usage, covers all the post-sale interactions between the brand and customer.

     Now, the brand wants to:

     · Deepen the relationship
     · Maximise the customer experience
     · Deliver on the brand promise
     · Increase brand loyalty
     · Remain top of mind
     · Invite repeat purchases.

     15.4.2 Customer loyalty

     The main objective of any CRM strategy should          NOTE  Think of a brand that has extremely loyal
     be to gain customer loyalty over the long term.              fans, for example, Apple, Nike or Harley-

     about acquiring and retaining customers who:                 them so vocally?

     · Have a projected lifetime value that makes
         them a profitable prospect to your business

     · Buy a variety of your products or use your services repeatedly during their time as a customer
     · Share their positive experiences with others
     · Provide honest feedback on these products and services, as well as their experiences
     · Collaborate with you on ways to improve their experiences
     · Become online ambassadors, who share and engage with your content.

     15.5 CRM AND DATA

     Data is central to the success of CRM initiatives. Knowing who your customer is, how they
     behave, and what they want makes a CRM strategy successful. Data gathering can begin
     even before your prospect becomes a customer. Matching a prospect's profile to the product
     or offer is the first step.

452
                                                                             Customer relationship management (CRM)

Data on its own is meaningless if it is not analysed and acted upon. Through analysis, data
can be turned into insights, which can then inform the various CRM processes and, indeed,
the business itself.
Data should underpin the way each touchpoint is utilised to build loyalty.
Consider the consumer who shops on her store card at a retail outlet. Her transactions are
recorded against her card and she is sent offers that detail the latest fashion trends and earns
points on her card shopping for these. At some point, her transactional data shows that she
has started shopping for baby clothes so she can now be cross-sold products, and rewarded
with double points when she buys them. Now she is increasing her spending in the store,
cross-shopping for both herself and her family and being rewarded for this, thus ensuring that
the retail outlet is offering her value and retaining her business.

15.5.1 Customer data

A good CRM programme begins with data. Who are my customers and what do they want?
What are their demographic and psychographic needs? Why did they choose me in the first
place? How many of them are active and continue doing business with me? Why do the others
stop? What is the average tenure of a customer?

                   Figure 15.4 What do you want to know about your customers?
Often, you will need to research this information. If the company has a database, conducting
surveys, focus groups, or dipstick telephonic research can help you get an idea. Consider that
an Audi Q7 driver is vastly different to an Audi A1 driver, for instance. They both pick the brand
for similar reasons, but their motivations behind choosing the products differ vastly.

                                                                                                                                    453
     UNITING

     Data can give you these insights. It can enable a company to create real value for the customer
     and thereby gain true loyalty. There is little point in running a customer insights survey, looking
     at the results and saying, `that's interesting' without putting into action any changes suggested
     by the results. Not auctioning noticeable changes also means customers are less likely to take
     part in surveys going forward, and quite rightly so. What's in it for them? Conversely, if you do
     action changes, customers will feel increased ownership in the brand and its offering.

     The actual technology you use to gather and        NOTE  Choosing a CRM system and

     own USPs and quirks.

     When looking at data, it is essential to keep in mind the Pareto principle. The Pareto principle,
     or 80/20 rule, holds that in many situations approximately 80% of profits are delivered by 20%
     of customers. Also keep in mind the traditional view that 20% of customers are responsible for
     80% of problems related to service and supply (Koch, 2008).

                                     80% of profits are generated by 20% of your customers, while 20% of
                                     customers are responsible for 80% of problems relating to the service

                                            Figure 15.5 The Pareto principle

     This means designing solutions with efforts directed at the 20% of customers who generate
     the most profits. To do this, you should segment customers effectively. High-value segments
     are unique to each business.

     You'll also want to consider the exact data to collect. While this will depend largely on your
     business objectives, here are some considerations:

· Information should be commercially relevant
· Capture additional contact details from the customer at every organic interaction, such as

    on purchases, contracts, negotiations, quotes, and conversations
· Allow your customers to manage their data along with you
· Keep track of any information you send out to the customer
· Consider anything that adds value to the relationship
· Note any legal implications around capturing and storing data, particularly web-based

    behavioural data, as the user's privacy must always be taken into account.

15.5.2 Where and how to gather CRM data

CRM data is gathered from a variety of touchpoints. Let's look at some of the possible oppor-
tunities for CRM data capture and analysis. Each avenue discussed below collects a range of
data from whichever touchpoints the business deems valuable.

Traditional CRM system data

Most traditional CRM systems are used to capture data for sales, support, and marketing
purposes. On top of simply creating a central repository for data access, these systems and
their related databases also offer basic analytics. The actual range of data collected within the
traditional CRM system is dictated by the CRM objectives. For instance, data could include
the following:

· Demographic details on potential leads, current leads, and contacts, such as contact
    information, age, gender, and income

· Quotes, sales, purchase orders, and invoices (transactional data)
· Psychographic data on contacts, such as customer values, attitudes, and interests
· Service and support records
· Customer reviews or satisfaction surveys
· Web registration data
· Shipping and fulfilment dates, such as when orders were shipped and delivered.

Data mining and testing hypotheses

Data mining involves analysing data to discover unknown patterns or connections. It is usually
conducted on large datasets and looks for patterns that are not obvious. Data is analysed with
statistical algorithms that look for correlations. It is used by businesses to better understand
customers and their behaviour, and then to use this data to make more informed business
decisions. For example, a grocery store that is in a primarily residential area may experience
an increase in customers looking to buy prepared meals and/or convenience meals in the late
afternoon or early evening as people begin arriving back in the area after work. This store will
be busy on weekends with people purchasing groceries for the week ahead; these groceries
including protein, frozen foods, and pantry staples. However, a grocery store that is in an area
with a high number of office parks may experience the opposite; they will see more people

                                                                                                                                    455

coming into the store looking for convenience meals and/or hot prepared food during the
day, and particularly, during the `lunch rush.' They may also see an influx of customers in the
late afternoon/early evening buying ingredients for dinner at home, such as unfrozen protein
goods and fresh produce.

or more of your website's goals.

      Social media monitoring data

       There are many social media metrics that are important to monitor, measure, and analyse,
       and some of these can provide valuable insights for CRM implementation. This can cover
       everything from quantitative data about number of fans and interactions, to qualitative data
456
                                                                             Customer relationship management (CRM)

about the sentiment towards your brand in the social space. Social media metrics can also
lead you to new prospects.

15.5.3 Collating and organising your data

Typically, you'll find that a business has:

· One or more databases, such as email, customer, mobile, or call centre databases, or
    datasets in silos

· A point of sale system where product purchase data is stored
· Various forms of web data from display or search networks, keyword research, site analytics,

    social media, or email marketing
· Social media profiles on sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or LinkedIn, which

    can also be considered databases of sorts.

CRM software can be used to automate lead and sales processes and to collect all of this
customer information in a centralised place, allowing a company to get a holistic view of the
customer; from this, meaningful data insights can emerge.

equally frustrating for an organisation not to know who has spoken previously with a customer
and what was dealt with. This could be a touchpoint at which a company falls down and leaves
a less than positive impression with the customer.

Fortunately, there are many technological options that help to record all this information in
one place. Most of these services can also schedule elements of the sales process and set
reminders where appropriate for follow-up action.

Some notable examples include Salesforce   NOTE  Consider user adoption rates and the

15.5.4 Keeping data fresh

Call it what you will, but `stale,' `outdated,' or `unhealthy' data doesn't benefit anyone. Some
generic older data can help you assess trends over time, but identifiable customer data is
usually redundant if not up to date. People move house, update their contact numbers and
email addresses, and change jobs. They earn more or less, stop working, start working, have
kids, and retire. All of these mean that their needs change, and their contactability changes;
therefore maintaining a customer relationship and delivering relevant communication becomes
impossible if your information is not fresh.

       So, how do you keep your data fresh?
       For generic data (like web analytics), you must continuously monitor trends and note what
       causes changes over time. This is also useful for monitoring trends and identifying gaps in
       data when a business evolves. For instance, if you know that you generally receive increased
       website and store visits during December, but your sales drop, you know that you need to
       gather more data around your inventory and in-store environment during that time.

       Keeping identifiable data current means you need to facilitate regular dialogue with contacts
       on your database. Whether it's through a call centre, an online prompt, or a quick question at
       your in-store point of sale, there needs to be a plan for updating details at regular intervals.
       You can empower your customers and incentivise them with programme attractiveness.

     15.5.5 Analysing data for marketing

       One of the most powerful features of interactions and transactions over the internet is that
       everything is tracked and recorded (see Chapter 20: Tracking and analysis and Chapter 21:
       Conversion optimisation). This provides a wealth of data that can be analysed to make
       business decisions.

       For CRM, this means that the customer acquisition source can be recorded and analysed
       against sales data. This leads to a very accurate return on investment (ROI) calculation and
       indicates where CRM and marketing efforts should be focused.
458
                                             Customer relationship management (CRM)

ROI stands for return on investment, and it's key to understanding whether marketing efforts
have been successful. Here's a simple example: Company A sells accounting software and
makes R10 000 on each product it sells. It sends an email to its customer base, users who
have bought a previous version of the software and might be interested in upgrading. The
campaign has an overall cost of R100 000. Of the 5 000 users who receive the email, 10%
decide to buy. That means it cost R200 to acquire each of the 500 customers. The company
has made R5 million, an ROI of 50:1.

Integration is the key to the effective use of technology in CRM. Ensure that all channels can
be tracked and that information is usable to all parties within an organisation. Knowing where
your customers come from, but not what they purchase, is pointless; these two metrics need
to be compared in order to produce actionable insights.

Analysing CRM data can aid marketing initiatives in a variety of ways, for example:

· Campaign analysis: Find out which          NOTE  Mobile marketing can play a key role

    increase ROI.

· Personalisation: Customise your commu-
    nications to each customer.

· Event monitoring: Tie offline events, like
    shows or sales, to your online interactions and sales.

· Predictive modelling: Predict a customer's future behaviour and meet this need at the
    right time.

Analysing CRM data can aid in improved customer segmentation, including:

· Customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis: Predicting each customer's lifetime value and
    managing each segment appropriately (e.g., offering special deals and discounts).

· Advanced customer profiles: Identifying certain behaviours, such as big spenders or those
    who look for bargains by attending sales. This information can be used to tailor marketing
    communications accordingly.

· Customer prioritisation: Targeting small groups of customers with customised products
    and service offerings that are aligned to meet customer needs, rather than simply generic
    current offerings. You should craft specialised retention strategies for customers with the
    highest CLV.

· Identify brand influencers and advocates: Consider the realm of social media, where
    influencers are central to the spread of content. Brands are increasingly prioritising relation-
    ship building with social media influencers to build brand advocates who will help market
    the business for them. By identifying which customers are providing the most value and
    positively influencing others to become customers, you can focus efforts towards them
    and increase their loyalty, creating true brand advocates.

                                                                                                      459

     Understanding customer lifetime value

     CLV is the profitability of a customer over their entire relationship with the business.
     Businesses need to look at long-term customer satisfaction and relationship management,
     rather than short-term campaigns and quick wins. This approach leads to increased
     value over the entire lifetime of a customer and means that CLV is a metric central to
     any CRM initiative.
     It's important to look at your customer base and segment them according to how often
     they purchase and how much they spend with your company. Very often, customers who
     spend more, cost more to acquire, but they might also stay with the company for longer.
     Referrals made by a customer can also be included as part of the revenue generated by
     the customer.

     Figure 15.8 The customer's average order value and how
          often they order are used to determine their CLV

     The key is to understand these costs and then target your CRM strategies appropriately.
     CLV lets you decide what a particular type of customer is really worth to your business,
     as well as how much you are willing to spend to win or retain them.

     For example, a potential customer looking to purchase a digital camera is likely to search
     on Google for cameras. As a company selling digital cameras, your excellent search advert
     and compelling offer attract the potential customer who clicks through to your website.
     Impressed with your product offering, the user purchases a camera from you and signs
     up to your email newsletter as part of the payment process.

     Analysing the amount spent on your search campaign against the sales attributed to
     the campaign will give the cost per acquisition of each sale. In this case, this is the cost
     of acquiring the new customer.

     As the users are now signed up to your newsletter, each month you send them compelling
     information about products they may be interested in. These newsletters could focus on
     their obvious interest in photography and highlight additional products they can use with
     their new camera. Think about the value exchange that is necessary for a customer to
     give you their attention. Content marketing is a powerful tool here. The costs associated
     with sending these emails are the costs of maintaining the relationship with the customer.

460
                                                 Customer relationship management (CRM)

When they purchase from you again, these costs can be measured against the repeat
sales likely to be made over the course of the customer's lifetime.

For example, most customers will purchase

a new smartphone every 2 to 3 years;             NOTE  See Chapter 9: Content marketing

purchase accessories, such as phone

cases, spare chargers, or earphones. Each of these opportunities allow a company to

calculate a lifetime value and ensure that their spending on a particular customer is justified.

15.6 THE BENEFITS OF CRM

At its core, effective CRM promises the following:

· Increased revenue and profitability
· Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty
· Better service delivery and operational efficiencies
· Decreased acquisition costs; keeping churn low through CRM offsets the need to spend

    as much on the acquisition of new clients, while retention of existing customers is cheaper

    for obvious reasons.

Maintaining good customer relationships is             NOTE  A CRM communication programme is

generally far higher than the cost of maintain-

ing an existing customer relationship. While an

investment in a CRM communication programme or platform can be large, these costs are

often offset by the increased revenue generated by encouraging repeat business.

15.6.1 Putting a value on CRM

Broadly, CRM can be looked at from:

· A marketing perspective: Understanding your customer segments and building a rela-
    tionship with them.

· A cost perspective: Decreasing the amount you spend on customers; it costs more to
    attract a new customer than to maintain an existing one.

· A sales perspective: Turning the users who know about your service or product into
    customers who have made a purchase, in other words, managing prospects.

· A service perspective: Ensuring that users who have interacted with you are satisfied
    and delighted.

                                                                                                   461
            UNITING

       Effective CRM can also create a powerful new marketing and referral force for a company,
       namely its happy customers. Delighting customers fosters positive word of mouth.

       The first step to any CRM initiative is to understand the value of a customer relationship to a
       business.

     15.6.2 CRM implementations

       CRM should infuse every aspect of a business in the same way that marketing should be
       integral to everything you do, but it is useful to look at the different ways CRM is implemented.

       You should consider your relationship with your customer at every point. There are a multitude
       of ways that customers and your business will connect (or collide). As far as possible, try to
       ensure that these connections are positive.

      Marketing

       Marketing is the first way that a customer will hear about your product or service. There is no
       point throwing information out into the world and hoping that your ideal customer will find
       you; you have to nurture this relationship.

       · Conduct personalised targeting and profiling across a range of marketing channels such as
            telemarketing, email marketing, social media marketing, and campaign management projects.

       · Place the right mix of a company's products and services in front of each customer at the
            right time.

       · Understand what customers do and want, matching that knowledge to product and service
            information and measuring success.

      Sales

       Ensure the customer receives the correct product.

       Make sure that correct sales-related processes are carried out within the organisation. This
       could include:

       · Client or campaign management
       · Sales configuration, for customising products or pricing
       · Call management
       · Contact management
       · Ad management
       · Sales force automation (including territory)
       · Account and lead management systems

· Interaction between all parties in the transaction
· Systems that put sales reps directly in touch with customers at the point of sale.

Service and service fulfilment

Improve the service you give to current customers through:

· Email response management
· Social media support systems
· Telephony capabilities, such as automatic call distribution
· Computer-telephony integration
· Queue/workflow management
· Interactive voice response and predictive dialling.
· Problem resolution systems, workflow automation, and field service dispatch systems.

Services invoked by the customer

Create and manage systems or capabilities that can be directly invoked by the customer. Here
are some examples:

· Web self-service
· Search
· Instant messaging
· Email queries
· Voice over IP (VoIP)
· Browser and application sharing
· Conferencing
· `Call me' capabilities
· Social media support
· Online forums.

CRM loyalty programs

There is a difference between CRM and loyalty programmes. Loyalty programmes actively
seek to maintain customers by rewarding them with a hard currency, like points. Loyalty
programmes are designed to develop and maintain customer relationships over a sustained
period of time by rewarding them for every interaction with the brand. You may, for instance,
earn points on a purchase, for shopping on certain days, completing a survey, or choosing to
receive a statement by email.

Consider South African health insurer Discovery and their Vitality program. It aims to keep
customers healthy by rewarding them for health-related behaviours like exercising, having
regular check-ups, stopping smoking, and buying healthy foods. By doing so, it reduces the
burden of ill-health on the medical aid itself.

                                                                                                                                    463

                         Figure 15.9 An advert for Vitality promising rewards for keeping fit
       Not all loyalty programmes are created equal. Many brands have embraced them as a way
       to improve their sales, and consumers have come to believe that they are simply a way of
       extorting more money from them.
       To create an effective loyalty programme, consider the following:
       · Carefully calculate the earning and redemption rates of points: A loyalty programme

            needs to give the appearance of real value, while working within the company's profit
            projections.
       · Loyalty programmes are about value exchange: You need to find a way to partner with
            the customer.
       · Rewards are key to success: You need to offer value to the customer in a way that is real
            and desirable.
       · Customer care is important, but it's a hygiene factor, not a differentiator: Technology
            allows for effective real-time conversations.
       · Data, a single view of our customer, is central to success: You need to maintain accurate
            records in one central place.
       · Digital allows for innovation: This can apply to new payment technology, digital commu-
            nications channels, and more.
       · Trust is pivotal to success: Customers need to know that their data is being protected and
            that you will honour your commitments. Legal requirements in your country may demand it.
       · Loyalty programmes are not quick wins: Consider up-front how the programme might come
            to a close or risk alienating and disappointing customers and undoing any positive results.
       The loyalty currencies offered as part of the loyalty programme offer huge potential for brands.
       Amazon's loyalty currency, Amazon Coins, is available in eight countries and already has many
       customers investing hundreds of millions in the currency (BizCommunity, 2017).
       However, any financial rewards offered as part of your loyalty programme need to be carefully
       considered and their value proposition evaluated and assessed before implementation. For

example, Pick n Pay, a large grocery store chain in South Africa, drastically cut the rewards
on its Smart Shopper loyalty programme in early 2017. Customers went from earning R1 for
each R100 spent, to earning R1 for each R200 spent. The initially generous loyalty program
and associated loyalty currency was impacting on the business' bottom line. Such a radical
change in reward levels did not go down well with customers, and the brand did experience
some fall out. The impact of the programme on the business' operational costs should have
been assessed and addressed earlier, rather than so many years after implementation leaving
customers with a negative experience of the brand (Business Day, 2017).

Where loyalty programmes are built around straightforward points and rewards systems, they
can also become a point of parity. A loyalty programme should deliver on value that is unique
and central to your organisation. You don't want to be competing with your competitor on
who can provide more points, which essentially means more discounts, and ends up being a
competition based on price. The sum of the parts of your loyalty programme should be difficult
for a competitor to replicate.

  Cryptocurrencies

   Like loyalty currencies, cryptocurrencies are also based in the digital world and not tied to
   a central banking authority. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, were developed as a means of
   facilitating electronic payments online using a peer-to-peer network that was not managed
   by a server or central authority. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are digital money created
   from code. The data is encrypted and encoded to signify a single unit of currency. Such
   currencies are not secured by people or by trust, but by pure mathematics, making it a
   more secure system because it is not impacted by central banks and monetary supply. It
   is also almost immune to corruption. As well as Bitcoin, there is Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum,
   and Monero, to name a few (Blockgeeks, 2016).

   These digital currencies, both universal cryptocurrencies and loyalty currencies, are
   challenging the traditional banking and international monetary system. Individuals are
   losing trust in banks and national governments' roles in monetary policy.

   However, it must be acknowledged that cryptocurrencies carry their own level of risk
   and weaknesses. One of the criticisms levelled against cryptocurrencies is the enormous
   pressure it puts on the environment due to the massive amounts of energy required to
   run the mining servers. People are also not as trusting of cryptocurrencies yet because
   they do not necessarily understand it or know how it works. Because the currency is not
   necessary linked to traditional currency, people may not understand where their money
   has `gone' or how to use it.

   cryptocurrency/.

Apps

CRM apps are a great step forward in customer relationship management. They help to
track customer contact info, which members of your team they interacted with, their emails,
and positions, as well as the last conversation the customer had with your company. Larger
companies make use of software tools like Salesforce, but the high price tag makes the software
unattainable for small businesses and startups.

CRM apps like HubSpot CRM, Zoho CRM, and Intercom are popular choices. If you're looking
for a full-featured CRM, HubSpot works for up to 1 million contacts and integrates with Gmail
or Microsoft Outlook. Google contacts is a nice simple choice that works inside of Gmail and
is ideal for smaller businesses and startups. Intercom is a CRM that focuses on what people
view on your site, so that you can track what they are likely to purchase. It links user behaviour
to user profiles, and the paid options include chat options that allow you to chat directly with
customers online. Zoho is a great choice if you already use Zoho software.

Apps are making CRM easier by managing your contacts and tracking their interactions with
your brand. They continue to get better and better, and brands should be making use of these
useful tools.

Apps for payment services

As well as CRM apps, brands can develop loyalty apps that also enable payment. Brand specific
apps that enable purchases are becoming a preferred means of payment. The Starbucks
Rewards program accounts for almost 50% of Starbucks' revenue (as of October 2020). Over
60% of millennials are happy to use apps to purchase products in store, which is changing the
landscape of loyalty currencies and how such currencies are managed by brands (BizCommunity,
2017). More and more brands are offering payment gateways and even credit and microloans
through their apps. This is impacting how customers view brands as service providers and
greatly changing how they see banks and traditional monetary institutions.

SMS

SMS is a handy tool for communicating with     NOTE  See more about SMS and apps as

all mobile channels, you will have access to

your customer exactly where they are at that

moment and in a very personal space. Therefore, use this channel responsibly and only when you

have permission to do so. Sending endless SMSes can lead to customers removing themselves

from your SMS contact list and could give that customer a negative perception of your brand.

      Live chat

       Having the ability to chat to your customers when they are on your site is very useful in addressing
       customer queries immediately and can lead to valuable conversions. Real, live customer service
466
                                                     Customer relationship management (CRM)

agents or sales people can converse directly with customers, addressing any concerns easily
and directly or selling them any products they may be browsing at that moment. Live chat
offers many benefits, including improved conversions, SEO, average order times, awareness
of additional products, efficient management of issues, and reduced overhead costs. Cost per
contact is much lower than call centre or in-store customer assistance.

Various providers offer live chat functionality to websites, such as Intercom, Pure Chat, Live
Chat, Live Agent, and Freshdesk. It is becoming increasingly common to have live chat on
brand sites, and customers that expect to find live chat don't walk away from your brand. Just
like not being on Facebook could be detrimental to your brand, simply because customers
may expect all credible businesses to be on the social network, not having a live chat could
also negatively impact customer's perception of your brand as a viable business.

In an attempt to streamline processes, some

companies use chat bots to solve customers'          NOTE  Read about the "5 Common Chatbot

to speak to a person.

                              Figure 15.10 The live chat feature on Fedhealth

Be wary of using chat bots to address clients on live chat. Customers dislike robotic responses
and want to feel heard and acknowledged by a real person. Although chat bots offer large-scale
solutions to CRM, their use should be carefully considered against customer response and
attitude to communicating with a bot.

    15.7 SOCIAL CRM

       Widespread social media usage means that CRM has to be conducted in this forum in order to
       deliver an all-around experience for the customer. Not only should social media be integrated
       into any existing CRM strategy and looked at from a touchpoint and channel perspective, but
       social media can also be used to drive CRM.

                                    Figure 15.11 Stats on poor customer service cost
       Social media platforms allow customers to easily share their brand experience (good or bad)
       with their online social connections, who in turn can share this experience. This means a
       potential word-of-mouth audience of millions could witness a single user's brand experience
       and weigh in on the situation.
       Customers place a great deal of value on the opinions of their peers and are more likely to look
       favourably on a brand, product, or service if a peer has recommended or praised it.

                                        Figure 15.12 Influence of peer-driven media
       Brands have realised that they need to leverage this in their CRM strategies and now understand
       that communication is not one way (from brand to consumer) or even two way (between
       consumer and brand), but multidirectional (brand to consumer, consumer to brand, consumer
       to consumer).

                                                                             Customer relationship management (CRM)

The convergence of social media with CRM has been termed social CRM or CRM 2.0 and has
developed into a field on its own.

               Figure 15.13 Peers recommend companies and influence purchasing

15.7.1 Social CRM and support

Social customers are increasingly turning to social media channels for support. With the
immediate accessibility offered through mobile devices, they see this as a convenient channel
to communicate with brands. This means that brands need to respond quickly and transparently
to consumers' questions, gripes, and even compliments. A support query going unanswered
on Twitter, for instance, is likely to cause frustration for the consumer, and prompt them to
take a situation that is already visible to other consumers even further, potentially causing a
brand crisis.

                                     Figure 15.14 Social CRM is valuable
Brands should carefully consider whether all social media channels are appropriate for them
and be prepared for any eventuality. Brands that are well liked will generally have positive
responses on social media, and those that receive a mediocre response from consumers will
have a bit of a mixed bag, but those that have a lot of support issues are likely to experience
very large numbers of complaints that need to be addressed.

                                                                                                                                    469
            UNITING

       Social support staff should have access to all the historical data relating to customer issues, such
       as all the data collected about previous complaints and reference numbers. These channels
       make customer support public. In this way, they can respond directly to the consumer in the
       social channel that they've selected and escalate the problem appropriately.

     15.7.2 Social CRM and online monitoring

       Social CRM can also make use of online reputation management and monitoring tools.
       Online monitoring, or reputation management, entails knowing what is being said about your
       organisation and ensuring that you are present in or leading the conversation.
       By using these tools, brands can rate and sort these mentions based on their sentiment. This
       allows them to effectively test the temperature of the online community's feeling towards the
       brand, which can then guide any future action.

                          Figure 15.15 Hashtag monitoring on a social listening dashboard

      Social listening

       Data that you accrue through social listening and enhanced customer profiles can help you
       draw valuable insights about your target audience on an individual and/or collective level. It is
       all about collecting data; whether it is brand mentions, relevant hashtags, competitor mentions,
       or industry trends. If you are not using social media listening, you may not know what your
       competitors are up to in real-time. Social listening is like a early warning system that sends
       signals about how your brand is perceived - negative or positive.
       Make sure that you are not just tracking metrics; rather, gain insight into your customers and
       potential customers, and then address their needs.

15.8 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO IMPLEMENTING A CRM STRATEGY

There are five steps to implementing a CRM strategy:

Step 1  Conduct business analysis and
        develop a problem statement.

Step 2 Understand your customers' needs.

Step 3 Set objectives and measurements of success.

Step 4  Develop your CRM strategy, and determine
        how you will implement it.

Step 5 Choose the right tools.

Figure 15.16 Five steps to implementing a CRM strategy

Step 1: Conduct a business needs analysis and develop a problem statement

A major part of determining where to begin with CRM implementation is having a clear
understanding of business needs and where CRM would most benefit the organisation. CRM
touches on both online and offline sales, marketing, and customer service. It's important to
review the needs of each business area so that you can determine your CRM strategy.

Ideally, you should have individual goals for each department. All members within the organ-
isation should buy into the strategy in order to drive it successfully. Implementing successful
CRM across the organisation is a process, in which stakeholders make decisions collectively
and share their views and needs. Decisions should be based on realistic budgets and resources
and full calculations carried out before any kind of loyalty currency is decided upon. Remember
the Smart Shopper example from Pick n Pay above. Failing to carefully consider how rewards
may impact on your bottom line, could cause problems later on.

Step 2: Understand customer needs

CRM is about the customer. You might have identified a range of business needs, but what

about the needs of the customer?                                                                 471
UNITING

Two elements of CRM in particular, service delivery and customer support, are actually all
about meeting the needs of the customer. And what's the best way of determining customer
needs? By asking them, of course. There are various ways to find out what customers want,
but in all of them, it is important to listen. Use online monitoring tools and insights from social
media to gather a more rounded view of what your customers think, feel, and want. Look at
past behaviour, churn rates, and successes. It may be worth doing a detailed data mining
exercise to understand which of your customers is the most valuable and why.

Step 3: Set objectives and measurements of success
CRM is a long-term commitment. Therefore, you need to consider a long-term approach.
Depending on the business needs, you may decide to focus on communications objectives,
sales objectives, business objectives, or all three.

Objectives and success measures could include the following:

Table 15.2 Objectives of sales and business

Sales objectives             Business objectives           Communication objectives

increasing customer numbers                                improving responses to
                                                           campaigns
increasing market share      increasing profitability per
                             customer                      improving end-to-end integration
                                                           of the sales process cycle

The metrics you select for measurement will depend on these objectives. There are numerous
metrics that you can choose from when measuring your performance, and the actual metrics
you choose are generally referred to as your key performance indicators (KPIs).

Step 4: Develop your CRM strategy, and determine how you will implement it
Once you've identified all CRM implementation objectives, you will need to determine how
you are actually going to roll it out. What channels will you use? What touchpoints will you
leverage? What data will you need for this?

Next, you need to determine which tools you will use to gather this data and how you will
implement your initiatives across these channels. Don't forget that you need to communicate
with your internal stakeholders before you launch the initiative to your external ones.

You will need to make choices based on what is available to you or what you intend to embrace.
The digital space offers a range of innovative options for CRM delivery; you simply need to
get creative in your execution.

       Step 5: Choose the right tools
       There are lots of excellent CRM tools available, but these are useless without a clear CRM
       strategy in place. You can only select your tools once you know what your objectives are,
472
                                                                             Customer relationship management (CRM)

what touchpoints and channels you are going to utilise, and what data you need to collect
and analyse.

15.9 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

CRM systems that gather information on customer preferences and needs, as well as information
on competitors, and in the industry in general, let organisations focus on providing customer
solutions instead of simply pushing products.

We've outlined a host of options below.

Collaborative CRM tools

Collaborative CRM refers to a process that combines customer data across all facets of a
company. For example, queries regularly submitted to the technical support or customer service
arm of a business can be used to inform product development and website content. Instead
of various departments collecting their own customer data and using this in isolation, data is
collated so that all channels make informed decisions based on the holistic customer experience.

Nice (nice.com) is an example of a CRM product that offers collaborative authoring. This means
that multiple users can simultaneously edit shared documents while maintaining an audit trail
and version control.

Social CRM tools

Social CRM tools perform a number of functions, from standardising the collection of data from
social media channels, to automatically posting links and accepting friend requests. These
tools can also be used to identify customer sentiment within social media channels.

BrandsEye (brandseye.com) and Simplify360 (simplify360.com) are examples of social CRM
listening tools that collect data on brand mentions across social media channels online, in real time.

Operational CRM tools

Operational CRM tools deal with the most obvious channels that relate to customers: the front
end of a business and its customer service. From a web technology point of view, operational
CRM informs the website what a customer sees as well as their entire online user experience.

Two examples of operational CRM tools are OnContact (oncontact.com) and Zoho CRM (zoho.
com/crm).

Sales and marketing automation CRM tools

Sales force automation (salesforce.com) uses CRM software to manage sales cycles and to
collect customer sales data. The software enables businesses to track leads, schedule trans-
actions and communications with potential and existing customers, and generate detailed
reporting on the sales process.

                                                                                                                                    473
            UNITING

       Marketing automation tools identify current customers and use their response information to
       manage email marketing lists. The tools can also identify prospects, as well as unhappy customers.
       HubSpot (hubspot.com) offers a marketing automation tool that allows companies to generate
       and send behaviour-driven emails.
       Analytical CRM tools allow companies to record, save, and investigate customer data to better
       understand customers through their behaviour. For instance, data collected about the nature of
       visits to your website can be used to make informed decisions about where to focus attention
       based on customer behaviour. Past purchasing behaviour of customers can be analysed
       to predict future purchasing behaviour. Data can be used to segment customers and tailor
       communications. These tools can help target marketing campaigns at customers and predict
       future sales and customer spending.
       KXEN was an American software company which existed from 1998 to 2013 when it was acquired
       by SAP (sap.com). It is a popular analytical CRM tool with the ability to forecast customer
       behaviour and shed light on customer preferences and spending power. It also allows you
       to tailor marketing campaigns to specific customers, segmented by various demographics.

      15.10 CASE STUDY: AMAZON PRIME

          Amazon Prime is the loyalty programme for Amazon.com.
          Amazon is a international online shopping hub that has products
          in almost all categories; from household detergents to party
          packs to online books.

       One-line summary

          Amazon Prime has become one of the largest and best loyalty programmes in recent years,
          despite not using point systems and oversimplified projections of loyalty by providing
          consumers real value by addressing their needs for instant gratification and exclusivity,
          while streamlining the customer experience and seeing a substantial financial return for
          the company.

The problem

Amazon noticed that shipping was often a stumbling block when it came to completing
purchases. If shipping took too long, users would drop out of the purchase. Similarly, if
users purchased an item that was less than the minimum to receive free shipping, they
would also abandon the purchase. They needed to somehow streamline this process, so
that customers would complete their purchases.

They considered a loyalty program that would address these two aspects, but knew that
customers are inundated with loyalty programmes that offer cash-back rewards and
promotions. Every retailer, bank, and service provider offer some form of loyalty programme
that is very similar to all the others.

Amazon noted that many loyalty programmes fail because they don't meet the needs of the
customer and promise delayed gratification. They offer customers nothing new nor anything
they can derive any real benefit from in the short term. Customers have to build up points
and cash-backs and wait to receive their reward. Many customers have become wary of
loyalty programs, seeing them as another way to extort more money from consumers.

Customers need something that offers real benefits, for which they are willing to pay
US$139 a year. They want real value immediately and not something they need to wait
months or years to see any benefit from.

The solution

Amazon Prime provides its customers with what they really want and need from the
brand. It has created a program that is designed to meet their customers' need for instant
gratification and removes the stumbling blocks in the purchase process. Prime members
receive next day delivery on all items, and do not need any minimum value in their shopping
carts to receive free shipping. They reap the benefits of the program immediately and
every time they shop online.

Instead of making these shipping features free, Amazon Prime made the service part of an
exclusive loyalty programme that users had to pay a yearly fee to benefit from. In addition
to tapping into instant gratification, Amazon Prime also made use of customers' desire to
be involved in something exclusive, that would set them apart from general customers.
As well as shipping benefits, Amazon Prime users would get access to exclusive deals
and discounts, as well as the first option on new products. Prime members get to see and
purchase products before they are made available to other customers.

To ensure they provided perceived real value, Amazon also included access to their entire
library of Amazon Prime videos in the Prime membership. Amazon Prime has started to
produce its own content for Amazon Prime (called Amazon Originals). This means that
the customer receives great value in the form of online viewing content, and the brand
gains invaluable input that it can use to fuel further development.

                                                                                                                                 475

          Amazon Prime is more than a loyalty or a rewards program, it is a privilege program
          that taps into customers' need for feeling important and special, as well as addressing
          stumbling blocks in the purchasing process, and meeting our growing need for instant
          rewards (YourStory, 2017).

       The results

          Amazon created a truly extraordinary loyalty programme that users were prepared to
          pay for. By providing customers with what they need and streamlining the customer
          experience, Amazon demonstrated that gimmicks and cash back rewards were not the
          solution for loyalty programmes.
          Amazon Prime saw rapid adoption in the US and experienced a 40% increase in sub-
          scriptions year-on-year for more than a decade after its inception. From 2020 to 2021,
          the subscriptions increased by 50 million, and Amazon reported in 2021 that there were
          more than 200 million Prime subscribers worldwide (Howley, 2021).
          More than 60% of Amazon's US customers had a Prime membership. Prime members
          spend nearly double (US$1,300) what non-Prime members do (US$700) per year (Business
          Insider, 2017). The programme was a huge success for the brand, with revenue from Prime
          alone making up US$ 6.4 billion in 2016. The programme was so successful that revenue
          from subscriptions alone was nearly enough to cover the largest cost of the company: its
          overall shipping costs (Bloomberg, 2017).

   Essentially, establishing customer loyalty is about providing users with an experience
   that is simply better than anything else, so that users change their purchase behaviour
   to favouring your brand. And that is exactly what Amazon was able to achieve through
   Prime (LooseThreads, 2017). An example of these benefits and positive experience was
   the time-saving that shopping with Prime offered customers. According to Bezos (2021),
   `a typical trip to a brick-and-mortar store may take an hour, a purchase on Amazon takes
   15 minutes.' Without having to take time to go to physical stores, the founder estimates
   that the average prime customer saves 75 hours a year.

15.11 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

1. Why do you think Amazon Prime has been successful for so many years, when most other
    programmes lose their allure?

2. What aspect of loyalty does Prime tap into?
3. What do you think of Amazon's decision to include their video streaming as part of their

    Prime membership?

15.12 THE BIGGER PICTURE

Managing customer relationships should be built into every marketing tactic and activity you
perform, especially if your organisation has adopted CRM as an ongoing strategy to drive
customer retention.

Successful email marketing is built on two very basic customer needs: privacy and permission.
The very first step in using email to communicate with a customer is gaining their permission.
Data mining and segmenting customer databases allows email marketing to be tailored and
personalised. Email is often the primary point of contact for service-related messages.

Online advertising is a double-edged sword when it comes to CRM. It can be a very effective
acquisition tool for new customers, but intrusive advertising can attract attention for all the
wrong reasons. Effective online advertising speaks to customers' needs and presents solutions
to them, attracting attention without being overly intrusive. The key is to be relevant and useful
wherever possible.

Search engine optimisation and search advertising start with customer intent. Existing customer
data can indicate where to focus search engine marketing efforts, especially when it comes to
analysing how well a website caters to the intent indicated by a customer's search term. Social
media marketing is based on customer needs and preferences. It is also a powerful tool for
turning delighted customers (who are expressive online) into advocates for an organisation.
Social media creates new communication channels for an organisation, enabling discussions
and customer service to take place where the customer feels most comfortable.

                                                                                                                                    477
            UNITING

       Effective web development and design starts with understanding and catering for customer
       needs, and should focus on the experience of the web user. Designing for customers first and
       foremost gives web visitors a seamless experience. CRM data can tell you what your customers
       need, and web experiences can support the customer journey. Web designers and developers
       can also create sophisticated customer service portals to manage CRM, such as support pages.
       Through all of the digital marketing tactics, effective analytics is the most useful CRM tool.
       It allows each channel to be measured on its merits, and the customers acquired by each
       channel can be analysed.

    15.13 SUMMARY

       Customer relationship management is the cornerstone of your interactions with customers.
       Digital technology makes the process of discovering key insights seamless, effective, and very
       useful, but CRM cannot be restricted to only digital channels as customer interactions happen
       offline too. There are many benefits to implementing a CRM strategy, from reduced customer
       service costs to happier customers, and quicker, more tailored, and effective communications.
       Naturally, understanding customers is the biggest outcome of CRM. This understanding leads
       to meeting their needs much more effectively, which in turn has direct bottom-line benefits
       for the brand.
       There are many facets to CRM that you should consider before deciding how you will approach
       it. Some key factors include:
       Brand touchpoints: How do customers interact with the brand, and vice versa?
       The tools you need for your business: Will you use operational CRM, analytical CRM,
       collaborative CRM, or sales force automation?
       Communication channels: Which are available to you to communicate with your clients?
       Implementations: Will you implement for sales, marketing, and customer support and service
       fulfilment, or all of these?
       Strategy: What are the steps you need to take within your organisation to ensure a successful
       CRM strategy?
       Costs: What cost are you looking at and what return on investment are you expecting?
       Your long-term aims: What is your goal? Why do you need to manage your relationship with
       your customer? How will this benefit your company?
       Data capabilities and needs: Are you gathering the correct data, storing it correctly, updating
       it constantly, and then analysing it for insights?

    16.1 INTRODUCTION

       Direct marketing is all about communicating directly to customers rather than indirectly, via
       ads or billboards. Direct marketing via digital generally involves email and to some extent,
       mobile channels.

       At its core, email marketing is a tool for customer relationship management (CRM). Used
       effectively, this extension of permission-based marketing can deliver one of the highest returns
       on investment (ROI) of any digital marketing activity (the principles covered in this chapter
       can apply to any kind of permission marketing). Simply put, email marketing is a form of direct
       marketing that uses electronic means to deliver commercial messages to an audience. It is
       one of the oldest and yet most powerful of all digital marketing tactics. The power comes from
       the fact that it is:

       · Extremely cost effective due to a low cost per contact
       · Highly targeted
       · Customisable on a mass scale
       · Completely measurable.
       Furthermore, email marketing's main strength is that it takes advantage of a customer's most
       prolific touchpoint with the internet, their inbox.

       Almost 70% of the world's total population uses a mobile phone. Furthermore, growth in this
       sector is steady, rising by around 1.8% annually. By the start of 2021, the total number of mobile
       connections was 8 billion.

       During 2021 mobile clients accounted for 41.6% of all email opens (emailmonday, 2022), whereas
       desktop accounted for 16.2%.

       47% of consumers use a mobile application for checking their email (Campaign Monitor).
       Email open rates on mobile show that email remains the most useful channel for getting to
       people. Depending on the market you're targeting, if you send an email, it will be opened on
       a mobile phone at some point.

       This means that you cannot think about email without thinking about mobile at the same time.

       Like mobile-specific channels, email marketing is a tool for building relationships with both
       existing and potential customers. It should maximise the retention and value of these customers,
       which should ultimately lead to a greater return on investment.

           Some people consider email marketing to be old fashioned. Indeed arguments about
           its demise have been going on for years, but it can be one of the most powerful tools in
           your digital arsenal.

16.3 DIRECT MARKETING STRATEGY AND PLANNING

The first part of any digital direct marketing campaign should involve planning for the goals
you need to achieve. Email and mobile marketing can be used as a tool to help you achieve
your business and website goals. As with all tactics, direct marketing should be considered
in line with your overall business, marketing, and digital strategy.

As discussed in the chapters on analytics and   NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 21:
conversion optimisation, you will decide on           Conversion optimisation.
the key performance indicators (KPIs) for your
campaign. KPIs are the metrics that indicate
how well you are performing.

You have a few options for digital direct marketing:

· Promotional emails
· Newsletters
· Transactional emails
· SMS marketing.

Promotional emails will usually have an immediate goal:

       · Users make a purchase

       · Users download some content

       · Users request further information.

Newsletters tend to focus on longer-term goals and are usually geared at creating and retaining
a long-term relationship with the reader so your KPIs are more important here.

Transactional emails are generally automated emails that inform customers of payments,

subscriptions, or changes to their account. This category can also include confirmation emails

or reminders.

16.3.1 Email service providers

An email service provider (ESP) is a partner

who can help manage your email design              NOTE  We have listed some ESPs in the Tools of
and send. For bigger organisations, it often             the trade, section 18.6.

makes sense to purchase your own software

and server or to partner with an ESP. This is especially true if you are sending more than 50

emails at a time. Most ESPs are do-it-yourself services that do not manage or strategise your

campaign, but give you the tools you need to manage it yourself.

There are some important questions to ask when choosing an email service provider:

· How easy is it to use? This is important if you are managing the campaigns yourself.
· Can you upload and migrate the contact list? It's advisable that you own your lists.
· Is the process self-service or managed?
· How does the reporting work?
· What is their deliverability like?
· Are they endorsed by email and deliverability authorities, such as Return Path or Trust-e?
· Do they adhere to best practices for direct marketing?
· How is the data stored, processed, and secured? Who owns it?

16.3.2 Using mobile for direct marketing

Remember that users see their mobile as a personal device and can resent intrusions on it. This
means that there are certain principles you'll need to keep in mind if you plan to use mobile
for direct marketing purposes.

Privacy and permission

One of the most important principles for mobile is privacy. Users see their mobile as a very
personal device; they don't respond well to unsolicited marketing messages invading that
privacy. The location-based nature of mobile also presents some challenges to user privacy.
No one wants their location published without their permission, and users need to be able to
control notifications.

For a business to avoid damaging its brand by      NOTE  Remember that many countries have

messages and should be able to opt out at will.

A strong database of preference profiles and

constant maintenance of consent can drastically reduce the risks and make users feel more

in control of their marketing experience.

                                                                                                   487
            UNITING

           Read how Hindustan Unilever targeted low-income consumers to build a permission
           database in an area with vast basic mobile penetration but relatively little smartphone
           presence: hbr.org/2016/12/how-unilever-reaches-rural-consumers-in-emerging-markets.

      Value and reciprocity

       The best way to avoid coming across as invasive and intrusive for mobile users is to ensure
       that every message you send on this personal device is valuable to them. Push notifications
       from apps, for example, have a high engagement rate, but users won't opt in unless you are
       offering clear value and have taken the time to build up some trust. Digital consumers have far
       too many distractions competing for their attention to pay attention to an unsolicited marketing
       message that gives them nothing.
       Offering value to mobile users does two things: It helps to build up relationships and, as a
       result, loyalty, and it uses the principle of reciprocity. If you give consumers something, they
       are more likely to be willing to give something back.
       For this reason, any messages you send directly to users should be helpful and set the customer
       up to remember you in a positive light. For example, a hotel could send a confirmation sms, a
       reminder or a way to shorten the check-in process, or a query about whether the guest needs
       anything upon arrival. None of these would be seen as intrusive.
       Offering real value to your consumer won't amount to much if they're not reading the messages
       you send, which they won't if they don't trust you. To build up that trust, you need to consistently
       invest in a value exchange; their attention for your message.

      Relationships

       If you practice permission marketing and offer value to your mobile audience, you will ultimately
       build a stronger relationship with your customers. These relationships can result in a higher
       customer lifetime value as well as positive sentiment, which can be spread by your audience
       and result in more converts to your brand.
       Because mobile's ability to connect you to your customer at their moment of need is unpar-
       alleled, so is its ability to help you build a connection with your brand's followers. When used

· Can you pre-check cell numbers with networks and carriers to find out which numbers
    are MMS-enabled?

· How does the reporting work? What can you measure?
· Do they optimise the MMS for the screen size of the phone?
· How good are their creative services? Make sure you see some examples of previous work

    to assess their skills.

· Do they provide and manage an opt-out service?
· What are the personalisation options?

16.3.4 Email on mobile

You now know that most email is opened first on a mobile device, in fact, about 3 to 5 consumers
say they check their email on the go (mobile) and 75% say they use their smartphones most
often to check email (Van Rijn, 2022).ial. Users expect an engaging, attractive experience across
devices, so an email that isn't formatted for a mobile device isn't going to get a good response.
Many users will simply delete the email or even opt out rather than opening it again on desktop.

This presents a challenge for email design. The mobile screen is obviously much smaller than
a desktop screen, so the way an email is displayed differs as well. Not only that, but different
mobile devices have different screen sizes, and they make use of different mobile operating
systems. This means that each one has different standards and default settings and renders
emails in a unique way.

To make things even more difficult, very few

users view an email on only one device. They      NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 7: Web

laptop to their tablet and back to their mobile

phone during the course of a day. Although sending two versions of your email is an option,

one for mobile, one for desktop, it's probably not the best solution. You want an email that

displays well across as many different clients and operating systems as possible. One way to

achieve this is through responsive email design.

Some smartphones do render HTML emails and can auto-fit them for mobile screens, but this
can still affect the way the email displays.

Take into account that 62% of mobile users will delete an email if it is not mobile-optimised.
In a study it was found that 52% of users said that a bad mobile experience made them less
likely to engage with a company (Rinaldi, 2022). Your content must be easy to skim, with clear

     To ensure optimal rendering on mobile devices,  NOTE  Don't worry if some of this sounds a bit
     here are some common best practices to follow         too technical. Your web developer will
     when designing your emails:                           understand and be able to advise you.

     · Generally, most emails are designed to be
         600px wide to display well in an email preview pane. This scales well on typical mobile

     screen sizes. On a 320px screen, an email can be zoomed out to 50% and display perfectly;

     similarly, on a 480px screen, it can display at 75%.

     · Host your email newsletters online and link to them from your preheader. That way, anyone
         who opens your email on a mobile can click straight through to an HTML version of your

     newsletter.

     · Design your email in a grid system. This means your content needs to be laid out in vertically
         and horizontally aligned blocks, with gaps in between. Doing this will make it easier for

     various operating systems and email clients to scale your email down to fit a mobile screen.

     This is not a guarantee that the email will display properly in mobile, but it should solve the

     problem for most mobile devices, such as iPhone, which auto-fit HTML emails.

     · Make sure that you include alt text for your images! Your email needs to convey its message
         with or without images.

     · Mobile devices that don't automatically scale your email down will display the content
         on the left of your email first. Make sure that your most important content is placed here.

     · Button links need to be at least 44px to render well on mobile phones. Smashing Magazine
         recommends 72px so that users can easily tap buttons with their thumbs and see visual

     feedback that the button has been pushed.

   Something important to remember: design for touch.

Most mobile devices have touchscreens. This means that, instead of clicking on your links
with a mouse, users will be tapping your links with their fingers. If your links are placed too
close together, it will be difficult for users to click on one link without accidentally also tapping
the other. To make the user experience easier, make sure your links are placed in a 30-45px
area, with a margin of at least 15px around them. By spacing links like this, it will be easier for
touchscreen users to follow through on your call to action.

16.3.5 Rules and regulations

There are a number of laws across the world to protect users from unsolicited emails and
SMSes and stop businesses from abusing these communication channels. While they vary in
severity according to the country, and we recommend that you do some research into your
local legislation, it's important to acknowledge two very important rules:

1. You cannot send communications to someone without their permission.
2. If someone requests to be unsubscribed from your communication, you have to meet their

    request or face penalties in many jurisdictions. This means including an unsubscribe option
    for emails and an "SMS `stop' to opt out" option for SMS.

16.4 STEP-BY-STEP DIRECT MARKETING PROCESS

Direct marketing requires careful planning and weeks, if not months, of preparation work to
get right. These steps will guide you through the process of setting up your direct marketing
strategy.

16.4.1 Growing a database

Running a successful direct marketing campaign requires a business to have a genuine
opt-in database. This database, or list of subscribers who have agreed to allow a company to
send them emails or SMSes with marketing messages, is the most valuable asset of a direct
marketing campaign.

Permission must be explicitly given by all users to whom messages are sent. Companies that
abuse this can put their reputation in jeopardy and, in many countries, legal action can be
taken against companies that send unsolicited bulk messages also known as spam.

It is important to track the permissions that are generated for each user. A time stamp is a key
part of the data capture and opt-in process and helps to protect you against spam complaints
and potential legal action.

Spam is unsolicited bulk email or SMS messages. It means that the recipient has not given
permission to be sent that message. According to statistics released in 2019, around 9% of

                                                                                                                                    491
     UNITING

     marketing emails in 2018 were considered spam by email providers. This is out of a total of
     just over 281 million emails sent in that year.

     By 2025, it is estimated that over 376 million emails will be sent in that year alone, which is a
     growth of almost 100 million emails in less than ten years.

     Growing this database while keeping it targeted is a key factor in any direct marketing campaign.
     The database needs only one entry, the prospect's email or phone number, but the following
     should also be considered:

     · Name, surname, and title
     · Date permission granted
     · Source of permission
     · Gender
     · Country
     · Date of birth
     · Phone number or email (depending on which you already have)
     · Frequency (how often they'd like to hear from you).

     Fields such as name, surname, and title should be separated in your database. You should also

     gather date of birth as opposed to a prospect's age as it ensures that your database can stay

     up to date.

     Don't be tempted to ask for more information       NOTE  As always, the best long-term strategy
     than required. The more information a marketer           for growing your database is to create
     can gather, the better they can customise                valuable, shareable content that users

     mation a prospect is required to give, the less
     likely they are to sign up. Further information
     can be requested over time.

     There are many ways to attract prospects to opt into a database. An email sign up form on a
     company website is vital. Website visitors express an interest in a company by clicking-through
     and this is an opportunity to develop that interest further. Following the same principle, any other
     properties where newsletter or SMS sign up can be promoted should be taken advantage of.

                         Figure 16.6 An email newsletter sign-up call to action
Here are some best practice tips for sign-up forms:
· Put the sign-up form where it can be seen, above the fold and on every page.
· State your anti-spam stance explicitly, and be clear that you value subscribers' privacy.
· Clearly state what the subscriber's information will be used for.
· Use a clear call to action.
· Include a benefit statement. Tell subscribers what they will get and how often they will get it.
· Ensure the email address or phone number is correct by checking the syntax.
· Test to see what works best!
Every interaction can be used to ask permission to send marketing material, though some
work better for email than mobile, for example:
· Offer something valuable, and ask them to sign up to your email newsletter at the same

    time (e.g., white paper, gift voucher, music track).
· Add a newsletter subscribe box to the checkout process of your retail site.
· Use interactions at trade shows to ask for email addresses and possibly phone numbers.
· Ask for email addresses or phone numbers in-store.
· Call out your email campaign on your social networks, and link through to your subscription

    form.
· Invite users to submit their phone number and email address in order to enter a competition.

16.4.2 Designing an email

Emails should be created and viewed as HTML for desktop and most mobile devices. Simpler
phones require basic text emails. Be sure to check your audience's preferred devices carefully,

                                                                                                                                    493

     as cheaper smartphones are becoming available, which increases their penetration into
     lower-income areas.

     Text emails include small, plain, text only content. If you use a Windows Operating System,
     open Notepad, and type there, you will be creating a text file. As these are text only, the copy
     really counts here.

     HTML emails have more complex designs. These emails can contain images, different fonts,
     and hyperlinks. They're probably what you've had in mind throughout this chapter when we
     referred to email marketing.

     Parts of an email

     Each part of an email serves a particular function.

     Sender information

     This includes the `to,' `from,' and `reply to' fields.  NOTE  Refer to the images of the full newsletter
     These are opportunities to build a relationship               later in this chapter to see how these
     through creating a perception of familiarity.                 elements look in context.
     In other words, the reader needs to perceive

     that the newsletter is somewhat unique and

     sent personally by the publisher. Using a personalised company email address, (e.g., trevor@

     company.com), for the `reply' field creates familiarity and builds trust with the reader provided

     the name is recognisable. Otherwise, using the brand name is fine. The `from' address should

     also include the organisation's name. A meaningless `from' address that the reader cannot

     identify serves only to confuse the origin of the newsletter.

     Subject line

     The subject line may be the most important              NOTE  You could also try personalising the
     part of an email! Subject lines help the reader               subject line with the recipient's name or
     to identify the email and entice them to open                 location to make your email stand out.
     it. The subject line is also scrutinised by spam

     filters, so you should avoid using unusual

     characters, for example, `#2$%&^^%###' or `!!!!!.' Emojis such as smiley faces or hearts can

     sometimes work, but first test to see what works for you.

     Consistent subject lines using the name of the company and the newsletter edition can build
     familiarity and help readers to sort their inbox. Subject lines should also reflect the content of
     the email. As with everything online, testing different subject lines will lead marketers to the
     formula that works for them. Some brands have found that using emojis can improve open
     rates, while others have had no success with them.

   Did you know that 47% of email recipients open an email based on the subject line alone?
   At the same time, 69% of email responders report emails as spam based solely on the
   subject line. Apart from curiosity, FOMO is possibly the one psychological principle that
   drive consumers to open an email. Being humorous requires a bit more thought and
   creativity, but subject lines that make your subscribers laugh, can pay off in terms of
   your open rates.

                    Figure 16.7 Sender information and a subject line on an email
Preheader
The preheader is a line or two of text displayed above your email header. Most commonly, it's
the line of text that will redirect you to `View online.' Where possible, try including your call to
action in the preheader. This could be difficult, given the limited space, but it does ensure that
every recipient, even those who don't necessarily open the email, will still be exposed to it.

                                        Figure 16.8 An email preheader
Header
The header is the colourful banner or image that is included in many emails. This often contains
the logo, which is important for branding, as well as a CTA or image to catch the recipient's
attention. Not every email will have a header, but these do provide added impact.

       Personalised greeting
       With a database that has the capability to store readers' names, it is possible to personalise
       the greeting of the email. "Hi, Kim Morgan" can elicit far better responses than "Dear Valued
       Customer", but it is possible to create a greeting with personality without personalising it.
       Occasionally, the subject line can be personalised as well to boost responses. Including your
       subscriber's name is not the only way to make your subject lines more personal. You can also
       use casual language, share something, or use copy that implies familiar tone or friendship.

                                        Figure 16.10 A personalised email greeting
       Body
       This is where the content of the email goes. Don't be tempted to use too many images; they
       can increase the size of the email and obscure text when images do not load. Be sure that text
       can be read without an image being loaded. The structure must allow readers to scan and
       navigate the email easily. Short paragraphs, emphasis through bolding and colours, as well
       as sectioning information with bullets and borders, all contribute to a well-structured email.
       Footer
       A standard footer for emails helps to build consistency. It is the customary place for the contact
       details of the company sending the email. It should include the name, physical address, and
       contact email of the company. It can also include the privacy policy of the sender or even extra
       copy to reinforce branding. One way to grow the email list is to add a `forward to a friend' link
       in the footer or, more commonly, social media buttons. The most important part of the footer
       is a clear unsubscribe link.

Unsubscribe link

In many countries, it is mandatory to have an unsubscribe link on all commercial emails. In best
practice terms, you should also include a link for managing subscription preferences - this lets
the receiver decide exactly which emails they receive from you, rather than opting out from
all of your email marketing.

just need to slot content into the appropriate

sections. Some email service providers offer

ready-made templates for you to use. As with website templates, paid-for email templates

come with some benefits and disadvantages. While they are often cheaper than commissioning

a custom template, they can be inflexible and generic, meaning that they will not uniquely

represent your brand. If you are choosing a template to buy, consider picking the plainest one,

so that you can adapt it to your brand as needed.

A custom-designed email template will allow you to plan your own content structure and
ensure it displays well across many email readers and devices.

When having your template designed, it's important to test it with a number of email readers,
browsers, and mobile devices so that you can ensure that it displays correctly. This can become
challenging as some users still use preview panes to read their email.

Design considerations

How an email looks is integral to how well it is received by your database. Design also refers
to how it is built, which can impact whether the email is delivered and how likely users are
to interact with it. Some design considerations are included below. A few of these are a little
more technical, so make sure that your email partner has these covered for you.

The look and feel

Studies have found that users read or scan

emails following an F-shape (Nielsen, 2006).  NOTE  Take a look here for some free email
A follow-up study by the German Research            templates as a place to get started:

different layouts and paragraph lengths, and

found that the F-shape still applies (Biedert, Dengel, Buscher, and Vartan, 2012). So, plan your

important information to follow this flow.

                             left-hand side of the screen dominating patterns

Cluttered inboxes and busy subscribers mean an email that's lengthy and difficult to get through
probably won't be read. Help your subscribers by structuring your email content into segments,
making use of borders or colour blocks to accentuate and divide content. It's important to
balance image and text in your emails. Make a point of placing images next to the relevant text.

General design guidelines                     NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 7: Web
                                                    development and design.
HTML and CSS design principles differ for
web and email. Here are a few things to keep
in mind when designing your email:

       · Don't make use of external or embedded
            style sheets and avoid unnecessary embedded rows and columns.

       · Make use of table nesting as far as possible, as this is generally considered to render the
            best results with difficult email clients. Email designers tend to make use of tables to design
            their email layout, using inline styles within these tables.

                                                        Direct marketing: Email and mobile

· Set a fixed width for your email by specifying  NOTE  Naturally, your email design should
    the width and spacing of each cell rather           echo your overall corporate identity and
    than the entire table. When these specifics         personality.
    are not declared, email clients tend to

render the email according to their own

defaults and can break the design.

· If you are using a block background colour, be sure to include a 100% width table to cover
    the entire email.

· Keep fonts in your email design larger than 16px. Anything below that becomes difficult
    to view in mobile. Also bear in mind that, while coloured text (or light-on-dark text) may

look visually impressive, it can be difficult to read an entire email like this and may strain

your subscribers' eyes. Rather limit such visual tricks to smaller sections of your email, or

to emails that contain less written content.

· Make use of inline CSS. Some email clients strip the CSS from the head and body of the email.
· Test your emails in a variety of email clients before you send.
· Use responsive design!

Designing for the preview pane

Many email users still use desktop clients to manage their email. Given the number of emails
users receive on a daily basis, many still prefer to view emails in their preview panes rather
than opening them. This has added another challenge for designers who want to ensure that
their emails display properly.

Images and layout should consider the preview pane and be tested for rendering. Preview
panes can be vertical or horizontal.

Tips for designing for the preview pane:

· There is no set width. Therefore, testing is the way to go. A width of 600px works best for
    preview pane display (HubSpot, 2016).

· Ensure that plain, email-friendly fonts are used toward the top of your email in order to
    ensure that the first text encountered is properly displayed.

· Consider carefully what images you display in the top section of your email and test displays
    accordingly.

· Placing your logo prominently at the top left of your email can ensure optimal brand
    recognition and exposure.

· Try to include your call to action in the area displayed in the preview pane. That way, even
    if subscribers choose not to read your email, they'll still see your primary message.

· Some successful email templates use the area likely to be seen in the preview pane to
    provide a table of contents for the email. Users know what they can look forward to when

    opening the email.

                                                                                                  499
UNITING

Email and images

Avoid using images to convey important content. Make sure that there is alt text for all images
used in the email. This ensures that the message of the image will still be communicated even
if the image itself is not seen. Even though most email clients display images by default, some
users may still not see them. Your email should make sense whether or not the user can see
images.

Tips for using images in email design:

· In the past, background images did not render well in emails, but this is changing. A block

      The call to action

       Email design should support calls to action. For your campaign to be effective, your goals and
       KPIs should be supported by the email layout and design. Calls to action can be hyperlinked

text (also called text links), or can be images which look like buttons. Don't forget, that if images
are blocked, your buttons will be blocked too.

Generally, both text links and CTA buttons are effective for generating clickthroughs, though
some studies find that buttons perform better. While you should use buttons for links that
support your CTA (e.g., `make a booking,' `check availability') your email shouldn't be littered
with them, and hyperlinks should be used for additional links. You should test them to see
what kinds of CTAs perform best for you.

The copy of the CTA is exceptionally important:  NOTE  Check out this article for examples

16.4.3 SMS best practice

Structuring an SMS involves considerably fewer considerations than writing an email. Keep
in mind:

· The core concern for SMS writing is that they are limited to 160 characters, which means
    the hardest part of writing one is finding a way to convey your core message with very
    limited space.

· Part of your SMS needs to be dedicated to offering an opt-out option so that users feel in
    control of the communications.

· Because the mobile phone is so personal, sending relevant, targeted SMS messages is
    imperative. Make sure that your mobile opt-in database is very carefully segmented; 200
    subscribers who actually want to hear from you are far more valuable than 2 000 who feel
    annoyed or harassed by your messages.

· Think about when you send your messages: are they being sent at a time that is relevant
    to your customer? If you are sending a sales promotion message, are you sending it at
    6 a.m. in the middle of the month or at 10 a.m. on a weekend after payday?

· Make sure that if your SMS includes a next step, such as clicking through to a website, the
    landing page is mobile-optimised.

SMS is often best used for customer relationship management, but you can also use it to send
promotions targeted to a time of day when your customers are likely to be out shopping or
aimed at specific demographics or geographic areas. Just remember, as with all direct marketing,
these messages need to be relevant and valuable to your customer.

                                                                                                                                    501

     16.4.4 Creating content

     Content that is relevant and valuable to readers is vital to ensuring the success of a direct
     marketing campaign. Valuable content is informative and should address the problems and
     needs of readers. It is important to realise that the reader determines the value of the content,
     not the publisher. Newsletters can offer:

     · Humour
     · Research
     · Information
     · Promotions
     · Exclusive content.

     SMS messages can offer:

     · Special offers and discounts                     NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 9:
     · Information                                            Content marketing strategy.
     · Time-dependent discounts
     · Celebrations
     · Contests
     · Trivia or voting
     · Reminders.

     Determining the content of your direct

     marketing messages is an important element

     of your overall brand content strategy.

     Any copy written for your brand should follow a
     predetermined brand voice guide. Consistency is important and will dictate how your customers
     trust and build a relationship with your brand.

     The principles of writing good online copy apply. You should start with the most important
     information first, and make sure that your language is scannable, meaning that it makes use
     of the appropriate formatting, such as bolding and bulleted lists.

     1. The first is in-message links. It's important

     to consider that any links you include in your email copy will lead readers away from your

     email. You'll want to keep these to a minimum, and include a link only when it is a call to

     action, a legal requirement, or a service feature. Links in SMS messages should be shortened

     with a URL shortener like Bitly and should lead to a mobile-optimised page.

2. The second element is, for email, the all-important subject line. Many users decide whether
    or not to open an email based on their first point of contact: the subject line.

For an email newsletter, it's useful to put together a recurring content structure. The example
shown here depicts a consistent content structure with repeating elements.

article displayed elsewhere, such as in your

company blog. Sending out too much long         NOTE  Note how the same elements recur for

However, if your newsletter consists of only one article, it may help to publish it in full.

Content in an SMS obviously needs to be more concise. You should get to the point as fast as
possible, which can mean including price points so that users know immediately if they are
interested. Remember to include an opt-out option.

16.4.5 Segmenting your database

The technology of direct marketing allows for mass customisation; it is one-to-one marketing
on a macro scale. Even simple personalisation can see improved results.

Customisation covers everything from using the recipient's name and sending the correct
email version to their device, to sophisticated measurement of a recipient's preferences and
tailoring content to suit them. This is even more important for SMS marketing, where content
that doesn't interest the reader can actively damage their relationship with your brand.

Segmenting a database can allow for customis-

ation across demographics or purchase history.    NOTE  Other options include segmenting
For example, you may choose to divide your              by location, user behaviour on site,
database according to gender or age. A political        or position in the sales funnel (e.g.,

different messages to different demographics.

A pet store may find it useful to segment their list according to the different kinds of pets their

customers own. In this way, it is possible to send messages that are slightly different and

tweaked to different target groups.

16.4.6 Deploying

By creating valuable content, establishing the correct frequency, and testing your messages
for display and deliverability, an email marketer should be able to ensure an excellent delivery
rate. Consistency in deploying newsletters also aids in fostering trust and fulfilling expectations.

When should you send emails? Common sense tells you not on Monday morning or Friday
afternoon, but this varies by audience. Testing will guide you. Generally speaking, the best days
of the week to send emails are between Tuesday and Thursday.

SMS messages need to be timed even better, given that they will be delivered immediately to
a device the consumer is carrying with them. Best times for delivery will vary depending on
type. According to SMSGlobal (2016):

· General marketing messages should be sent between 10:30-11:30 a.m or 2:30-3:30 p.m.
· Appointment reminders should be sent 24 hours and/or directly after the appointment is

    made.
· Weekend sales and special events reminders should be sent on Thursdays or on the

    morning of the event.

As always, of course, you need to test send times to check which works best for your customers.

Sender reputation

Email reputation is a score given to you depending on how well your emails are regarded by
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and your subscribers. If the sender's score falls within the

                                                                                                      505
     UNITING

     ISP's thresholds, a sender's messages will be delivered. If not, the sender's emails may arrive
     in the bulk or spam folder, be quarantined, or be bounced back to the sender.

     How it works: There are various authentication systems that can impact your reputation
     score. One of these is the Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain Name System
     (DNS). DKIM associates domain names with individual email addresses, ensuring that
     each organisation has to take responsibility for emails sent that are associated with their
     domain. Basically, DKIM signs out any outbound emails.

     The DKIM signature is added to the email header and includes an encrypted code. The
     receiving mail server will then take that DKIM signature and verify it with the DNS system
     to find the matching DKIM public key. Once it has this key, it can use it to unlock the
     encrypted code. If the code hasn't been changed, the email hasn't been tampered with,
     which means it can be authenticated and passed into the receiving mail server.

     Becoming an effective email marketer requires constant list cleansing and hygiene. In fact,
     most lists shrink by about 22% each year as a result of subscribers changing email addresses
     (HubSpot, n.d.). Build a preference centre and send out an email once a year asking subscribers
     to update their details. Make sure you are diligent about maintaining a current opt-in list to
     achieve maximum deliverability via reputation.

     Tips to help your reputation score:

     · ISPs offer various authentication standards, such as Sender ID, sender policy framework
         (SPF), and DomainKeys. We highly recommend the use of these standards.

     · Remember that a huge but inaccurate and outdated database is far less useful to an email
         marketer than a tightly maintained, smaller database. Strive to boost your database, but
         don't forget to clean as you go.

     · Ensure that email broadcast rates are not too high.
     · Respond to complaints and unsubscribe requests. If someone requests to be unsubscribed,

         do so. If you don't, there's a good chance you'll face stiff penalties.
     · Educate users about white lists.

Permission for any kind of direct marketing must be explicitly given to the company. Trying to
gain permission in a sneaky way is illegal and should never be done.

SMS credibility

Reputation via SMS is just as important; consumers are becoming increasingly suspicious of
marketing messages in general, so reputation is important to convince the customer even to
take your message seriously.

To make sure your SMS is credible, you'll need to pay attention to how it's written, the message
itself, the words you use, and so on. Time of delivery is also important, as is branding the
message so that your customer knows who it's from. Remember the key: send users only what
they want, when they want it, and you'll be trusted.

16.5 MEASURING SUCCESS

As with all things digital marketing, tracking, analysing, and optimising are key to growth and
success. Most direct messaging tracking systems produce statistics in a user-friendly manner.

Key measurables for understanding the performance of direct marketing campaigns include:

· Number of emails or SMSs delivered.
· Number of bounces: This should be separated into hard bounces and soft bounces.
· Number of unique opens: To explain this, consider this example: If one of your customers/

    recipients of your email opens the email ten times, it will count as ten overall opens but only
    one unique open. If two customers open it ten times each, it will count as twenty overall
    opens, but only two unique opens.
· Unsubscribes: Significant or consistent loss in subscribers is an indication that you are
    not meeting the needs of your subscribers.
· Pass-on rate: A high pass-on rate (forwards) indicates that your customers value the content
    enough to share it constantly with others. Adding a sign-up link to forwarded emails will
    organically grow the opt-in list.
· Clickthrough rates and conversion: These measure the effectiveness of a message via
    the links placed in the content. When a reader clicks through to a web page, these can be
    easily measured as a percentage against the number of delivered, opened, or sent emails.
    It reveals which content or promotion was the most enticing for the reader.

Some metrics are more useful than others. A good example of this is the open rate. Emails are
tracked using a tiny, transparent image that gets downloaded, but some email desktop clients
block the downloading of images. If the tracking image doesn't load, the email won't register
as opened. However, this can be factored in to some extent, and open rates give you an idea
of how well your subject lines resonate.

                                                                                                                                    507
            UNITING

       What you should be interested in is what activity takes place based on a message. This means
       you'll need to track leads or actions. You can do this through link tagging, meaning appending
       tracking parameters to a URL in your newsletter or SMS. These parameters are then identified by
       the Google Analytics of your website, registering that the user has come to the site through your
       email or SMS. Google Analytics will then take the information in the tag and store it in a cookie,
       from which it can track the user's interactions with the site after they arrived at the landing page.

       Here is a link to the Mobile Marketing Watch website as it may appear in a Mobile Marketing
       Watch email campaign:

       ?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+
       MobileMarketingWatch+%28Mobile+Marketing+Watch%29

       These can then be used to report on traffic from that message using Google Analytics.

       Generic direct messaging benchmarks can be used as a guide to see how well your campaigns
       are performing, but the best way to monitor performance is to benchmark your own campaign.

       Smaller lists tend to have a higher open rate, but this is probably because they're more
       targeted. The overall average email open rate is 27.4%, though this varies by industry, while the
       average clickthrough rate is 4.5%. Overall rates are quite low because far too many ignorant
       or lazy email marketers bring down the average. It's best to look at the average open rate for
       your industry, rather than the overall rates. You can do this by checking the Email Stat Centre
       website (EmailStatCenter, n.d.).

       The overall SMS open rate is harder to determine. Many reports put it at between 82% and
       98%, but this is difficult to ascertain. The average clickthrough rate varies by source but is
       generally far higher than email, at anywhere between 6% and 19% with overall response rates
       above 30% (Gilhooley, 2021).

       Once the reports have been generated, it is time to work out what the numbers are revealing,
       and use this information to improve the next message to be sent out.

       To make sure that your email marketing efforts are continually improving, it's important to
       test your campaigns. The most common form of direct marketing testing is to conduct an
       A/B split test. This is a test that involves sending one version of your newsletter or SMS to a
       specified percentage of your database, while sending a modified version to the remainder of
       your database. Some factors to test include:

       · Open and response rates across different subject lines, calls to action, and delivery times
       · Optimal number of links in an email for clickthrough rates and conversions
508
                                                                                       Direct marketing: Email and mobile

· Different copy styles and copy lengths
· The effect of video on delivery rates, open rates, and conversions for email and MMS
· Balance of text and image ratio.

By monitoring the results of each send, you can determine which version yields the desired
results. You can, for instance, test variations of your call to action to determine which is more
effective in persuading subscribers to click through.

Examples of what to test:

· Subject lines (for email)
· Send times
· Best day to send
· Layout
· Text vs. button links
· Database segmentation
· Call to action
· Copy differences (for SMS).

Testing and monitoring your send statistics go hand in hand. It's important to analyse your results
after sending to ensure you're implementing the most effective strategies for your database.

Useful KPIs include:

· Open rate
· Clickthrough rate
· Number of emails forwarded
· ROI
· Number of social shares
· Database growth
· Conversion rate (activity on your site generated by the email)
· Delivery or bounce rate.

16.6 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

    16.7 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

       Permission-based direct marketing can give the highest return on investment of any marketing
       activity. Technology allows mass customisation, allowing personalisation across a large list of
       subscribers. When used to foster relationships with a customer base, direct marketing can go
       a long way towards increasing the lifetime value of that customer.
       Direct marketing is highly measurable, and databases are able to be easily and thoroughly
       segmented. However, with the increasing numbers of companies and individuals using email
       and SMS marketing, many consumers are fatigued. It requires ingenuity, focus, and dedication
       to maintain a direct marketing database and consistently deliver useful quality messages that
       will be read.

          They worked with an ESP to make sure their emails were certified and created an entirely
          opt-in email list. Using tracking, they identified a handful of domains and sub-segments of
          donors that were reporting abnormally high spam rates, which they decided was due to
          regional differences - their campaigns worked well in the United States, but not in each of
          the 180 countries to which they were sending emails. For example, non-English-speaking
          countries reported higher spam rates. They suppressed these domains from their list and
          automatically unsubscribed anyone who reported an email as spam.

          habits. GlobalGiving used this information along with a matching offer and a time-bound
          appeal for users to donate by a certain deadline.

          They followed this with constant A/B split testing to ensure that their recommendation
          engine was working. They also tested subject lines, content, appeals, and more.

       The results

          The team saw a tenfold increase in engagement from email:

          · Their recommendation emails dramatically outperformed the emails that sent random
              projects to donors.

          · When factoring in the donor's giving history, using projects they had supported in the
              past, they saw a 20% boost in engagement as well.

          They also created a carefully set up email program focused on improving the brand's
          reputation in the long term.

    16.9 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. Which elements of GlobalGiving's email marketing constitute best practice?
       2. What role did the database play in this example? Why was it so important?
       3. Explain how personalisation played a role in the campaign.

    16.10 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       While direct marketing can operate as a stand-alone marketing campaign, integrating it
       with other channels, both online and offline, will serve to reinforce the brand's message and
       increase responses.

       There should never be a disparity between the content, tone, or design of an email or SMS
       when compared to the rest of a company's offerings. In-store promotions can be reinforced
       and promoted to a direct marketing database, or website information can be summarised for
       email or SMS.

Custom landing pages, if required, should be created for any promotions being communicated
by email. For the most part, marketing messages should aim to get the customer to the site;
landing pages are therefore essential. They need to be optimised to close the call to action.
The message gets the subscriber onto the page and the landing page gets them to sign up,
buy, or engage. The idea is to create a flow between the two that brings the `selling' process
full circle, whether it's actually buying something or just reading through the content to engage
them with the brand.

Direct marketing and social media work very well together for cross-channel promotion. Where
email and SMS can create a one-on-one feel between a brand and an individual, social media
can move that attention towards a sense of community and keep your consumer involved in
a dialogue.

16.11 SUMMARY

Direct marketing can deliver the best ROI of any digital marketing tactic. It is:

· Highly targeted and customisable
· Cost effective
· Easy to set up, test, and track.
Gaining explicit permission to send marketing messages to a person is an essential prerequi-
site for successful direct marketing. Once you have this permission, all messages sent by an
organisation and the individuals in that organisation can be seen as marketing opportunities.

Successful direct marketing requires careful planning and testing. HTML emails need to be
tested across a range of email clients and should be tested for a spam score before being
deployed. All messages sent to a list of subscribers need to provide an easy and accessible
unsubscribe option. Make sure you adhere to your local regulations for direct marketing.

16.12 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

1. What is meant by `mass customisation' and why is this so beneficial?
2. What are the key differences between direct marketing by email or SMS and direct marketing

    by post?
3. Why is it important for permission to be gained before marketing by email or mobile to a

    prospect?
4. Emails that are expected and recognised are more likely to be read. How can a marketer

    use this knowledge to increase the readership of emails?

    INTRODUCTION TO ADVERTISING

       Digital tools can be powerful for advertising. It is now time to put your knowledge to practice. In
       this part, Advertising, the focus is on social media advertising. You are now targeting specific
       customers; meaning that you are not flinging mud and hoping some of it will stick. Your money
       is going where it needs to in order to push content, drive traffic to your website, and increase
       reach and engagement.
       Chapter 17: Social media advertising focuses on how to use social media, the skills and
       knowledge you need to implement your strategy on various social media platforms. You will
       be introduced to the guidelines for proper effectiveness, available targeting options, and how
       to measure the effectiveness of your social media advertising.
       In Chapter 18: Search advertising you will put your SEO skills to work and learn how to put
       together a search ad, and how to bid on key phrases. You will see that it is not enough to just
       get clicks on an ad; you want your users to take an action once they get there.
       Digital advertising is all about increasing sales, improving brand awareness, and retaining
       customers. You know that images need to be compelling and fit the medium.
       In Chapter 19: Online and display advertising the focal point is on the various ad formats,
       pay models, and ad types. Digital advertising has become more important than ever with the
       quantum leap of digital adoption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though you have
       online marketing tactics, such as animations, games, video, and images at your disposal, be
       aware that consumers can suffer from advertising fatigue. Make sure your ads inform, persuade,
       and ultimately, convert users.

     ADVERTISING

     17.1 INTRODUCTION

     Social media first became a choice for marketers in 2005, when Facebook launched its first
     advertising option. The medium has advanced in giant strides since then, offering a reasonably
     low-cost ad option to marketers and reaching a wide audience as long as the ads are engaging
     enough.

     Social media ads can be recognised by labels such as `suggested post' or `promoted pin',
     depending on the platform. The ad formats available are continuously evolving, which means
     that marketers need to keep up with what's available to them; there are ever-increasing
     opportunities to reach their consumers on a platform and in a format that suits them.

17.3 UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING

Social media advertising should be considered as part of an overall social media effort. While
brands can start a Facebook page and share engaging posts, those posts would be seen
only by a fraction of the possible audience, even if they have already liked your page. It is
necessary to pay to promote your posts to ensure that you reach a much larger percentage
of your target audience.

Social media advertising is a form of online advertising that takes place on social media
networks. Many platforms offer extraordinarily detailed targeting options that match users
whom advertisers have identified as belonging to specific purchasing groups, making it a
great way to reach exactly the right group of users with your ads.

While more traditional forms of advertising are arguably somewhat inefficient, the targeting
offered by social media platforms make it stand out even from other forms of online advertising,
such as search or display ads. Social media platforms also tend to have higher clickthrough
and engagement rates at a lower cost (Hootsuite, 2015).

While it is possible to use social media advertising without considering any other aspect of
your digital marketing strategy, it should be considered holistically. Chapter 14: Social media
strategy discusses how social media in general can fit into other channels. Social media
advertising can be used to:

· Draw attention to products and drive sales
· Drive traffic to websites and other online properties
· Encourage foot traffic
· Encourage other activities offline.
Social media, used well, should be an essential part of any paid media campaign, when one
considers the targeting options and access to consumers it offers.

17.4 CORE PRINCIPLES

Social media consists of a vast number of different platforms, most of which have different rules
for what will and will not work well as an advertisement. There are, however, some general
principles that govern social media advertising as a whole.

17.4.1 General guidelines

First, remember that 85% of social media time takes place on mobile devices (Backlinko, 2021).
This means that any ad you create for social media is highly likely to be viewed on mobile, so
you need to make sure that it will display well on that device. Test your posts on mobile devices
before you pay to promote them. Consider:

· Images should be clear and convey meaning even when small
· Text should be brief enough to minimise the need for scrolling

                                                                                                                                    521
            ADVERTISING

       · The point of the ad should come across immediately with a clear CTA
       · Any links in the ad should lead to mobile-optimised landing pages.
       Second, most content on social media is user-generated, so if you're creating paid ads, you need
       to match the rules of the platform you're on and generate content that fits what users of that
       platform will expect. Make sure you understand the platform before you start advertising on it.

                             Figure 17.1 Netflix's Twitter account matches the tongue-in-
                                    cheek and playful tone preferred by Twitter users

                                                            Social media advertising

While promoted ads aren't the same thing as responding to customers, the same principle
applies: fit your tone and content to the platform. On Facebook a more neutral, but still
brand-relevant tone is best since their audience is broad and reading that audience
can be difficult. On other platforms, because you can see more about the users you are
speaking to, it can be easier to adapt your tone to them. Remember that your tone should
also be informed by your brand identity and overarching strategy.

Third, use your regular, unpaid posts to test out your paid ads. Make sure that you use effective
social media copy in every post. Keep your copy short and to the point, with a clear call to
action that tells the reader exactly what to do next, and give them a reason to click or carry out
the CTA. Then, track which posts are being liked, shared, or commented on - those should be
your first choice for paid promotion. The feedback you get on posts is often near-instantaneous,
which allows you to respond quickly to whichever posts are doing well and which are doing
badly. Facebook Ads Manager can help you do A/B testing by putting equal funds behind two
different posts. The one that gets a better initial response gets the rest of the funds.

Fourth, rotate ads often. Social media users expect fresh content; they should not be seeing the
same ad multiple times over multiple days, so rotate ads every three to five days (Hootsuite,
2016). The general rule is that a user should see an ad a maximum of four times.

17.4.2 Payment models                         NOTE  Read more about payment models at

The most likely payment models you will
encounter on social media include:

· CPC (cost per click, pay only when the ad is clicked on)

· CPE (cost per engagement, pay only for

demonstrated engagement with the ad)                You can learn more about Facebook's

adjusted based on the goals the advertiser

hopes to achieve).

Other payment models will be encountered on other platforms. For example, depending on
the goal of the ad campaign, Pinterest uses a CPM or optimised CPC payment model. A lot
of specialised paid media on Twitter is done via third parties like Ad Dynamo and can require
high budgets and one-off costs rather than being cost per view or engagement.

                                                                                                    525

17.4.3 Platforms

One of the core principles to keep in mind when choosing a social media platform on which
to advertise is that you need to go where your audience is. You will find different audiences
and communities on different platforms. Even if one person is on multiple social media platforms,
they perform vastly different activities on each of them. Be sure to choose a platform that fits
your needs as a business as well.

Let's take a look at a few of the most popular  NOTE  Learn more about popular platforms in

you might want to focus your attention on

them. As you read, keep in mind that for most

networks, the number of older users is increasing which can lead to changes in the behaviour

of younger users on the platform or even drive them off entirely.

Facebook

What they offer: Facebook offers a wide array of targeting options and the biggest social
media audience in the world, with roughly 2.89 billion users as of the second quarter of 2021
(Statista, 2021).

Ad formats are based on desired objectives, which we will discuss in the next section. Their
pricing can vary significantly based on a number of factors, but their ad platform is fairly intuitive,
and Facebook Analytics gives you a lot of information you can use to optimise ad performance.

You will have access to Facebook Ads Manager, which allows you to manage campaigns, ad
sets, and individual ads. This is also available as an app.

Who uses it: Worldwide, of the 2,98 billion Facebook users, 44% of female-identified and 56%
of male-identified users are active on Facebook. The demographics are skewed toward the
youth market, with 23% of active users aged 18 to 24 and 31% aged 25 to 34. 62% of users
have some form of higher education (Statista, 2021).
Best suited to: Hootsuite statistics indicate that two thirds of Facebook users visit the
Facebook page of a local business. Every business should have a Facebook page, as it is the
bare minimum of what users expect. Your business should be on Facebook even if it is just
listed with an address, website, and other basic details. Whether a business should use paid
advertising to promote posts depends on what it wants to achieve, but if you plan to use social
media advertising at all, you should consider starting on Facebook. To find out more about
Facebook marketing, visit the Hootsuite website: blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-marketing-tips.

Instagram

What they offer: Instagram offers photo, video, and carousel ads in a number of formats.
Instagram also offers an omnichannel, integrated shopping experience. The newest feature,
Instagram Shoppables, enables purchases to be made directly on the platform. Because it is
owned by Facebook, it has many of the same features, including analytics (through Facebook
Ads Manager), good targeting options, and various objectives to drive campaigns. Instagram
stories is also a powerful feature, which is mentioned in Chapter 13: Social media. Instagram
is potentially the best platform at the moment to work with influencers. It has a very tight
community culture with a focus on quality, unique content, and creativity.

                              Figure 17.8 Instagram user audience overview

United States. Closely following are users from Brazil and Indonesia, respectively. The important
thing to note for Instagram is age. As of July 2021, 62% of active Instagram users were between
18 and 34, compared to only 6% above 55 (Statista, 2021).

Best suited to: In theory, any business can use Instagram. The key attraction for Instagram

is visually attractive pictures and videos.

Twitter

What they offer: Twitter offers ad campaigns

based on objectives, much like Facebook and        NOTE  Read more about payment models,

on Twitter is a problem because the ads are

expensive, the targeting is not as good as Facebook's, and user growth has stalled. However,

pay-per-click (PPC) on Twitter can be cheaper than other options.

Followers earned from a Twitter campaign tend to be fairly qualified prospects. They will have
been chosen to see your tweets based on how well they fit your targeting profile, and they
then choose to follow you based on how well your tweet speaks to their needs.

Who uses it: Twitter's users are also skewed towards the youth market: 55% of adults aged
18 to 34, but only 17% of adults over 50, use this platform. At 68%, it also has a significantly
higher adoption rate from male-identified users. At 73%, the highest proportion of Twitter users
originate from the United States. 55% of Twitter users are from Japan, where Twitter ranks as
the top social media platform. Closely following are users from India, United Kingdom, and
Brazil respectively (Statista, 2021).
Best suited to: Twitter is suited to any business that wants to reach an audience like the one
described. Twitter audiences are used to instant gratification, Twitter feuds (check out the hashtag
#cuteanimaltweetoff for a good example of this), and snappy comebacks. Twitter is a highly
politicised space, so any slip-ups or faux pas on the part of your brand will be quickly picked up.

LinkedIn

What they offer: Most social media sites offer good targeting options, but in keeping with its
position as a social network for business professionals, LinkedIn's targeting options involve
someone's professional abilities. It also tends to convert well on gated content that requires
users to enter an email address or other information to download something.
Who uses it: Global user reports indicate that 57 % male-identified and 43% female-identified
LinkedIn users are active on the platform. The highest engagement from a user-group is those
aged 25 to 34. With those below and above this bracket having similar adoption rates, as
indicated in the breakdown below (Statista, 2021):
· 19.6% of adults 18-24
· 59.9% of adults 25-34
· 17.5% of adults 35-54
· 2.9% of adults over 55.

            ADVERTISING

       LinkedIn gained more users over the global Covid 19 pandemic. At the start of 2020, it had
       700 million users. In the first quarter of 2021, it increased to 722 million and it spread to over
       200 countries. LinkedIn reports indicate that of the 722 million, 690 million are professionals
       and 3 million are MBA degree holders. It also has a high proportion of decision makers, so it
       is a viable option for B2B marketing.
       On the LinkedIn press page, you can see a map of all their users (LinkedIn, 2021).

                                            Figure 17.11 LinkedIn's user locations
       Best suited to: B2B marketers who want to target business professionals, as well as companies
       that hire a lot of people, should start with LinkedIn.

      Pinterest

       What they offer: Pinterest doesn't offer as many targeting options as some other social media
       platforms, but it still has basic location, device, gender, and language targeting. Users often visit
       Pinterest specifically to gather information about and plan potential purchases, and those who
       view ads on Pinterest tend to have greater awareness and purchase intent than those who don't.
       Who uses it: Pinterest is a great platform for targeting women. Of users on Pinterest, 71%
       identify as women and 15% identify as men, with the remainder unspecified. At 89.9 million
       users, the United States has a significantly high adoption rate. Brazil has 27.5 million users,
       followed by Mexico (14.5 million), and Germany (14.1 million). It is again skewed toward the
       younger market, with 57% of adults between 18-34 using it, dropping steadily as age increases.
       Only 4% of adults aged 65+ use the platform (Statista, 2021).

   Figure 17.12 Pinterest user demographics demonstrating the skew towards young users

Best suited to: Retailers tend to make the most use of this platform, though other businesses
can create successful accounts as well. The key is to create beautiful, useful boards that people
want to look at, and to use advertising to capitalise on that.

Snapchat

What they offer: Snapchat has come a long way since its origin as a niche platform mostly

used by teenagers. It still has a lot of pull with young demographics, and it encourages real-time

content creation and consumption, with users paying more attention to content. Facebook,

Instagram, and WhatsApp have been fairly

blatant about stealing Snapchat's features,    NOTE  To find out more about VR try-ons,

Who uses it: As of July 2021, Snapchat has 293 million active daily users and up to 513.9
active monthly users. Globally, 56% of its users identify as female and 43% as male. It has the
highest adoption rate in the United States (105.3 million) and India (99.8 million). France (23.3
million) and the United Kingdom (19.8) follow respectively. When looking at the age of users,
the numbers are closely spread. At 22%, the highest active use is from those aged 25 to 34.
Closely following this are users aged 13 to 17, who account for 21%, and users aged 18 to 20,
who account for 20% of the user profile (Statista, 2021).

                                                                                                    531

                                        Figure 17.13 Some Snapchat user statistics
       Best suited to: Snapchat has fewer options for small businesses than most other social media
       platforms simply because their options are expensive. Prices have come down, however, with
       cheapest option, the Sponsored Local Geofilters ad, coming in at as little as US $5. This means
       that, while the bigger options are still only available to large businesses, other options are
       available to almost anyone. This means that Snapchat is suited to any business that wants to
       find a particularly young audience.

      YELP

       What they offer: Yelp is a review site that helps users select a business that suits their needs.
       There are many sites similar to Yelp, so keep in mind that you may want to choose a different
       option that is more active in your area. Tracking leads generated by Yelp can be difficult, but it
       does provide some metrics, like page views and ad clicks. With users relying more and more
       on reviews and review sites when choosing where to buy, platforms like Yelp are increasingly
       attractive.
       Who uses it: Yelp's demographic profile shows that it has an even spread from male and
       female users. 53% of Yelpers are women, showing only a slight preference of over men (47%).
       Yelp has an equal adoption rate in rural and urban areas, and its most popular users are aged
       25 to 34. Most remarkably, 43% of the demographic come from high-income households. In
       general, a Yelp user is more likely to try an innovative product and, whilst 54% are more open
       to direct advertising in exchange for free content, 46% of Yelpers expressed annoyance from
       receiving direct ads (Statista, 2021).

Best suited to: Yelp works best for location-based businesses. That said, many advertisers
argue that advertising on Yelp may not be worth the money compared to a free profile, so
weigh your options carefully.

     ADVERTISING

     17.5.1 Facebook

     We have already looked at what kind of audience can be found on Facebook and the broad
     strokes of what they offer.

     Objectives

     Facebook offers several paid-for advertising solutions based on the action the advertiser
     wants the audience to take and the purpose of the ads. The core objectives are awareness,
     consideration, or conversions, which Facebook has broken down further into more specific
     objectives on which you can base your ad creation:

     · Awareness: The awareness objective is used when you want to show your ad to the largest
         number of people who are most likely to remember and resonate with your ad. This objective
         is normally used if your business or brand is new.

     · Traffic: The traffic objective is used when you want your audience to visit a specific desti-
         nation. The destination is usually your website, but it could also be your Facebook profile.
         This objective is often used for special offers or sales promotions, for example.

     · Engagement: The engagement objective is designed to get people to interact with your
         content, such as liking, commenting, sharing your posts, or watching your videos.

     · Leads: These objectives are designed to collect leads for your business through, for example,
         messaging, phone calls or signups to monthly newsletters.

     · App promotion: App promotion is designed to promote your app to people who are likely
         to be interested in it. It is measured by the number of app installs.

     · Sales: The sales objective is designed to drive sales of your products or services. It helps
         you to reach the people most likely to make a purchase from your website.

     Ad types

     Once you have chosen an objective, Facebook offers a set number of ad formats to choose
     from that will help you meet that objective. Those formats are:

     · Photo                                          NOTE  To explore Facebook formats further,

                 Figure 17.15 Facebook ad examples for mobile and desktop feeds
These ads have several options for placement in your users' feed. They can appear RHS (right
hand side) desktop, in the news feed on desktop, or in the news feed on mobile. Because
Facebook owns Instagram, you also have the option of showing certain ad types there. The
vast majority of Facebook's revenue comes from mobile, so they are very focused on a good
mobile experience for their users. Find out more about their ads here: facebook.com/business/

type, you will need to look at Facebook's
targeting options, which gather user data from
Instagram and WhatsApp as well. They offer
three audience options to choose from:

1. Core audiences: You select your audience manually based on demographics like age and
    location.

2. Custom audiences: You upload a contact list to connect with customers on Facebook.
3. Lookalike audiences: You use customer information to find people similar to them on

    Facebook.

Core audiences
This is a manual selection which allows many detailed targeting options:
· Location: Where the users are located, city, region, etc. Allows exclusion of locations.
· Demographics: Age, gender, languages, relationship status, type of work, education, and

    more.
· Interests: Interests, hobbies, and Pages they like on Facebook.
· Behaviours: Activities users do on or off Facebook that give information on which device

    they use, their purchase behaviours or intent, and travel preferences.
· Connections: Offers the option to include or exclude users who meet at least one parameter

    (not all of them). This can include whether people have a connection to you on Facebook
    (or have friends who do).
For a full list of Facebook targeting options, look at this infographic: i.marketingprofs.com/
assets/images/daily-chirp/170213-infographic-complete-guide-to-facebook-ad-targeting-full.jpg.

                               Figure 17.18 A defined audience on Facebook
If you select multiple options from within an ad targeting category, you'll reach users who
meet any of the options you've selected. For example, if you choose multiple Locations like
the United States and Canada, you'll target anyone who lives in either the United States OR
Canada, not both.
Another example might be choosing multiple options from the Interests targeting category. If
you choose interests like Golf and Tennis, you'll target anyone who likes golf OR tennis, not
just users who like both golf and tennis.

                                                                                                                                    537
            ADVERTISING

       Keep in mind that it's not possible to target ad sets only to the users who fall into all of the
       selected categories.

                                       Figure 17.19 Interests targeting on Facebook
       Custom audiences
       This kind of selection has several benefits, including:
       · Powerful exact targeting
       · No wastage
       · Cap bidding and frequency
       · Encrypted and secure data.
       Using these selectors, you can create a list of who you want to reach using their email addresses.
       Facebook matches the email addresses and allows exact targeting of those users through their
       ads. Custom audiences are extremely powerful; if you have users' email addresses, you can
       target individuals. This is useful for any brand that make use of newsletters or gathers email
       addresses elsewhere.
       Lookalike audiences
       Lookalike audiences is useful because it helps you find a similar audience to your existing fans
       and gives more accurate targeting. This makes it easy to find more users on Facebook who
       are like the people you know. You can build a lookalike audience based on:
       · People who like your Page
       · Custom audiences that you've created with emails, phone numbers, or website or app data.
       It's an effective way to reach even more potential customers, because you can target your
       lookalike audience with the adverts you create. Think of Facebook as a `sophisticated audience
       matchmaker. You tell Facebook what you like in a customer, and Facebook delivers a new
       audience segment filled with prospects that meet your criteria' (Sehl, 2019).

The Facebook Pixel

The Pixel is a piece of code you can build into your website to help you track user actions
and remarket to them on Facebook. Your conversions can be tracked across mobile phones,
tablets, and desktops. Additionally you can optimise your bids for website conversions and
ensure that your ads will be shown only to the users most likely to convert. Furthermore you
can remarket to or reach users on Facebook who have visited your website. You can learn more

17.5.2 Instagram

Instagram is a very large mobile platform with an engaged mobile audience, making it a good
option for some businesses.

Objectives

The ad objectives that Instagram offers are the same as Facebook (as both of these platforms
are connected under their parent company, Meta). As a reminder, these objectives are:

· Awareness: You want to show your ad to the largest number of people who are most likely
    to remember and resonate with your ad.

· Traffic: You want your audience to visit a specific destination, such as your website or
    Instagram shop.

· Engagement: You want to get people to interact with your content, such as liking,
    commenting, sharing your posts, or watching your videos.

· Leads: You want to collect leads for your business.
· App Promotion: You want to promote your app to people who are likely to be interested in it.
· Sales: You want to drive sales of your products or services by reaching the people most

    likely to make a purchase from your website.

                                                                                                  539
            ADVERTISING

      Ad types

       Not every ad type is available for every objective. Once you choose an objective, you will be
       shown the ad types you can use. The ad types offered by Instagram are:
       · Image ads: A high-quality, single image ad.
       · Stories ad: A video or full-screen ad that is displayed in the user's feed. This ad type comes

            with additional features like filters, polls, text, GIFs, and interactive stickers.
       · Video ads: These can be short videos of up to 120 seconds.
       · Carousel ads: Brands can use up to 10 images or videos to display a product line or develop

            their brand story. Users swipe horizontally to explore the next image or video.
       · Collection ads: Is a blend of the features of a shopping ad with the display functionality

            of a carousel ad. Much like a product catalogue, brands can display the product line (in
            carousel format) and users can make purchases directly from the catalogue.
       · Explore ads: This option is for better ad placement. Brands can select a text or video ad
            that is then placed under the `Explore' tab on Instagram - where users search for content
            based on interest, curiosity, and preference.
       · Instagram shop: These ads, often affectionately referred to as shoppables, enable a user
            to make an in-app purchase of the product on Instagram. The Instagram ad displays the
            product tag. For businesses in the United States, ads have product tags and a checkout
            feature.
       · Reels ads: As of June 2021, Instagram launched Reels ads. Much like Instagram Stories,
            these short-form videos feature in between Reels. These ads will display vertically in the
            users feed, unlike most of traditional formats that display horizontally.

           Did you know that 40% of users consume social media with the sound off? It is important
           to design your ads for sound-off consumption, and to use sound to delight users who do
           have the sound on. Use visual elements to tell your story, add captions for any voiceover
           or scripted audio, and use text overlay to deliver you key message without sound.

Targeting options

Instagram has many of the same targeting options as Facebook. They include:
· Custom audiences (target audiences of users you already know, which include lookalike

    audiences)
· Location, age, gender, language targeting
· Detailed targeting (include or exclude users based on demographics, interests, and/or

    behaviours)
· Connections (include or exclude users based on connections to your page, apps, or events).
You can also save an audience to use it for future ad sets.

Advertising tips

· Remember, Instagram shares targeting options with Facebook so make use of them, but
    don't go too granular.
                                                                                                                                    541
     ADVERTISING

     · Don't make your post look like an ad. It should be visually arresting and enjoyable first,
         advertising second. It should blend in with organic content rather than stand out as an ad.

     · Include a hashtag so that users can find        NOTE  You can find out more about advertising

     17.5.3 Twitter

     Twitter offers a self-service ad platform with several options and allows a degree of specific
     targeting. The service does still tend to change frequently, and not all options may be available
     to all regions or user accounts.

     Objectives

     Like Facebook, this is mobile first and the ad formats match the actions you want users to
     take. The basic objectives are:

     · Awareness: This objective is designed to help you get your ad seen by as many people as
         possible, i.e. maximise its Reach. You can choose to reach a specific audience or a broad
         audience.

     · Consideration: The consideration objective in Twitter consists of several sub-goals, which
         are the following:
         · Website traffic: Helps to drive traffic to your website (you can choose to track clicks
              on your website link or conversions on your website).
         · Video views: Designed to get your audience to watch your videos.
         · Pre-roll views: Facilitates pre-roll views of your videos. A pre-roll view in Twitter is a
              video ad that is played before a user watches a video; it is counted when a user watches
              the ad for at least two seconds, or when they click to expand or unmute the ad.
         · App installs: Gets people to install your app (you can choose to track installs or
              sessions in your app).
         · Engagements: Encourages people to interact with your content, such as liking,
              commenting, or sharing your tweets.
         · Followers: Helps you grow your Twitter following (you can choose to track new followers
              or engagement from your followers).

     · Conversions: This objective is designed to drive conversions on your website or in your
         app. There are two sub-objectives under conversions:
         · App re-engagements: Encourages your audience to take a conversion action on your app.
         · Website conversions: Helps to generate conversions on your website, such as
              purchases, sign-ups, or leads.

Ad types

Promoted ads are a collection of the more traditional ad types, such as:
· Text ads: Tweets that are native ads that appear at the very top of a user's timeline or in

    Twitter mobile apps. There is no minimum spend, and advertisers pay when users retweet,
    @reply to, favourite, or click on a promoted tweet.
· Video: A tweet that includes a single video. Additional features include: standalone video,
    video ad with website buttons, video ads with app buttons, video with polls, and lastly
    video with conversation buttons.
· Carousel ad: Brands that have a story to tell can use carousel ads. There is an option of
    six images or videos, and no less than two. Much like the other platforms with this feature,
    users swipe right to progress with the story. Additional features include the website and
    app carousels.
· Moment ad: Brands with a story to tell can also use the moment ad. It offers robust
    storytelling capabilities that can be used to present a collection of stories or moments. It
    is an appealing option for both advertisers and publishers.
· Image ad: This is a single photo ad with the same additional features as video ads. When
    they appear in the users feed, they are clearly labelled as an ad with the word `promoted.'
· Follower ad: To gain more followers and increase awareness, these ads are promoted to
    attract the attention of their desired target audience.

            ADVERTISING

       Additional formats with specialised placements are:

       · Twitter Amplify: Offers two formats, which are pre-roll and sponsorships. Brands can
            amplify their message by featuring their ad in conjunction with video content from publishers.

       · Twitter Takeover: A feature for trends and timelines with different placement options.
       · Twitter Live: Brands can broadcast live content and participants can join or interact with

            the live feed in real-time.
       · Twitter ad features: Features that can be applied to all five formats. These include polls,

            conversation buttons, website buttons, app buttons, branded notifications and branded
            hashtags.

       These are the most popular options available, but there are others. You can find a full list of
       Twitter cards here; they change fairly frequently, so make sure to check in often: business.

      Targeting options

       Twitter targeting options are nearly as detailed as Facebook. You can choose an audience
       based on:

       · Location (country, state, region, metro area, or postal codes)
       · Gender
       · Language
       · Device, platform, and carrier
       · Keywords
       · Followers
       · Interests
       · Tailored audiences (upload a list of emails or Twitter IDs or put a code snipped on your

            website, to collect visitors, purchasers, or downloaders, and then target them)
       · TV targeting (to target users who engage with television programs in a specific market,

            or by show)
       · Behaviours
       · Events (users interested in global or regional events).

       Advertising tips
       · Use your own campaign-specific hashtags rather than generic ones
       · Utilise multiple tweets per campaign, and test your options
       · Include a deadline
       · Monitor influencers
       · Make sure your ads contain content worth sharing.

17.5.4 LinkedIn

LinkedIn ads allow you to create and place adverts on prominent pages on the LinkedIn
website, including a user's homepage, search results pages, groups, and more. It has both
self-service and premium options, and offers `sponsored updates' as a self-service option.
There is a minimum budget requirement of US $10 a day, though no minimum spend; that is,
you have to budget at least US $10 a day, but you don't actually have to spend any of it. Ads
can be served on a CPM or CPC basis.

Objectives

When you sign into your Campaign Manager, LinkedIn provides you with a search filter for
your brand goals (LinkedIn, 2021).

The three objective filters are to increase:

1. Awareness: Brand awareness
2. Consideration: Engagement, video views, and website visits
3. Conversion: Lead generation, website conversion, and job applicants

Ad placements and types

LinkedIn offers 10 ad types, namely:

· Text ads (for desktop only)
· Video ads, which can also be placed as sponsored content
· Message ads, which can be placed as sponsored messaging
· Dynamic Ads (offered as follower ads, Spotlight ads, and Job ads)
· Single image ads
· Single job ads, which can also be placed as sponsored content
· Carousel, which can also be placed as sponsored content

Advertising tips

· Test variations of your ads to see which is the most successful.
· When creating a single image ad, keep your introductory text under 150 words to avoid

    truncation and unnecessary ad spend.

· Consider your budget carefully. Sponsored InMail ensures you'll be seen by your target, and
    display ads are a good way to stay top of mind, but both can be quite expensive.

· Make sure you use all the allotted characters  NOTE  You can find more information about

    they look good, both on desktop and mobile.

17.5.5 Pinterest

Although Pinterest is a social media platform, a typical user places higher value on the Pins
and their Pin board. It is more a place for discovery than for social interaction. To target this
audience, a business account is necessary to advertise on the platform.

Objectives

When creating a Pinterest Promoted Pin, you will be asked to choose a goal for your campaign.
These goals are broadly aligned with the other social media platforms, which are:

· Brand awareness: This objective helps you build brand awareness and reach a large audience.
· Video views: The video views objective helps get your videos seen by as many people

    as possible. It optimises the quality of views, average playtimes, and completion rates for
    your target audience.
· Consideration: This objective is designed to help you increase the number of people who
    click on your promoted pins (taking them to your website).

                                                                                                   547
     ADVERTISING

     · Conversions: This objective drives conversions on your website or app, such as making
         a purchase, signing up for your email list, or downloading your app.

     · Catalog sales: This objective drives sales of your products or services on Pinterest. When
         people click on your promoted pins, they will be able to see your products or services on

         Pinterest and purchase them directly from your website.

     Ad types offered

     Pinterest offers a number of different ad formats. Choosing which type of Pinterest ad to use
     will depend on the type of campaign you want to run. The five ad types on Pinterest are:

     1. Standard
     2. Video
     3. Shopping
     4. Carousel
     5. Collections.

     Targeting options

     Targeting options for Pinterest are:

     · Demographics: This will include information such as gender, age, location, and languages.

     · Automated targeting: Pinterest will align    NOTE  To find out more about targeting your
         your Pin with user's interests and search        ads on Pinterest, visit their website here:

     · Actalike audiences: Pinterest will combine

     what you already know about your

     customers with behavioural insights from Pinterest to target new user groups with similar

     characteristics.

     · Keywords: Pinterest will show ads to people searching for specific topics, such as `decorative
         rugs.'

     · Interests: Pinterest will reach people based on the types of pins and boards they like or
         create.

     · Customer lists: Pinterest will use your customer list to contact people who are already in
         your buying-cycle or have already engaged with our website or made an in-store purchase.

     Advertising tips

     · Make sure that the ads you select reflect your brand promise. Misleading or exaggerated
         claims are more than a bad idea - Pinterest prohibits them.

     · Use vertical images. This isn't required, but users prefer it.

     · Optimise your pins for mobile viewing.       NOTE  Read more about advertising with

17.5.6 Snapchat

Snapchat's paid advertising options are relatively young, but they have grown almost as rapidly
as the app itself. There are a variety of ways that brands can advertise on Snapchat, such as:

· Lenses and geo-filters (including AR Lens Experiences)
· Discover channels
· Live channels
· Influencers
· Takeover
· Promotion
· Unboxing
· Product placements.

Objectives

Snapchat objectives mirror those of the other social media platforms we have looked at so
far. Briefly they are:

· Awareness: The brand awareness objective has three sub-objectives you can choose from:
    · Awareness: Increase awareness of your brand or product.
    · Snap Promote: Promote your story to get more subscribers.
    · Promote Places: Promote your places to Snapchatters.

· Consideration: This objective is designed to help generate engagement, leads, or traffic.
    Its sub-objectives are:
    · App Installs: Helps get people to install your app.
    · Website traffic: Designed to drive traffic to your website.
    · App traffic: Designed to drive traffic to your app.
    · Engagement: Encourages people to interact with your ad in some way, such as swiping
         up, or sharing the Snap with a friend.
    · Video views: Promotes your brand or product through video.
    · Lead Gen: Generate leads for your business.

· Conversions: This objective is designed to drive conversions on your website or app. The
    conversions objective is subdivided into:
    · Website conversions: Helps increase conversions of your brand or product on your website.
    · App conversions: Drives conversions of your brand or product on your app.
    · Catalog sales: Drives sales of your products or services on Snapchat.

Ad types

Snapchat offers a few ways to reach your audience:

· Snap single image or video ad
· Filters

Targeting options

Snapchat includes a variety of targeting options:

· Interests and behaviours
· Location
· Demographics
· Pixel custom audiences: An advanced retargeting feature that affords engagement with

    Snapchatters who have engaged with your website

· Snapchat Custom Audience Match: Brands can anonymously match data from an existing
    list of email addresses and mobile device IDs to Snapchat's consumer data. Users can opt

    out of being included.

· Lookalike: Offered as an advanced feature, much like Facebook, brands can target users
    with characteristics similar to their existing customers.

      Advertising tips

       · As always, make sure your content fits the platform: Snapchat is informal and natural, using
            fun filters and add-ons, rather than the more posed images you might see on Instagram.

       · Tell a story. Test your content to see what works best.
       · Use influencers. This is a great way to reach even more users.

     17.5.7 Other platforms

       The above is by no means an exhaustive examination of available platforms for social media
       advertising. For example, some marketers still like Google+, and YouTube is a huge platform
       for marketers.
550
                                                     Social media advertising

Different countries have different preferred platforms. For instance, Weibo and WeChat are
dominant in China, and Vkontakte is popular in Russia.

Make sure you do your research so that you know which platforms your audience is active on
and where you might want to advertise. Reddit, for example, (reddit.com) along with similar
content curation platforms, is great for sharing good content, but the community is very
advertising-savvy and does not welcome overt ads that do not provide value to the user.

Tik Tok (tiktok.com), ranking at 7th for global platform use with 1 billion users and 63% of them
under the age of 29, is also one to watch, particularly for influencers and micro-influencers
(Dataportal, 2021).

You may also want to keep an eye on

up-and-coming platforms, such as Twitch        NOTE  Read more about strategies for creating

apps like Clubhouse ( joinclubhouse.com),

which offers corporates and brands strategic opportunities for sponsorship and branding for

rooms or events.

17.6 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

Some of the difficulties of advertising on social media are the same as the difficulties of being
on social media in general. They include:

· Promoted posts all need to work hard to make an authentic connection with the audience.
· You need to consistently promote good content.
· There is always the chance that your audience will respond negatively to a post, which

    can escalate quickly.
· Choosing the right platform to advertise on can be a challenge.
· Tying ad spend on social media to revenue increases can be difficult, since the benefits of

    advertising on these platforms are often indirect. Take a look at Sprout Social's `How to define
    an actionable social media ROI for your business' for some tips: sproutsocial.com/insights/
    social-media-roi-guide. It is important to clarify with whomever you are reporting to that ROI
    on social media is not an exact science. Far more data is available than on traditional media,
    but it has its limits. So rather than drawing a clear line from social media advertising to sales,
    look at encouraging behaviours that lead to sales, such as convincing users to sign up for a test
    drive rather than attempting to sell a car. You can easily calculate your ROI if you know how
    many signups for test drives you get from Facebook, and how many test drives result in sales.

Despite its challenges, advertising on social media cannot be avoided. If you want to reach
the maximum possible number of users with granular targeting that ensures you're reaching
exactly the right users at the right time, social media advertising is the way to go. It is also the
only way to ensure that a significant portion of your audience per platform will see your posts.

                                                                                                                                    551

     17.7 MEASURING SUCCESS

     Measuring the success of your social media advertising activities can be tricky. As mentioned,
     ROI can be difficult to establish, but it can be done!

     Start by identifying your KPIs. Note the       NOTE  Not only is `number of followers' a vanity
     difference between vanity metrics and those          metric, too many followers who are not
     metrics that will actually be useful. The            quality followers can actually harm your
     number of fans on Facebook, for example, is          brand. Remember, only a tiny percentage
     a vanity metric. It doesn't mean much on its         of your total audience will see your
     own. Instead, you would want to look at the          content organically, so you want them to
     percentage increase in number of fans or the         be engaged.
     engagement rate of the fans that you have, to
     see whether you are doing well.

     The KPIs you identify as important will depend on the goals of any campaign you run. For
     example:

     · If you want to drive revenue, your important KPIs will be sales related, such as product
         purchases, signups for trials, or traffic to your website (which could then turn into a

         conversion).

     · If your goal is awareness, your most important KPI might be reach.
     · If your goal is building customer relationships, you would want to look at engagement

         numbers and sentiment.

     If you want to attach actual monetary value to your KPIs, you need to decide what method
     you want to use. Do you want to look at average sales, the lifetime value of a customer, or how
     much similar reach would cost you if you used different methods of advertising?

     To measure your KPIs, you'll need to use the analytics tool of the platform you're advertising on
     (see below). You can use Google Analytics to see whether social drives traffic to your website,
     to attribute revenue to specific posts, to find out how visitors from social consume your content,

 17.9 CASE STUDY: SHEIN

   Shein is an online fast fashion retailer, founded in 2008 in China.

  One-line summary

   To reach a differentiated market, global fashion outlet, SHEIN, used a comprehensive
   eMarketing strategy to create an immersive, full-screen experience directed to Snapchat's
   GenZ and Millennial users.

                                                                                                                                    553
     ADVERTISING

     The problem

     SHEIN wanted to target a new market and expand its reach with a young demographic.
     They created an immersive shopping experience to increase brand awareness with Millenial
     and GenZ users. They used a strategic mix of App Installs, Snap Lifestyle Categories,
     and Snap Stories to create a full-screen experience for the user. They paired this with the
     Discover feed and an optimised analytics strategy on Snapchat.

     The solution

     Through a powerful mix of short video
     formats, attention grabbing headlines
     and stories, they were able to attract the
     attention and curiosity of this young user
     base. The strategic mix of advertising and
     marketing techniques enabled them to
     increase ROI by 20%. They used the Snap
     Lifestyle Categories to tap into a market
     of users with an interest in fashion. They
     targeted users who were already in the
     funnel and most likely to convert, driving
     their CPP down by 50% (compared to per-
     formance on other platforms). As a result
     of their strategic planning, they executed
     a comprehensive plan that leveraged the
     full capabilities and affordances of the
     Snapchat platform, which ultimately led to
     better results than they set out to achieve.

     The results

     The brand saw very favourable results from
     this campaign:

     · They performed better than their            Figure 17.24 Shein fashion products
         outlined investment goal and achieved           on the SnapChat platform

         20% ROI.

     · They successfully targeted and increased brand awareness to a new user demographic.
     · Due to Snapchat's wide user base, SHEIN was able to increase exposure and influence

         globally.

     · They decreased ad spend with 50% lower Cost Per Purchase (CPP).
     · When compared to installation on other channels, Snapchat resulted in lower installation

         costs, as much 20% less per app install.

17.10 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

1. Why do you think Snapchat was the right platform for SHEIN'S campaign?
2. What do you think was so appealing about the immersive experience?
3. What could other brands learn from this campaign about advertising on Snapchat?

17.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

Social media advertising ties in with any number of other marketing channels. You can use it
to push content marketing to an audience that will appreciate it and encourage shares and
earned media coverage, to drive traffic to your website, to push offline campaigns and encourage
chatter about them. Any marketing campaign should keep social media advertising in mind
as a potential way to increase reach and engagement.
The incredible targeting opportunities offered by social media advertising allow content to
reach exactly the right audience at the right time to encourage interaction or conversions, and
paid promotion is the best way to boost the reach of any post.

17.12 SUMMARY

Social media advertising is an effective channel for reaching as many of your users as possible
on the platforms on which they are active. Certain guidelines apply to all social media adver-
tisements, such as ensuring that ads will look good and function well on mobile, but others
are platform-specific.
Each platform offers its own unique advertisements, targeting options, and analytics capabilities.
Which platform you use should be informed not by where you wish to be active, but by where
your audience already is.
In this chapter, we covered some of the most popular advertising platforms, but others do exist
and should be considered depending on audience, location, and capabilities.

17.13 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

1. What should be the primary consideration when choosing a platform on which to advertise?
2. What are the most exciting targeting capabilities offered by social media advertising?
3. What sets social media advertising apart from other forms of online advertising?

     Search advertising on search engines is based on keywords. This means that it is triggered
     by the search term that a user enters into a search engine. Advertisers target the keywords
     for which they want their site to appear. Since the potential customer is already expressing
     intent, as per the buying cycle, it allows the advertiser to target their offering directly to the
     potential customer.

     18.3 DEFINING SEARCH ADVERTISING

     As discussed, search advertising involves placing online advertisements on search engine
     results pages to connect your product with consumers who are likely to be in the buying phase
     of the customer lifecycle.

     Search engines display results to search queries based on proprietary algorithms. Each major
     search engine uses its own formula to determine what results to display for any term. The vast
     majority of searchers don't click through to the second page of results (less than 6% of people
     do), which means they are likely to find what they're looking for on the first page (Shelton,
     2021). With search engines getting so much traffic, and delivering great value, they need to
     find a way of generating revenue.

     With so many search engines out there, which platform should you choose?

     There are some small differences from platform to platform in terms of editorial policy, and each
     system has a different user interface. With over 90% of users choosing Google as their search
     engine, Google Ads is the best known and is considered the industry standard. It allows users
     to transact in the currency of their choice, is tied to a comprehensive analytics tool, and offers
     training programmes and certifications. Also, Google Ads currently has the best contextual
     and geographical targeting worldwide (Google Support, 2021).

     18.3.1 Structuring your search advertising campaign

     When you start running search advertising, you shouldn't just create a whole stream of ads;
     you need to have a plan.

     Your Ads account is your home for all the

     ads you are currently running, and it should   NOTE  Many search advertisers create ad

     campaigns, according to your strategy and the

     ads you are running. Within each campaign, you should have ad groups; these are sets of ads

     that have a common characteristic or focus. For example, if you are selling books online, you

     may have ad groups focused on a specific genre, author, event and special offer, as well as

     some ad groups around general themes, such as promoting local stores or making online sales.

of Responsive Ads.

Responsive search ads follow this structure:

· Headlines: Up to 15 headlines of 25 characters each
· Display URL: 2 path fields (up to 15 characters each) on the display URL (optional)
· Descriptions: Up to 4 description lines (90 characters each).

     18.4.1 Responsive Text Ads

     As the name suggests, through the use of Machine Learning, a Google ad adapts and responds
     to the user's search query and to the interface of the user's device so that the right message is
     displayed in the best way. A carefully and skilfully planned responsive ad can improve search
     relevance by showing the best combination to the user and, when aligned to clear goals, it
     can improve targeting measures.

     With far more headings, features, and algorithms at play, it is important to plan your ads carefully.
     Consider the variants of the potential combinations and their sequencing. Each ad asset should
     make sense on its own and in combination with the other pieces. Important information, such
     as your CTA (call to action), must feature in headline 1, headline 2, or description1. Headline3
     and description 2 are optional so they won't necessarily be displayed.

     For greater ad performance, ads recommends creating at least five headlines of varying lengths
     and using all four descriptions. Whilst pins can be added to control what users see and will
     notify users of important information, it is advisable to use pins sparingly and strategically.

     When designing an ad, there are strict editorial

     policies and guidelines that advertisers need     NOTE  To find out more about responsive
     to adhere to. Some of these are as follows:             ads, watch this video from the Google
     ads or extension that do not use commonly               Support team:

     used correctly or for its intended purpose,

     gimmicky or non-standard words and phrases, and entering a phone number in ad text. If an

     advertiser fails to follow the rules, Google will not publish the ad. This is to ensure that Google

     can maintain its professional integrity and standards. As with all of their products, these

     policies are subject to updates. Find out more about the policies here: support.google.com/

Many advertisers test offers in the ad copy, such as a discount or a limited time voucher. Product

     While long-tail phrases are generally cheaper and lead to a higher rate of conversions, you

     will need to use a much larger number of them to make up for the lower traffic volume that

     they generate.

     Also consider that search engine users may be at various stages of the buying cycle, and it
     could be worthwhile to craft a long-tail keyword strategy, targeting those who are at the end
     of the buying cycle and know specifically what they are looking for.

     For example, if you sell cameras, targeting the term `camera' may not bring in much targeted
     traffic (since users searching for `camera' may be looking for information, pictures, price

also called a vanity URL.

The display URL must be the same domain as the destination URL, and Google pulls this out
automatically. Google will show only one ad per domain.

it improves the ad's Quality Score. The aim

should be to send users to a web page that is

as relevant to their search, and the PPC ad, as possible. This is known as deep linking.

Landing pages

Search advertising is not just about creating ads and bidding for keywords. The process
continues once a user has clicked on your ad. The page that the user reaches by clicking
on an ad is called a landing page and is either an existing page on your website, or a new,
custom-built page for the campaign at hand (useful if you are running a competition or special
offer). Unlike web pages, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as
the CTA. Another great feature of the landing page is that there are fewer links on the landing
page, which means there are fewer clickables that will take visitors away from your page.

                                                                                                                                    567

Landing pages can make or break an advertising campaign. Poorly executed PPC campaigns
will send all users to the homepage of a website. Campaigns that convert will make sure that
users land on a page that is relevant to their search with a very visible call to action.

The aim is to keep the user as focused on the goal as possible, which is conversion. Sending
users to the homepage gives them too many other options to choose from.

For example, if users searched for `Canon EOS 1300D', a poorly run campaign would
send them to canon.co.uk.

A better campaign would have the user clicking through to canon.co.uk/for_home/
product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_1300d/.

Landing pages also indicate relevance to the

search engine, which can increase the Quality  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 5:

per click (CPC) of the keyword. Adding key-

word-rich pages to the website can also have SEO benefits. PPC campaigns often have

thousands of keywords, which can mean that you will have a lot of landing pages to build.

Creating dynamic landing pages means that with a simple script, unique keyword-rich landing

pages can be created for every search. The script will take the keyword that the searcher has

used and insert it in predefined places on the landing page. The user will land on a page that

is highly relevant to their search.

18.4.3 Ad extensions

Google ad extensions visually enhance the ad, whilst providing extra information to search
ads without affecting standard ad copy limits.

Ads offer two types of extensions: Manual and Automated. These extensions are added,
changed, and retired frequently. As Google is always testing their extensions, it is a good idea
to check in on updates to extensions or new ad extensions on offer.

As the name suggests, when setting up the ad you can manually select which extensions to
add to your Google Ad. While you can add as many as you like, make sure that they are relevant
to your business goals as they come at an additional cost.

The ads manual extensions are:

Location extensions

Location extensions allow you to add location information and maps to your ad (you can
add map pins, navigation assistance, and a call option). To use the extensions, you can either
insert your address manually or link your ads account to your Business Profile. This extension
can also run automatically. Read about Google's ad extension here: lineardesign.com/blog/

Callout extensions

Callouts allow you to include additional text with your search ads to highlight the key attributes
of your business, product, or service.

Call extensions

The call extension allows you to display a local phone number in a line below the standard
text ad. This is particularly effective for mobile ads, where the user can click and call directly
from their phone. Each call is the equivalent of a click. A business with a Search Network can
use call reporting to track calls as conversions. Where deemed the best result, ads can run
this extension automatically (Google Support, 2021).

       With the goal of generating more leads, this extension enables an advertiser to embed the
       form directly into the ad - creating a seamless and frictionless user experience. This extension
       can only be added at a campaign level and, at present, it is only available in certain countries.
       Ads also have strict protocols for using this extension.

     Price extensions

       This extension provides the user with the price for services or products. For best results, link
       the price extension to the landing page with that product on it. At the time of print, this feature
       is only available in certain countries.

     Image extensions

       Advertisers can upload powerful images that match the key words and clearly display their
       product in their search. It is also advisable to match these images with the landing page and
       to your ad copy. Ads can run a combination of results, including image-only SERP results.

       Automated extensions will be applied to your ad if Google thinks they will improve your per-
       formance; you cannot choose to add these yourself. Factors such as your bid, the ad's Quality
       Score, and page rank also have an influence on the metrics that Google Ads will apply to your
       ad. If you are watching your budget, you are able to remove extensions using the opt out feature.
       A brief overview of the automated extensions are as follows:

     Seller ratings extension

       Ratings gathered from reviews and collected information are combined and presented on
       a rating scale underneath your Ad. These ratings help users make more informed decisions
       about the product or service that you offer.

           Figure 18.16 An image showing a seller rating review of 4,9 for an app on Google Play

     Dynamic sitelinks

       This automatic extension follows a similar format to manual sitelinks in that the advertiser adds
       the sitelinks. Ads offer suggestions to improve sitelinks and run dynamic sitelinks automatically.
       Where it competes directly with a manual sitelink and the conditions suit it, the manual sitelink
       takes priority. This enhancement is used to increase the ad's performance, with the objective
       of conversion.

     Dynamic structured snippet extensions

       Dynamic structured snippets automatically show additional landing page details, which help
       searchers determine whether your site contains the kind of information they're looking for. This

Dynamic callout extensions

This enhancement runs automatically and without any input from the advertiser. It is used to
increase search relevance as useful and appropriate information is pulled from the landing
page and placed under the heading of the ad. For greater control, manual callouts can be
used to override this feature.

18.5 TARGETING OPTIONS

Search ads are targeted in a variety of ways, depending on how you want to reach your intended
audience. Targeting your ads means you know that the traffic you are getting is relevant to
your product.

18.5.1 Keywords and match types

It's not enough to simply pick the right keywords; you need to know about the different ways
in which the search engine interprets and matches the search term to your chosen keyword.
Most search engines require the advertiser to provide the search keywords for which their ad
should appear.
Considering the massive volume of searches conducted every day, it would be impossible to
determine all the possible terms potential customers might use to find you. That is why there
are different keyword match types for search advertising.
Google Ads use the following match types:
· Broad match
· Phrase match
· Exact match
· Negative match.
Broad match: This means that your ad will appear for the keywords you have entered, search
terms that contain your keywords and any other words in any order, as well as some variations
of your keywords, such as misspellings and synonyms.

                                                                                                                                    575
            ADVERTISING

       Phrase match: This is denoted with quotation marks around the keywords; `phrase match'
       means that your ad will appear only for search terms that have your keywords in them, in the
       same order, although other words may also be in the search term.

       Exact match: This is denoted by square brackets [exact match] and means that the ad will
       appear for search terms that match exactly the same as the keywords selected.

       Negative match or Negative keywords: These are denoted by using a dash in front of the
       keywords; negative [-] means that your advert will not appear in searches using that word,
       no matter what other words are used.

       Advertisers can assign as many keywords as they want to an ad, but only one ad for each URL
       will be shown. If two advertisers are bidding to show ads for the same domain, only one will be
       shown. Which ad will be shown is based on the bids being placed and on the quality of the ads.

     18.5.2 Language and location targeting

       Search engines have versions customised for specific regions and languages, based on the
       user's settings and where in the world they are searching from. As a search marketer, you
       can choose the language and the location of the search engine to target. This is known as
       geotargeting.

       For example, you may want your advert to show only to English searches in Asia or to French
       searches in Johannesburg. Targeting your ad means that your ads won't be seen by users
       outside your target area, and you won't pay for traffic that you cannot convert into customers.

     18.5.3 Behavioural and demographic targeting

       Search advertising can also be targeted based on personal behaviour. Using ads, you can
       re-target visitors who came to your site via an ads advert based on actions that they took. This
       means that if users came to your site, but did not complete a purchase, you can target ads to
       them in the SERPs or through other online advertising channels, such as the Google Display
       Network. This is called re-marketing or re-targeting, and can be very effective for remaining
       top of mind until the user is ready to convert. It is usually advisable to cap the number of times
       a re-marketing ad is shown to an individual to avoid annoying them.

    18.6 BIDDING AND RANKING FOR SEARCH ADS

       As you know, search ads are charged on a per-click basis. The cost that you pay for every click
       is determined by a variety of factors and is based on a bidding system.

       The different advertising platforms offer advanced bidding options, all aimed at helping you
       run your ad campaign better. You can bid for placement on the SERP, or you can bid based
       on how much you are willing to pay per click. You are also able to tailor your approach. For
       example, bidding for ads during certain times of the day only.

576
                       Search advertising 

Search advertising is usually run as a Vickrey auction model, so advertisers place bids to
appear based on certain criteria. The advertising platform determines when ads are eligible to
appear and serves them as is appropriate. The advertiser then pays the advertising platform
when their ad is clicked on.

Advertiser  Bid price  CPC
    A2        $3.00    $2.51
     A1       $2.50    $2.36
    A3        $2.35    $2.06

                   Figure 18.18 Three advertisers bidding on the same key phrase

With search advertising, the advertiser:

· Creates the copy for an advertisement
· Determines the landing page for the advert
· Selects the keywords or criteria for which that advertisement should appear
· Chooses the maximum amount, the cost per click (CPC), that they are willing to pay for

    a click on the ad. Alternatives to setting a bad limit based on CPC are to set a Maximum
    CPA, or to Target Return on ad spend.

The advertising platform:

· Checks the ad for compliance with editorial guidelines
· Displays the ad for relevant search queries or other criteria
· Determines the rank of the ad based on the advertiser's maximum bid and the relevance

    of the ad (which includes factors such as clickthrough rate, ad copy, keyword, and landing
    page relevance).

In Google Ads, you are able to set budgets for your campaign and decide on your CPC bids
for your keywords. You can set daily or monthly budgets. Once your total is reached, your
ads no longer run, so you can be sure that you never overspend. If you are concerned about
overspending, you can set a daily budget. However, this can mean that your ads may not run
as often as you may like them to.

18.6.1 Conversion and clickthrough rates

Search engines look at factors such as relevancy to try to ensure that it is not just advertisers
with deep pockets that can land the top ad listing. Search engines need to ensure that users
find the ads relevant, otherwise they'll be less likely to click on them, and no click means no
revenue for the search engine.

Studies repeatedly show that 46% of clicks go to the top three paid ads in search results (Webfx,
2021). Competition for these top spots can be fierce and the cost per click can be very high.

                                                                                                   577
            ADVERTISING

       Ads at the top of a page, generally have the following qualities:
       · They are very relevant to a user's search query
       · They have relevant and meaningful ad extensions
       · They have a good quality score. The ad and landing page are high quality and focus on

            relevance and usefulness.
       · The ad placed meets the Ad Rank Thresholds, the minimum requirements.
       · The ads are aligned to the user's needs (e.g., preferred device, time of day)
       · They consistently perform well, with high CTRs over time
       · The CPC bid is competitive and outbids other ads of the same quality (Google Ads, n.d.).

                                                                        Conversion - took

                       Figure 18.19 An image illustrating clickthrough and conversion rates

     18.6.2 The bidding process

       Advertisers need to determine the maximum they are willing to pay for a click on their ad, and
       they need to decide this for each keyword they enter for an ad. This bid is the maximum cost
       per click (max CPC).
       However, this will not necessarily be the CPC that the advertiser must pay for a click. Every time
       a search query is entered, the search engine runs an auction to determine the placement of
       the ads where advertisers have bid on that search term. This auction is known as a generalised
       second price (GSP) auction, which is a variation on the Vickrey auction. The highest bidder
       gets the first slot, the second highest the second slot, and so on. Higher positions are more
       valuable, in the sense that they generate more clicks, and the GSP allocates these positions
       in order of bid size. Each advertiser's payment is determined by the next highest bid.
       In the GSP auction, each advertiser will pay the bid of the advertiser below him, plus a standard
       increment (typically US $0.01), for a click on their ad.
       Google AdSense has transitioned to the first-prize auction from the end of 2021. According to
       Google this will help advertisers simplify how they buy online ads.

18.6.3 Ads Quality Score

When it comes to ranking, it's not quite as simple as that. It rarely is!
The search engine doesn't only take the bid an advertiser places on a keyword into account;
there are a number of other factors that come into play. In the case of Google Ads, this is known
as Quality Score. Quality Score is a diagnostic tool meant to give you a sense of how well your
ad quality compares to other advertisers. Quality Score is applied on keyword, ad group, and
account level. It is important that your entire account has a good Quality Score, as it affects
ranking and the cost per click.

                             Figure 18.20 The Google Adwords quality score
The Quality Score is ranked on a scale from 1-10 and available at the keyword level. The score
is calculated based on the combined performance of these three components:
1. Expected CTR: The likelihood that your ad will be clicked when shown
2. Ad relevance: How closely your ad matches the intent behind a user's search
3. Landing page experience: How relevant and useful your landing page is to people who

    click your ad.
Another way to think of the Quality Score is as a discount that is applied to your campaign.
For instance, an ad with a great Quality Score can achieve a top position at a lower bid than a
competing ad with a poor Quality Score. For example, an advertiser with a Quality Score of 5
will have to pay twice as much for a certain position as an advertiser with a Quality Score of 10.

18.7 TRACKING

In order to report on campaigns, from start to conversion, you need to use appropriate conversion
tracking. Conversion tracking is usually accomplished with a small tracking pixel that is placed
on the conversion confirmation page of the website.

                                                                                                                                    579
            ADVERTISING

       Google Ads offers conversion tracking tags, which will allow you to report on ads campaigns
       from impression through to conversion. The ads interface provides a wide range of useful reports.

       In order to track many other networks, however, third-party tracking needs to be used. Most
       ad-serving technology will also enable pay-per-click tracking, usually at a nominal additional
       cost per click. Running display campaigns through these networks has an added benefit; you
       can access reports about how campaigns might influence each other.

       If you are sending traffic to a website that uses Google Analytics, you can use campaign tracking
       to track and report on campaigns that are driving traffic to the site. It is best practice to link
       your ads and analytics accounts to share information across these platforms. For example, link
       the cost PPC in Google Analytics and some basic analytics information in ads.

    18.8 IMPLEMENTING A SEARCH ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN

       To have a successful search advertising campaign, you need to do more than just running an
       advert anytime. You need a plan that speaks to your business' marketing strategy.

     18.8.1. Do your homework

       For a successful campaign, you need a full online and offline analysis of the business, customer
       demographics, industry, and competitors. While it is relatively quick to set up a campaign,
       pre-planning will show dividends later. You need a brand, an identity, and a clear, unique selling
       point. You get only three lines to advertise, so you need to make sure you know what must be
       included and how to make the most impact.

     18.8.2 Define your goals

       You need to know what you want to achieve with your search advertising campaign. Branding
       campaigns, for example, are very different from campaigns to increase sales. What do you
       want users to do once they click on your ad?

     18.8.3 Budget, Cost Per Action (CPA), and targets

       Determine how much you are willing to spend to achieve your goal, your target CPA. Decide
       how much budget you are going to allocate to your search advertising campaign. If your goal
       is to increase revenue, your budget may be unlimited as long as revenue is increasing and
       you are within your target CPA.

     18.8.4 Keyword research

       You need to determine which keywords potential customers are likely to use when searching
       for the service that you offer. Along with that, you need to know:

       · Which common misspellings or typos a customer might use
       · Which words would show that they are not likely to purchase from you, such as `free' and `cheap'

· How to bid. Look at expected volumes for your keywords. There are also tools that will
    show you similar or related keywords, so you can expand your keyword list even further.

See section 18.11 Tools of the trade for some suggestions.

18.8.5 Write the ads

Using your keyword research, write compelling ad copy to promote your products. Ads can
be unique to one keyword, or you can group them and have a number of keywords for one ad.
Make sure you use an appropriate display URL and that you target the landing page for each ad.

18.8.6 Place your bids

Based on your goals and keyword research, set the maximum bids for your keywords. Don't
set these too high at this stage as you'll tweak the bids as you test your campaign. Don't make
them too low either; you won't get much traffic, which could negatively affect your Quality
Score. Test your ad to find the right balance in line with your goals. Ads also provides tools
that can help to guide your decisions.

18.8.7 Tracking

Get your tracking tags in place, especially any conversion tracking tags. Make sure that you
are consistent in your tags. Also, try to be as descriptive as possible while still being logical.

18.8.8 Measure, analyse, test, optimise!

With tracking in place, you can analyse your ROI down to a keyword level, and then focus your
campaign and budget on the keywords that are converting best.
Consider how changing the text, image, or video of your ad could increase the CTR or your
conversion rate. Test different landing pages to see what converts better.
Test the networks too. Your Bing campaign may perform better than Google, or your Facebook
account may drive cheaper traffic. Always keep your goals in mind and work, work, work to
achieve them.

18.9 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

There are many reasons why search advertising can be an excellent addition to any digital
marketing strategy. For example:
· No to low cost barrier: You pay only for traffic, there are usually no setup fees involved,

    and all the tools you need to start out with can be accessed for free.
· Tracking every cent: Search advertising allows you to track your advertising spend down

    to a keyword level, so you can learn what works and what doesn't on a micro scale.

                                                                                                                                    581
ADVERTISING

· Targeted advert placement: You can make your advertising relevant by using filters,
    targeting your ads to specific users, or even in the way you use keywords and match types.

· You're giving your customers what they want: You can put your advert in front of users
    who are searching for your product, allowing you to provide a solution, as opposed to
    creating an interruption.

Search advertising campaigns are quick to set up, can provide high volumes of traffic, and are
highly trackable. But there are some pitfalls that you should be aware of.

Click fraud

Click fraud occurs when your advert is clicked on by users who are not legitimate potential
customers. Because an advertiser has to pay for every click, sometimes unscrupulous com-
petitors can click on the ad to force the payment. There are even automated bots that can
click on ads, costing advertisers millions.

Thankfully, search engines have taken measures     NOTE  Fraud protection software does exist to
to combat click fraud. Therefore, it is no longer        help reduce click fraud. There are many
widely prevalent. Advertisers can report                 options to choose from.
suspected click fraud, and the search engines
will refund invalid or fraudulent clicks after
investigation.

How to detect this? Keep an eye on your campaign. Any sudden leap in CTR should be inves-
tigated, and you should pay particular attention to drops in the conversion rate, which would
indicate potential fraud. Pause the campaign if you suspect fraud, and alert the search engine.

Bidding wars and climbing CPCs

High-traffic keywords are expensive, and the battle to stay on top means that the CPC of
these keywords is escalating. Convincing yourself that it's number one or nothing can result
in burning through your campaign budget quickly with little to show for it.

Keep focused on your campaign goals and ROI, and keep investigating to find less expensive
niche keywords that work for you.

Keeping an eye on things

Search advertising campaigns require a lot of monitoring and the bigger your campaign gets,
the more time this takes. Search advertising can provide a fantastic ROI, but you need to check
in and tweak regularly to make sure that it continues to perform for you.

    18.10 MEASURING SUCCESS

       How do you know if a campaign is performing well? You may think that more clicks are better,
       but is this necessarily the case? Being in the top position means that you may pay more per

582
                                                    Search advertising 

click. When your advertising budget is limited, it is often more cost effective not to bid too much
for your keywords and to occupy the lower ad positions. Because you'll pay less per click, you
can achieve more clicks and potential customers for your limited search advertising budget.

Advertisers need to consider what users do after clicking through to the advertiser's website
from the search engine. When planning a search advertising campaign, it is crucial to set the
goals of the campaign upfront, and to ensure that these are attainable. With a goal set up, the
advertiser can track how many of the users that clickthrough to the website follow through to
that goal. This is called a conversion.

Goals could be:

· Buying a product
· Filling in a form or quote
· Downloading a white paper
· Sending an enquiry
· Booking a flight.

We know that the CTR of an ad is the number of clicks out of the total impressions. The
conversion rate of an ad is conversions divided by clicks. The cost per action, or the cost per
each conversion, is the total cost of the campaign divided by the number of conversions. The
average cost per click is the total cost of the campaign divided by the number of clicks.

As the advertiser, you also need to know the value of each conversion. If the value of a conversion
is less than the cost of achieving it, you effectively lose money with every conversion. Knowing
the value of a conversion to your business, will enable you to run search adg campaigns profitably.

You also want to look at your share of voice, which is your brand's share of the total advertising
exposures for that sector or product type. This helps you measure how visible you are during
your campaign.

  The solution

   The company partnered with Vertical Leap to change their SEO and PPC campaigns. The
   company solution operated on several levels:

   · They found that eBay was limiting exposure of Frooition ads and requested removal
       of the restriction placed on the ads.

   · They restructured the entire account using historical data so that they could better
       focus budget. Keywords that didn't work well were removed, and keyword match types
       were refined to better targeted search terms.

   · They wrote new ad copy to match the new structure of the account and improve the
       keyword quality score.

   · They adjusted the ad schedule so that high-performing hours of the day were targeted.
   · They created new ad extensions to highlight USPs and improve clickthrough rates.

  The results

   Because they removed poorly performing keywords and refined targeting, they decreased
   the number of impressions by 33% and reduced overall spend by 65%.

   The quality score improved dramatically, and cost per click was reduced by 52%.

   The changes to ad copy and ad extensions, along with the targeting, increased the
   clickthrough-rate and conversions also rose.

   In summary:

   · Cost per conversion dropped by 70%
   · Total conversions increased by 21%
   · Conversion rate went up by 65%
   · Overall costs dropped by 65%
   · Clickthrough rate increased by 69% (Digital Training Academy, 2016).
   By using data and actionable insights carefully, Frooition and Vertical Leap radically
   improved the PPC campaign.

     an effective search engine marketing strategy.

     Search advertising is an excellent source of keywords and conversions. This insight can be
     used to improve a site's SEO, as you will already know the relevance of these keywords to your
     intended audience. In turn, improved SEO rankings and social media interactions can help to
     reduce the CPC of your search advertising campaign, improve your Quality Score, and raise
     your CTRs throughout.

     Search advertising can help to give your brand immediate search engine presence for your
     offline campaigns, when these might not yet be highly ranked in the natural search results.
     Search advertising can also be used together with online crisis management. If a company is
     unable to combat negative search results through the natural rankings, they are always able
     to bid for search ads that can present their view.

     Having a firm grasp of search advertising on search engines will provide a good foundation
     for running digital advertising campaigns across other networks and ad types.

     18.15 SUMMARY

     Search advertising is advertising on the results pages of search engines; it is where an advertiser
     typically pays for each click on an ad. These ads consist of text, links, and ad extensions. They
     are listed above and alongside the organic search results and are marked as ads so that users
     are aware that these are paid-for listings.

     Search advertising is targeted according to keywords, demographics, behaviour, or interest.
     On search engines, the CPC is determined by an auction.

     The success of an ad may be determined by its CTR, but the success of a campaign will be
     determined by its conversion rate and its ability to achieve a target CPA. After all, it's not
     enough for users just to click on your ad; you want them to take specific actions on your site
     once they get there.

     18.16 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

     1. Why would competitors commit click fraud?
     2. When should you use certain search types for ads, and why would this matter? How does

         it affect the number of conversions?
     3. Why should one use relevant landing pages when running a search advertising campaign, and

         how does this affect the number of conversions?

     19.1 INTRODUCTION

     Digital advertising, simply put, is advertising    NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 18:
     on the internet. It can be found anywhere you            Search advertising.
     access the web; the majority of this form of

     advertising is now found on mobile. Digital

     advertising, also known as online advertising, is an integrated approach to advertising, focusing

     on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. This includes display ads found on websites, ads on

     search engine results pages, ads placed in emails and on social networks, video and content

     advertising, and other ways in which advertisers use the internet.

     The terms 'digital advertising' and `online advertising' are used interchangeably in this chapter.

     The main objectives of online advertising are to increase sales, improve brand awareness,
     engage customers, and raise share of voice in the marketplace. It is based on the simple
     economics of demand and supply. Advertisers aim to stimulate a consumer need (demand)
     and then satisfy that need (supply).

     Online advertising follows web user behaviour. Advertisers want to place their ads where
     potential customers will see them. Digital advertising is not limited to one specific medium or
     location; it can be placed almost anywhere on the web and can consist of images, text, videos,
     interactive elements, and even games.

     Although the internet provides new scope for

     creative approaches to advertising, we see its           To find out more about measuring clicks,

19.3 OBJECTIVES

Advertising online has a number of objectives; let's explore them.

19.3.1 Building brand awareness

Making users aware of a brand or product is an important long-term goal for any marketer.
Once customers know about it, they are more likely to trust the brand. The more frequently a
brand message is seen, the higher the recall on the brand, ad, or tag line. The better known a
brand is, the more business it can do. Brand awareness drives recall at the point of purchase
or when considering a brand to use. Its ultimate goal is to sell more of the product or service.

It is worth noting that despite low clickthrough rates, online advertising does drive
awareness because the ad is seen even if it isn't clicked. This is highly relevant when
using programmatic engines to drive affiliate-based marketing tactics. This moves away
from the `old school' CPM buy. Refer to the section on advertising exchanges and pro-
grammatic buying for more context.

Digital advertising is largely visual, making it     NOTE  Brand awareness is essential for
an ideal channel for promoting brand imagery.              launching a new brand or product or
Brand imagery is the result of all the visuals that        approaching a new audience. Read more
represent your brand's identity. The images are            about brand awareness in this article:
more than just visuals; they convey an emotion             blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-

in the viewer, also know as `brand feelings.' Your         awareness.

brand image, however, refers to how your brand

is perceived on the outside and the reputation it has in the world (Reid, 2019).

           Apple, for example, hosts an entire event dedicated to announcing its new releases.
           Other brands, such as Coca-Cola or Kleenex, have become so well-known that they
           replaced the generic terms, such as cola or tissue. These terms as known as propriety
           eponyms. Another popular enonym is band-aid. While BAND-AID is the name brand that
           makes adhesive bandages, most people use the term to refer to any adhesive bandage,
           regardless of who makes it.

                           award winning banner from Swedish company ATG

19.3.2 Creating demand

Creating customer demand is a three-step process: inform, persuade, and remind. Consumers
can't want what they don't know about. Advertising needs to convince them that they want
something and let them know why they should want it. Online advertising provides a great way
to communicate the unique selling points (USPs) of a product, helping to stimulate demand
and reminding consumers about the product and why they want it.

                  Figure 19.2 A banner ad that creates demand for a new product

19.3.3 Satisfying demand

Once consumers want a product, they need to find out how to satisfy that desire. At this point,
it is important for the marketer to show the consumer how a particular brand or product will
best meet that need. Search ads are usually most useful for this (see Chapter 18: Search
advertising for more information).

             Figure 19.3 A search ad that meets the customer's need to save money
                                                                                                                                    593

19.3.4 Driving direct response and sales

All forms of digital marketing need to drive traffic and sales in the long term. However, the
immediacy of online advertising also drives traffic and sales in the short and medium terms.
Unlike traditional media advertising, online advertising can turn the potential customer into
an actual customer right there and then. Better still, it is possible to measure accurately how
effective the online advertising campaign has been in this regard.

19.4 THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR

Online advertising is able to drive instant sales and conversions. Unlike other advertising
mediums, the consumer can go from ad to merchant in one easy click. Because of the connected
nature of the internet, online activities are highly trackable and measurable, which makes it
possible to target ads and to track and gauge the efficacy of the advertising accurately. Each
ad can be tracked for success.

The long tail of successful tracking also ensures that the user is tracked from the start of their
journey to their final purchase, which might not be in the traditional `awareness to sale' funnel.
Google has called this principle `attribution modelling,' and it is based on the premise that a
certain digital channel might be better at assisting in purchase than another, at a certain time,
in a certain chain of interactions with the brand.

For example, a user might see a display ad for the VW Golf at the beginning of the month, but
not click on it. Later in the month, they receive a raise and decide to purchase a new car, the
VW Golf comes to mind. They search for it and click on a Google search ad to view the vehicle
on the website and evaluate costs. Then, they visit a number of other vehicle websites. A week
later, they see an ad on Facebook for the VW Golf on a 2% below prime sale, so they click on
it and fill out the lead form for the dealer to call them. This demonstrates how different media
might play a part in bringing the sale or last click attribution.

19.5 TYPES OF DISPLAY ADS

There are many different ways to display ads in digital. Some common options include Responsive
Display Ads (RDAs), banner ads, interstitial banner, op-ups and pop-unders, floating ads,
wallpaper ads, map ads, video ads, native content, and sponsored content.

19.5.2 Banner ads

A banner ad is a graphic image or animation displayed on a website for advertising purposes.
Static banners are in GIF or JPEG formats, but banners can also employ rich media such as
video, JavaScript, HTML5, and other interactive technologies. These allow the viewer to interact
and transact with the banner. Banners are not limited to the space that they occupy; some
expand on mouse-over or when clicked, some capture data within the banner.

are still an option, most advertisers currently make use of Responsive Display Ads for their

display campaigns.

Banners may be animated, static, or HTML5 (or AMP HTML for mobile users), but must be
under 150 KB in file size. The standard formats are:

       · Banner (468 × 60)
       · Small square (200 × 200)
       · Square (250 × 250)
       · Large leaderboard (970 × 90)
       · Half-page ad (300 × 600)
       · Skyscraper (120 × 600)
       · Wide skyscraper (160 × 600)
       · Large rectangle (336 × 280)
       · Inline rectangle (300 × 250)
       · Leaderboard (728 × 90).

       All ads need to be supplied with a destination URL. Some rich media ads allow for multiple

       destination URLs.

19.5.3 Interstitial banners

Interstitial banners are banners shown between pages on a website or, more often, between
screens on an app. As you click from one page to another, you are shown this ad before the
next page is displayed. The user is given the option to close the ad. Google has strict rules for
this format. They penalise, for instance, when interstitial ads do not appear during a natural
transition, but while the user is browsing or in the middle of as task at hand (e.g., when
playing a game or buying a product). Read more about it here: support.google.com/admob/

                                   on a mobile app, from Google Support

   Pop-ups and interstitial ads rank lower on Google's SERP, since users tend to dislike
   those ads. If deemed intrusive to the user's experience, Google will devalue the website.
   These formats must be implemented with the user's experience in mind.

19.5.4 Pop-ups and pop-unders

As the name suggests, these are ads that pop up, or under, the web page being viewed. They
open in a new, smaller window. You will see a pop-up straight away, but will probably become
aware of a pop-under only after you close your browser window.
These were very prominent in the early days of online advertising, but audience annoyance
means that there are now `pop-up blockers' built into most good web browsers. This can be
problematic as sometimes a website will legitimately use a pop-up to display information
to the user. Pop-ups still occur now and then on mobile phones or when visiting somewhat
unethical sites.

                                                                                                                                    597
            ADVERTISING

     19.5.5 Floating ads

       Floating ads appear in a layer over the content, but are not in a separate window. Usually, the
       user can close this ad. In fact, best practice dictates that a prominent close button should be
       included on the ad, usually in the top right-hand corner. Floating ads are created with HTML or
       Rich Media, and float in a layer above a site's content for a few seconds. Often, the animation
       ends by disappearing into a banner ad on the page. These days many sites are using pop-ups
       to encourage newsletter sign-ups or social media likes rather than to advertise products.

to click on an ad of this type, but not always.
Wallpaper ads are purely impression-based
strategies and used exclusively for brand or
product awareness objectives.

19.5.7 Map ads

This is advertising placed on an online map, such as Google Maps or Waze. This type of ad is
ideal for local businesses and is usually based on keyword searches for the brand's offering.

19.5.8 Video ads

Video campaigns are excellent for driving traffic to your site and for increasing awareness.
As explored in Part 3: Creating, video is a powerful marketing format. Video placements are
available on the Google Display Network. Google Ads target devices such as Smart TV and
DSTV. Common display formats for this are video and banner ads. Also, TrueView In-Stream
ads run on YouTube and on some Google Display Networks. To find out more about this option,

     ADVERTISING

     19.5.9 Native content

     Native content advertising is the online version of advertorials. This is where the advertiser
     produces content that is in line with the editorial style of the site, but is sponsored, or in
     some way product endorsed, by the brand. Video is an increasingly popular method of native
     advertising. Great examples of this exist on Buzzfeed.com.

     19.5.10 Sponsored content

     Sponsored content advertising exists at the bottom of articles you read online. This is where
     the `suggested articles' posts appear. In most cases, this is paid-for promotion. Advertisers pay
     to have their content promoted under certain categories of sites or articles.

     19.6 PAYMENT MODELS FOR DISPLAY ADVERTISING

     As well as a variety of mediums and formats, there are also a number of different payment
     models for display advertising.

     19.6.1 CPM

     CPM stands for cost per thousand impressions (M is the Roman numeral for a thousand). This
     means the advertiser pays for every thousand times the ad loads on the publisher's page. This
     is how a campaign is normally priced when brand awareness or exposure is the primary goal.

     CPM rates for rich media ads are often based on file size, so rates are usually higher than for
     standard media ads.

     19.6.2 vCPM

     If budget is a concern, advertisers can select the vCPM option so that they only pay for the
     impressions that can be measured as viewable (viewable cost per thousand impressions). Find
     out more about this strategy here: support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3499086?hl=en.

     19.6.3 CPC

     CPC stands for cost per click. This means that

     the advertiser pays only when their ad is clicked  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 18:
     on, regardless of how many times it has been             Search advertising.

     viewed. CPC advertising is normally associated

     with search advertising, although it has become very popular in display advertising too, especially

     when using ad networks. Banners can be priced this way when the aim is to drive traffic and

     conversions. It is also a payment method sometimes used in affiliate marketing, when the aim

     is to drive traffic to a new website.

19.6.4 CPA

CPA refers to cost per acquisition. Using this model means that the advertiser pays only when
an ad delivers an acquisition after the user clicks on the ad.

Definitions of acquisitions vary, depending on the site and campaign. It may be a user filling
in a form, downloading a file, or buying a product.

CPA is often the best option for advertisers because they pay only when the advertising has met
its goal. For this reason, it is also the worst type for the publisher, as they are rewarded only if
the advertising is successful. The publisher has to rely on the conversion rate of the advertiser's
website, something that the publisher cannot control. The CPA model is not commonly used
for banner advertising and is generally associated with affiliate marketing.

19.6.5 Flat rate or sponsorships

Large sites with high website traffic, such as Media24 Network, sell priority space that is still
available after direct sales efforts. These placements can be purchased on a CPM or on a
fixed-term agreement. If this is the case, Google will pay the owner of the website via Google
AdSense.

Additionally, owners of lower-traffic sites can sometimes sell banner space at a flat rate, in other
words, at a fixed cost per month, regardless of the amount of traffic or impressions. This would
appeal to a media buyer who may be testing an online campaign that targets niche markets.
A popular way that this is employed is via a homepage or section takeover, in which a brand
can buy a homepage takeover on a news portal on the day of an important news event, such
as a big sports day or an election.

There are several variations to what a sponsorship on a website entails. Examples include
exclusive ads on all the pages and slots on a specific page, newsletter or section, and sponsoring
content. Sponsorship means that no other advertiser will appear in that section. Sponsorships
are often difficult to measure and are mostly used to raise brand awareness. These can be very
effective when launching a new brand.

19.6.6 CPE

With the cost per engagement (CPE) model, advertisers pay for interactions with ads, normally
placed in videos or application (e.g., Facebook apps). An interaction, referred to as an engagement,
usually starts with a rollover or mouse-over that expands the ad. An engagement can also be
a like, comment, share, or other platform-relevant social action.

Once expanded, an ad may contain a video, game, form, or other interactive content. The ad
doesn't take the user away from the web page, and marketers pay only when a user completes
an action.

                                                                                                                                    601
            ADVERTISING

     19.6.7 What payment model can you expect?

       The advertiser rarely has a say over the payment model used. This comes down to the website
       owner or publisher, advertising type, and other factors, such as the popularity of the site.

       CPM favours the publisher, while CPA favours the advertiser. Sometimes, a hybrid of the two
       payment models is pursued.

       High-traffic, broad-audience websites, often referred to as `premium' or booked media, will
       typically offer CPM advertising. Examples include web portals such as yahoo.com or news
       sites such as cnn.com.

       Niche websites with a targeted audience are more likely to offer CPC or CPA advertising to
       advertisers with an appropriate product. These can also fall under the umbrella of affiliate
       marketing.

       As programmatic ad exchanges (a way to purchase digital advertising inventory) take over
       more of the digital inventory, the CPM and sponsorship buying models are starting to wane
       in popularity for both advertiser and publisher. The accuracy and cost efficiency with which
       programmatic uses remnant advertising inventory from sites that sell majority CPM inventory,
       make it a popular way to target and buy going forward. This style of buying also allows much
       better targeting of the advertising over time, a big plus for advertisers. This will soon overtake
       the traditional CPM buy in 100% of cases.

       Types of advertising can be seen on a scale from more intrusive (and thus potentially annoying
       to the consumer) to less intrusive. In the same way, payment models can be scaled from those
       that favour the publisher to those that favour the advertiser.

       When planning a campaign, it is important to know how the advertising will be paid for and
       what kinds of advertising are offered by publishers. A lot of this can be solved by using a
       company that specialises in ad serving, media planning, and media buying.

           Which is the best payment model for you? This will depend on the purpose of your ads
           and the return you expect on your investment. Each payment model can be effective and
           lucrative if used appropriately.

    19.7 GETTING YOUR ADS ONLINE

       To get your ads to appear online, you need to find and pay for the space where they will appear.
       There are several options for doing this:

       · Premium booked media
       · Advertising networks
       · Advertising exchanges and programmatic buying

602
                                                           Online and display advertising

· Social media advertising placement (see more in Chapter 17: Social media advertising)
· Native advertising
· Mobile advertising
· Ad servers.

19.7.1 Premium booked media

Premium booked media works very much in the traditional way of booking advertising. The
advertiser contacts the premium media provider (usually a single group that oversees a key,
high-profile online space) and discusses options for placing an ad. Usually a costly, high-profile
option, this will involve negotiating on targeting and pricing for the space desired.

19.7.2 Advertising networks

An advertising network is a group of websites on which ads can be purchased through a
single sales entity. It could be a collection of sites owned by the same publisher. For example,
New Line Cinema, Time Inc., and HBO are all owned by Time Warner Inc. Or it could be an
affiliation of sites that share a representative.

The Google Display Network is one of the largest advertising networks in the world. The
advertising network acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers and provides
a technology solution to both. As well as offering a centralised ad server that can deliver ads
to a number of websites, the networks offer tracking and reporting, as well as targeting.

Advertising networks can categorise the sites by factors such as demographics, topic, or area
of interest. Audience targeting is a particularly useful option, in which an ad can be targeted
according to remarketing lists, custom lists, or interest categories. Advertisers pay to advertise
in specific channels and not in individual sites.

In general, audience targeting is preferred to

placement targeting. Usually, the campaign      NOTE  For those just starting out and learning

converting sites or on the objectives of the          conversion as your objective.

campaign. Rates are often negotiated with the

network, and placements are booked over a period of time.

19.7.3 Advertising exchanges and programmatic buying

Advertising exchanges are where unsold advertising space, called inventory, is placed by
publishers for bidding. The inventory is sold to the highest bidding advertiser. This type of
advertising gives advertisers far more control and mimics the PPC model of search advertising
(GSP auction). However, bids are for audience profiles and space rather than for keywords. It
allows publishers to fill unsold inventory at the highest available price, and can give smaller
advertisers access to this inventory.

                                                                                                    603
ADVERTISING

Programmatic buying is the automated purchasing of digital advertising space using software.
This is much more efficient than the old process of human ad buyers and salespeople, and
therefore it is also cheaper. Programmatic buying can happen in advance from specific publisher
sites or in real time bidding.

Real time bidding is one kind of programmatic ad buying in which ads are bought on a
per-impression basis through real time instantaneous auctions.

Programmatic buying is exciting because it makes targeting much easier. It uses small predictive
analysis to present your ads to the most likely optimal target market, and then evolves from
there, based on what is working best. This frees marketers up to focus on KPIs, creative strategy,
and other aspects.

19.7.4 Social media advertising

Many social media platforms offer an adver-

tising option, as this is their primary source of  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 17:

to reach prospects because you can usually

target very accurately based on user-provided demographic information.

19.7.5 Native advertising

Native advertising is presenting advertising in a way that matches the platform on which it is
presented and that meets audience expectations for that platform. It is an indirect promotion
of the brand or product, focused primarily on providing value to a specific readership, but it
differs from content marketing in that it is paid. Essentially, it is paid advertising that works
very hard not to disrupt the user experience. In its ideal form, this means the user is presented
with useful, engaging content, that in turn is much more compelling than a banner ad.

It can look like paid search ads on a search engine, sponsored content like on LinkedIn or
Facebook, or promoted listings, like on Twitter. However, it more closely resembles content
than advertising.

19.7.6 Mobile advertising

Mobile advertising is no longer something that should be considered in isolation. While there
are still mobile-online networks, online advertising is moving toward real time buying and
networks, and so device is becoming just another targeting option. All of the ad options already
discussed are also available on mobile. For some interesting stats on mobile ads, visit this
website: digitalthirdcoast.com/blog/google-ads-statistics.

      Blind networks

       These networks target a large number of independent mobile publishers, and generally allow
       you to target by country or type of content, but not by specific websites. Payment tends to

be on a CPC basis, which can vary. An example of this kind of network is BuzzCity (buzzcity.
com). Very few low-cost blind networks exist these days, as they have all been bought up by
programmatic engines.

Premium blind networks

Advertising on premium blind networks tends to be more expensive but allows the advertiser
to target better-known brands and high-traffic sites. Broadcasters or operator portals fall under
this category. Payment here is often on a CPM basis. Millennial Media, now owned by AOL,
is an example of a premium blind network. While targeting options are available, different
networks can work in different ways, with varying levels of support.

Premium networks

These networks often offer sales as a direct extension of the big brands that they present. More
detailed targeting and sales support is available, but they also charge higher rates. They also
offer different ad bidding options, such as CPC and CPView for video ads. An example of this
kind of network is Widespace.

     19.7.7 Ad servers

       Ad servers are servers that store ads and deliver them to web pages. Ad servers can be local,
       run by a publisher to serve ads to websites on the publisher's domain, or they can be third-party
       ad servers, which serve ads to web pages on any domain. Ad servers facilitate ad trafficking
       and provide reports on ad performance. They have two functions: to help publishers manage
       their ad inventory and to help advertisers monitor and optimise their campaigns.

      The benefits of ad servers

       Rather than distribute copies of each piece of creative advertising to each publisher or media
       buyer, you can send out a line of code that calls up an ad directly from the ad server each time
       an ad is scheduled to run. The agency loads the ad the server once and can modify rotations
       or add new units on the fly without needing to re-contact the vendors. This is referred to as
       third-party ad serving.

       The ad servers provide a wealth of data, including impressions served, ads clicked, CTR, and
       CPC. While publishers have their own ad servers, most of the third-party ad servers also have
       the ability to provide performance against post-click activities such as sales, leads, downloads,
       or any other site-based action the advertiser may want to measure.

       Ad servers provide a consistent counting methodology across the entire campaign, enabling
       the advertiser to gain an `apples to apples' comparison of performance across the entire media
       schedule, which includes multiple websites. This ensures that the advertiser gets what they
       are paying for and avoids fraudulent activities, such as click fraud, as a good third-party ad
       server should be audited.

       The ad server also allows sophisticated targeting of display advertising. Examples of third-party
       ad servers include Google DoubleClick and Sizmek. It is generally accepted practice to run
       one of these ad servers, but they all cost a percentage of the CPM rates.

    19.8 TARGETING AND OPTIMISING

       Ad servers serve ads across a number of websites and can track a user's clicks, impressions,
       and actions. This means that ad servers can offer advertisers the following:

       · Frequency capping: This limits the number of times a specific user sees the same ad in
            a set time period.

       · Sequencing: Using the sequential creative rotation feature, an advertiser can control the
            order of the ads and therefore, the order that the user will see them.

       · Exclusivity: This ensures that ads from direct competitors are not shown on the same page.
       · Roadblocks: This allows an advertiser to own 100% of the advertising inventory on a page.
       The ad server can also target ads based on the business rules of the advertiser or the profiles
       of the users.

· Geotargeting: Online advertising has            NOTE  Location targeting can be very cost-

platform, and carrier.

· Day and time: Advertisers can choose the time of day or day of the week when their ads
    are shown. Advertisers can specify when their campaign should flight, down to the minute.

This usually depends on the client's objective for the campaign or the product itself.

· Language: Using the browser language setting, users can be targeted by language.
· Audience targeting: The ad server uses the profile of a user, built up over websites visited

    previously, to determine which ads to show during a given visit. These lists of users - or

expressions - can be used to target specific groups of users. Lists can be combined and

excluded. There is no limit to the size of the expressions, and they can be shared with other

advertisers who can then add these insights to their lists.

Remarketing is another form of audience

targeting. This allows the ad server to display         You can find out more about DoubleClick

cart, encouraging them to go back and make a

purchase. This can be done through various engines, the most popular of which is DoubleClick

Digital Marketing (DDM) from Google.

Another approach to audience targeting is to set up parameters to determine when a certain
ad needs to be shown. For example, if the user has clicked on a banner advertising a test
drive, and the user has actually booked the test drive, the next time they see an ad from the
advertiser, a different ad will be shown because the user has already responded to the first one.

· Contextual advertising: The ad server deduces the optimum ads to serve, based on the
    content of the page. To do this, an advertiser will use keywords and topics in their ad group.
    For example, on an article about mountain bike holidays in Europe, the ad server would
    show ads for new mountain bikes, or ads from travel companies offering flights to Europe,
    or perhaps ads for adventure travel insurance.

                                                                                                    607

     19.9 TRACKING

     Online advertising can be tracked - a feature

     that makes it so superior to conventional adver-  NOTE  Read more about this in Chapter 21:
     tising. Not only can an advertiser tell how many        Conversion optimisation.

     times an ad has been seen (impressions), but

     also how many times the ad has been successful in sending visitors to the advertised website

     (clicks). As discussed in the Chapter 21: Conversion optimisation, the tracking needs to

     continue on the website to determine how successful the ad has been in creating more revenue

     for the website (conversions).

     In addition to tracking ads, advertising networks can provide information about the users who
     saw the ad, as well as those who acted on it, including:

     · Connection type
     · Browser
     · Operating system
     · Time of day
     · Language
     · Internet service provider.

     Many third-party ad servers will set a cookie on impression of an ad, not only on clickthrough,
     so it is possible to track conversions that happen indirectly (called view-through conversions).
     Simply put, third-party ad servers can track not only the post click data, but also the post view
     data - when a user sees an ad, does not click on it, but goes to the website after viewing the
     ad either by typing in the URL or by searching for the site.

     Using this information, the ad server can target the ads displayed, helping advertisers to
     optimise campaigns and get the most from their budgets.

     19.10 IMPLEMENTING ONLINE ADVERTISING

     Knowing the various types of display options and payment models available is all very well,
     but you may be wondering how to put this all together as you plan your campaign. Here is a
     step-by-step guide that you can follow to ensure that you run effective ad:

     Step 1: Determine your campaign goal
     Are you embarking on a branding campaign, or is your primary focus direct response? Keep
     your overall channel and brand objectives in mind when planning your digital campaign.

     Step 2: Identify your key performance indicators (KPIs)
     Which figures will let you know if you are succeeding? This should tie in closely to your goal.

608
                                                                                               Online and display advertising

   Don't forget to keep an eye on any non-digital advertising that the brand is doing. This
   could have a significant effect on your results, and you want to ensure that you are
   communicating the same message.

Step 3: Investigate your target audience
What websites are they likely to be visiting? The type of creative you use and the payment
model you follow will largely be determined by the websites on which you advertise.

Online advertising is an acquisition and awareness channel. It does not require users to seek
an interaction actively, as search advertising and email marketing do. It is therefore crucial
that the ads are placed in front of the audience that is most likely to convert. Sites such as
Narratiive can help give this type of insight (narratiive.com).

Step 4: Research potential publishers to host your ads
Niche websites with a smaller, more targeted audience will most likely charge a flat rate for
display advertising or a CPA rate. They could be flexible in display options that they offer, but
you will need to take into account their bandwidth costs if they serve the ads.

High-traffic websites with a broad audience will usually charge on a CPM basis. They will broker
their advertising inventory through an ad network or a number of ad networks.

Step 5: Set a budget
Most advertising platforms will let you set and dynamically manage your budget. Decide how
much you are willing to pay per click, impression, action, or engagement, and set your total
budget in line with this.

Step 6: Create your ads
Now, you will need to brief your creative team to ensure that you have the optimum banners
for your campaign.

Your online ads will need to:

· Attract attention
· Convey a message
· Entice action.
Animation attracts attention, but be wary of being one of several animated banners on a
website. Banners should not be considered in isolation, but in the context of the website on
which they will appear.

Web users respond well to being told what to do, and the content of an online ad should be
concise and directional. Examples of these CTAs include:

· `Click for a quote.'
                                                                                                                                    609
     ADVERTISING

     · `Click here for the full video and win.'
     · `Donate now.'

     Step 7: Choose or create a landing page
     All advertising needs an appropriate landing page or destination URL. Whether this involves
     creating a microsite or merely leading users to an existing page on the website, ensure that
     clickthroughs are not being wasted. Generally, sending advertising traffic to your homepage
     is not a good idea as it leaves the user confused about where to go next.

     Step 8: Run your ads                              NOTE  If a problem comes up, you can simply
                                                             stop your campaign, change the creative

     for your money, and that nothing unusual is
     occurring.

     Step 9: Track, measure, optimise

     As with all online marketing tactics, you need to track what your ads are doing and the results
     they are generating, measure your returns and successes, and then optimise your online ad
     campaigns to get even better returns in the future.

     19.11 THE FUTURE OF ONLINE ADVERTISING

     On the web, the convergence of digital devices    NOTE  Read about this in the McKinsey
     and channels is leading to new avenues for              study on quantum leap of digital
     online advertising. Digital advertising can             adoption: www.mckinsey.com/

     COVID-19 pandemic. But it is not without its            transformed-business-forever.

     challenges, such as increasing CPC prices and

     changes to tracking cookies due to privacy concerns.

     While we have become used to the internet as a free medium where we can read and interact
     with any content we want, it is the fact that it is an advertisers' medium that keeps it free.
     And that means that as technologies evolve and the way we interact with content changes,
     so advertising follows.

     Previously, the level of interaction a web user had with a website could be measured by the
     number of pages of that website the user viewed. Now, technology (e.g., AJAX) and rich media
     (e.g., video) mean that the time spent on a web page can be more meaningful than the number

610
                                                           Online and display advertising

of pages viewed. The key word here is `engagement,' and technology and data analysis are
working towards being able to determine how websites can quantify the level of engagement
with a viewer. The ultimate way to get your customers excited is by providing them with a
product experience that beats all others.

Display ads have a history of being annoying and frustrating for online users. This is no longer
the case. Due to responsive and dynamic banners with personalised and targeted messages
that are displayed directly to the user, display advertising CTRs are on the rise. Additionally,
formats such as native advertising, for example, have a fairly good engagement rate. The
question remains: With the digital's marketing focus on tracking and measuring response and
engagement, should a company spend money on less measurable activities such as `brand
building,' where they are paying on a CPM basis?

increase in search volume, for example.

What does this tell us? Measurement should take place across all channels, and no channel
should be utilised in isolation. The best results will be gained through an integrated and holistic
approach to digital marketing.

19.12 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

Online and display advertising have many advantages, but also many challenges. As evocative
and interactive as they can be, many consumers are feeling exhausted by ads and concerned
about their privacy.

19.12.1 Advantages of online advertising

Banner advertising goes a long way towards bridging the advertising divide. They can look
very similar to print ads, and they occupy a particular bit of real estate in a publication with a
particular number of views. It's easy to understand, and it does the things with which buyers
are familiar.

Online advertising can take advantage of the emotive qualities of images, videos, and animations.
Some campaigns are better suited to images than plain text.

Since banners can contain rich media, they offer levels of interactivity that other forms of
advertising cannot achieve. This allows your target market not only to see your banner, but
also to play with it. Interaction builds a bond and improves the chances of the consumer
remembering your brand tomorrow. Cognitive learning is a powerful outcome of interactive
display advertising.

                                                                                                     611
     ADVERTISING

     Modern online advertising is able to bring together a number of other online marketing tactics,
     such as animations, games, video, and Flash.

     Banner ads, like all digital marketing tactics, are measurable. Track clickthrough rates and you
     get an idea of exactly how many users are responding to your call to action. Some publishers
     even have the ability to do post-click tracking, which means that you can track the user all the
     way to a sale if that is the purpose of the ad.

     19.12.2 Challenges of online advertising

     A lot of display advertising is intrusive, so

     popup blockers can often prevent ads from         NOTE  Advertising is not a problem that's
     being served as they were intended by the               unique to the web. For example, TV

     will block advertising on web pages. Technolog-         streaming services.

     ically savvy consumers are increasingly using

     these methods to limit the advertising that they see, which for the most part is okay. Ideally,

     you want to target interested users to click and convert, so make sure that online users are

     streamlining what they see based on their interests and not the design and execution of your ads.

     Bandwidth can also be an issue, although this is a shrinking problem. However, campaigns
     should be planned according to demographics in determining the richness (and investment)
     of interaction.

     Consumers are suffering from advertising fatigue, so while new technologies can provide
     great results, as soon as the market moves mainstream it can get saturated. Consumers are
     increasingly ignoring ads.

     19.13 MEASURING SUCCESS

     How you measure the success of an online ad campaign will depend greatly on the objectives
     you set for that campaign. For this reason, it is important to set those objectives before the
     campaign begins. The objective you have in mind will inform the goals you monitor (where
     'goal' is a specific user action), and that will inform the KPIs you track. You will also want to
     measure events or steps in the conversion process.

     As an example, if your objective is awareness, you may want to look into the following KPIs,
     among others:

     · Number of visits to your website
     · Amount of user engagement (measured by time on site, comments on or shares of a social ad)
     · Number of product views
     · Number of brochure downloads.

612
                                                                                               Online and display advertising

Remember, KPIs are going to differ based on your objectives. Always keep that in mind!

As we explored in Chapter 3: Market Research, it is essential to design with the user in
mind. Another way to measure the success of your campaign is to run a Brand Lift Study.
This is a valuable and meaningful strategy of getting user feedback on the look and feel of
your brand. Find out more about Brand Lift Studies here: support.google.com/google-ads/

 19.14 CASE STUDY: POST-IT AND PROXIMITY RUSSIA

   Proximity is a creative agency focused on digital and CRM. Post-it has
   helped people be more productive, communicate better and express
   themselves in a number of creative ways. Post-it is one of the most
   popular office products in the world.

  One-line summary

   Post-it and Proximity Russia came up with a banner ad campaign that people actually liked!

  The problem

   The major problem with banner ads was that users did not like them. They found display ads
   annoying and rarely actually engage with them. Retargeting banners were seen as even more
   invasive. Post-it wanted to create a retargeting banner that users actually wanted to see.

  The solution

   Post-it created a banner that users could use as Post-it notes. They would click on the
   banner, type a note to themselves, and then retargeting technology would show them
   their own Post-it notes instead of retargeting banners.

   This involved using the same technology other websites use for retargeting, as well as
   choosing placements for their ads on the most commonly used websites so that users
   would see their Post-it stickers wherever they visited.
   Clicking on a note brought users to a Post-it page where they could manage their stickers,
   create new ones, or delete all of them.

  The results

   Users engaged with this campaign happily. It received:

   · 47.6% active engagement
   · 152.40 seconds average interaction time
   · Considerable earned media reach, including users asking for the same campaign to

       be brought to other countries.

                                                                                                                                    613

       1. Why did users find this banner ad campaign so engaging?
       2. Which elements of best practice did Proximity Russia follow?
       3. How did understanding the audience play a role in this campaign?

    19.16 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       Offline advertising and marketing campaigns can be adapted for an online audience in order
       to ensure maximum brand exposure. It is very effective in enhancing offline marketing and
       advertising activity and in ensuring a wider reach.
       As mentioned, online advertising can be used as an acquisition channel, reaching out to a new
       audience. It can be used to initiate a buying cycle and customer relationship, which then play
       out across other online channels. Addressing advertising and other channels to complement
       each other will result in a consistent message and optimum results. Online advertising can be

used to reach a large audience, and then other digital marketing tactics can be used to refine
and engage this audience further. Social media advertising in particular is crucial for building
communities and keeping the brand top of mind.
Online advertising and affiliate marketing go hand in hand. Affiliate networks also act as
advertising networks, allowing for advertising to be purchased on a performance basis.
When seeding new products and viral campaigns, which are shared by many users on social
media, display advertising can be used to reach a wide audience at a low cost. It can expose a
campaign to many new users, and increase the chance that those who are most likely to pass
on a message receive it in the first place. Display advertising also supports other advertising
and marketing channels, such as search advertising and marketing.

19.17 SUMMARY

Online advertising has two main objectives:
· Branding
· Direct response, engagement, and sales.
The internet allows for highly targeted and highly trackable advertising across a variety of
online media. Some ways that advertisers can use the internet are:
· Banner ads
· Interstitial banners
· Pop-ups and pop-unders
· Floating ads
· Wallpaper ads
· Map ads.
Ad servers provide trafficking, tracking, and reporting solutions to both advertisers and publishers.
They allow advertisers to target display ads based on parameters, including:
· User profile (location, operating system, browser, connection type)
· Behaviour
· Fequency and sequencing
· Exclusivity
· Context of content.
Technology allows for increased levels of interaction within an ad, and for advertising tailored
to engagement media, such as online videos and social network applications.

                                                                                                                                    615

    19.18 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

       1. Online banner advertising and outdoor display advertising both use images to try to increase
           sales. In planning, both need to consider placement so as to be seen by their most likely
           audience. What are the key differences?

       2. Is display advertising an effective acquisition channel? Why or why not?
       3. Go to thetimes.co.uk and forbes.com. What advertising can you find on the front page of these

           two websites? What products are being advertised, and how are they being advertised?
           What can you deduce about the target market for these products?

    INTRODUCTION TO ANALYSING

       Analysing the outcomes of your marketing strategy and plan is as essential as initiating it. Not
       only does it provide you with an understanding of how your marketing efforts are performing,
       but it also presents you the opportunity to explore solutions based on the results that emerge
       from the analysis.
       The insights that you gain from your data and analyses take the guesswork out of the equation
       and provide an in-depth understanding of the results to help you make informed decisions
       that will take your business and marketing plans to the next level.
       In Chapter 20: Tracking and analysis we go into more detail on the best practice in tracking,
       analysing, and optimising your data for the best possible results. There is a considerable
       variety of digital media monitoring and measurement tools available online that offer free and
       paid-for services to help you measure how your content and platforms are performing. The
       chapter's focus is on how to capture web analytics data, how to present this data clearly, and
       most importantly, recommend methods to filter data and extract the information that will be
       most useful to you.
       Since every action that takes place online is recorded in one way or another, the combination
       of these recordings showcases behavioural patterns and trends that inform what is influencing
       the market. As business, brand, and marketing leaders, now more than ever, keeping an eye
       on the analytics will be crucial because of the rate that technology is evolving.
       Chapter 21: Conversion optimisation speaks to keeping your online marketing space fresh
       and up to date. Digital marketing tactics, tests fit for goal and purpose are presented, as well
       as user-centric approaches to entice your customers to convert.
       The technological evolution is persistent and is giving rise to major industry movements as
       well as how people interact with digital content, on platforms, and through connected devices.
       Chapter 22: Future of advertising gives you a comprehensive understanding of the role of
       technology and the significance of human behaviour amidst the shifting landscape. The future
       will be affected by the trends and behavioural changes we witness daily, which is what makes
       tracking and data analysis especially important today.
       Maintaining integrity and authenticity while connecting with your audience will become even
       more important in a privacy-first era. Be prepared to shed your skin often, and rise to the
       challenge of adapting quickly.

     20.1 INTRODUCTION

     Picture the scene: You've opened up a new fashion retail outlet in the trendiest shopping centre
     in town. You've spent a small fortune on advertising and branding. You've gone to great lengths
     to ensure that you're stocking all of the prestigious brands. Come opening day, your store is
     inundated with visitors and potential customers.

     And yet, you are hardly making any sales. Could it be because you have one cashier for every
     hundred customers? Or because the smell of your freshly painted walls chases customers
     away before they complete a purchase? While it can be difficult to isolate and track the factors
     affecting your revenue in this fictional store, move it online and you have a wealth of resources
     available to assist you with tracking, analysing, and optimising your performance.

     To a marketer, the internet offers more than just

     new avenues of creativity. By its very nature, it  NOTE  Remember, analytics data can be found

     campaign; it can show you very quickly what's

     not working. It all comes down to knowing where to look, what to look for, and what to do with

     the information you find.

     At the beginning of this book, you learned how important it is for a business to direct its actions
     through carefully designed strategy and planning. There are two factors that not only inform
     key business decisions for strategy, but also provides the needed evidence and support to
     substantiate them. These are data-driven insights and customer/client focus.

     Throughout the chapters, you have also learned about a few of the forms and sources of data,
     each highlighting the elements that you should track to measure the success of a particular
     area of digital marketing. Now you're going to learn more specifics about data analytics and
     how to analyse the data you've gathered.

    20.3 WORKING WITH DATA

       In the days of traditional media, actionable data was a highly desired but scarce commodity.
       While it was possible to broadly understand consumer responses to marketing messages, it
       was often hard to pinpoint exactly what was happening, and why.

       In the digital age, information is absolutely everywhere. Every single action taken online is
       recorded, which means there is an incredible wealth of data available to marketers to help
       them understand when, where, how, and even why users react to their marketing campaigns.

       This also means there is a responsibility on marketers to make data-driven decisions that
       inform tactics and plans. Assumptions and gut feel are not enough; you need to back these
       up with solid facts and clear results.

       Don't worry if you're not a `numbers' person because working with data is very little about
       number crunching (the technology usually takes care of this for you) and a lot about analysing,
       experimenting, testing, and questioning. All you need is a curious mind and an understanding
       of the key principles and tools. Data concepts that you should be aware of include performance
       monitoring trends, big data, and data mining. Let's look at each of these:

     20.3.1 Performance monitoring and trends

       Data analytics are all about monitoring user behaviour and marketing campaign performance
       over time. The last part is crucial. There is little value in looking at a single point of data. You
       need to look at trends and changes over a set period to encourage a dynamic view of data.

624
                                                    Tracking and analysis

For example, it is not that helpful to say that 10% of this month's web traffic converted. Is that
good or bad, high or low? But saying that 10% more users converted this month than last
month shows a positive change or trend. While it can be tempting to focus on single `hero'
numbers and exciting-looking figures, such as `Look, we have 5000 Facebook fans!', these
really don't give a full picture if they are not presented in context. In fact, we call these `vanity
metrics' because they look good, but they don't really tell you much.

Monitoring performance and trends will help   NOTE  Pay close attention to any changes in
you determine the next steps to improve your        the expected data, good or bad, and
impact in the market, customer engagement,          investigate any anomalies.
and increased sales by generating new leads.

20.3.2 Big data

`Big data' is the term used to describe truly vast data sets, the ones that are so big and unwieldy
that they require specialised software and massive computers to process. Companies like
Google, Facebook, and YouTube generate and collect so much data every day that they have
entire warehouses full of hard drives to store it all.

Understanding how it works and how to think about data on this scale provides some valuable
lessons for all analysts. Here are three:

1. Measure trends, not absolute figures: The more data you have, the more meaningful it
    is to look at how things change over time.

2. Focus on patterns: With enough data, patterns over time should become apparent so
    consider looking at weekly, monthly, or even seasonal flows.

3. Investigate anomalies: If your expected pattern suddenly changes, try to find out why and
    use this information to inform your actions going forward.

20.3.3 Data mining

Data mining is the process of finding patterns hidden in large numbers and databases. Rather
than having a human analyst process the information, an automated computer programme
pulls apart the data and matches it to known patterns to deliver insights. This can often reveal
surprising and unexpected results, and tends to break assumptions.

Data mining in action

Krux (2016) offers the example of examining an enormous dataset for an automotive brand
that wanted to improve brochure downloads and increase requests for test drives. The
data they analysed related to consumers, consumer attributes, and marketing touchpoints.

To determine a pattern, they had to explore 47 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (fortyseven
sextillion) combinations of factors; too many to evaluate without using machines.

                                                                                                       625
            ANALYSI NG

           These combinations came from 35 touchpoints, including the website, campaigns, and other
           marketing channels, and 37 analytics points, including auto buyers and smartphone users.
           The brand was able to spot relevant patterns, (e.g., consumers who bought a certain brand
           of car were more likely to download brochures, but not more likely to request test drives).
           This allowed them to segment the consumers who bought cars into those who started
           the purchase process by downloading a brochure and those who started with a test drive.
           The first group was detail-oriented, so ads featuring specific models with links to the
           specifications page helped to drive conversions.
           The second group wanted to know how driving the car felt; they were targeted with ads
           that appealed to their senses, and included a call to action about scheduling a test drive.
           This helped to drive media efficiency and campaign performance.

    20.4 TRACKING AND COLLECTING DATA

       Data tracking is the process of selecting specific metrics and events to track, then collecting,
       organising, and analysing the resulting data. Once you've analysed the data, you can apply
       your insights to improve business performance and customer experience (Baker, 2021).
       A key problem with tracking users on websites used to be that it was impossible to track
       individual users - only individual browsers, or devices - since this was done through cookies.
       If, for example, Levi visits the website from Chrome on his home computer and Safari on his
       work laptop, the website will think he's two different users. If Nosipho visits the site from the
       home computer, also using Chrome, the website will think she's the same user as Levi, because
       the cookie set when Levi visited the site will still be there.

           Email opens aren't tracked with cookies. Instead, when the images in the email load,
           a tiny 1×1 pixel also loads and tracks open rate. This means that if the user is blocking
           images, their activity will not be tracked.
           To track if those who did open your email then visited your page, or eventually converted,
           links within the email also include UTM tags. UTM tags are codes in the URL that enable
           your analytics software to track where a user has come from.
           In this link: https://www.redandyellow.co.za/5-ways-design-can-used-empower-women/
           ?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=AugNewsletter.
           The campaign tracking tag appended on the end of the URL is: ?utm_source=newsletter&
           utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=AugNewsletter.

626
                                                                                                           Tracking and analysis

With growing consumer privacy concerns, evidenced in laws like the EU Privacy Directive
(1995) and the Protection of Personal Information Act (PoPIA, 2021) which requires websites to
disclose their cookie usage, cookies started to fall out of favour, making tracking more difficult.
Google's Universal Analytics changed all of that when it was introduced in 2012. Now, about
a decade later, Google will be replacing Universal Analytics with Google Analytics 4 by mid
2023. Because of its dominance in the search engine market, we will focus on how Google
will affect tracking and measurement using these models.

20.4.1 Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4

When it was introduced, Universal Analytics set the standard for how user data was collected
and organised. It was designed to offer new tracking codes for websites and features to measure
user behaviour more accurately. This however, will be phased out by 1 July 2023, and Google
Analytics 4 will replace the measurement model.

The difference between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4
According to Boon (2021), the key differences between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4
(GA4) are as follows:
Different measuring models
Universal Analytics uses a measurement model based on sessions and pageviews. A session
is a group of user interactions (hits) with a website that takes place over a given timeframe. A
session can contain multiple pageviews, events, and ecommerce transactions.
GA4 uses a measurement model based on events and parameters. The principle here is that
any interaction can be captured as an event. As a result, all Universal Analytics hit types
translate to events in GA4.
Removal of monthly hit limits
Another significant difference between Universal Analytics and GA4 is the removal of monthly
hit limits. The free version of Universal Analytics had a monthly limit of 10 million hits, which no
longer exists. Instead, GA4 has a limit on the number of different events that can be captured
(500). There is, at the time of writing, no limit as to the volume of hits that can be collected. This
has resulted in a number of clients already opting for a GA4-first approach to their analytics.
Free connection to BigQuery
The final difference is GA4's free connection to BigQuery. Previously this feature was only
available to GA360 customers, one of the big differentiators between the free and paid versions
of GA. BigQuery enables very large and complex data sets to be queried very quickly and takes
the data out of GA that gives you the ability to interrogate it without the issue of sampling.

                                                                                                                                    627
     ANALYSI NG

     How does Google Analytics 4 work?

     Google Analytics 4 is a set of Google Analytics reports and data for your website and/or app.
     Google calls this a `property.' GA4 has the following capabilities:

     · Collects both website and app data to better understand the customer journey
     · Uses events instead of session-based data
     · Includes privacy controls, such as cookieless measurement and conversion modeling
     · Offers guidance without complex models through predictive capabilities
     · Integrates directly to media platforms to drive actions (Google Analytics 4, n.d.).

     How to set up Google Analytics 4                  NOTE  What kind of privacy concerns might

Google Analytics 4 tags

Tags allow you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments -
collectively known as tags - on your website or mobile app. Google Analytics 4 makes use of
two tag types, instead of the one used by Universal Analytics. This is how Google explains it:

"The GA4 Configuration tag initialises Google Analytics for your Google Analytics 4 property
on a particular page. It handles behaviour such as setting of Google Analytics cookies, sending
automatic and enhanced measurement events, and declaring common settings. The Config-
uration tag should be fired on every page where you want to collect data for a Google Analytics 4
property, and should be triggered to fire as soon as possible, before any other Google Analytics 4
event tags. You can configure Fields to Set in the GA4 Configuration tag to set parameters
that need to remain consistent across all events on a page. GA4 Event tags inherit the parameters
of the GA4 Configuration tag. Parameters set by the GA4 Configuration tag remain static for
all events occurring on a page. The parameters are refreshed only when the Configuration tag
fires again, typically the next time the page is loaded.

The Google Analytics 4 Event tag lets you            NOTE  You can find out more about tags by

triggers and the sequencing will be automat-
ically guaranteed."

20.4.2. Gathering data

Google Analytics can measure almost anything about the customers who visit your website. To
gather the kind of data that can help you optimise your site, you'll need to know where to look.

       how users enter the conversion funnel and what happens once they are in the funnel. You
       can use Realtime to monitor changes to your traffic. It can help you answer these questions:
       1. Is the one-day promotion driving traffic?
       2. Have there been immediate effects as a result of a social network post?
       3. Is my new content affecting traffic?
       4. Is my tracking code working properly?

new and returning users and the method of

acquisition. It shows you which sources drive the most traffic to your site. By default, it contains:

· Acquisition overview which summarises your data to help you understand where your
    traffic comes from.

· User acquisition which provides data on where new users come from. In this report, the
    prefix `First user' means the data is about new users.

· Traffic acquisition shows you where new sessions come from. In this report, the suffix
    `Session' tells you that the data is about new sessions.

· Google Ads campaigns gives you information about which campaigns drove traffic to your
    app or website. Your Google Ads account must be linked for this to work.

To populate these reports with the necessary data, integrate with an ads platform, and use
the available auto-tagging.

Explorations

The second button on the navigation panel is Explorations. This is a set of advanced techniques
that go further than standard reports to help you find out more about your customers' behaviour.
Under Explorations, you can access data and analytical techniques that you can't find in reports.

An exploration consists of three sections. The large area on the right that shows your data
using the selected technique, is called the canvas. It can have multiple tabs, which allows you
to use multiple techniques in a single exploration. The default technique for a blank exploration
is the free-form table. Let's look at the techniques on offer:

· Free-form exploration sets out your data in a crosstab layout. You can use different visual-
    isations, such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, and geo maps.

· Cohort exploration gathers data about the behaviour of users that share common attributes.
· Funnel exploration visualises the user's steps necessary to complete a task on your site or

    app so that you can see how to optimise user experience.
· Segment overlap exploration shows how different user segments relate to each other. It

    can be used to identify new segments with complex criteria.
· User exploration looks at the users that make up segments. Using this, you can find extra

    information on individual user behaviour and activities.
· User lifetime exploration compiles user behaviour over their lifetime as a customer.

since they both provide insights that can lead        py=%2Cin-this-article.
to action. Usually, the data will be the same in
both Reports and Explorations, but sometimes
they are different. Typically when they differ,
Explorations tend to be more accurate. That
happens for the following reasons:

1. Support different fields: These two parts of GA4 give you different views, at different levels
    of granularity. The same dimensions and metrics may not be supported in both.

2. Segments and comparisons differences: Comparisons from Reports are converted to
    segments in Explorations and any of those that are not supported, will be dropped.

3. Date differences: If you create a report with a date range outside your settings, all other
    data outside of that will be eliminated.

4. Amount of data: If a property is collecting a lot of data, Analytics can use different meth-
    odologies between the two which can cause inconsistencies.

5. Processing time differences: Since data comes from multiple different systems, you may
    notice differences over 48 hours.

      Advertising

       The third button on the navigation panel is Advertising. These reports look slightly different to
       the others. Currently, there are three types of reports you can access:

       1. Advertising snapshot which summarises the business metrics.
       2. Model comparison which compares how different attribution models impact the value of

            marketing channels.
       3. Conversion paths which show the paths customers take to conversion, as well as how

            different attribution models can credit those paths.
636
                                                                     Tracking and analysis

These reports can help you answer important questions, such as specifying which ads had a
role in conversion. In addition, it can help you identify the paths customers take to conversion,
showing you how much time passed between a customer's first interest and conversion.

   "Attribution is the act of assigning credit for conversions to different ads, clicks, and
   factors along a user's path to completing a conversion. An attribution model can be a
   rule, a set of rules, or a data-driven algorithm that determines how credit for conversions
   is assigned to touchpoints on conversion paths." Read more here: support.google.com/
   analytics/answer/10607798?hl=en&ref_topic=10604827#zippy=%2Cin-this-article.

Configuration

The last button on the navigation panel is Configuration. From this panel, you can access:

· Events to create or modify website and app events: All data in GA4 reports come from
    events triggered by users when they interact with your site or app.

· Conversions events to measure the most important events: Set up the most important
    events for your business as conversion events.

· Audiences to create, edit, and archive audiences: This allows you to segment your users
    based on parameters that are important to your business.

20.4.3. The type of information captured

By now, you know the difference between objectives, goals, KPIs, and targets. You will be
focussing on KPIs when you measure data that has been captured.

KPIs are the metrics that help you understand how well you are meeting your objectives.
A metric is a defined unit of measurement. Definitions can vary between various analytics
vendors, depending on their approach to gathering data.

Analytics metrics are divided into:

· Counts: These are the raw figures that will be used for analysis.
· Ratios: These are interpretations of the data that is counted.

Metrics can be applied to three different groupings:

1. Aggregate: All traffic to the website for a     NOTE  One can easily be overwhelmed by data.
    defined period.                                      Read this overview of the metrics that
                                                         can help you to understand your users,
2. Segmented: A subset of all traffic according          and help you to elevate your business:
    to a specific filter, such as by campaign            measureschool.com/ga4-metrics/.
    (PPC) or visitor type (new user vs. returning
    user).

3. Individual: The activity of a single visitor
    for a defined period.

                                                                                                   637
            ANALYSI NG

      Basic metrics

       To establish whether your campaigns are working, you need to look at some basic metrics, such as:

       · Overall web traffic: The number of users that visit a website.
       · Sessions and average session duration: The visitor count in 30-minute increments and

            how much time each visitor spends on your website.
       · New vs. returning users: Users visiting your website for the first time show natural traffic

            is taking place, and users coming back to your website show the content is useful to them.
       · Page views and most visited pages: The number of times a page was successfully

            requested, and which pages were visited the most.
       · Exit rates and bounce rates: The last page of a visit and the single page view visits,

            divided by the entry pages.
       · Conversion rates: Metrics that provide insight into whether you are achieving your analytics

            goals (and through those, your overall website objectives).
       · Impressions: The number of people who viewed your advertisement or content. Each view

            counts as a new impression.
       · Social reach: The number of people who viewed your advertisement or content. Reach

            is only counted once.
       · Social engagement: The number of people that interacted with the content through clicks,

            likes, shares, comments, etc.
       · Click-through rates: The number of times a link was clicked, divided by the number of

            times it was seen (impressions).

       For mobile data, you can add these metrics:

       · Device category: Whether the visit came from a desktop, mobile, or tablet.
       · Mobile device info: The specific brand and make of the mobile device.
       · Mobile input selector: The main input method for the device (such as touchscreen, click

            wheel, or stylus)
       · Operating system: The OS that the device runs (some popular ones include iOS and

            Android).

    20.5 ANALYSING DATA

       To test the success of your website, you need to remember the TAO of conversion optimisation:

       Track - Analyse - Optimise

       A number is just a number until you can interpret it. Typically, you will not be looking at the raw
       figures, but what they tell you about how your users are interacting with your website. Because
       your web analytics package will never be able to provide you with 100% accurate results, you
       need to analyse trends and changes over time to truly understand your brand's performance.

Kaushik (2010) recommends a three-pronged approach to analytics:

    the website?

· Analysing behaviour data infers the intent of
    a website's visitors. Why are users visiting?

· Analysing outcome metrics shows how many users performed the goal actions. Are visitors
    completing the goals we want them to?

20.5.1 Acquisition

Steps in the acquisition process include how you generate traffic to your website, either through
campaigns or SEO.

A good analysis of acquisition will tell you where you spend the most money and time acquiring
traffic. You can use this to lower costs through eliminating the segments where you are not gaining
traffic and increase revenue through investing in the segments where you are gaining traffic.

20.5.2 Behaviour

Behaviour can indicate a lot about a user's intent. By studying data you can infer which problems
visitors are expecting your website or app to solve:

Some methods to gauge the intent of your visitors include:

· Click density analysis: Looking at a heatmap to see where users are clicking on the site
    and if there are any noteworthy `clumps' of clicks. For instance, many users clicking on a
    page element that is not actually a button or link.

· Segmentation: Selecting a smaller group of visitors to analyse, based on a shared char-
    acteristic. This lets you see if particular types of visitors behave differently.

· Behaviour and content metrics: Analysing data around user behaviours (e.g., time spent
    on site or the number of pages viewed), can give a lot of insight into how engaging and
    valuable your website is. Looking at content metrics will show you which pages are the most
    popular as well as which ones users leave most often, providing excellent insight for your
    content marketing strategy, as well as indicating what your audience is really interested in.

20.5.3 Outcomes

Ultimately, you want users who visit your website to perform an action that increases your
revenue. Analysing goals and KPIs indicates where there is room for improvement. Look at
user intent to establish if your website meets users' goals, and if these match with the website
goals. Look at user experience to determine how outcomes can be influenced.

                                                                                                     639

20.5.4 Problems in the conversion process

Funnel analysis is crucial to understanding where problems in a conversion process lie. In
this way, it helps you to track whether your website or app is achieving its ultimate goal. The
process of achieving that goal can be broken down into several steps. These are called events
or micro-conversions. Analysing each event is called a funnel analysis or path analysis.

For example, on a hotel booking website, the ultimate goal is that visitors to the site make a
booking on the website with a credit card.

Each step in the process is an event that can be analysed as a conversion point:

Event 1: Perform a search for available dates for hotels in the desired area.

Event 2: Check prices and amenities for available hotels.

Event 3: Select a hotel and go to checkout.

Event 4: Enter personal and payment details and confirm booking (conversion).

One naturally expects fewer users at each step. Increasing the number of visitors who progress
from one step to the next will go a long way towards improving the overall conversion rate of
the site.

If your objective is to increase revenue, you could look at ways of increasing your conversion
rate - in other words, the number of visitors who purchase something on your site. One way of
increasing your conversion rate could be to offer a discount. This means that you would have
more sales, but probably a lower average order value. Or, you could look at ways of increasing
the average order value so that the conversion rate would stay the same. In turn, you would
increase the revenue from each conversion.

   Here are some examples of possible objectives, goals and KPIs for different websites:

   Hospitality ecommerce sites, such as expedia.com:

        Objective: Increase bookings
        Objective: Decrease marketing expenses
        Goal: Make a reservation online
        KPIs: Conversion rate, cost per visitor, average order value.

   News and content sites, such as news24.com:

        Objective: Increase readership and level of interest
        Objective: Increase time visitors spend on website
        Goal: A minimum time on site
        KPIs: Length of visit, average time spent on website, percentage of returning visitors.

KPIs help you to look at the factors you can influence in the conversion process. If your objective
is to increase revenue, you could look at ways of increasing your conversion rate - in other
words, the number of visitors who purchase something on your site. One way of increasing
your conversion rate could be to offer a discount. This means that you would have more sales,
but probably a lower average order value.

Once you have established your objectives, goals, and KPIs, you need to track the data that
will help you to analyse how you are performing. This information will indicate how you can
optimise your website or campaign.

20.5.5 Segmentation

Every visitor to a website is different, but there are some ways in which we can characterise
groups of users and analyse metrics for each group. This is called segmentation.

Some segments include:

Referral source

Users who arrive at your site via search engines are all likely to behave differently (e.g., those
who type in the URL directly, those who come from a link in an online news article). In addition
to conversion rates, click path and exit pages are important metrics for you to consider. Review
the page where visitors enter your website - can anything be done to improve their experience?

                                                                                                                                    641

                                   Figure 20.15 Default segments in Google Analytics

      Landing pages

       Users who enter your website from different pages can behave differently. What can you do
       to affect the page on which they are landing? Or, what elements of the landing page can you
       change to positively influence outcomes?

      Connection speed, operating system, browser

       Consider the effects of technology on the behaviour of your users. A high bounce rate for
       low-bandwidth users, for example, could indicate that your site is taking too long to load.
       Visitors who use open-source technology may expect different things from your website
       compared to other visitors. Different browsers may show your website differently. How does
       this affect these visitors?

      Geographical location

       Do users from different countries, provinces, or towns behave differently on your website? How

      First-time visitors

       How is the click path of a first-time visitor different from that of a person who returns? What
       parts of the website are most important to first-time visitors? Is it worth it to have new visitors
       go through the trouble of loading a new page to help them learn about how to use your main
       site? Remember that information about regular visitors can be very helpful in designing your
       site for newcomers (Landefeld, n.d.).

       Software, such as crazyegg.com can show you exactly where users click on a web page,
       regardless of whether they are clicking on links or not.

It produces information that helps you to discover which areas of a website are clickable, which
attract fewer or no clicks, and which areas are not clickable but have users attempting to click
there. This can show you what visual clues on your web page influence where your visitors
click, which in turn can be used to optimise your visitors' click path.

There are many factors that may be preventing your visitors from achieving specific end
goals. This could range from the tone of the web copy to the colour of the page; anything on
your website may affect conversions. Possible factors are often so glaringly obvious that one
tends to miss them, or so small that they are dismissed as trivial. Changing one thing on your
website may result in unforeseen consequences. For this reason, it's important that you avoid
jumping to the wrong conclusions.

Hotjar, another popular analytics tool, demonstrates how heatmaps can help you improve your
web page. You can find more information here: hotjar.com/heatmaps.

20.6 DATA VISUALISATION

Reporting on data and making sure that the information gets to the right users, in the right
way is important. Not everyone is adept at understanding a detailed financial breakdown, and
analytics reports often intimidate people, which is why it is important to present information
in a way that's accessible to everyone.

Data visualisation involves placing data in a       NOTE  Many online data visualisations are

what to compare.

In the age of Big Data, data visualisation is crucial in making sense of the information generated
every day. Good visualisation `tells a story' by removing the `noise' and `highlighting the useful
information' (Tableau n.d.). Effective data visualisation is a delicate balancing act between
form and function. The better you can convey your point visually, the better you can leverage
that information.

20.7 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

The first thing you need is a web analytics tool to gather data. Some are free and some need
to be paid for. You will need to determine which package best suits your needs. Bear in mind
that if you switch vendors, you may lose historical data.
Below are some of the leading providers:
· Google Analytics: support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en
· AWStats: awstats.sourceforge.io
· Hotjar: hotjar.com
· GoSquared: gosquared.com
· Neil Patel Inc: neilpatel.com
· Clicky: clicky.com.
When it comes to running split tests, if you don't have the technical capacity to run these
in-house, there are third-party services that can host them for you. Google Optimize is one
platform for running tests and assessing your website's performance.
To test the significance of basic split tests, view a split-test calculator on drpete.co/
split-test-calculator.
When you use cookie-based tracking, you need to add code tags to your web pages that need
to be maintained, updated, and occasionally changed. Google Tag Manager (marketingplat-
form.google.com/about/tag-manager/) makes it easy to add and work with tags without the
need for any coding knowledge. Other professional tag management tools include Ensighten
(ensighten.com) and Tealium (tealium.com).

    20.8 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES

       Tracking, analysing, and optimising is vital to the success of all marketing efforts. Digital
       marketing enables easy, fast tracking and the ability to optimise frequently. When you use real
       data to make decisions, you're likely to make the best choices for your business and digital
       channels (e.g., websites).
       However, it can be easy to become fixated on figures and metrics, instead of looking at broader
       trends and using them to optimise campaigns. Generally, macro or global metrics must be
       considered before analysing the micro elements of a website.
       Testing variables is vital to success. Results always need to be statistically analysed, and
       marketers should let these numbers support the decisions. Avoid assumptions about the
       outcome. Instead, wait for the numbers to inform you. The next chapter covers this in much
       more detail.

      20.9 CASE STUDY: EFINANCIAL CAREERS

           Netflix is a US subscription streaming service and production company.

       One-line summary

           Netflix leveraged its user data in a variety of ways and took a digital-first approach to
           customer loyalty by improving its content recommendation engine, developing original
           content, and increasing customer retention rate.

                                                                                                       Tracking and analysis

The problem

With so much data to leverage, Netflix had wide-ranging goals for the company's marketing
analytics. However, all of the organisation's goals contributed to the company's larger
business objectives to focus on customer retention.

Netflix aimed to go beyond basic user demographics to understand what customers
want from a streaming platform, and what was likely to convince them to stay. With this
knowledge, Netflix believed it could create better products, and services for happier
customers.

The company acknowledged that access issues, service outages, and platform flaws could
all lead to unhappy customers and negative sentiment, which could cause customers to
seek out an alternative solution.

By identifying problems early through marketing analytics, Netflix worked towards
improving and continued to innovate.

The solution

To work towards its customer retention objective, Netflix collected data from virtually
every interaction with its 150+ million subscribers. The company then used marketing
analytics tools to process this native data and evaluate everything from how customers
navigate the platform to what they watch.

By creating such detailed customer profiles, Netflix was able to make much more per-
sonalised recommendations for each user. The more data the company collected, the
more it could tailor its algorithm to suggest the ideal content to each individual viewer.

To better understand the platform's users, Netflix collected such data as:

· The devices viewers used to stream content
· Day of week and time of day when users viewed content
· Number of serial episodes viewers watched in a row
· Whether viewers paused and resumed content
· Number and type of searches users performed.
Netflix also welcomed user feedback on content. The company incorporated these content
ratings into their analysis to better understand viewer preferences.

The results

According to the streaming platform, the Netflix algorithm was responsible for about 80%
of viewer activity. The company successfully collected relevant data and used marketing
analytics to generate recommendations that encourage viewers to continue watching
and subscribing.

                                                                                                                                 649
            ANALYSI NG

           The revenue metrics suggested that Netflix's focus on marketing analytics was hugely
           beneficial to the company. The company estimated that its algorithm generated $1 billion
           in value every year, largely due to customer retention.

           In recent years, Netflix's customer retention rate far surpassed competitors like Hulu and
           Amazon Prime. Netflix had an impressive 90% retention rate, meaning the vast majority
           of viewers continued to subscribe to the service month after month. In contrast, Amazon
           Prime's retention rate was 75%, and Hulu's was 64%.

           For Netflix, customer retention meant more than happy viewers. It also meant more data,
           a continually improving algorithm, and substantial business growth.

           Netflix emerged as the world's most highly valued company, with a total valuation of over
           $160 billion. Netflix could continue to increase this valuation by leveraging its data and
           producing original media and by recommending the ideal content to viewers every time
           they access the streaming platform.

                                                                                                                                      (Source: Sonnenberg, 2022)

    20.10 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. What was Netflix's primary objective in this study?
       2. Describe what analytics data was gathered and why they choose to focus on this data.
       3. How did Netflix achieve its retention and subscription rates using data analytics?

    20.11 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       Tracking, analysing, and optimising are fundamental to any digital marketing activity, and it is
       possible to track almost every detail of any online campaign.

       Most analytics packages can be used across all digital marketing activities, allowing for an
       integrated approach to determining the success of campaigns. While it is important to analyse
       each campaign on its own merits, the internet allows for a holistic approach to these activities.
       The savvy marketer will be able to see how campaigns affect and enhance each other.

       The data gathered and analysed can provide insights into the following fields, among others:

       · SEO: What keywords are users using to search for your site, and how do they behave
            once they find it?

       · Email: When is the best time to send an email newsletter? Are users clicking on the links
            in the newsletter and converting on your website?

       · Paid media: How successful are your paid advertising campaigns? How does paid traffic
            compare to organic search traffic?

       · Social media: Is social media driving traffic to the website? How do fans of the brand
            behave compared to those who do not engage socially?

· Mobile: How much of your traffic comes from mobile devices? Is it worth optimising your
    site for these? (It usually is.)

20.12 SUMMARY

The ability to track user behaviour on the internet allows you to analyse almost every level of a
digital campaign, which should lead to improved results over time. The foundation of successful
web analytics is to determine campaign and business objectives upfront and to use these to
choose goals and KPIs grounded in solid targets.

Data can be analysed to discover how users behave, whether outcomes have been achieved,
and how appealing the user experience is. Testing to optimise user experience can demonstrate
ways in which to influence user behaviour so that more successful outcomes can be achieved.
Segmenting the audience allows specific groups of users to be analysed.

CONVERSION OPTIMISATION

In this chapter, you will learn:

· Which digital marketing tactics you can test and improve
· How to pick the right test for your goals and purpose
· How to perform conversion optimisation step-by-step to improve the effectiveness of your

    online marketing efforts.
                                                                                                                                    653

     21.1 INTRODUCTION

     Let's look at a real-world example to help explain what conversion optimisation is. Think of a
     shoe store. When laying out the store, a lot of care is taken to determine where to place displays,
     mirrors, chairs, and the checkout counters. However, there is no way of easily determining if
     the current layout is the best option.

     For example, the checkout counter may be at the front of the store. It may, however, be worth
     testing to see if moving it to the middle of the store affects sales. This would require tracking
     sales over a period of time with the checkout counters in the front of the store, then shutting
     down for a few days while the store is reorganised, and tracking sales with the new layout.
     But this is all a little impractical.

     In contrast, if you have an online store, you can just show slightly or very different versions of
     web pages to visitors and track how different versions affect sales. You would not need to shut
     down your website to create new versions, and you can watch results emerge in real time as
     hundreds of customers pass through the store. The cycle of tweaking and testing websites
     in this way is called conversion optimisation. This chapter will take you through the steps in
     a conversion optimisation process, helping you understand how to make things work better.

21.3 WHAT CAN YOU TEST?

The short answer: everything! However, there are some good tactics to start testing.

21.3.1 Email marketing

The most obvious place to start testing your email marketing is with subject lines. A simple
split test will help you to determine which version of a subject line improves open rate. Within
an email, you can test your call to action copy to see how you can improve clickthrough rates.
Email is also a good medium to test different kinds of offers to see how they influence sales.
These can be combined with testing different types of content: long copy versus short copy,
or image versus video.

You can also test delivery days and times for your email, either with a split test or by testing
your whole group at different times of the year.

21.3.2 Display and search advertising

There are many different conversion points you may want to test with advertising. You can
test to see how different adverts may improve clickthrough rates, or you can test to see how
different adverts affect the conversion rate of the traffic coming to your website.

Different calls to action in the adverts can be tested, as well as different headlines. When it
comes to display advertising, completely different versions of banner adverts can be tested.

                                                                                                                                    655

Most Ad Servers, including Sizmek Ad Suite and Google's AdWords, have built-in testing. This
means that no additional code is required in order to run tests. In most cases, the Ad Server
will also serve adverts based on the results of the test, so that the better-performing advert
is given preference over time.

21.3.3 Social media

If you are broadcasting or distributing          NOTE  Read about social media analytical tools
messages via social media, you should test             for marketers here: sproutsocial.com/
your messages to see which perform better.             insights/social-media-analytics-tools/.
Usually, you will be testing to see how you can

increase engagement, whether that's replying

to messages, liking Facebook posts, retweeting posts shared on Twitter, or clicking through

on links shared.

Types of messages can be tested to see which messages increase interactions. Some options
to try are direct questions, shared links, overt requests to take an action, or other messages to
generate engagement. Types of media (e.g., images vs. videos) can also be tested alongside
other metrics (e.g., time of day, day of the week) to see how these affect interactions.

                            posts make the biggest impact on your followers

It can be trickier to test social media messages scientifically, as the environment is difficult, if
not impossible to control due to constantly evolving algorithms.

21.3.4 Landing pages

The landing page is the first page a visitor sees on a website. In some web analytics packages, it
is referred to as an entrance page. Any page of your website could be a landing page, especially
if users are coming to your website via search engines.
However, when you are running online campaigns that utilise tactics like email marketing or
online advertising, you often send visitors to a specific landing page. Because you choose the
page that visitors see first, you have an opportunity to craft a page that converts. There are
many things you can test on landing pages, for example:
· Heading: Different headings can make your visitors behave differently.
· Copy: Style, tone, layout, and length of copy can all be tested, as well as things like font size.
· Call to action: Various calls to action could increase actions.
· Colour: Test the colours of buttons, green and red are two common choices to try.
· Images: Different images can have an impact on conversions.
· Offer: You can test different types of offers on a landing page or word the same offer

    differently.

21.3.5 eCommerce

There are many things you can test on ecommerce websites, but the most obvious are to test
your product pages and your checkout process. With ecommerce, you are usually testing
to increase your conversion rate (when more consumers buy from you) or your basket size

                                                                                                                                    657
     ANALYSI NG

     (when consumers buy more from you). As your testing becomes more sophisticated, you will
     hopefully be achieving both.

     On product pages, you should be testing to see how you might encourage users to start the
     purchasing process. Here are a few things to test:

     · Images: Images of different sizes, or entirely different image content, could make a big
         difference.

     · Call to action: Seeing the words 'Add to cart' or `Buy now' may affect shopper behaviour.
     · Shipping information: Test to see whether displaying shipping costs before actual checkout

         affects the volume of customers starting the checkout process, as well as its effect on
         completing the purchase.
     · Credibility information: Do `Secure shopping' badges affect conversion rate?

     Product pages are also a good place to test how you might increase basket size. You can test
     displaying complementary or similar products. If you spend time on Amazon, you'll see that
     they display items that other customers bought together, suggesting you should do the same.

     The checkout process is incredibly important to test. Often, an online purchase takes place
     over several screens or steps. Instead of looking at the overall conversion rate, you should be
     looking at the conversion rate between steps. This is referred to as funnel analysis.

     If possible, you should test a single-page checkout versus the multi-page approach. Also test
     credibility and reassurance statements and how these affect the checkout process. Even font
     size can have an effect on conversions.

     The above should give you an idea of where you can start with your conversion optimisation,
     but it is by no means an exhaustive list.

     21.4 DESIGNING TESTS

     To design tests successfully, you need to know what you can test, how you can test, and
     what sort of time periods you are looking at for testing. If it's your first time doing conversion
     optimisation, you should start with simple and quick tests to get a feel for the process before
     embarking on more complicated tests.

     21.4.1 Types of tests                               NOTE  The Facebook split test feature allows
                                                               you to test different audiences against

A/B tests

An A/B test is one in which each version being tested is different from all the others. A/B
tests always involve just two versions of what is being tested: the original and an alternative.

                  50% see    50% see
                  Version A  Version B

Version A                                Version B

                                 Figure 21.4 A/B testing explained visually

A/B tests are ideal for an initial foray into conversion optimisation, as they can be easy to set
up. If you are running just one alternate and the original, it can also mean that you get a quicker
result. When conducting A/B testing, you should only change one element at a time so that
you can easily isolate what impact each factor has on your conversion rate.

We can also run multivariate tests, sometimes referred to as MVTs. Here, a number of elements
on a page are tested to determine which combination gives the best results. For example, we may
test alternative headlines, alternative copy, and alternative call to action buttons. Two versions
of three elements mean that we are testing eight combinations! Here is a simple formula to
calculate the total number of versions in a multivariate test: [No. of variations of element A] ×
[No. of variations of element B] × [No. of variations of element C] ... = [Total no. of variations]

Multivariate testing helps avoid the need to conduct several sequential A/B tests and easily
determines the contribution of each page element to the measured gains.

                                                                                                                                    659
            ANALYSI NG

                           Figure 21.5 Multivariate testing combines a variety of elements
       Multivariate tests can be more complicated to set up, but allow you to test more elements at
       once. Multivariate tests are ideal when you have large traffic volumes. If traffic volumes are
       not very high, it can take a very long time to reach a statistically significant result, especially
       if there are many combinations being tested.

     21.4.2 Length of tests and sample size

       Several factors determine which tests you can run. Relatively simple calculations help you to
       determine how long a test is likely to take, which is based on the number of participants, as
       well as the improvement in conversion rate. We've included some sample size calculators in
       Section 21.6: Tools of the trade in this chapter.

      Number of participants

       The number of participants in the test is determined by how many users actually see the page
       being tested, as well as what percentage of your potential customers you want to include in
       your test.
       The number of users who see the page being tested may not be the same as the number of
       visitors to your website. You'll need to use your data analytics to determine the number of users
660
                                                   Conversion optimisation

viewing that specific page. Of course, if you are running advertising campaigns to direct traffic
to the page being tested, you can always spend a bit more money to increase the number of
users coming to that page.

You also want to determine what percentage of users will be involved in the test. In a simple
A/B test, if you include 100% of your visitors in the test, 50% will see version A and 50% will
see version B. If you include only 50% of your visitors in the test, this means that 25% of your
overall visitors will see version A, and 25% will see version B. Including 100% of your visitors
will give you results more quickly. However, you may be concerned that your alternative version
could perform worse, and you don't want to compromise your performance too much.

Change in conversion rate

While this is not something you will know upfront, the percentage change in conversion
rate also affects the length of a test. The greater the change, the more quickly a statistically
significant decision can be made.

Number of variations

The more variations you have, the longer it will take to determine which combination performs
the best.

These factors can then be used to calculate the suggested length of time for a test to run.
There are several online calculators that do this for you. A good one to try is this one, offered
by Visual Website Optimizer: vwo.com/tools/ab-test-duration-calculator/.

                       Figure 21.6 Small changes can affect your online testing

It is usually preferable to test bigger changes or variations rather than very small ones, unless
you have a very large audience.

                                                                                                   661

     21.4.3 Designing for analysis

     The purpose of running tests is to improve performance. To do this, you analyse your results
     against what you expected to find and then choose the option that performed better. This
     sounds simple, but how do you know what counts as better enough to warrant a change? Is
     it one more click than the other option, three more clicks, or should one perform 25% better
     than the other? You also need to think about chance: how certain are you that the differences
     in your results were not just coincidental? These can be tricky questions to answer.

     To determine which option in your split test did

     better, set parameters and assess the statistical  NOTE  The p-value is defined as the probability
     significance of your results. In statistics, we          of getting results at least as extreme as
     create a null hypothesis. For split tests, the           the ones you observed, given that the
     null hypothesis is that there is no difference           null hypothesis is correct, where the
     between the performance of the two options               null hypothesis in A/B testing is that the
                                                              variant and the control are the same.

     and any difference recorded is due to chance.

     You then use statistics to calculate the p value,

     which shows whether the difference was likely due to chance (or not). If the difference is sig-

     nificant, it is probably not due to chance. Generally, to be significant, the p value should be less

     than or equal to 0.05, indicating a less than 5% probability that the difference in performance

     between the two options was due to chance.

     However, don't worry: you do not have to be able to perform complex statistical calculations.
     Handy tools like VWO's split test significance calculator will do this for you. All you have to do
     is enter the number of users that visited your control version and the number of conversions,
     as well as the number of users that visited the variation and the number that converted. The
     calculator then provides your p value and states whether your test is significant enough to change
     to the variation. You can find the calculator here: vwo.com/ab-split-test-significance-calculator/.

     When designing your tests, it is important to consider the null hypothesis and set the parameters
     for significance. By keeping these aspects in mind, you will develop tests that allow for clearer
     and easier analysis, which will make the whole testing process that much more effective.

21.5.1 Gather data

The very first step is to gather data about the site you are testing so that you can make smart
decisions about what to test and how. There are many sources you can use, depending on
the nature of the site that you are testing. Of course, you also need to know the business for
which you are testing; in other words, what do you want website visitors to do?

· Analytics data: Existing web analytics data can be used to determine which pages in your
    site should be tested. You can also gather data about specific pages on your site using
    tools such as crazyegg.com or contentsquare.com.

· User data: User labs or simple site surveys, such as kissmetrics.io are a useful tool and
    can also be used to add qualitative data to the quantitative data gathered using web
    analytics tools.

    customer service, you can gather data about

the site from customer service representa-

tives. They should have information on common reasons why visitors make a phone call.

Your CRM system may also hold some valuable data.

21.5.2 Analyse

Having gathered data, you need to analyse it intelligently so that you can start designing tests.
There are some key questions that you need to answer at this stage.

      What should users be doing on the site?

       This is where you look at the actual conversion. Usually, this is an action taken by a user that
66 4 increases revenue for a business. There are obvious conversions to look at, such as placing
                                                                                                       Conversion optimisation

an order or completing a lead generation form. However, it can also be useful to understand
less obvious conversions, or micro-conversions.

You could run a test to see what would reduce the bounce rate of a page. The aim of an online
bookstore is to sell books, but they could also test to increase newsletter signups, and focus
on selling books later. Micro-conversions can also refer to the path to conversion. Often, there
are established steps a visitor should take in the conversion process. Conversion optimisation
can look at each step. The Visitor Flow Report in Google Analytics can be a great help in
providing this insight. Knowing what actions or conversions you are testing is about knowing
the business and its website well.

Who is coming to the site? Why?

To understand who is coming to the website, and why, you need to look at data that tells you
about your visitors and how they got to your website. Visitor information includes their location
and richer demographic information (e.g., age and income), if available. Another key point to
look at is the type of device they use (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

To understand why these visitors come to your website, you need to be able to analyse your
sources of traffic. The search keywords sending you traffic should tell you something about
the intent of your visitors, for example.

What are they doing on your site?

Of course, now you need to understand what your visitors are doing, and why they're not doing
what you want them to do. Here you need to look at metrics, such as bounce rate and exit rate
for important pages. As well as examining your overall conversion rate, look at the steps in the
process and see where those drop-offs occur.

Look at which page is the most visited landing page, especially as this may not be the homepage.
Look to see which ones are exit pages and determine if those should be the last pages a user
sees on your site. You can use internal site search information to see if visitors are looking for
particular information on your website.

21.5.3 Fix anything that is broken

As part of your analysis, you may have identified problems that can be fixed without testing.
Before you continue, fix these. You should also try to understand if there is traffic coming to
your site that is not relevant. Segment that traffic from your calculations.

For example, if you have a beautifully designed website that sells custom couches, but is
featured in a website design gallery, you may get a lot of traffic that is coming only to look at
your site and not necessarily to buy couches.

21.5.4 Design tests

By now you should know what areas of your site need testing, so it's time to design tests.
                                                                                                                                    665

       You now have a sound A/B testing hypothesis.

     21.5.5 Run tests

       Implement the tracking code needed to run your tests. Most testing software uses cookies to
       ensure that return visitors see the same version of the test they saw initially. You will also need
       to put tracking code on your conversion page. Before taking your test live, make sure that the
       tracking code does not conflict with any other code on your website.
       If everything checks out, take your test live and wait for the data to be collected. Check in
       regularly to see how the test is proceeding and wait for a statistically significant outcome.

     21.5.6 Report and repeat

       When you have a result, it's time to report on it. Refer back to your null hypothesis to determine
       if the outcome was as expected and if it was statistically significant. In your report, you should
       include why things went as expected, or why not.
       Implement the better-performing solution and plan your next test. There is always something
       you can improve.

    21.6 TOOLS OF THE TRADE

       Online conversion optimisation relies on being able to record which version of a test a web
       visitor sees and whether or not that visitor converted. To avoid confusion, a returning visitor
       should also see the same version they saw the first time to avoid confusion. There are many
       software solutions that can help you:

21.7 CASE STUDY: HUBSTAFF

Hubstaff offers workforce management software (e.g.,
time-tracking, project management) that is particularly
useful for remote teams.

One-line summary

Hubstaff tested a new homepage design, which led to a 49% increase in visitor-to-trial
conversions.

The problem

Hubstaff measured its success based on traffic, trials, and revenue. It was essential for
visitors to the site to be drawn in and encouraged to sign up for the trial, which, in turn,
would lead to conversion to paid subscription to the service based on their experience.

                                                                                                       667
            ANALYSI NG

           The homepage had to highlight all of the right features in order for potential customers
           to sign up. The web design and marketing team knew that this approach would result in
           more conversions (visitor-to-trial and trial-to-paid).
           However, changing the homepage was a risk. The homepage draws the most visits, and
           launching the test could result in lost conversions and a decline in traffic. The conversion
           rate also had to be worth the effort. In other words, a nominal increase in conversions
           would not necessarily justify the work the team put into the new design.

                                     Figure 21.11 The original homepage for Hubstaff

       The solution

           Hubstaff settled on doing a split test. This meant that 50% of traffic was directed to their
           original homepage (Figure 21.11), and the other 50% to the new homepage.
           They used VWO software to track the following metrics:
           · Visitor-to-trial conversion
           · Hero form submission: This tracked the number of visitors who used the hero form

               seen in Figure 21.9, as opposed to clicking a `Free 14-day trial' call to action button.
           · On-page engagement: This tracked visitor engagement with the homepage by tracking

               clicks.
           · Pricing page views.
           Further, the full visitor journey was tracked to understand whether the conversion from
           trial to paid was due to the new homepage design or the experience using the app.

  The results

   The test was conducted over a three-month period, with over 250 000 visitors across both
   pages. The results were as follows (Nevogt and Gratale, n.d.):
   · Visitor-to-trial conversion: 49% increase
   · Hero form submission: 34% increase in visitors entering their emails on the homepage
   · On-page engagement: 6% decrease, attributed to the improved performance of

       sign-ups, which reduced the number of clicks necessary
   · Pricing page views: 3% decrease in pricing page views.

1. Why did Hubstaff decide to do an A/B test?
2. Discuss the results: was the new homepage less or more successful?
3. Briefly outline the metrics that were tested, and how they related to improving conversions.

21.9 THE BIGGER PICTURE

As you saw at the start of this chapter, conversion optimisation applies to just about every part
of your digital marketing strategy. Almost any tactic can be tweaked, tested, and improved. In
fact, this is best practice and highly recommended.

                                                                                                                                    669
            ANALYSI NG

       Conversion optimisation also speaks to a bigger consideration about keeping your channels
       up to date in the ever-changing online marketing space. Keeping things fresh and constantly
       improving are the way to go. Not only does this strategy entice your customer, it also reflects
       on your bottom line. Making valuable, incremental improvements increases your earnings in
       the short term and decreases the need for radical changes over time.

    21.10 CHAPTER SUMMARY

       Conversion optimisation is the process of testing to increase the conversions from a website
       or digital campaign. A conversion can refer to any action that a web visitor takes. Tests are
       either A/B, or multivariate tests. It's important to understand the business and customers, so
       you can create appropriate, useful tests.

       The basic approach to conversion optimisation is:

       1. Gather data
       2. Analyse data
       3. Fix anything that's broken
       4. Design tests
       5. Run tests
       6. Report and repeat.

    21.11 CHAPTER QUESTIONS

       1. Describe a situation where an A/B test would be more suited as a data-gathering method
            than a multivariate test.

       2. What is a conversion rate, and why is it so important to marketers?
       3. What can you test on an eCommerce product page? List three examples.

     22.1 INTRODUCTION

     Technology continues to shape the future of advertising. Accelerated by the global lockdowns
     due to COVID-19 since the start of 2020, we've witnessed how technology has enabled human
     connection with extraordinary changes that have fast-tracked lives globally. Our behaviours,
     expectations, and ultimately, our needs, have transformed as a result of technology making
     our lives easier, faster, and more engaging. The future of how we interact with the world is
     about to get even more interesting.

     There are two basic things that you will need to adopt if you as a business owner, consultant,
     or marketer want to keep abreast of new developments: becoming customer and data driven.
     Businesses must know who they are selling to and what their customers want.

     In the words of Dion Chang, trend analyst and founder of Flux Trends, `Every business needs
     to relook what they do, what their business models are, and what their purpose is. Looking
     at 2020, your customers are no longer where you thought they were, and they might not be
     needing what you thought you were selling to them' (Courie, 2021).

     This chapter takes a holistic view of how businesses need to adapt with the customer and data
     at the centre of it all. The various divisions that make a business work can no longer operate
     in silos. Business' true value and content comes from the whole, rather than parts of it.

     The new normal compels us to create and innovate as we move from the VUCA-world
     (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) into a BANI (brittle, anxious, non-linear, and
     incomprehensible) framework to get through the current times.

        While BANI is not going to help us solve the challenges of our time any more than VUCA
        did, it does offer a fresh and potentially more nuanced way of framing situations and
        conditions that could help to inform strategic leadership (Shelley, 2021).

     22.3 DATA AND TECHNOLOGY

     Technology is integral to our daily lives. It's hard to imagine life without technology because
     without it, humankind would not have progressed the way it has, especially over the last two
     decades. We've become dependent on it for some of our basic needs like learning, shopping,
     and connecting with friends and family. What we may not have realised until more recently
     however, is that every exchange we make using technology leaves a data trail of our online
     behaviour, which has become invaluable to businesses globally.

     ligence that businesses need to strategise for
     success (Deloitte, 2022).

     In the interest of privacy first, Google announced that mid-2023 will mark the end of the use
     of third-party cookies. Companies now have to review how this would affect their measuring
     and targeting performance. Alternative methods of tracking that preserve the privacy interests
     of internet users do exist and include the following:

     · Zero-party data
     · Universal IDs
     · Fingerprinting
     · Contextual advertising
     · AI-powered analytics.

     We will discuss these further in 22.4.2 Privacy and data protection.

     22.3.1 AdTech landscape

     Advertising technology, or AdTech, is the overarching term that describes the tools and software
     advertisers use to reach audiences to deliver and measure digital advertising campaigns.
     AdTech has been around for some time already. The wide range of tools and technologies we
     use today to achieve efficiency, targeted reach, real-time analysis, and optimisation, started with
     a simple display banner published on Wired Magazine in 1993 and the invention of cookies in

676
                              The future of advertising

1994 (Sweeney, 2018). AdTech has evolved significantly over time, striving to deliver the right
content to the right potential customer at the right time.

As buying and selling ads became increasingly complex, AdTech offered a more streamlined
process, enabling advertisers and agencies to manage their campaigns effectively. Brands are
able to use their budgets optimally and maximise their return on investment (ROI) in digital
advertising when using AdTech.

AdTech uses technology for media buying and because of the sophisticated audience insights
it derives from the data, it can reach targeted consumers through paid channels automatically.
It includes tools and technologies like demand-side platforms, supply-side platforms, agency
trading desks, ad servers, and ad networks to serve relevant advertisements to relevant
audiences. Let's have a closer look at these technologies:

             Advertisers and
                agencies

Publishers                    Agency trading
                               desks (ATD)

Ad networks  The adtech       Demand-side
             landscape        platforms (DSP

Ad servers                    Ad exchange

               Supply-side
             platforms (SSP)

   Figure 22.1 The AdTech landscape with the relevant touchpoints of the AdTech process

Demand-side platform (DSP): Software that advertisers use to buy video, display, and mobile
ads. A DSP is an organised marketplace where advertisers access publisher inventory through
direct integrations, supply-side platforms (SSPs), and ad exchanges.

Supply-side platform (SSP): A tool for publishers that automates selling digital ad impressions
including video, display, and mobile ads. It is driven by the supply side of the advertising
equation - the publishers who want to sell their inventory.

                                                                                                                                    677
            ANALYSI NG

       Agency trading desk (ATD): A tool or set of services related to media planning and buying that
       media agencies provide. Typically layered over a demand-side platform, the ATD is the service
       piece of the AdTech landscape that enables agencies to manage an advertiser's programmatic,
       bid-based media purchases as they happen across channels, while offering analytics on ad
       buys to clients throughout a campaign.

       Ad server: Serves ads to a website or app and reports performance metrics for those ads.
       Advertisers, agencies, ad networks, and publishers can use ad servers to deliver ads to a
       website. Ad servers house creative assets and optimise the process of selecting which ad to
       place, and where, using automated technology.

       With AdTech becoming more sophisticated and technology continuing to advance at its current
       rate, here are three of the key benefits for the future of advertising:

       1. Better utilised ad spend: Advertisers are able to deliver the right content, at the right time
            because ads are reaching engaged audiences with interests in the product or service. The
            delivery and placement of the ad are within control and completely measurable, resulting
            in better use of the budget.

       2. Operational efficiencies for campaigns: Tools like ad servers give advertisers or agencies
            a view of where their ads are placed and how they are performing. This results in more
            efficient and more effective planning, optimising productivity.

       3. Marketing funnel insights: A brand can share unique stories with their customers, depending
            on where they are in the marketing funnel. The technology provides insights that allow you
            to refine how to reach your audiences at different stages of their journey, and to reengage
            audiences that have shown an interest in your product or service.

       At this point in the digital timeline, the top priority for any business or brand is to offer their
       audiences a personalised end-to-end customer experience in real-time. AdTech enables a
       data-driven, customer-centric approach that will not only connect with your audience but also
       help brands achieve their business and sales goals.

     22.3.2 Programmatic advertising

       An integral part of AdTech, programmatic advertising is the use of technology to buy and
       sell digital ads. It uses an automated process to purchase digital ad inventory from across
       the web, mobile, apps, video, and social media. It uses workflow automation and machine
       learning algorithms to deliver effective ads to audiences based on a variety of signals, such
       as demographics and shopping patterns.

       It has become a formidable task to find, source, and place adverts on the billions of digital
       platforms on the internet to reach and engage the right customer. With the help of program-
       matic platforms and the increase in inventory and databases, AdTech allows for any setup
       and channel to be accessed programmatically, including mobile, desktop, tablet, audio, digital
       outdoor, and connected TV.

Targeting tactics are applied to segment audiences with the use of data so that advertisers
only pay for ads supplied to the right people at the right time, relying less on the `spray-and-
pray' method of digital advertising. Computers and algorithms make ad buying, placement,
and optimisation more effective by removing tedious activities and cutting down on time to
take the ad to market.

Artificial intelligence (AI) positioning

Advertisers use AI to identify and segment audiences, build ads, test ads, improve ad perfor-
mance, and optimise spend. These are all done automatically, in real-time, at scale. AI gives
digital advertising a competitive disadvantage because of the extent of its segmentation
capability that helps a brand discover audiences it didn't know it had.
Unlike traditional technology, AI can detect patterns in data and learn to make predictions
based on these patterns. Using machine learning, it gains knowledge from the outcomes to
make better predictions over time.

                                                                                                                                    679
            ANALYSI NG

       Once trained and guided by humans, AI can learn and improve on its own. The more data you
       enter into an AI system, the better it's able to learn and improve. It's more than one technology.
       AI is an umbrella term that comprises a range of smart technologies that can learn and improve
       on their own.
       Some of the AI technologies that you may hear about include machine learning, computer
       vision, natural language generation (NLG), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning,
       neural networks, and speech recognition.
       Because of its ability to learn and improve predictions and outcomes, AI is the component
       of AdTech that is involved in buying and placing programmatic and digital ads, optimising
       advertising budget and performance, and creating and managing ads.

      Virtual reality ads

       Virtual Reality (VR) is recognised for its immersive experiences. The simulation of a virtual
       environment initiates a deeper interaction and connection with customers. VR allows consumers
       to interact directly with their favourite products and brands. The use of VR headsets and
       controllers, can simulate interactions in the real world that offers an experience using the
       power of the internet.
       Interactive VR adverts that allow customers to engage directly with different products or
       destinations can create a higher conversion rate. Think about being served an advert for a
       hotel stay in the Maldives: a static image will show you the scene, and a video may give you
       a broader sense of what the venue offers. A VR advert can take it much further, enabling you
       to experience the actual space without physically being there.
       VR creates more enhanced experiences and can reduce the barriers that businesses face
       trying to persuade prospective customers to use their products or services. VR can serve
       as a substitute for previous in-person interactions, especially with the social restrictions and
       lockdowns imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Another benefit is that it cuts down on costs
       (shipping, travel, and otherwise), while positively shaping customers' perceptions of the
       organisation as a forward-thinking, green-conscious, and tech-savvy brand.

           According to Forbes, the opportunities that VR present will have a massive impact on the
           advertising industry, given the range of tools developers and designers will have to work
           with to implement creative strategies around the ads. New KPI metrics will be established
           as advertisers may focus on tracking immersion and in-experience engagement.

Augmented reality

Augmented Reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the physical world that makes use of
overlaying digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli to improve the user's
experience. Brands make use of augmented reality to promote their products or services, launch
marketing campaigns, and collect unique user data. While VR creates its own environment,
AR adds to the existing world.
Similar to VR, AR-based adverts can also be used to deliver interactive advertising experiences.
With the use of the internet and digital platforms, like apps, marketers can connect with potential
customers using technology that allows customers to try out products from wherever they are.
L'Oréal, for example, has partnered with YouCam Makeup by Perfect Corp to augment a
make-up try-on tool using their app. The makeover tool allows the user to `try on' hair colour,
foundation, lipstick, mascara, and blush for a realistic view of what it will look like before
making the purchase. This convenience gives their customers the freedom to try on a variety
of options without commitment. The engagement gives the brand the opportunity to get to
know how the functions are used, allowing them to get to know the user and their behaviour.
AR is used widely thanks to its availability, from filters on Instagram and Snapchat to TikTok
add-ons. Brands have been making use of AR functions to create awareness and run promotions
to help customers decide before making their purchase.

      Internet of things (IoT)

       The Internet of Things (IoT), like a Bluetooth device, connects a variety of physical devices
       through the internet and stores or exchanges data all around the world. One example of this
       technology is a product like Alexa, which can connect to home monitoring systems and lights,
       promoting the concept of a `smart home' that you can control using your smartphone.

       These technologies enable the world to connect people and objects with a network of seamless
       communication between them that helps us monitor the environment. It provides context for
       advertisers to leverage advertising opportunities and promotions in real-time.

       According to Vailshery (2021), over 13.8 billion IoT-connected devices are already in use
       today and around 75 billion are expected by 2025. Moreover, by 2025, the number of active
       IoT-connected devices is expected to hit 21.5 billion.

       These statistics and the ability to link such an extensive number of devices, opens up a plethora
       of advertising possibilities, including (but not limited to):

       Location advertising: IoT devices are GPS-enabled that allows brands to view the location
       of people and objects, enabling tracking and monitoring.

       Personalised advertising: IoT enables personalisation and an experience unlike any other. In
       retail, IoT can be used with sensors installed on product packaging. Using their smartphones,
       customers can interact directly with the campaign to claim rewards or discounts in specific
       locations.

       Billboard advertising: Advertisements on billboards offer hard-to-ignore and engaging ways of
       advertising to the public. It brings together real-world advertising that attracts a large number
       of viewers in busy places, creating brand awareness.

       Proximity advertising: This type of advertising aims to make interactions realistic with
       IoT-enabled objects, like beacons that react and adjust in response to position. It uses proximity
       technology to detect the presence of humans nearby and initiate pre-programmed actions to
       provide informational, contextual, and personalised experiences.

       The world of IoT offers a host of opportunities. Because of its interconnectivity to physical and
       online touchpoints, advertising opportunities have increased drastically across platforms. Every
       IoT connection and interaction gives brands a touchpoint that can be used to advertise their
       items to customers by approaching them at the `perfect' time with just the right product, using
       the data and information available to personalise the experience for customers.

       Using IoT in advertising strategy
       IoT gives you access to a load of data and information about your customers and the market.
       Although you may not yet know what kind of ad best suits your customer, your priority is to
       stay relevant in the market. For this, you need to investigate the current trends and customer
       needs. Apply these three actions to develop and enhance your approach:

1. Research: IoT helps you conduct thorough research to understand your market and
    customers. In this way, you are able to create ads your customers like and can relate to,
    which ultimately increases brand visibility.

2. Geofencing: IoT helps brands conduct location-based advertising. Adding your location to
    your ads allows your customer to understand where you're located and search for you. If
    they are close by, you have the ability to send them targeted ads. If your advert is enticing
    enough, they may just want to find out more about your brand.

3. Remarketing ads: This is a targeted way of advertising that brands use to re-target their
    customers. This is done using IoT devices that will instantly send ads to customers who
    have visited a brand's website or clicked on a social media. Remarketing advertising and
    IoT devices are a great combination for brands to connect with their customers.

22.4 CONSUMERS

Today's consumers have an increasingly sophisticated relationship with brands and digital
content. As you've learnt in Chapter 2: Importance of the customer, there are a range of
motivating factors that drive consumer behaviour. As a result of the influence of technology,
today's market has evolved so significantly that it has impacted every generation.

Consumers no longer blindly accept what companies say at face value. They perceive brands'
behaviour across multiple channels, (e.g., they may follow a brand on social media, physically
visit the store, read their reviews, and want more personalised offers) but may detest sharing
their information unless they have complete control.

Brands, marketers, and advertisers now have more informed consumers to deal with; customers
who are capable of making sensible decisions by finding out more about a product before
making a purchase. At the same time, there is room for negative consumer perceptions in
digital advertising. This is a battle that brands must continue to fight by finding ways in which
they can recover trust with their customers to improve their online reputation.

   We discussed customer experience extensively in Chapter 2: Importance of the customer.
   Feel free to revisit some of the concepts to see how they apply to the future of advertising.

Human-centred design

Based on a problem-solving approach that prioritises a human perspective during each of the
processes, human-centred design is often used in design, management, and engineering. It is
a practical means of determining the most suitable design for consumers because it makes use
of participation and feedback in the planning process. These contributions provide a thorough
understanding of any issues in the design process because the researcher and participant
have transparency between them that provides context.

                                                                                                                                    683
            ANALYSI NG

                              Figure 22.4 Wikipedia human-centred design visualisation
       Placing humans at the centre of any marketing or advertising strategy offers an in-depth under-
       standing of human needs, interest, ambitions, behaviours, and personalities. This is invaluable
       to any business for the connected world that we live in. We've mentioned before that customer
       centricity and technology are the key drivers of digital marketing and advertising success.
       According to Abramovich (n.d.) "the future of advertising will be personalised, automated,
       immersive, experiential, and measurable. It won't feel like advertising."
       People-centric marketing combines AdTech and marketing technology to reach potential
       customers by incorporating their preferences and behaviour into advertisements. This strategy
       aims to optimise sales, and increase the chances of receiving positive responses from customers.
       Also, this approach aims to foster brand loyalty with existing customers while attracting new
       ones. However, people-centric marketing can only be achieved if the marketing and advertis-
       ing strategies are focused on using data to reach their customers instead of using the more
       traditional approaches.

     22.4.1. Personalisation

       Previously, organisations used personalisation to customise a service or product for specific
       individuals, market segments, or customer personas for a brand. Personalisation has since
       evolved as a marketing tactic and has become a critical element in social media, email marketing,
       customer service, and just about every customer touchpoint in the user journey.
       Personalisation offers a variety of benefits, including:
       · Improved customer satisfaction
       · Increased digital sales conversion
       · Better branding
       · Improved website metrics and advertising.

For customers

If you're a Netflix subscriber, you would have received a message from them that says: "We just
added a movie you might like". With this level of personalisation, Netflix is invested in getting
to know their customers and their viewing habits better.

Customers have come to expect and, to a certain degree, demand personalisation from the
brands they interact with. Customers know that they don't have to accept experiences that do
not meet their expectations.

According to Accenture, 91% of consumers said they are more likely to shop with brands that
provide offers and recommendations that are relevant to them.

Personalised experience makes a customer feel understood, such as:

· When a streaming service, like Amazon or Netflix, offers recommendations based on
    previous viewing activity or sends reminders that the viewer left in the middle of a movie

· When a customer receives a reminder that they haven't completed a purchase on an
    ecommerce site.

These brands make use of recommender systems to enhance the customer's sense of per-
sonalisation. The systems suggest content based on a set of algorithms and use a customer's
past viewing or shopping habits to package and present recommendations that may lead to
the next action, such as watching the next movie. In this case, the viewer feels as though the
company understands their wants and needs, resulting in a personalised customer experience.

For organisations

Customer experience has become a key differentiating factor for companies. Personalisation
allows organisations to have more meaningful interactions with their audience and makes the
customer's decision to purchase easier.

Consumers receive masses of marketing messages every day. To stand out against the
competition, brands need to increase engagement and businesses need to break through the
noise that distracts their customers from their messages. Generic messages are simply not
effective and, the less relevant a marketing campaign is to a customer, the lower the response
rates will be.

AI and personalisation
AI affects personalisation in a variety of ways in customer experience and marketing. Brands
that are not incorporating tactics or approaches to address personalisation risk losing their
positioning in the market against their competition.

Consider these five ways that AI affects personalisation when preparing for the future of
advertising:

                                                                                                                                    685
            ANALYSI NG

       1. Create intelligent personas: Businesses can collect data by directly asking customers
            what they need, tracking user data, and adding existing data into the mix. This additional
            data will increase the understanding of the customer personas -- who they are and what
            they need.

       2. Drive content creation: Content creation is based on AI algorithms to capture a large
            set of data points that describe a customer's behaviour, such as emails that the customer
            opened, links that they previously used, past purchases, and similar customer types before
            selecting the best content for each individual.

       3. Optimise mobile: AI-powered personalisation can help companies create content that is
            suitable for mobile devices, bringing data together across multiple sources into a single
            view of the customer. Chatbots can also improve communication with customers and help
            them to purchase products while enabling them to use self-service for their online needs.

       4. Make use of deep data: If your business has large amounts of customer data,
            you can use it to break down customer preferences and buying styles to create
            marketing profiles, personas, or buyer segments. This data can be further organised
            to determine who your key customers are, along with their buying processes.
            Deep data can also enable brands to incorporate behavioural-based, data-like habits and
            preferences for additional customer insight using algorithms. It will help determine real-time
            decisions. For example, a company can learn about when it should schedule relevant
            content or offers, and how these items will solve or address a need.

       5. Incorporate algorithms into your planning and process: The use of algorithms has taken
            personalisation to the next level of getting closer to customers. Beyond segmentation,
            the use of algorithms through recommender systems can provide customers with more
            personalised experiences. AI can assist in improving purchase recommendations. Based
            on customer preferences, the algorithms can be designed to use customer preferences
            and behaviours to recommend products, cross-sell items, and increase conversion.

     22.4.2 Privacy and data protection

       The future of the web is focused on a privacy-first approach for consumers worldwide. The
       world's technology giants are constantly in the spotlight for privacy controls and data protection
       in digital advertising. Although data protection laws have been around for many years, new
       legislation came into effect from about 2018 that made extensive provision for the protection
       of personal data, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California
       Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the General Data Protection Law in Brazil, Protection of Personal
       Information Act (PoPIA) in South Africa, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic
       Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada, to mention a few.

           Today, there are more than 120 countries already engaged in some form of international
           privacy laws for data protection to ensure that citizens and their data are offered more
           rigorous protections and controls (Thales Group, 2021).

686
                                                                                                       The future of advertising

While trying to find a balance between personalised advertising and data privacy, the demand
for user consent is becoming the standard. Every business must be aware of these laws to
ensure that they comply and process user data and personal information correctly.

The end of third-party cookies

Google, the biggest browser and leading data collector, announced that third-party cookies will
officially be phased out in 2023. Although Apple's Safari and Mozilla Firefox started blocking
third-party cookies by default in 2013, Google only gave users the option to block cookies.
Because of the rise of user demands for greater privacy and transparency, coupled with
international data protection laws, this type of tracking will officially come to an end.

For decades, marketers have relied on third-party cookies to track and store user data online
to learn about consumer behaviour and track their activities and interests, which gave them
the insights they needed to target the right audiences. With the end of third-party cookies,
users will have more confidence searching the internet knowing that their privacy remains
intact. Some key challenges marketers have outlined as concerns with this phase-out include:

· 41% of marketers believe their biggest challenge will be their inability to track the right data
· 44% of marketers predict a need to increase their spending by 5% to 25% in order to reach

    the same goals as 2021
· 23% of marketing experts plan on investing in email marketing software due to Google's

    new policy (Bump, 2021).

First-party cookies

First-party cookies are codes that are created and stored on a website for when a user visits
the site. It has been essential to the web-browsing experience for a while; they are used to
remember passwords, basic information, and preferences. They're paramount to ecommerce
websites. If a user saves an item in a cart on Takealot, for instance, they will expect to find the
item there when they log back on. Without it, the cart would be empty each time.

First-party cookies will continue to serve as a means of collecting user information, which
will allow marketers to continue accessing and storing user information to use in their ads.

Contextual ad targeting

Marketers need to look for alternatives to stay on track with audience targeting. Another useful
advertising method is contextual advertising, where brands serve relevant ads to audiences
with content that the user is already interested in.

A form of targeted advertising, contextual advertising is where site content and keywords
are analysed in real time to determine suitability for a brand's message. Without the use of
search, browsing history or cookies, contextual advertising is an automated process where a
promotional message is matched to relevant digital content. The algorithms select the advert
based on keywords and other metadata included in the content. The result is that the advert

                                                                                                                                    687
            ANALYSI NG

       is relevant and targeted, which encourages users to click through the ad. This click-through
       activity creates revenue for the publisher of the content, as well as more traffic for the advertiser.

       When a user, for instance, researches a product or service, they will likely read a few reviews
       first. Contextual ads on review sites are displayed based on the content rather than on the
       user's browsing history. This is achieved with an automated system that displays relevant ads
       based on the content of the web page.

       Although not a new concept to advertising, contextual advertising and targeting does not rely
       on cookies, but instead, focuses on the channel or publication, current affairs, and contents of
       the article to reach audiences based on context.

      Adblockers

       The adblocker is another privacy and data protector. It prevents the display and/or download
       of adverts, giving the website visitor control over whether or not to view the advert and
       simultaneously encouraging an advertising-free environment. Considered one of the most
       challenging phenomena that content publishers, brands, agencies, and advertising technology
       have encountered, adblockers have increased consumer awareness of the tracking technologies
       used in the digital advertising industry.

       The average consumer is becoming more aware of personal identifying information and far more
       wary of giving away personal data online. They want more control over their online experience,
       fewer ads that are intrusive, and more ad relevance. Adblocking has continued to rise in recent
       years, which is why advertisers need to become more creative in how they target consumers.

      The way forward for marketing

       Although the end of third-party cookies may seem like the end of user tracking, there are other
       technologies that may be used to track online behaviour and create targeted advertising. For
       brands that previously relied on third-party data, it is time to consider alternatives, such as:

       · Zero-party data: This is information that customers share voluntarily and deliberately
            with you. You can secure this through quizzes, website activity, customer profiles, and
            subscription information.

       · Universal IDs: This is a single identifier that recognises users across multiple platforms
            and removes the need for third-party data. The Universal ID enables brands to track and
            target users more accurately by allowing the information related to the user to be passed
            onto approved partners in the supply chain.

       · AI-powered analytics: There are a host of benefits that AI can accelerate for data privacy
            initiatives. One technique is to classify sensitive data in the ecosystem to ensure compliance
            to data protection laws. AI can process large datasets and manage sensitive data to ensure
            the highest levels of customer privacy through automation.

22.5 CONTENT

Content is the backbone of advertising. It is the basis on which the user decides whether they
will scroll through or click on the call to action. Developed to promote and sell products or
services, content for advertising initiates and builds relationships with audiences.

According to the Content Marketing Institute, there are three disruptions that you should know
about for the future of content and advertising (Rose, 2021):

1. Consumers have choice and variety in content
The vast amount of content available online keeps increasing quickly. Because of the sheer
amount of content that is available, consumers have less patience to be interrupted by anything
- calls, text messages, pop-up ads, push notifications, amongst others. The way in which users
consume and spend time with content has changed. Trends put a renewed pressure on digital
content experiences. Digital content platforms now act as a physical presence proxy. All our
digital content (events, thought leadership, etc.) has to be more differentiated because our
audiences expect more, and the noise will only get exponentially louder.

2. Scarcity of physical presence
Physical presence has become far more pronounced since the global lockdowns of 2020. People
value it more than ever before. Interestingly, new preferences have come about as a result
of social distancing - many things are perceived to be experienced better in a non-physical
environment, and people are placing more value on their physical space in the world.

3. Decline of trust and truth
Trust in mainstream institutions is at the lowest it has ever been. Whether it's government,
mainstream media, businesses, or even non-profits, the misinformation and widespread
mistrust of these institutions and their leaders has increased dramatically. With the bar this
low, marketers are responsible for creating trust and truth as values. They need to monetise
marketing differently - through time, attention, referral, personal data, brand loyalty and even
trust. All of this can be converted into wealth for the business.

As digital advertising continues to battle with negative consumer perceptions, the onus is on
marketers to find ways in which they can recover trust. They need to serve engaging ads that
fit seamlessly into publisher pages to enhance the user experience.

22.5.1 Content intelligence

Content intelligence is the process of using software that combines machine learning and AI to
conduct market research about the effectiveness of specific types of content. This, in turn, helps
marketers to create a high-quality content strategy that they know will work (Needle, 2021).
Essentially, it provides the framework for a high-quality strategy that drives leads, conversions,

                                                                                                                                    689

       and revenue. The data shows you what performs well for your audience, which gives you the
       insights necessary to measure the actual impact of content created on a mass scale.

       Content intelligence platforms can also provide real-time reporting on the performance of
       content with actionable insights to create effective content that gets results.

       · Metrics and reporting: Content intelligence software uses big data analysis to analyse
            all of the content that's being created, often in real-time, and can provide marketers with
            useful data, such as what best content is, the reach of the content, and the impact.

       · Content analysis: Content intelligence platforms can also analyse individual pieces of
            content via natural language processing and identify characteristics, such as style and
            tone-of-voice, as well as make recommendations for content creators on SEO and other
            improvements that can be made on the content. Because these recommendations are
            based on data, it helps to take some of the guesswork out of the content creation process.

       · Automation: Some content intelligence platforms help marketers automate aspects of
            the content creation and promotion process, using artificial intelligence and algorithms to
            analyse a piece of content and execute decisions automatically.

       · Content management: Because content intelligence requires a large amount of data to
            work, it demands deep integration with the CMS. Some systems can work just by plugging
            into analytics tools such as Google Analytics, but others require a deeper integration with
            the content management system in which the content lives. Many content intelligence
            systems also provide CMS functionality.

     22.5.2 Smart content

       `Smart' content is another name for dynamic content. It's a marketing technique that adapts
       the information for the user according to their profile and needs. It can change and pivot
       dynamically, depending on who is reading it. This way, you can target the content to the reader
       and create a more individual experience to potentially boost conversions.

      Advantages of using smart content

       · Personalisation: Smart content allows you to create content that is personalised and
            relevant to your audience, which may result in a better experience for the user and a better
            chance of conversion for you.

       · Targeting: Using the data that you are collecting in your customer relationship management
            and marketing systems, together with the automation and intelligence of smart content,
            software can assist you in creating content that is highly targeted toward very specific
            groups of users.

       · Automation: You can save on time and resourcing if you are using machine learning
            algorithms to optimise your content automatically. With each user visit, the system learns
            from the actions of each previous visitor for optimisation.

· Improved and measurable ROI: You can achieve a significantly higher ROI with smart
    content for all of the reasons above. Essentially, the data allows you to calculate ROI
    accurately and is easy to collect and measure.

To get started with smart content, collect as much data about your audience as possible. Get
to know them exceptionally well because the more accurately you can segment your audience,
the more effective your smart content will be.

can have a positive impact on your sales and

platforms that they're on, they can expect a similar experience with your brand for their shopping

and customer service experiences. It will be important for you to be actively present on all of

the channels that you have set up and ensure that you build your brand presence effectively.

     22.6.1 Creating seamless and integrated experiences

       For any business and brand, adopting an omnichannel approach has numerous benefits.
       Being technology driven and customer focused is vital for business success, which is why it
       is so important that the brand offers an integrated and seamless experience for the customer.

           An omnichannel is a lead nurturing and user engagement approach in which a company
           gives access to their products, offers, and support services to customers or prospects
           on all channels, platforms, and devices (Fontanella, 2022).

       With omnichannel, it is possible to market, sell, and serve customers on all channels for an
       integrated experience regardless how or where a customer reaches out. Fundamentally, the
       experience you offer must be the same for customers on any of the chosen platforms or methods
       they use. Whether they are shopping online from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone, or
       in physical store, the brand experience should be equally seamless.

       It's important to distinguish between an omnichannel experience and a multi-channel experience.
       Essentially, omnichannel involves all channels and revolves around your customer, while
       multi-channel involves many channels and revolves around your product.

       These are a few of the benefits a brand can enjoy with an omnichannel approach:

       · Greater reach: Using an omnichannel strategy, you'll reach your customers where they are.
            They no longer have to search to find you because no matter where they are, your team or
            products are only a click, email, direct message, or phone call away.

       · Increased profits: Offering your customers multiple platforms and channels to purchase
            your product when they are ready to buy will make it easier for them to decide and act. A
            multi-channel retail experience also makes it easier for repeat customers to purchase again
            or renew their subscription, securing recurring revenue.

       · Boosted customer satisfaction: Customers will be happier when they feel they have
            options to reach your customer service and sales teams, especially if they can purchase
            easily on any device or their preferred platform. Customer satisfaction is the key to keeping
            them returning.

      Building omnichannel communication experiences

       Creating an omnichannel experience can take time. It isn't necessary to be everywhere at the
       same time. It's important to prioritise the channels in order to create and build it correctly, in
       line with your customer experience and brand objectives. Keep these five steps in mind:

       1. Start with the basics: Your website and social media channels
       Your website and social media are usually the first places your customers will come looking
       for you. Start here and ensure that you are consistent in how you respond to your customers.

692
                                                                                                       The future of advertising

Ensure that you're posting consistently, managing your social communities, and engaging
with the users who reach out to you via these channels. Make sure that you are responding
to emails and direct messages within your time frame. Avoid responding more efficiently on
one platform over another.

2. Create an app (if necessary)
Depending on your industry and product, it may not be necessary to create an app. It would
be best to review your customer needs and business requirements to make your final decision.
Be sure to have a legitimate reason for creating the app.

3. Seek to solve for the customer at every step
When considering adding a channel to your omnichannel strategy, ensure that it solves for the
customer. Remember, the purpose of an omnichannel approach is centred on the customer and
their needs. Your brand will benefit in the long term. Try to ensure an easy, issue-free experience.

4. Keep your messaging across channels the same
For a consistent experience, use the same messaging across channels but be aware of
duplication issues around boilerplate content. If, for instance, you're running an ad on social
media, the wording will differ to what appears on your website or in-store. Your messaging
must be suitable for the channel and application. Avoid copying and pasting content. Use the
same phrases to create a consistent brand voice that allows you to mix it up without looking
inconsistent.

5. Give customers a suitable CTA
Each time you interact with customers on your channels, whether it's on an ad, an organic post,
a private message, a phone call, or an email, your engagement should have a call to action.
That CTA should be appropriate for your channel; always test it to make sure it doesn't throw
your customer off. It should always extend a seamless experience.

22.6.2 What the future of advertising looks like

The future of advertising points to customer centricity and technology that will drive person-
alisation, automation and immersive experiences, while delivering measurability. It will likely
feel less like advertising and more experiential.

Future of digital advertising

The digital habits consumers adopted during the years since COVID-19 are not likely to change
drastically. Marketers will have to ensure, however, that each interaction with the customer is
effective and valuable. Consider the following:

· 91% of respondents agree ads are more intrusive today compared to two to three years
    ago, and 87% agree there are more ads in general
                                                                                                                                    693
            ANALYSI NG

       · 42% of consumers feel that ads across digital media are irrelevant to their needs, an increase
            of 10% since last quarter

       · 73% of consumers dislike companies with repetitive messaging, representing a 15% increase
            in negative sentiment quarter over quarter

       · 62% of companies have, or plan to have, an omnichannel marketing strategy (AdWeek)
       · Conversion rates actually increase the more users see an ad within remarketing campaigns
       · Nearly all ad buyers expect digital advertising to comprise more than 50% of their total

            marketing budget in two years
       · Today, buyers and sellers on average use programmatic advertising for only 17% of their

            inventory. Within two years, that will more than double
       · Digital advertisers believe automation will have an impact on achieving their goals.

       Consumers are more likely to engage with brands that advertise beside legitimate content. They
       are less likely to engage with brands that advertise next to false, objectionable, or inflammatory
       content, and would stop using a brand or product. Consumers believe that advertisers bear
       responsibility for ensuring their digital ads run beside trustworthy content (The Harris Poll, 2020).

       What does this mean for the future of digital advertising? Essentially, it means that ads continue
       to need to be personalised. Once you have the consent of your consumers to use their data,
       you need to use that data effectively so you can create the right ads. Additionally, you shouldn't
       just focus on one area of advertising; you should have an omnichannel, multi-device approach.

       When you're going back to the drawing board for your digital advertising strategies, remember:

       1. Remarketing continues to be a good strategy to reach uses.
       2. Programmatic advertising is on the rise.

       Now that we've looked at digital advertising as a whole, let's dive into more specifics. What
       will mobile advertising look like in the future?

      Future of mobile advertising

       Mobile advertising has been rapidly growing in the past couple of years, but it is expected to
       slow down to about 10.4% by the end of 2022. Despite this decline, there are some facts that
       you need to take into account when planning your mobile advertising:

       · 85% of advertisers and 72% of publishers are currently utilising programmatic advertising
       · 80% of programmatic ad spend will go to mobile, rather than desktop ads (eMarketer)
       · When asked to specify which mobile ad types were annoying, 73% said ads that pop over

            the entire screen were the worst
       · Mobile users value search ads compared to others, likely because they're relevant to their

            information needs
       · Twitter ads are 11% more effective than TV ads during live events
       · In 2019, mobile advertising spending worldwide amounted to 189 billion USD and it is

            expected to surpass 240 billion dollars by 2022

                                                      The future of advertising

· Programmatic mobile ad spend is increasing, as in-app ads dominate. Automation in mobile
    advertising will continue to rise as well

· Additionally, when it comes to mobile advertising, you might want to consider search ads
    instead of banner ads, since they create a better user experience.

Future of video advertising

Consumers don't find value in watching video ads if they don't have to. Take these trends into
account when planning your video advertising:

· 100% of respondents reported they will always skip ads when given the opportunity
· The pandemic has overwhelmingly increased the amount of online video people watch
· Marketers feel more positive about the ROI offered by video than ever, as it continues to

    strongly influence traffic, leads, sales, and audience understanding
· 87% of video marketers reported that video gives them a positive ROI, compared to the

    lowly 33% who felt that way in 2015
· In 2019, video was the #1 form of media used in content strategy, overtaking blogs and

    infographics
· Video is still one of the most powerful advertising tools, and it's continuing to rise, even in

    the face of the pandemic.

Future of TV advertising                        NOTE  You can find more statistics and trends
                                                      on Hubspot, RevJet, Statista, and

increase. However, it's important to note that
the future of TV advertising is going to look
programmatic. Take these into account when
planning your TV adverts:

· Programmatic TV will represent a third of global TB ad revenue
· It is expected that TV advertising revenue in the United States will grow from 71 billion USD

    in 2018 to 72 billion in 2023

· Global TV ad revenue is projected to increase from 173 billion USD to 192 billion between
    2018 and 2022.

Without a doubt, the future of advertising is going to look interesting, because as technology
continues to evolve, so will our marketing strategies.

22.7 GREATER COLLABORATION: RESOURCING

Every strategy and plan need the right resources to deliver and achieve the desired goals.
In preparation for the future of advertising, it's important to ensure you have the right skills,
knowledge, and expertise on board. With the rate of technology advancing and people adapting
to the changes of the environment, the certain uncertainty is that change is inevitable.

                                                                                                                                    695

       The contents of this chapter and textbook as a whole will remain words on a page until you
       practice what you have learned and put these teachings into action. In this section, we unpack
       what it is going to take from a resource perspective to get ready for the future of advertising.

       Creativity alone is no longer the only requirement for brands and agencies. The influence of
       technology on the advertising industry and the transformation of the digital marketing world
       requires more than the manual job bags and methods that were standard practice two decades
       ago. Everyone who has an interest in brand, marketing, and advertising must upgrade their
       processes. With the abundance of tools, automation, and bots becoming part of marketing
       departments, agencies and people who don't transform towards the future risk being left
       behind, wasting time on tasks that slow down decision making.

      Advertising: an end-to-end view

       Advertising is not only about making an advert anymore. It entails the entire process, from
       advert creation to measuring and analytics, particularly in digital advertising. Real-time
       reporting of a published advert can (and should) link back to the creative execution, although
       not everyone is doing it. The intelligence that a brand can gain from these insights will be
       beneficial in the long term.

       In essence, agencies should start looking into the end-to-end process of advertising in order
       to charge for value. Using automation can reduce back-office costs, which will also reveal a
       few valuable factors:

       · Retainers will increase because the value created by advertising will become more apparent
            with better reporting and sales results

       · Agency structures may likely change, requiring fewer client service staff and more strategy
            and creative staff

       · Agency margins will improve because less wastage means improved efficiency while
            transparency will make it easier for agencies and clients to work together, identify mistakes,
            and rectify them.

      The role of the CMO

       Post-COVID, the role of the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) should evolve beyond creating
       leads. Instead, the focus should shift to actively finding and making deals and revenue happen.
       The role will entail more than driving audience engagement and should include driving the
       sales process as a whole.

       Marketing leaders are unique to the organisation because, beyond marketing operations, they
       are responsible for the go-to-market of the business. The role of marketing in increasing and
       securing market share has become more direct, immediate, and urgent than ever.

CMO as focuser
Anticipating how audiences, customers, and prospects will change has always been a task
for CMOs and marketing leaders. The shifting business landscape, however, pushes market
and revenue growth more directly into the CMO's strategic tasks, which is why the role will
also need to become more focused on predicting and pre-empting how sales and market
opportunity will evolve.

Consumers are inundated with information, marketing messages, and adverts. CMOs must use
their skills intelligently to drive more nuanced, relevant, and useful materials, as well as advice,
to customers. And they need to do so quickly. Using data-driven insights, CMOs need to be
able to create a strategy of engagement that is more compelling and actionable for customers.
This may require radically evolved formats of the content they create.

CMO driving employment and community
The CMOs of today and the future are actively working to create certainty for their people.

Since COVID-19, digital business has expanded the goals of marketing beyond its previous
confines. The CMO is now also helping the entire business go to market. To succeed, they
will have to reinvent themselves and their teams to deliver more to the business and drive
it forward. At the baseline, CMOs must consider the business, customer, workforce, and
community perspective when seeking answers and finding solutions to the uncertainties that
the business faces.

Digital ecosystems

The explosion of digital demands a whole range of new skills for marketing teams and agencies.
There is a need for multi-channel creativity that spans platforms and functions, such as SEO
and content marketing, UX design, social media marketing, data analytics, augmented reality,
production, and ecommerce capabilities.

To ensure that businesses have all of these covered, some big companies may consider the
in-housing agencies because of the demand for brands to deliver quickly, consistently, and
with the right quality. Others may consider upskilling existing teams, employing skilled people,
or contracting the skills required.

Effective collaboration is a vital function in a digital ecosystem. To create and deliver meaningful,
impactful campaigns, different departments - advertising and marketing, customer service,
research and analysis, information technology and operations, finance and governance - will
all need to be able to communicate and share ideas and data. In a business environment, every
function has a role to play in the digital ecosystem.

Customer relations can no longer be removed from content, especially in a customer-centric,
digitally-connected world. All parts should be integrated into a working whole to achieve the
best results.

                                                                                                                                    697

     can adapt to meet the many changes.

     22.8 CASE STUDY: THE FUTURE OF ADVERTISING: PATHWAYS
     TO SURVIVAL IN FOUR SCENARIOS

     Deloitte is a multinational professional services network with offices
     in over 150 countries. They are considered to be the global leader
     in professional services providing audit and assurance, consulting,
     financial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and related services.

     One-line summary

     Deloitte used their proven scenario approach to illustrate plausible futures in the global
     advertising market and show how today's players might adapt to meet the many changes
     and uncertainties along the way.

     The problem

     Deloitte applied their scenario planning approach to design a simple overview of a
     complex ecosystem, demonstrating the future of advertising and how to navigate the
     uncertainties using five archetypal stakeholders that they identify as shaping the future
     advertising landscape.

     The solution

     Deloitte based their scenarios on a comprehensive set of underlying drivers that
     may shape the future of the advertising industry. They generated these by inter-
     viewing experts and using their unique external environment analysis based on
     Natural Language Processing algorithms. They proceeded to cluster the resulting
     drivers into social, technological, economic, environmental, and political factors.
     To determine the four scenarios for the future of advertising, the company rated
     them in terms of their relative uncertainty and impact on the advertising industry.

                                                                                                   The future of advertising

As a result of their analysis, Deloitte developed the following four scenarios for the future
of advertising:

· Scenario 1: The transactional you
· Scenario 2: The creative you
· Scenario 3: The entertained masses
· Scenario 4: The fragmented masses
This was designed to assist newcomers and existing market players with a form of guardrail
to navigate the uncertain future of advertising in a digital landscape.

The results

The case study revealed the trends that are changing the advertising industry. The four
scenarios reflect on their critical uncertainties in the matrix, which may differ in effect
from scenario to scenario. Deloitte identified seven factors for which development could
be predicted with a high degree of certainty and which are relevant for all scenarios. They
determined that these trends will shape the future of the advertising industry:

Marketing clouds will prevail: Marketing clouds will be indispensable elements in adver-
tising processes, as they control the creation and management of marketing relationships
and manage campaigns with customers. It will become standard to integrate solutions for
customer journey management, email, mobile, social, web personalisation, advertising,
content handling, and analytics.

Artificial intelligence will be imperative: AI is ubiquitous in the advertising space. AI
supports decision making and analyses consumer behaviour. Enriched with data about
how consumers interact with advertising, it substantially optimises campaigns to perform
better. Implemented consistently and to its full extent, AI understands consumers better
than they do themselves.

Programmatic will become universal: Programmatic will be the standard for digital
advertising. Processes will be fully automated in the context of purchasing and selling ad
space and dynamically placing digital ads, and transactions will take place in real time.
Programmatic will be an essential enabler for targeted advertising. Traditional processes
involving RFPs, human negotiations, and manual insertion orders will vanish from the
digital advertising space.

`Context is king': Digital advertising will be predominantly contextual. Ads will be selected
and placed by automated systems, based on ever more detailed user profiles and the

          War for ad talent will continue: The continuing digitalisation of advertising with new
          market players, changing job profiles, and a shift of power within the industry will cause
          an enormous war for talent. Employers will compete for experts with scarce, specialised
          skill sets. Demand for data scientists, analytics experts, and creative minds is huge.
          AdTech will consolidate: The once fragmented and heterogeneous supplier landscape
          within the AdTech segment will consolidate. Large AdTech players will acquire almost
          all their smaller but highly specialised competitors. The desire for improved services,
          additional scale, and more data will be the main driver behind vigorous M&A activity.
          TV will lose its dominance: After print, traditional linear TV will lose in importance. Large
          digital platform companies will generate similar reach through video on demand, social,
          or messaging functionalities.

    22.9 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

       1. What was the purpose of the case study that Deloitte conducted using scenario planning?
       2. How did they determine the scenarios for the future of advertising?
       3. Do you believe their findings are valid? Please provide an explanation for your answer.

    22.10 THE BIGGER PICTURE

       How you adapt to the changing environment now will determine your place in context of the
       future of advertising. While online security remains a major concern because of the sheer volume
       of data that is generated by the technologies that businesses are adopting, it's imperative that
       you take the necessary steps to protect your customers' data - this is essentially the basis of
       their trust in you.
       Preparing for the future of advertising will require skills, knowledge, tools, and systems to set
       you up for success. As the world continues to change, one of the best attributes you can have,
       is the agility to adapt and rise to the occasion.
       There will be shifts in how technology and people react to social and environmental changes.
       Our learnings since 2020 have been to be prepared for anything because the only thing that
       is certain is change. The contents of this chapter provide a host of valuable information to help
       you navigate the current times in preparation for the future.

    22.11 SUMMARY

       The future of advertising will be personalised, automated, immersive, experiential, and
       measurable, primarily because technology and consumers are at the centre of it all. Knowing

how to reach and connect with your audiences using technology will be important for every
marketer, especially as the internet moves into a privacy-first era.

For businesses and brands, maintaining integrity and authenticity while building trust among
audiences is going to be essential in all your digital advertising practices. Advertising is taking
on a new skin because people have become more wary and conscientious of online data and
security risks.

As technology continues to evolve, ensuring that you and your team have the right skills to
navigate the digital landscape will become more valuable over time. Knowing the trends that will
shape the future of how we interact with each other online and offline will become invaluable
in how you connect with your audiences.

     INTRODUCTION

     The World Wide Web keeps evolving - from the early days when we primarily used the internet
     as an information highway to today where it enables our connections with family, friends, our
     communities, and anyone online who shares our interests anywhere in the world. It would
     seem almost natural for the next stage of evolution to be an actual immersion of the web.
     This is how we identify the metaverse - a place where a persistent virtual world meets virtual
     augmented reality, and Web3.0.

     Before we get into the vast technology aspects of the metaverse and the digital economy, it is
     vital to highlight some of the key motivating factors behind human needs because ultimately,
     this is what will determine the purpose of the technology as an enabler.

     Human behaviour and interaction have always been based on four key factors, namely social
     experiences, knowledge sharing and learning, transacting, and entertaining or being enter-
     tained. These interactions seldomly occur in isolation. In fact, we usually experience two or
     three of them simultaneously and, it is these key factors that will determine how technology
     will enable our connections.

     As we enter the next evolution of digital technology, there is no doubt that the metaverse will
     be influenced by how we interact, behave, and choose to represent ourselves in the world.
     Augmented and virtual realities are the essential technologies that will shape access to the
     metaverse while integrating real and simulated experiences to fulfil the key factors that motivate
     human connection. Opportunities for marketing in the metaverse also open innovation and
     experimentation for brands and users alike.

     In this chapter, we will explore the opportunities that the metaverse presents and its impact on
     marketing and business today. As a direct result of how technologies have responded to our
     intrinsic human needs, we will also explore how marketers will have to adjust their strategies
     alongside common pitfalls to avoid when using the metaverse for marketing.

    THE METAVERSE VS. THE MULTIVERSE

       The ongoing transformation of technologies is enabling us to connect and interact with each
       other and our environments in ways that we could only ever have imagined. Technology has
       caught up with fiction and it is now time to familiarise ourselves with the concepts of the
       alternate worlds in which we are venturing. Understanding some of the key differences between
       these `verses' can shed some much-needed light on how we navigate and make the most of
       them for the benefit of our customers and brand purpose.

          The concepts of the metaverse and virtual multiverse are currently in their infancy
          stages. Because we cannot predict the future or how these will be adopted, we are
          wary of defining them too narrowly. In the current context the metaverse is a concept
          for a connected virtual world, whereas the multiverse provides the potential for multiple
          digital ecosystems. While we are exploring the metaverse and multiverse in their current
          context, we are also cognisant of the progress and influence it will have in future on how
          the digital world evolves.

    The metaverse explained

       Considering the metaverse is meant to be the next evolution of the internet, there are several
       differing ideas and views of what it is going to be. It is meant to serve everyone, which is why
       it will be different for different people and their needs.

       According to the most cited definition of the metaverse by one of the industry's top metaverse
       influencers, Matthew Ball (2018, updated 2021 and 2022), the metaverse ... `is a massively scaled
       and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced
       synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual
       sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects,
       communications, and payments.'

       Even Ball, who ventured out to give his best shot at a definition, acknowledges that to provide
       a single all-encompassing definition of the metaverse is impossible, since this large-scale
       disruption is still in its infancy. It should, however, not be seen as virtual reality; rather as a
       shared digital environment where all digital actions can occur. Anyone can be part of the
       metaverse and participate in a specific event/place/activity. The metaverse is designed to be
       a social environment that requires users to create a virtual identity in the form of an avatar.

       The metaverse will become a fully functioning economy where individuals and businesses will
       be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for a range of so-called work. This body
       of work, for which the creators will have ownership, produces value which is recognised by
       others (Ball, 2020).

The opportunities that this opens up for marketing and brands, is best illustrated in the adidas
merch window where their new collection was a mix of digital and physical items, sold as
NFTs. Customers were able to buy virtual wearables to be used in, among others, The Sandbox,
but also the physical clothing, such as hoodies, and tracksuits to match (adidas.com/

In another example, Gucci, who wanted to        NOTE  You can read how certain brands

could view, try on, and buy digital Gucci
products to glam up their own blank avatars
before exploring the garden.

Some aspects of the metaverse are also already evident in virtual video game worlds. A
socialisation tool like Gather.town brings together multiple elements of our lives into online
worlds. These apps are not the metaverse, but are similar.

The multiverse explained

Multiverse literally means multiple universes. Based on the theory of a `many worlds' inter-
pretation (MWI), the multiverse is a concept of a pre-time era, before the Big Bang, where
multiple universes existed and ours was only one of many independent others. This science
of quantum mechanics claims that time is like the branches of a tree, where all possibilities
play out to every eventuality in an infinite number of parallel universes, rather than only one
straight or linear timeline that we understand in our universe. This theory, however, cannot be
verified by scientific testing.

If we, however, think of it as a virtual multiverse, it already exists in various online ecosystems.
In online gaming, Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft are examples of virtual multiverses, while
in business, Microsoft Mesh - a collaboration and communications platform developed by
Microsoft - may be an example of another. Universes in the multiverse operate independently
of each other, and do not offer a unified experience from one to the other.

The primary difference between multiverse and the metaverse is that each universe in the
multiverse is separate, whereas the metaverse is believed to encompass all universes in
one ecosystem - seamlessly unifying the experience from one universe to the next. The
metaverse is not a piece of sci-fi tech, but ` an intricate web of slowly developing pieces.'

    Why the hype around the metaverse?

       The metaverse presents massive opportunities for us to share value in a new way. Web3.0 shares
       this code and serves as the foundation for the metaverse, consisting of blockchain-enabled
       applications that are decentralised, aiming to support an economy of user-owned assets and data.
       As a result of the loss of trust in large organisations, governments, and big brands alike,
       responsible contributors and creators are aiming to decentralise the economic benefit from
       these institutions and shift it back to the people who are creating the artefact or digital items
       to reward their effort. At our very core, humans want to be valued and recognised for who
       we are and what we do. We want our time respected, and we want to share our value with
       people who create that value. The metaverse is enabling this by flipping the business model

to allow communities to share the economic benefits from the virtual worlds they help create
(Leonard, 2022).

The digital economy

The disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution combined with the COVID-19 pandemic has
increased our need for agility, adaptability, and positive transformation. As the global economy
digitalises, it is estimated that about 70% of new value created over the next ten years will be
based on digitally enabled platform business models (Charlton, 2022, World Economic Forum).

The economic activity will result from billions of everyday online connections between people,
businesses, systems, devices, and data. To sustain this hyperconnectivity, the digital economy
will need a solid backbone for the growing interconnection of people, organisations, and
machines on the internet. This is already taking shape and challenging conventional ideas of
how businesses should be structured and operate, from accepting payment methods to goods
and services delivery, and product experiences.

Cryptocurrency is changing how we transact and powering a new social economy to restore
control to content creators and consumers. Based on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency
is a decentralised digital ledger that records all exchanges and transactions in real time,
permanently, and publicly.

One of the most well-known blockchain-based currencies is Bitcoin. When a user buys Bitcoin,
the transaction is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the record is distributed to thousands
of individual computers across the globe. Ethereum is another public blockchain, and like
Bitcoin, is also transparent and programmable through a smart contract that essentially runs
software routines automatically when conditions are met. All transactions are available for
anyone to view, unlike traditional banking books.

Blockchain is also the foundation of digital currency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Specific
items like artwork and music on a blockchain are non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning they
are unique and non-transferable. Fungible items are currency, like a dollar that is worth the
same as another dollar, and can be swapped with other dollars.

Using a smart contract, one user can purchase a digital artwork from a seller for a set amount
of currency. Once the buyer accepts the fee, the exchange is completed using the blockchain.
If there is any dispute, the amount paid can be verified on the public record.

More than the smart transactions, the blockchain has everything to do with the metaverse; it
enables people to own digital assets and NFTs which ultimately interconnects the real world
and the virtual world through one experience. The blockchain is enabling seamless access from
one world into the other using cryptocurrency for access by authenticating proof of ownership.

                                                                                                                                    713

          One example of where digital meets real, is on Disrupp. They describe themselves as `A
          creative ecosystem combining art, collectibles & NFTs to merge realities across digital
          fashion and gaming.' This NFT marketplace collaborates with artists to create collections
          of collectibles that anyone can own and then use in the metaverse.

          Each Dissrup Drop, or piece of art, must comprise of 3 essentials, namely artworks, digital
          collectibles, and phygital collectables. Artwork is defined as single edition NFTs in line
          with the concept of each Dissrup release, whereas digital collectables are digital items,
          but in limited quantities. Phygital collectables are collectables that include a digital as
          well as a physical component.

          The digital collectables on Dissrup are affordable items that the owner can use to
          personalise their spaces or avatars on a gaming platform. As with some real art, they are
          done in limited runs. Phygital items are exactly what their name implies: a physical and
          a digital component, in this case collectables that include both a physical and a digital
          component. You can spruce up your metalounge with a digital state-of-the-art chair, but
          you can also chill on it in the physical world - craftspeople will bring these digital creations
          into your physical lounge. Read about Dissrup and how they are already combining our
          lived reality with the early iteration of the metaverse here: dissrup.com You will find the
          latest Drop by Dissrup here: dissrup.com/drops.

       In addition to establishing a creator economy for ordinary people on a global scale, the
       metaverse will offer innovations in communication for workplaces and educational institutions
       - a phenomenon that was already seen since 2020 when the world was gripped in a raging
       pandemic.

       There are, however, also some cons to this next best thing: the requirement of advanced
       digital technologies which is not a given in developing countries where the digital divide is
       still persisting. In addition, privacy concerns and security implications are notable metaverse
       pitfalls. To quote The conversation (2021): `Marginalised people often suffer the most harm from
       unintended consequences of new technologies. ... Avatars, the graphical personas people
       can create or buy to represent themselves in virtual environments, are being priced differently
       based on the perceived race of the avatar, and racist and sexist harassment is cropping up in
       today's pre-metaverse immersive environments.' Regulating tech will be part and parcel of the
       metaverse and all stakeholders will have to find the right balance between freedom of speech
       and freedom of expression, and something that is harmful.

       All involved will have to be cognisant of the pitfalls so that the vast opportunities that the
       metaverse presents, do not exclude ordinary, marginalised people on a global scale.

UNDERSTANDING THE METAVERSE ENVIRONMENT

We understand the metaverse to be a shared       NOTE  AR technology, in particular, can lead to

Since the metaverse is still in its initial stages,
we cannot comprehend the full extent of its capabilities yet. The seven layers that we unpack
here provide an understanding of what makes up the metaverse, each representing an important
part of the metaverse that cannot function entirely without the others.

The seven layers to the metaverse include experience, discovery, the creator economy, spatial
computing, decentralisation, human interface, and infrastructure.

     Experience

       According to Takyar, CEO of LeewayHertz (n.d.), the metaverse will not be limited to a 3D version
       of the real world for only viewing. Rather, it will be a true interpretation of the dimensions and
       distances of photorealistic graphic elements, with the potential to provide experiences that
       the real world cannot offer.

       For instance, well-known brands are putting their money into massive interactive live events
       hosted on platforms like Roblox and Decentraland, offering a glimpse of how events and
       activities in the metaverse can manifest interactivity. How this will differ from real life is that
       front-row ticket experiences will be open to anyone.

       The metaverse is all about experiences. From games and social interactions to shopping,
       theatre, and e-sports; the potential future metaverse can transform human experiences with
       its immersive and real-time space.

     Discovery

       This second layer is about experiential discoveries that result in a search and find approach to
       familiarise users with new experiences. On the one hand, users proactively look for information
       and experiences, and on the other, they receive information on what experiences await them
       in the metaverse.

       The discovery layer is the most beneficial for businesses. It is cost effective and relies on
       community-driven content (word of mouth, reviews, shared experiences, and testimonials) to
       get people to discover metaverse experiences.

     Creator economy

       Ultimately, the metaverse will create an immersive 3D world with interconnected virtual spaces
       that mirror reality. Powered by AR, VR, and similar technologies, the spaces will be designed
       to attract visitors who will be able to do virtually anything once in that space.

       Content creators will play an essential role in creating this new world and experts believe the
       metaverse will make the creator economy a multibillion-dollar industry. The creator economy
       will be made up of independent creative people who produce digital content, such as images
       and videos, e-books, webinars, art, and blog posts. They will use the metaverse to generate
       revenue by selling goods, displaying, and selling collections, collaborating with brands,
       and promoting them, influencing buying behaviour by posing in avatar fashion apparel and
       accessories, and so on.

          Whilst accepting that the metaverse can and will open a promising new market for the
          creator economy, it is still being heavily debated whether the metaverse is a good thing
          or if it will have negative effects on our future. Apart from the immersive experiences,

   the disappearance of geographical barriers, better online social interactions, upgraded
   social media, new business opportunities, improvements to online learning and education,
   positive impact on cryptocurrencies and NFTs, as well as new opportunities for financial
   gain, there are disadvantages. According to Bernard Marr, a world-renowned futurist
   there are some challenges that the metaverse will bring, such as privacy issues, health
   concerns, access inequality, desentisisation, and identity hacking (Marr, 2022). In addition,
   quick web availability is an obligatory necessity for taking part in the universe, whereas
   many individuals cannot afford the cost of a top-of-the-line VR headset for entering the
   metaverse.

Spatial computing

The launch of virtual assistants and ride hailing service apps in the spatial computing layer of
the metaverse has already made our lives easier. We've become accustomed to moving from
one location to another using an app that captures our real-life journey through a GPS tracker
and enjoyed the fun of trying on clothing virtually from the comfort of our own personal spaces.
Spatial computing combines AR, VR, and MR to bring the idea of the `metaverse' to life.

The vision of a parallel, three-dimensional, virtual universe that interacts with the real world
becomes possible with spatial computing. It allows us to interact with both the virtual and the
real world at the same time in real time.

Decentralisation

The metaverse is forecast to become a multi-trillion dollar part of the world economy. And,
like the internet in its current form, will not be under any one entity's control. First adopters
and large tech companies will however play an important role in the further development and
evolution of the metaverse.

Decentralising control and influence on how data and connections will be used by larger
entities will be a priority to ensure the security, privacy, and safety of users in the metaverse.
Blockchain technology will address privacy and data protection issues that might plague a
centralised metaverse and simultaneously, will also ensure authenticity and legitimacy of
interactions between users and businesses in the real and virtual worlds.

To realise the full potential of the metaverse, it will be necessary to maintain a transparent
and traceable way to perform transactions and interactions. Blockchain and crypto assets are
solutions for this issue, while NFTs are seem to ensure there are no asset ownership disputes
within the metaverse. Legal disputes have however, surfaced in the courts. One notable example
is Nike, which filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against StockX, an online marketplace,
in February 2022. Nike claimed that the reseller was offering up NFTs that display Nike's
trademarks without authorisation (Asso & Azaria, 2022, TFL). It is already clear that every

                                                                                                                                    717
                                AN TIC I PAT I N G

       brand and company will need a metaverse strategy and defined metaverse ethical policies to
       create experiences that transcend the world as we see it today.

          Bias, for instance, is emerging in AI as a result of prejudice data being fed into AI systems,
          bringing scientists to conclude that traditional algorithms were biased. The ethical roadmap
          for the metaverse is still being carved out. It will be interesting to see how moderation
          will be done on the metaverse, what the avatar's legal personality entails, or if ownership
          of virtual property and assets can be used as collateral in the real world.

     Human interface

       The layer that deals with the human interface refers to the hardware or devices that will allow
       users to experience the full extent of the metaverse. Over time, technology has been drawing
       us closer to our devices, which have been getting smaller, smarter, and portable. Inventions
       like smart phones, smart watches, and smart glasses are enabling us to connect and engage
       a lot more quickly and seamlessly from any location in the world.
       The fact that humans and machines are growing closer is necessary for an immersive, lifelike
       experience of the metaverse. With the advancement of spatial computing, we will likely be
       able to experience the metaverse as we do the physical world soon.

     Infrastructure

       This layer is made up of the technological infrastructure that will be required to create a fully
       functional and interoperable metaverse. According to Takyar (n.d. LeewayHertz), there are five
       groups of technology that drive the metaverse:
       · Computing power and network that includes spatial positioning algorithms, edge

           computing, GPU servers, real-time network transmission, and virtual scene fitting
       · Artificial intelligence
       · Video gaming technologies that include 3D game engines to create the resources, such

           as animations, sounds, and images
       · Display technologies that include AR, VR, and MR that are not only purposed for an

           immersive audio-visual experience, but also for the experience of users' evolving tastes
           and preferences over time
       · Blockchain technology that is supported by the decentralised value transfer mechanisms,
           settlement platforms, and smart contracts to assure value ownership and circulation.
           Through decentralisation an economic system that features transparency, efficiency, and
           stability will be realised.

The metaverse will have a massive impact           NOTE  Fortnite, a video game developed by

existing strategies that brands can use to secure        `try digitally, buy digitally' a step further:
their position in an evolving market.                    They sold a $12 virtual sneaker online

       used to create and build its audiences, engagement, and experiences are lessons that can
       contribute to effective brand building and marketing in the metaverse with voluntary participation.

      Game design and approach

       Successful gaming developers have been creating captivating game designs for decades. The
       greatest purpose of these designs is to fulfil the user's need to see how their actions progress
       to achieve results. There are four elements that interact with each other for a successful game
       design that's made up of story, aesthetics, mechanics, and technology (Schell, n.d.). As far as
       this concept goes for creating value for audiences, each of these will need to be solved for the
       game strategy approach that brand and marketing professionals will use for the metaverse.

       The story
       This requires an empathetic understanding of who the audience is, and how the brand is going
       to help them on their hero's journey. It is imperative that brands understand the user persona
       as well as the psychological journey that it wants to take them on for a better life experience.
       Creating an authentic story about the brand, and how the audience will experience it, is essential.

       Adopting the human-centred design or design thinking approach will assist in developing an
       authentic story. For this purpose, brands and marketers should answer the following questions:

       · What is your story?
       · Why are you telling this story?
       · How do you do that in a way that is authentic?
       · Who is the hero?

       The aesthetics
       People generally spend money to make themselves look good, which is why aesthetics is
       important for virtual experiences. It evokes desirable responses from the user when they
       interact with the interface. Because the metaverse environment is persistent and although not
       yet entirely VR, once technology allows for it, brands and marketers should prepare themselves
       to create visual experiences in line with what they want their audiences to experience.

       Many worlds are going to exist in the metaverse. Brands should consider what their digital twin
       will look like as an extension of the real world and develop a strategy for it. For this, a good
       understanding of both the real and virtual worlds, the users' avatars, and how they will interact
       with the brand, as well as how products and or services will be packaged and delivered, will
       need to be defined and designed.

       The mechanics
       The mechanics include the type of game and the actual physical system of how the game
       works, including rules of engagement that guide the user on how to achieve their goals, as well
       as the game's response to their actions. Every game has an economy of value in something.

It determines how players will be rewarded for reaching and exceeding levels, as well as
where they fail and need to try again. It is a straightforward relationship that gives users the
freedom to choose to participate, or not in certain activities, increasing the levels of voluntary
participation and engagement.

The technology
Technology is the least visible to users. For this, it is necessary to explore the practicalities
of virtual reality as an example, although there are major accessibility issues and constraints
around VR due to the limitations of devices. AR, however, is mature and ready to go, which
gives humans a visual contextual information layered over the real world. GPS is a good
example of this because it is digital information layered on top of the real world. It is a form of
AR that has billions of smartphones connected and AR-enabled. Brands should look at ways
of incorporating this into their strategies.

Each of these elements require a strategy. Each step forward in developing the brand experience
as it relates to game design will bring the brand closer to understanding what the future will
look for them in the metaverse. A serious gaming strategy, rather than a metaverse strategy,
will help brands become better prepared for the metaverse, especially in the initial stage of
its development. Take into consideration that 65% of Gen Z have spent money specifically
on virtual gadgets that are used in a game only. This illustrates the level of engagement the
metaverse has (Barrett, 2022).

Creating shared value

Brands need to think carefully about how they will share value that they uncover through data
insights with users in the metaverse because it's only then that they will get an exchange. The
aim is to keep people wanting to come back for more by offering them something of value - get
them engaged enough for them to choose to return.

Creating shared value can no longer be a distant vision, mission, or value. Instead, brands
need to adopt it as a belief and commitment, which is derived from a purpose-led business.
It's been proven that purpose-led businesses outperform those that are driven by short-term
profits, which is why it is more important now that brands adopt the shared value approach
and maintain voluntary participation.

Opportunities for brands in the metaverse

The consensus is that the metaverse will be positive for businesses. According to multinational
investment bank, J.P. Morgan, the market opportunity of the metaverse will be worth more
than $1 trillion in annual revenues (World Economic Forum, 2022).

We are already seeing early adoption from industry giants like Disney, Gucci, and Warner Bros,
who will likely be the ones who design the metaverse in line with their consumer needs and
business aspirations. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, our behaviour and social needs

                                                                                                                                    721

     determine what technology will do to support it. This is why businesses and brands should decide
     sooner rather than later if they will join the initial phase or wait to see how it plays out - and risk
     missing the opportunity to influence the design of the metaverse during the early stages.

     To reach customers in the metaverse, there are
     a few approaches that are not far off what we already know - the only difference is how we
     will interact with the information and data.

     Here are some of the ways brands are using the metaverse:

     · Engagement and awareness: Brand experiences through gaming are becoming popular.
         For instance, Nike has partnered with Roblox to create a game called Nikeland where users
         participate in games. Other brands have created their own games, where players can go
         on a quest or adventure to gather collectibles that may be exchanged for real life value. It's
         about creating engagement for the brand recognition and experience.

     · Special events: Using existing platforms like Fortnite and Roblox to virtually launch events,
         such as product or movie launches and concerts, has become a viable option for brands,
         especially since the pandemic and global lockdowns.

     · Marketing opportunities: Brands are looking at ways to use their memorabilia, logos, and
         virtual assets in the metaverse. For instance, Coca Cola auctioned off memorabilia for NFTs
         while Nike is looking at ways to trademark to produce and sell virtual branded apparel for
         avatars and the like.

     The metaverse will be a goldmine for growth marketers because of its data-driven capabilities
     through the virtual world on which it is built. The devices that it will be using, such as VR
     glasses, will generate masses data that may be used to promote value to the audience, both
     in the metaverse and in the real world. This means that the detailed behavioural patterns
     that will be tracked on VR devices may be used to connect with similar personas on real-life
     marketing channels.

     Note: `The metaverse will have a huge impact on growth marketing. Even if you don't plan
     to use the metaverse as a marketing platform, you can still use data from the metaverse
     to fuel your growth marketing strategy' (Barrett, 2022).

In essence, brands and marketers are using existing models to explore new, creative, and more
immersive ways to connect with their customers virtually and in real-life. This requires a new
way of thinking that revolves around the customer experience with careful consideration of
their needs and your brand authenticity.

WHEN THE METAVERSE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME MAINSTREAM

Currently, we are at the emerging phase of the metaverse. This stage includes commercially
available products and services like social networks, online games, ecommerce, cryptocur-
rencies, and NFTs. Depending on the application, these technologies may fulfil one or more
characteristics of the metaverse, but is still incomplete. It is going to take time for the concepts
to be adopted, given the challenges that currently exist related to access and adaptability.

How brands can prepare for the metaverse

Although the metaverse and Web3.0 present accelerated digital innovation, there are funda-
mental challenges in today's digital experiences that must be solved. These include digital
trust, equity, and capacity. According to the World Economic Forum, we have a long way to go
to address the challenges around trust online and how to identify real users from fake ones to
eliminate harassment, racism, manipulation, bullying, and cybercrime. Additionally, access to
quality internet globally is a challenge.

                                                                                                                                    723
                                AN TIC I PAT I N G

       This highlights the disparities between people and groups in the digital world and whether
       technology can meaningfully address inclusion in digital experiences. The gap between the
       technology haves and have nots will likely widen substantially if we don't find solutions in this
       phase of the metaverse and Web3.0.

    FUTURE OF MARKETING IN THE METAVERSE

       Creating and curating long-term value for businesses and brands is the responsibility of the
       board or directorship of a company. Leadership should be taking interest in the metaverse
       because of the extent to which it is being adopted at various levels across industries, including
       major technology giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft. Executive teams need to debate
       and plan for the implications of the metaverse on their businesses.

       Some of the key considerations that executive teams and CMOs should review, reflect, and
       decide on for the benefit of their businesses and stakeholders, include the following:

       · How will the company or brand participate in the metaverse? What will its position or
           standpoint be (e.g., contributor, investor, or creator)?

       · Gaming in virtual worlds has been around for several years and forms part of the metaverse.
           How users engage with the virtual world in a game presents an opportunity for business to
           adopt and explore similar strategies to connect with their audiences virtually and in real-life.

       · Shared value, brand purpose, and voluntary engagement will be priorities for marketing and
           stakeholder engagement going into the metaverse future. The gaming strategy approach will
           likely provide the most relevant insights for businesses to incorporate into their long-term
           visions and goals for future clients, deals, and transactions.

       · Businesses can learn from the value systems that underpin a variety of games that may
           inspire a strategy to engage audiences in the metaverse.

       · VR, AR, and MR are all elements of the metaverse that enable user engagement with the
           virtual world. Businesses or brands should consider each of these in the context of how
           they will contribute to its broader strategic goals, as well as how they will enable its use
           in the metaverse.

       · Businesses and brands need to be aware that gaming strategies require specialisation.
           Designing custom solutions for businesses in line with key trends and best practices will
           take time and requires specialist expertise.

     How to make the most of the metaverse

       We have now realised that, like the internet and other major technological advancements,
       the metaverse is reshaping the world as we know it. The greatest advantage is that it offers
       an immersive experience of the real and virtual worlds simultaneously, which will likely allow
       individuals and businesses to explore greater opportunities in a more cost-effective way.
       Brands will partner with gaming companies that have already paved most of its way to the
       metaverse. For instance, Balenciaga partnered with Fortnite and has accessories, such as

designer pickaxes, backpacks, and digital outfits available in its virtual boutique in Fortnite.
Nike partnered with Roblox to create Nikeland.

Because of the game-like nature of the interactive and immersive experiences, Gen Z are firmly
aligning themselves with many, and can be seen as the early adopters in the metaverse. This
opens a variety of possibilities to unlock greater human connections and brand engagement. To
make the most of the metaverse, based on what we currently know, we recommend prioritising
these key themes:

Leverage the metaverse for good: The possibilities that the metaverse present is an oppor-
tunity for us to set the tone and leverage it for good. There are no geographical restrictions
which makes global connections possible in a more realistic way. Considering the numerous
global challenges that we face, the metaverse makes it possible for us to garner support for
movements to address climate change, upskill and use training simulations for learning, and
collaborate more closely with teams in the real and virtual worlds.

Data driven insights: With lessons from Web2.0 where we learned how data was exploited
for the benefit of technology giants, the metaverse presents an opportunity to do better. The
sheer scale of data transfer in a three-dimensional world may raise potential risks and privacy
concerns, which is why it is important that industry leaders focus on leveraging the metaverse
for good, rather than short-term profit goals.

Human insights: Because the world will be more focused on authenticity and more meaningful
connection, human insights will serve as the prime reference point to shape the next frontier
of human experiences. Putting human interests and needs at the centre of the metaverse
ideation will serve as the moral compass to build trust into the ecosystem of virtual worlds, i.e.
human safety before brand safety, ensuring digital civility.

Brand purpose and value creation: Building

the brand and customer. It will take all the key

themes outlined here, together with the brand's commitment to generate authentic experiences

The unique skills needed for the metaverse

The metaverse requires a set of unique skills that we will need to practice and enhance to
navigate and create this virtual environment. These skills are not new to humans but are
unique to we conduct business, as well as how we create and exchange value going forward.

                                                                                                    725

                          embark on this journey into a three-dimensional, connective world
                          designed through technology and related elements.

                          is why efficient and proficient communication skills are necessary.

                          Dealing with an infinite amount of complexity will require a great deal
                          of positivity and motivation for everyone involved. Combined with the
                          other essential and unique skills for the metaverse, motivational skills
                          help drive desired results.

                          Improving the quality of decisions making requires problem-solving and
                          critical-thinking abilities that will be hugely beneficial for the metaverse,
                          especially in the initial phase where key questions are being asked, and
                          decisions are being made.

                          The willingness to learn and share knowledge will increase efficiency in
                          the metaverse, as well as create and share value for future growth and
                          development.

     Useful tactics for the metaverse

     While the metaverse is still experiential in nature, the opportunity to explore, create, and innovate
     is vast and diverse. To get started in the metaverse, brand and business leaders should look
     at what is available and practical now. There are platforms that are already enabling virtual
     environments, lending itself to what the vision of the metaverse will be like in the next few years.

     Some of the key characteristics of the metaverse is that it is always active (persistent), it
     exists in real time, users have individual activity, it is self-contained and fully functional in
     this state, consists of a mix of different virtual worlds, and enables user-generated content.

Useful tactics that brands and businesses should consider for the metaverse include, but are
not limited to:

· Identifying what your audience wants and if they are in the metaverse, discovering what
    they expect from it

· Deciding where your brand fits in with the large metaverse landscape, and consulting with
    metaverse veterans who are fully immersed in the virtual worlds to share their insights

· Experimenting with the metaverse by using private business or personal accounts to explore
    and experience what it offers

· Developing the expertise in-house or hiring people who are familiar with the environment
    to create it for your brand or business

· Focusing on the experience and what will work for your brand or business in the metaverse
    - ensuring that you protect and preserve your reputation both inside and out of the virtual
    world.

    ETHICS AND MARKETING IN THE METAVERSE

       New technologies that have endless possibilities must be carefully considered in terms of
       conduct and ethics. Currently, questions on ethics are almost as infinite as the metaverse
       itself, even though cyber laws, policies, regulations, and technology codes of ethics already
       exist. The metaverse presents a whole new level of engagement that will eventually connect
       the real world so closely to the virtual that one contemplates questions whether avatars would
       be accepted to represent oneself in virtual form, and whether all appearances are acceptable.

       While the legal fraternity study, examine, and determine the global and regional laws concerning
       the metaverse, marketers will need to examine how ethics and marketing will affect value
       creation for consumers who remain at the centre of it all.

       The time to take a refreshed look at a business' commitment to brand authenticity as well as
       social responsibility and environmental causes is now. Ethics and moral discipline for marketing
       in the metaverse will be essential to brands and their customers. Marketers will need to dedicate
       themselves to the greater good, rather than only the bottom lines, to deliver long-term value
       and sustain brand relevance into the future.

       Based on the set of standards for ethical norms and values set by the American Marketing
       Association, it is essential that we are reminded of the core values that govern marketing, namely:

       1. Marketers should do no harm. In that, embodying high ethical standards and adhering to
            all laws and regulations in the decisions we make is fundamental to this practice.

       2. Trust should be fostered in the marketing system. Avoid deception in product design, pricing,
            communication, and delivery of distribution.

       3. Hold on to ethical values. Build relationships while also enhancing consumer trust in the
            integrity of marketing by acknowledging these core values: honesty, responsibility, fairness,
            respect, transparency, and citizenship (AMA, 2021)).

 CASE STUDY: TABLE MOUNTAIN CABLEWAY TAKES DIGITAL TRIP

  One-line summary

   Due to lockdown regulations since 2020 and operational disruptions because of the
   weather, the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company (TMACC) launched an innovative
   addition to their offering that would allow anyone to have a virtual experience of the tour
   to the top of Table Mountain.

  The problem

   In summer, TMACC lost about 20% of the cableway capacity to the South Easterly wind.
   To solve this challenge, the company decided that a digital twin of the experience would
   meet the peak summer demand and serve additional purposes of attracting international
   audiences to this tourism destination.

  The solution

   A virtual experience of the cableway cart was created to give the customer the same
   butterfly effect of going up inside the cableway cart. This immersive experience looks and
   feels like the real experience. In this way the company not only offered the experience to
   anyone who could not be there, but also aligned itself with new technology.

  The results

   In addition to the commercial benefits to tourists and visitors, many children living in
   Cape Town and the Cape Flats who have never experienced the mountain before, now
   have access to the experience. For TMACC, being able to do outreach and inspire young
   people around them is invaluable. The virtual cableway cart experience is the best digital

    THE BIGGER PICTURE

       Decentralisation, infinite connections, and opportunities to create, explore, and experience a
       limitless reality are all enticing concepts for human curiosity and evolution. With the metaverse,
       it becomes possible in ways that we have not yet imagined. As the movement progresses and
       industry leaders gain ground in this dynamic space, we can expect to see erratic growth and
       innovation by new entrants and inventive creatives.

       The metaverse is expected to unlock an abundance of opportunities. As a result of lessons
       learned from Web2.0 as far as privacy and protection of personal information is concerned,
       there is a solid base that serves as reference for us not to repeat those mistakes. However, we
       are embarking on an unknown journey at this stage - a new frontier - that will require unique
       skills, a thorough understanding of human behaviour and interactions, customer experiences,
       and brand purpose. To navigate successfully, we need to keep our heads in the game and our
       hearts on our purpose.

    SUMMARY

       One of the pertinent things that we advocate for as far as brand building and customer
       engagement is concerned, is brand storytelling. Brands are about experiences, and creating
       a sense of belonging, and connectedness. It helps define our social statuses, which is why
       we do not pursue technology for its own sake, but rather use it to allow us to do things that
       we could not do before. The fundamentals of human interaction and what we value does not
       change; however, how we engage, evolves with the right enablement.

       Although there are plans and visions to create a virtual version of the real world in the metaverse,
       it is important that brand, marketing, and business leaders are not distracted by the technology,
       but rather remain focused on their customers and their purpose. It is important to plan and
       prepare for the metaverse and adapt to the changing environment.

       The metaverse has the potential to change the world, where people will be able to go to places
       they would never be able to go, explore things they would never be able to see, and feel things
       they would never be able to feel. We have come a long way since 1992 when Neal Stephenson
       coined the term metaverse in his novel Snow Crash. But we still have a long way to go, and
       while it is important to investigate these new opportunities and cool technology, we also have
       to stay grounded and understand the nature of other realities (The Crypto Pie, 2022).
