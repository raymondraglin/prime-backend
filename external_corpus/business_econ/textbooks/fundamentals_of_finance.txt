business or simply looking to understand how the world of
finance works, this book is your starting point. At its core,
finance is about making decisions under uncertainty. In this
book, you will explore different types of financial markets,
institutions and instruments and understand the purposes
that they serve. You will discover why a dollar today is worth
more than a dollar in the future and learn to apply the valuation
principle to evaluate debt and equity instruments. You will gain

 1. What is Finance?

Finance is concerned with the allocation and distribution of
monetary capital and risks amongst various entities. It is an

                                                Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance | 7
area of study that delves into how individuals, businesses, and
institutions value, obtain, and manage their financial resources.
Finance can be divided into four broad categories: Corporate
Finance, Investments, Financial Markets and Institutions and
Personal Finance. Let's explore each of these four areas of
Finance:

  · Corporate Finance is the study of how corporations make
      financial decisions in order to maximise their shareholders
      wealth. Essentially, corporate finance is about how
      corporations invest in real assets which generate income,
      how these assets are funded and how the income is
      distributed to shareholders.

  · Investments is the field that examines how individuals
      and managers allocate their assets over time under
      conditions of certainty and uncertainty. The goal of
      investments not only aim to maximise returns but do so in
      a manner that is consistent with the investor's objectives
      and tolerance for risk. The investment process often
      involves valuations, risk and returns analysis, constructing
      and evaluating portfolio performance.

  · Financial Markets and Financial Institutions is the study
      that focuses on understanding how financial markets
      operate, the various types of financial instruments that are
      traded, the structure and functioning of financial
      institutions and how they all contribute to the broader
      financial system.

  · Personal Finance is a field that examines the financial
      decisions of an individual or a household. This includes
      retirement planning, insurance, saving, insurance, tax
      planning and estate planning. Personal finance involves
      continuous learning and adjustment to adapt to life
      changes, economic shifts and individual circumstances.

2. Why study Finance?

Whether your aim is to land a high paying finance careers or
not, finance provides you powerful tools to understand and
navigate the interplay of market conditions and economic
forces. Studying finance is not just about managing money
but it is about making critical decisions in a world full of
uncertainties. For example, you have probably heard the
phrase "There is nothing such as a Free Lunch". So, in order
to earn a return, you have to take some risk. The more risks
you take, the higher returns you earn. Finance tells you that
not all risks are counted as equal. Some risks will enable you
to achieve higher returns, others will not. What about maybe
there is a "free" lunch i.e. investment opportunities that offer
high returns but very low or no risks. Are these opportunities
real? What is their chance of happening or repeating in the
future? What about legendary investors such as Warren Buffet,
Jim Simons or Peter Thiel? Are they lucky? Do they take higher
risks and what risks do they take? What investment strategies
do they follow? Finance offers essential insights that help you
addressing these questions.

3. How are businesses are formed?

In Australia, in order to operate a business, you need to decide
on its structure. Each structure has certain advantages and
disadvantages. The most suitable structure for your business
should be based on its scale and nature, as well as your
preferred management style. When starting or expanding your
business, you have the option to select from four fundamental
structures:

 1. A sole trader is a business structure that is known for its

                                                Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance | 9
      simplicity in setup and operations, offering complete
      control over assets and business choices. It benefits from
      minimal reporting obligations and is typically a cost-
      effective model. Sole traders can file tax returns using
      their personal tax file number (TFN). However, this
      structure carries the disadvantage of unlimited liability,
      meaning personal assets could be at risk if the business
      faces financial difficulties. Additionally, sole traders are
      personally responsible for paying tax on all income earned
      from the business.
2. A partnership is a business structure in which two or more
      individuals manage and operate a business in accordance
      with the terms and objectives set out in a Partnership
      Deed. The income or losses are shared among the
      partners according to the partnership deed.

          The partnership business structure is also known for its
          ease of establishment and cost-efficiency, often
          involving less complexity compared to forming a
          corporation. When forming a partnership, it is necessary
          to obtain a separate Tax File Number (TFN) for the entity,
          which is used for all tax-related matters. Additionally,
          partnerships must acquire an Australian Business
          Number (ABN) and utilize it in all their business dealings.
          The partnership itself is not subject to income tax.
          Instead, the tax responsibility is passed on to the
          individual partners, who each pay tax on their
          proportion of the net income generated by the
          partnership. Finally, if the business's turnover reaches
          or exceeds $75,000, the partnership must register for
          the Goods and Services Tax (GST). This structure allows
          individuals to pool their resources and expertise but also
          necessitates a high level of mutual trust and clear
          communication due to the joint responsibility for the

10 | Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance
         partnership's commitments. There are three principal
         forms of partnership:

 · General Partnership (GP): In this arrangement, all partners
     participate in the day-to-day management of the business
     and each partner has joint liability for the debts and
     obligations of the business. This means that each partner
     is individually responsible, as well as collectively with other
     partners, for the liabilities of the partnership.

 · Limited Partnership (LP): This form of partnership consists
     of both general and limited partners. The general partners
     manage the business and have unlimited liability for its
     debts, while the limited partners contribute capital and
     share in the profits but typically do not participate in
     managing the business. Limited partners' liability is
     restricted to the amount they have invested in the
     partnership.

 · Incorporated Limited Partnership (ILP): This form of
     partnership consists of both general and limited partners.
     The general partners manage the business and have
     unlimited liability for its debts, while the limited partners
     contribute capital and share in the profits but typically do
     not participate in managing the business. Limited
     partners' liability is restricted to the amount they have
     invested in the partnership.

3. A company is a form of a business structure where it is
     recognized as an independent legal entity, distinct from
     its owners or members, setting it apart from sole trader or
     partnership structures. Functioning much like an
     individual, a company is capable of incurring debt,
     initiating legal action, or being subject to legal claims.
     Shareholders of a company are typically not personally
     accountable for the company's financial liabilities. Their
     main financial responsibility is limited to paying any

                                              Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance | 11
      amount that may be outstanding on their shares if such a
      payment is requested. However, it's important to note that
      the company's directors can face personal liability if they
      do not fulfill their legal duties. Setting up a company can
      be a complex and costly endeavour. It is generally more
      suited to those who anticipate fluctuating business
      income and may benefit from the ability to carry forward
      losses to offset future profits. This structure is often
      favoured by those seeking to reinvest earnings into the
      business or plan for a long-term investment, due to the
      protections and potential tax advantages it can offer. If the
      company's turnover reaches or exceeds $75,000, you are
      required to register for the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
      Non-profit organizations have a higher threshold set at
      $150,000 for GST registration.
4. A trust is a structure where a trustee carries out the
      business on behalf of the trust's members (or
      beneficiaries). In a trust structure, the trustee, who may be
      an individual or a company, holds and manages the
      business for the benefit of other parties, known as
      beneficiaries. This trustee bears full responsibility for all
      aspects of the trust, including both its income and any
      losses. Setting up a trust structure is typically costly and
      complex, often chosen to safeguard business assets for
      the beneficiaries' advantage. The trustee is charged with
      the decision-making regarding the distribution of
      business profits among the beneficiaries. Due to the
      intricate nature of trusts, establishing one requires
      significant time, expertise, and careful planning.

The following diagram summarises the key differences
between business structures:

4. What is the objective of a corporation?

Shareholders want managers to maximise the market value of
the firm. A smart and effective manager makes decision that
increase the current value of the company's shares, thereby
enhancing the wealth of its shareholders. This is known as the
principle of shareholder wealth maximisation.

4.1 How do we measure the value of the

                         Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance | 13
firm?

There are various methods for valuing a corporation. One of the
most common and straightforward approaches is to calculate
the firm's market capitalisation. This is done by multiplying
the current share price of the company by its total number of
outstanding shares.

   This can be calculated using online share market data from
sites such as Yahoo Finance. Using data from here, on on 8/
01/2023 the market capitalization of Telstra can be calculated
as: 3.9050 * 11.55 (billion) = 45.1 billion dollars. Have a look at
todays data to see how Telstra's market capitalisation has
changed.

   There are other methods to measure a company's value, such
as using revenue multiples, earnings multiples, or more
complex valuation techniques like discounted cash flow
analysis. Each method has its own advantages and is suitable
for different types of analysis or investment decisions. The
choice of valuation method can depend on the nature of the
company's business, the availability of financial data, and the
specific goals of the valuation.

4.2 Is maximising the value of the firm
equivalent to maximising profit?

Maximising the value of a firm and maximising profit are
related but not equivalent. Profit is not cash and maximising
profit refers to the short-term goal of increasing a company's
earnings or profits. It involves strategies to enhance revenue
and reduce costs without consideration the risks to future cash
flows by doing so.

   Maximising the value of the firm is a broader and more long-
term objective. It involves increasing the overall worth of the

14 | Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance
firm to its shareholders, which encompasses not just current
profits but the future cash flows and its associated risks. This
approach considers factors like market expansion, innovation,
customer loyalty, and brand strength.

   In essence, while maximising profit is about making the
most money in the short term, maximising the value of the
firm is about increasing the overall worth of the business in
the long run. The latter includes building sustainable business
models, investing in growth opportunities, managing risks
effectively, and maintaining a strong reputation, all of which
contribute to long-term shareholder value.

4.3 Do managers always maximise the
value of the firm and act in the best
interests of shareholders?

While managers are expected to act in the best interest of
shareholders by maximising the value of the firm, they may
not always do so. This discrepancy leads to what is known as
agency problems. Agency problems arise when there is a
conflict of interest between the needs of the principal (in this
case, the shareholders) and the agents (the managers). Since
managers are hired to run the company on behalf of the
shareholders, their decisions should align with the
shareholders' interest in maximising firm value. However, this
alignment does not always happen due to several reasons:

  · Divergence of goals: Managers may have personal goals
      that differ from the goal of shareholder wealth
      maximization. For instance, they might be more
      interested in expanding the company size to enhance
      their personal power and status, even if it's not in the best
      financial interest of the shareholders.

                                               Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance | 15
  · Risk Preferences: Shareholders typically have diversified
      portfolios and may prefer riskier strategies that promise
      higher returns, while managers, whose personal wealth
      (like stock options, job security) is tied to the company,
      may prefer safer, less profitable strategies.

  · Short-Term Focus: Managers might focus on short-term
      achievements to enhance their reputation or achieve
      short-term performance targets, while shareholders
      generally benefit more from long-term strategic planning
      and investments.

To mitigate these agency problems, various mechanisms can
be employed:

  · Performance based incentives: Aligning managers'
      compensation with shareholder interests, such as
      granting stock options or bonuses tied to company
      performance, can encourage managers to work towards
      maximizing shareholder value.

  · Corporate Governance: Effective governance structures,
      including a strong, independent board of directors, can
      oversee and limit managerial actions that do not align
      with shareholder interests.

  · Market Discipline: The threat of takeover or shareholder
      activism can also serve as a check on managerial
      decisions.

  · Regulatory Oversight: Regulations and legal frameworks
      can set standards for managerial behaviour and protect
      shareholder rights.

16 | Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance
4.4. Does the pursuit of increasing a
corporation's shareholder wealth conflict
with social objectives?

Maximising the value of the firm and pursuing social objectives
can sometimes appear to be in conflict, but actually, they are
complementary. Traditionally, maximising shareholder value
often focuses primarily on financial returns. This perspective
can lead to a perceived conflict with social objectives, as actions
beneficial for short-term profits may not align with social or
environmental well-being. For example, cost-cutting measures
might increase profits but could also lead to reduced workforce
welfare or environmental harm.

   A more modern approach integrates social objectives into
the definition of corporate objective. This perspective, often
associated with the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria,
argues that addressing social and environmental issues can
be beneficial for long-term corporate objective. Sustainable
practices can enhance a company's reputation, improve
stakeholder relations, and mitigate risks associated with social
and environmental issues, thereby potentially increasing long-
term shareholder value.

   The stakeholder theory posits that companies should serve
not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including
employees, customers, and the community. By addressing the
needs and concerns of a broader group, companies can build a
more sustainable and ethical business model that, in the long
term, can also maximise shareholder value. In summary, short-
term profit maximization can conflict with social objectives,
but in the long term, integrating social goals may be essential
for sustainable profitability and resilience.

4.5 What are the key decisions made by
managers to maximise the value of the firm
and hence the wealth of its shareholders'?

Managers maximise the firm's value by making a number of
key corporate policies. These decisions are considered as key
corporate policies because each of them has a direct impact on
the firm's value.

The BIG THREE

Image: The big three decisions in companies

 1. Investment decisions
The investment decision sometimes is referred to as the capital
budgeting or capital expenditure (CAPEX). It involves the
acquisition, management and disposal of real assets. Real
assets are assets that produce cash flows for a corporation
through their productive use. These include tangible items like
oil fields, land, and factories. Additionally, corporations invest
in intangible assets such as research and development (R&D),
advertising, and the development of computer software. These

18 | Chapter 1 - Introduction to Finance
expenditures are considered investments because they
contribute to the development of know-how, brand
recognition, and reputation.

2. Financing decisions

To finance its investments, a corporation can obtain funds
either from lenders or from shareholders. When borrowing,
the corporation receives cash from lenders and commits to
repaying the debt along with interest. If shareholders provide
the funding, they are not guaranteed a specific return; instead,
they receive any future dividends the company may distribute.
The decision of choosing between debt and equity financing is
referred to as the capital structure decision. The term "capital"
denotes the firm's sources of long-term financing.

 3. Payout decisions

Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, others
do not. Payout policy answer a series of questions: "Should the
company pay cash to its shareholders, how much and what
are the mechanisms a corporation can use to distribute cash
to its shareholders". Corporations pay out cash by distributing
dividends or by buying back some of their outstanding shares.
Cash rich companies are more inclined to pay dividends
whereas growth-oriented companies, often without a history of
dividend payments are less likely to initiate such payouts in the
near future.

      Takeaways and looking ahead

        In the first chapter, we delve into on what finance is,
     why it is important and perhaps interesting at the
     same time. We start to embark on a journey of
     someone who is contemplating to open a business and
     having to decide on the best structure for his/her
     business. We also explore the corporate objectives.
     Given manager's goal is to maximise the value of the
     company and hence the wealth of their shareholder, do
     they always do so? Is the value maximization objective
     contradicting with the social objectives and what are
     the key corporate decisions that will exert a significant
     influence on the company's value. In the next, chapter,
     we will examine the concept of Valuations i.e. the time

1. Basic Principles of Finance

In finance, we focus on cashflows, not accounting profit. There
are two types of cashflows: cash receipts are denoted as cash
inflows while cash payments are denoted as cash outflows.
When assessing investment opportunities, financial managers

22 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
are not only concerned with the magnitude of the cashflows
but also the timing and risks of these expected cashflows. The
overarching principle that influences how managers value
future cashflows and hence what investment decisions to
make is the time value of money which states that "A dollar
received today is always worth more than a dollar received in
the future".

1.1 Why is a dollar today always worth more
than a dollar in the future?

The reason is money available today can be invested and grow.
When someone invests, they expect to be compensated in
some form of "returns" but how large should these returns be?
There are three components that make up the rate of returns.

   First, by investing, the investor is deferring consumption
today in anticipation of consuming more in the future. That
is, the investment has to grow in real terms in order for the
investor to consume more. Second, when an individual's
money is tied up in investments, the value of that money can
be eroded by inflation. Thus, the rate of return has to be high
enough to also cover the inflation rate. Finally, there may be
risks associated with the investment. The future returns on an
investment are not guaranteed and there is a possibility of
not receiving the expected return, or in worse case scenarios,
losing the initial capital. Investments that carry higher risks
typically need to offer higher returns to attract investors. Taken
together, the invested funds should yield a return that
compensates for the delay in consumption, inflation and risk.

       Total Return = Inflation rate + Real interest rate + Risk
                                        premium

                                         Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values | 23
1.2 What about interest rate? Is it a form of
return?

Interest refers to the return on debt investment, where the
investor lends money to an entity (such as a corporation,
government, or financial institution) in exchange for the
promise of future repayments. Interest rate is often expressed
as a % per annum (p.a).

   Example: Suppose you invest $100 in a bank account that
pays interest of r = 6% a year. In the first year, what is the
interest that you earn and what is the value of your
investment?

   Answer: In the first year, the interest that you earn will be
0.06 * $100 = $6. The value of your investment will grow to $100
+ $6 = $106 or $100 * (1+0.06) = $106.

2. Present and Future Values

2.1 Terminology

Before we proceed, let's introduce some terminology:

  · Nominal interest: is the stated interest rate on a financial
      product or investment e.g. 5% p.a.

  · Principal refers to the amount of borrowing or lending.
  · Time to maturity: is the duration from the current date

      until the date when the principal amount of a debt
      instrument is due to be repaid in full.
  · Present value (PV) is the current worth of a future sum of
      money or stream of cash flows given a specific discount
      rate.
  · Future value (FV) is the value of a current asset at a

24 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
      specified date in the future, based on an assumed rate of
      return over time.
  · A discount rate refers to the rate of return used to
      discount future amounts of money, converting them into
      their equivalent present value.

2.2 Why is it necessary to distinguish
between present and future values?

The distinction is crucial because these concepts serve unique
purposes in financial decision-making. Present value helps in
understanding the current worth of money that will be
received or paid in the future which is vital for comparing the
value of cash flows occurring at different times. Conversely,
future value is used to determine how much a current sum
of money will grow overtime. This assists in forecasting the
growth of current investments which is crucial for long-term
planning and setting realistic financial goals. Both concepts
are grounded in the time value of money principle.

   Example: Let's say you decide to deposit $100 into an account
offering a 5% p.a. After one year, your investment grows to $100
multiplied by (1 + 0.05), which equals $105. Hence, the amount
of $105 represents the future value of your $100 investment
over a year, at a 5% annual interest rate.

   Conversely, the $100 can be considered as the present value
of $105, discounted back one year at a 5% annual rate. As an
investor, if you know that the interest rate is 5% p.a then you are
indifferent between receiving $100 now or $105 one year from
now.

   The process of going from the present value to the future
value is called compounding, whereas the method of
translating future amounts back to the present is referred to as
discounting.

2.3.  Present and Future Values

2.3.1 Calculating present and future value

The methods used to determine present and future values vary
based on the kind of interest rate arrangement in place.
Broadly speaking, there are two types of interest rate
arrangements: simple interest and compound interest.

   Simple interest is a method of accruing interest where the
interest charge is calculated solely on the principal amount.
Interest does not compound, interest earned is not reinvested
to earn additional interest. The principal amount remains
unchanged throughout the term of the loan or investment.
Simple interest is often used in short-term borrowing and
lending where the horizon is less than 1 year.

   Compound interest is the method by which interest earned
on a principal amount is reinvested, so that in subsequent
periods, interest is then earned on the new principal, which
includes the previously earned interest. This compounding

26 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
effect leads to the principal amount growing over time,
allowing the investor to earn "interest on interest".

   Example: What is the future value of $100 at the end of year
1 with interest rate of 6%?

   Interest earned during the year will be $100 * 0.06 = $6. The
future value or value at year 1 will be FV1 = $100 + $100 * 0.06
= $106. In this case, both simple and compound interest yield
the same results.

                          Principal = PV = 100
                                r = 0.06 p.a.
                                     n = 1

                      FV1 = 100 * (1 + 0.06) = 106

What is the future value of $100 at the end of year 2?

For compound interest, the interest will be calculated on the
$106 balance. The interest earned during year 2 will be 0.06 *
$106 = $6.36. Hence the future value or value at year 2 will be
FV2 = $106 + $106 * 0.06 =112.36.

   For simple interest, the interest will be calculated on the
initial principal which does not change over time. So, the
interest earned during year 2 is still 0.06 * $100 = $6. The future
value or value at year 2 will be $106 + $100 * 0.06 = $112.

Principal = PV = 100                Principal = PV = 100

r = 0.06 p.a.                       r = 0.06 p.a.
   n = 2                               n = 2
   Compound interest FV2 = FV1 *       Simple interest FV2 = FV1 + 100

(1 + 0.06)                          * 0.06
   = 100 * (1 + 0.06) * (1 + 0.06)     = 100 + 100 * 0.06 +100 * 0.06
   =100 * (1 + 0.06)2                  =100 * (1 + 0.06 * 2)
   =112.36                             =112

                      Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values | 27
The difference of $0.36 is due to interest on interest under the
compounding interest arrangement.

   What is the future value of $100 at the end of year 5?

Year  Compound interest
1     100.00 * (1+0.06) = 106.00
2     106.00 * (1+0.06) = 112.36
3     112.36 * (1+0.06) = 119.10
4     119.10 * (1+0.06) = 126.25
5     126.25 * (1+0.06) = 133.82

      FV = PV (1+i)n = 100 * (1.06)5 = 133.82

As the investment horizon increases, the difference in future
values between compound and simple interest arrangements
becomes wider. This is because compound interest earns
interest on the interest already earned, while simple interest
only earns interest on the principal amount.

   Future value formula for compound and simple interest:

      Equation 1:

          Equation 2:
28 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
Where:

  · FV = value of investment at the end of period n
  · PV = original principal (P0) or present value
  · i = the rate of interest per period
  · n = the number of periods

2.3.2 Future value and compounding frequency

Compounding frequency refers to how often the interest on
an investment or loan is calculated and added to the principal
balance. This frequency can significantly impact the amount
of interest accrued over time. The more frequently interest is
compounded, the more interest is earned on the interest
already accumulated. Common compounding frequencies
include:

   Annual compounding: Interest is compounded once a year.
This is the simplest form of compounding. For example, with an
annual interest rate of 5%, $100 compounded annually would
grow to $105 after one year.

   Semi-annual compounding: Interest is compounded twice
a year. Interest is paid and added to the principal two times
per year. The interest rate per period is the annual interest
rate divided by two since it is the rate that is applied every six
months.

   For example, with an annual rate of 6%, a principal of $100
would earn 3% interest (half of 6%) in the first six months, and
then the new amount ($103) would earn another 3% for the
second half of the year.

                                         Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values | 29
   Quarterly compounding: Interest is compounded four times
a year. The annual rate is divided by four, and this rate is applied
every quarter.

   Monthly compounding: Interest is compounded every
month. The annual rate is divided by 12, and this monthly rate
is applied to the balance each month.

   The formula for compound interest considering different
compounding frequencies is:

          Equation 3:

Where:

  · m = Number of compounding periods in a year
  · n = Number of years in the entire period

Example: You have $1,000 to invest in a bank account paying
an interest of 5% p.a. What is the value of your investment after
10 years if interest is compounded annually, semi-annually,
quarterly and monthly.

   Answer: i = 0.05, with annual compounding, m = 1, m x n = 10
x 1 =10. The above formula yields a future value of $1,628.89. For
semi-annual compounding, the future value is $1,638.62 (m = 2,
m x n = 20, i = 0.05/2 = 0.025). Similarly, the future value under
quarterly and monthly compounding is $1,643.62 and $1,647.01,
respectively. This example demonstrates how more frequent
compounding can lead to greater accumulation of wealth due
to the "interest on interest" effect.

   In fact, the above formula and the one in equation 2 are
equivalent. I is the interest rate per period and n is the number

30 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
of periods. If nominal interest is 5% p.a but compounding every
quarterly then the interest per period is 5%/4 = 1.25%. If the
investment horizon is 10 years but interest payment is
calculated every quarter then the number of periods in
quarters is 40. Note that i and n has to match. If interest is on
a per quarter period, the number of periods should also be the
number of quarters.

2.3.3 Present value and discounting

The future value is calculated by determining how much the
present value will grow to over a certain period. Conversely,
the present value is calculated by determining how much a
future amount of money worths in terms of today's dollars.
The method of converting the future value back to the present
is called discounting. In other words, the present value is the
discounted value of future cash flows.

   Present value can be calculated using equation 4:

          Equation 4:

The formula illustrates that as n increases, PV decreases. The
value a dollar in the future decreases if it is received later in
the future. The higher the discount rate i, the lower the present
value. The discount rates reflect the opportunity cost of capital
i.e. the potential return that investors forgo when they choose
to invest their resources in one option over an alternative. It is
the rate of return the investor could have earned by putting his/

                                          Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values | 31
her money into the next best investment. Therefore, the higher
the discount rate, the less valuable a future dollar is today as
investors prefer to receive money sooner rather than later if
they can earn a higher return on that money elsewhere.

   Example: You're planning a vacation in five years and
anticipate it will cost $10,000. Given a 5% annual interest rate
from the bank, how much should you deposit now to ensure
you have the $10,000 needed for the trip in five years?

Answer: Applying equation 5, where FV5 = $10,000; i= 0.05, n=5.

          Equation 5:

   So, you need to deposit $7,835 into the bank now in order to
receive $10,000 in 5 years.

32 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
2.3.4 Other applications

Due to the time value of money, cash flows at different times
cannot be simply summed up in their nominal amounts. To
compare or aggregate them, they must be adjusted to a
common point in time, either through discounting to present
value or compounding to a future value. For example, if you
receive $100 today and another $100 in a year, you can't just
add them to say you have $200 at today's value. If the annual
interest rate is 5%, the $100 received a year later is actually
worth less today. Using discounting, its present value would be
around $95.24. So, in today's terms, you would have $195.24, not
$200.

   From equation 2, if you know future value, interest rate and
time periods, you can work out present value. In generally,
knowing any three variables will enable you to figure out the
fourth one. For example, in 2012, Facebook (now Meta) went
public with the price of $38 per share. In 2024, the current price
of Meta is $374 per share. What is the annual rate of return did
the investors who bought the shares at $38 at the IPO and hold
them until January 2024?

   Answer: Applying the formula in equation 2 where FV = $374,
PV = $38, n = 12. The missing variable is r. $374 = $38 * (1 +r)12.
(1+r)12 =374/38 = 9.8421. (1+ r) = 9.84211/12

   R= 1.2099 - 1= 20.99% or 21% per year.

2.4 Annual percentage rate versus
effective annual rate

Interest rates in financial markets can be presented in several
forms, with the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) being the most
common, particularly when dealing with banks. The APR is
based on the assumption of once-a-year compounding.

                                         Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values | 33
However, this doesn't truly reflect the `effective' interest rate if
we're evaluating loan terms that compound more frequently.

   The more precise way to gauge the yearly rate, accounting
for the impact of multiple compounding periods within the
year, is to use the Effective Annual Rate (EAR). The EAR is
essentially the actual yearly growth rate that includes the
effects of compounding. This rate provides a genuine measure
of the cost associated with borrowing or the real yield from
lending when compounding is more frequent than annually.

   For example, if a bank quotes an APR of 6% with semi-annual
compounding, the EAR would be higher than 6% because the
interest is compounded twice a year, not once. To calculate the
EAR from the APR in this scenario, you would use the formula
to adjust for the effect of compounding. The calculation would
show that the EAR is approximately 6.09%, which is the true
cost of the loan or the actual yield on an investment over the
year, taking into account the compounding effect.

          Equation 6: Effective annual rate formula

M is the frequency of compounding periods within a single
year, indicating how often interest is calculated and added to
the balance over that year. Effective Annual Rate (EAR) provides
a more precise measure of the annual interest rate, factoring in
the effects of the compounding periods.

   Example: Suppose your mortgage comes with a stated
annual interest rate of 8% per annum; however, the
repayments are structured on a monthly basis. You'd want to
know the actual yearly interest rate the bank is effectively

34 | Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values
applying to your loan. This is determined by calculating the
Effective Annual Rate (EAR), which takes into account the
monthly compounding of interest.

   Applying the above formula where m = 12, APR = 8%, so the
monthly interest rate is 8%

Quoted versus effective annual interest rate:

Frequency  Quoted Annual  n Formula            Effective Annual
           Rate                                Rate
                          1 I                  10%
Annual     10%            2 (1+i/2)2-1         10.25%
                          12 (1+i/12)12-1      10.47%
Semi-annual 10%           365 (1+i/ 365)365-1

Daily      10%

Continuous 10%

Continuous compounding is used in other more advanced
finance subjects (such as derivatives).

Takeaways and looking ahead

       In this chapter, we define and describe the
                                       Chapter 2 - Present and Future Values | 35
     implications of the time value of money. We also
     explore the process of compounding and discounting.
     Finally, we distinguish between the stated (nominal)
     annual interest rates, which do not take into account
     the frequency of compounding within a year, and
     effective annual interest rates which do reflect
     compounding effects, thereby offering a true reflection
     of the annual interest rate.

3.1 Mixed cash flow stream

3.1.1 Future value of cash flow streams

Financial managers frequently need to evaluate series of cash
flows that occur in future period. From the last chapter, the
future value (FV) of a series of cash flows cannot be found by
simply summing them up. Each individual cash flow needs to
be converted to a common point in time in the future and then
sum up. The following example illustrates this principle:

   Mary wants to determine the balance in an investment
account earning 9% annual interest. She makes the following
ends of year deposits as follows: $500 in year 1, $900 in year 2,
$400 in year 3, $700 in year 4.

   Where i = 9%:

   The future value of this stream of cash flow can be found by
bringing the value of each of the cash flow to year 4.

   FV = 500×(1+0.09)3 + 900×(1+0.09)2 + 400×(1+0.09)1 + 700
             = 647.51 + 1069.29 + 436 +700
             = $2,852.8

3.1.2 Present value of multiple cash flows

Just as with future value, the present value (PV) of multiple
cash flows is determined by summing up the present values of
each individual cash flow. Each cash flow is discounted back to
the current period to reflect its value in today's terms.

38 | Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications
   For example, if you expect to receive $100 in one year, $200
in two years, and $300 in three years, and the discount rate is
5%, you would discount each of these cash flows back to their
present value. The sum of these present values would give you
the total current worth of your future cash flows.

   Where i = 5%

   PV = 300/(1+0.05)3 + 200/(1+0.05)2 + 100/(1+0.05)
   = 285.71 + 181.41 + 95.24
   =$562.36

3.2 Annuity: A special case of level cash
flows

An annuity is a stream of equal periodic cash flows over a stated
period of time. This stream of cash flows can represent regular
inflows from an investment or outflows as committed
expenses that need to occur in the future. Annuities are often
associated with retirement income, however, their application
is not limited to retirement income. Rather mortgage
payments, insurance premium, rent and lease payments can
all be classified as annuities.

   For a stream of cash flows to be qualified as an annuity, it
needs to meet three conditions:

  · The amount of cash flows are the same each period.
  · The interval between each cash flow is the same.
  · The cash flows occur for a fixed amount of time i.e. they do

      not go on forever.

              Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications | 39
There are two types of annuity:
   Ordinary annuity: is an annuity where cash flows are received

and paid at the end of each period. Example: mortgage
repayments, salaries, insurance premiums.

   Annuity due: is an annuity where cash flows are received
and paid at the beginning of each period. Example: tuition
payment, rent.

3.2.1 The future value of an ordinary annuity

The future value of an ordinary annuity refers to the amount of
money that will be accumulated in the future when a series of
equal payments are made at the end of consecutive periods at
a certain interest rate.

   Here is the timeline of the cashflows for an ordinary annuity:

   To calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity, one
option is to bring each of the cash flow to the future i.e. end of
period 5 and add them up just like any other stream of cash
flow. However, there is a quicker way. The future value of an
ordinary annuity can be computed according to the following
formula:

          Equation 1:

40 | Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications
Where:

  · FVA: future value of an annuity,
  · i: interest rate per period,
  · CF: cash flow each period and
  · n: number of the periods.

Example: Suppose you are saving for retirement and decide
to deposit $1,000 into your retirement fund at the end of each
year for the next 20 years. Assume the retirement fund offers
an annual interest rate of 5%. At the end of year 20, what is the
balance of your retirement account?

   Since the deposits are made at the end of each year over
a span of 20 years, this pattern of payment qualifies as an
ordinary annuity and the formula in Equation 1 can be applied
to calculate the accumulate amount at the end of the 20th
year. The example also shows that when cash flows happen for
a long period of time, bring each cash flow to the future is very
time consuming and hence not realistic. Equation 1 offers a far
better alternative.

   Answer: N = 20, i = 5% and CF = 1000.
   Future value factor is (1 + 0.05)20 -1 = 1.6533
   FV = 1000 * 1.6533/0.05 = $33,066

               Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications | 41
3.2.2 The future value of an annuity due

For annuity due, the cash flow pattern is very similar to the
ordinary annuity. The only difference is each payment occurs
at the beginning of the period rather than in the end. The
timeline of the cashflows for an annuity due is as follows:

   In an annuity due, each payment accrues interest for an
additional period compared to an ordinary annuity, because
payments in an annuity due are made at the beginning rather
than at the end of each period. Consequently, the future value
of an annuity due will always exceed the future value of an
ordinary annuity when both have identical cash flows and the
same duration.

   The future value of an annuity due is therefore:

          Equation 2:

Example: Suppose you are saving for retirement and decide to
deposit $1,000 into your retirement fund at the beginning of
each year for the next 20 years. Assume the retirement fund
offers an annual interest rate of 5%. At the end of year 20, what
is the balance of your retirement account?

42 | Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications
   Answer: The only difference between this example and the
above example is the deposit is made at the beginning of each
period instead of the end. This stream of cashflow is therefore
classified as an annuity due and the future value can be
calculated as:

   Future value of an annuity due = Future value of an annuity *
(1 + i)

   = 33,066 * (1+0.05) = $34,719.3

3.2.3 Present value of an ordinary annuity

The present value of an ordinary annuity measures the current
worth of a series of future periodic payments at a given interest
rate. It answers the question: "How much would I have to invest
today to receive a certain payment amount at regular intervals
for a specified period, given a particular interest rate?"

   The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is
given by:

          Equation 3:

Example: If you require $5,000 every month to live for the next
              Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications | 43
20 years starting by next month. How much money should you
deposit into your account now if the bank is paying an interest
of 6% p.a?

   Answer: The sum you need upfront is essentially the present
value of an ordinary annuity, with each payment being $5,000.
Since the payments are monthly over 20 years, you have a total
of 240 payment periods (12 months x 20 years). The monthly
interest rate is 0.5% (which is the annual rate of 6% divided by
12 months).

   Applying the formula in equation 3, CF = $5,000, (1 + 0.005)240
is 0.3021. PV = 5000 (1 - 0.3021)/0.005 =$697,903.86.

   In order to receive $5,000 per month starting from the next
month, you need to deposit $697,903 today if the bank is
paying an interest of 6% p.a.

3.2.4 Present value of an annuity due

Just as with the future value, the present value of an annuity
due is obtained by adjusting the present value of an ordinary
annuity forward by one additional period.

   The formula for the present value of an annuity due can be
given by:

          Equation 4:

Example: Suppose you still require $5000 monthly payment to

44 | Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications
fund your lifestyle expenses for the next 20 years with the first
payment needed immediately. How much you need to deposit
now if the bank is paying an interest of 6% p.a?

   Answer: Since the first payment is required immediately, this
stream of cashflow is classified as an annuity due. The first
payment happens at month 0 while the last payment happens
at month 19. The present value of an annuity due can be
obtained by compounding the present value of an ordinary
annuity one more period.

   PV of an annuity due = PV of an ordinary annuity * (1 + i)
   = 697,903 * (1+0.005) = $701,595.38.
   Similar to future value, the present value of an annuity due is
always higher than the present value of an ordinary annuity.

3.2.5 Application of an annuity formula

The application of an annuity extends beyond calculating
present and future value. The formula allows investors to
establish monthly payment amounts, discern the growth or
discount rate necessary to reach a specified future sum, or
determine the duration required for an investment to mature
to a desired lump sum. The annuity equation comprises four
variables; by knowing any three, the remaining one can be
deduced by rearranging the equation.

   Example: You need $200,000 as a deposit to buy your new
home. If the interest rate is 6% p.a and you can only put aside
maximum $3,500 per month towards this saving goal. How
long will it take you to achieve your initial deposit for your
home? Assume the first payment will start 1 month from now.

   Answer: $200,000 is the Future Value that your monthly
payments will grow to. Interest per period is 0.06/12 = 0.005 or
0.5% per month since each payment is made monthly, what
you need is monthly interest rate. $3500 is the amount that you
need to pay every month in order to achieve a future lumpsum

              Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications | 45
of $200,000. Since the first payment commences one month
from now, it is an ordinary annuity. What we need to find is the
number of periods that required to reach $200,000

   Applying the formula in equation 1:

   In order to solve for n, we take log on both sides, n*log(1.005) =
log(1.2857), n=log(1.2857)/log(1.005). N = 50.39 periods and since
each period is 1 month, if each month you put aside $3500 and
the bank is paying an interest of 6% per annum, you need to
save 50.39 moths or 4.2 years to reach $200,000.

3.3 Perpetuities

3.3.1 Present value of a perpetuity

A perpetuity is defined as a stream of equal cash flows that
continue indefinitely. It's a type of annuity that has no end,
theoretically lasting forever. For instance, dividend
distributions can be regarded as a form of perpetuity since
the company is assumed to operate on a going concern basis.
Although companies might not exist forever, in the perspective
of investors, the lifespan of a company is considered to be
indefinite.

46 | Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications
   A perpetuity does not have a future value since its life is
indefinite. The present value of a perpetuity is given by:

          Equation 5:

Example: Your grandfather is retiring at the end of next year.
He would like to ensure that he and after he dies his heirs, will
receive payments of $11,309 a year forever, starting when he
retires. If he can invest at 9.9% per annum, how much does your
grandfather need to invest NOW to receive the desired cash
flow?

   Answer: The amount of money he needs to invest now is the
present value of the perpetuity where each cashflow is $11,309,
interest rate is 9,9% or 0.099.

                         =

3.3.2 Growing Perpetuities

A growing perpetuity is a series of cash flows that increase at a
constant rate indefinitely. Unlike a standard perpetuity, which
has a fixed cash flow, a growing perpetuity takes into account
the growth of the payments over time.

              Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications | 47
   The CF1 grows at a constant rate (g) year on year forever.

          Equation 6:

Example: As a millionaire intending to establish a scholarship
in your name, you wish to grant an annual scholarship of
$50,000, with the amount increasing by the inflation rate of
approximately 3% each year. If the interest rate is 7% p.a, how
much do you need to put down today to ensure the scholarship
can be sustained indefinitely?

   Answer: This is a growing perpetuity since the payment
required in the first year is $50,000. In the second year, the
required repayment is 50,000 * (1 + 0.03) = $51,500. In the third
year, the payment would be 51,500 * 1.03 and so on. The amount
that you need to put down today would be the present value
of this growing perpetuity where the growth rate is 3% p.a and
interest rate is 7% p.a.

                            =

48 | Chapter 3 - Present and Future Values with Applications
      Takeaways and looking ahead

        This chapter wraps up our discussion on the present
     and future values of single and multiple cash flows. The
     forthcoming chapter will expand these valuation
     principles by applying the present and future value
     formulas to the valuation of more complex financial
     instruments, namely stocks and bonds. We will
     examine how these formulas assist investors in making
     informed decisions about the intrinsic value of these
     securities, taking into account expected future cash
     flows and risks.

4.1. Real vs financial assets

4.1.1. Real assets

Real assets represent all the elements required for the
production of goods and services which a society's members
are able to generate. They are the essential building blocks
of an economy's wealth, representing the core resources that
determine its productive capacity. In the context of a company,
real assets are the cornerstone of its ability to produce output.
These are the physical or tangible and non-physical or
intangible resources that the company utilizes in its operations.
The examples of real assets include property, plant and
equipment, land, buildings and machines.

   Intangible assets: These do not have a physical presence but
still needed as part of the production process. They include
knowledge, intellectual property i.e. patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade secrets.

   From topic 1, we know that investment decisions are vital for
any business as they directly impact the company's potential
to create value. Making wise investment decisions means
identifying which real assets will yield the most favourable cash
flows, taking into consideration the costs of obtaining,
operating, and improving these assets. These decisions are not
confined to initial purchases; they also encompass the
continuous process of maintaining existing assets to ensure
their ongoing productivity and deciding when and how to
upgrade them to respond to technological advancements,
market demands, or regulatory requirements. The aim is to
optimize the efficiency and profitability of the assets
throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that they contribute
positively to the company's financial health and competitive
position.

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 51
4.1.2. Financial assets

Financial assets i.e. financial securities are assets that are
created by the law which outlines the rights and obligations
of the holder and the issuer. These assets do not contribute
directly to the productive capacity of the economy. They
represent the claims over the cashflows produced by real
assets. Unlike real assets, financial assets are created by the
financing decisions. The examples of financial assets include
stocks and bonds which represent the claims of the capital
providers' claims on the cash flows.

4.2. The financial system

The financial system is a complex network that includes
financial markets, institutions and products, all of which play
a critical role in the economy. The financial system's primary
purpose is to efficiently direct funds from savers, who have
excess funds, to borrowers, who have a deficit of funds, thereby
facilitating investment in productive ventures, which is critical
for economic growth and prosperity. In order for the financial
system to have a smooth functioning that allows for free flow
of capital and ensures its integrity and stability, there needs
to be independent bodies that oversee the financial system.
These are regulators who enforce legal requirements, protect
consumers, monitor risks and maintain confidence in the
financial system.

4.2.1 Financial markets

  · Financial markets are physical or virtual venues where
      financial instruments are traded. Financial markets can be

52 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
      classified according to different criteria:
  · Maturity: money vs capital market
  · New and outstanding security: primary vs secondary

      market
  · Asset types: equity, bond, fx and derivatives
  · Organisation of transactions: exchange traded vs over the

      counter.

4.2.1.1 Money markets versus capital market

Money markets provide a platform for the issuance and trading
of short-term securities i.e. instruments with maturities of less
than 12 months. The money markets are largely composed of
institutional investors, such as banks, mutual funds, and
corporations, rather than individual investors. These
participants either have surplus funds and are looking to earn
interest or have a short-term shortage of funds and need to
borrow. Unlike stock exchanges, money markets do not have
a specific physical trading location. Transactions can be
completed over the counter (OTC), through electronic systems,
or via telephone. The instruments traded in the money markets
include Treasury notes, certificates of deposit, commercial bills,
promissory notes, inter-bank loans, and repurchase
agreements (repos). Each of these serves a specific function in
terms of liquidity management for financial institutions:

  · Treasury notes: Short-term debt obligations issued by the
      government.

  · Certificates of deposit (CDs): Term deposits with banks
      that offer higher interest rates than regular savings
      accounts.

  · Commercial bills: Issued by companies to finance their
      immediate cash flow needs.

  · Promissory notes: Unsecured notes that are used for

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 53
      financing a wide range of transactions.
  · Inter-bank loans: Short-term loans made from one bank to

      another to manage liquidity.
  · Repurchase agreements (Repos): Short-term borrowing

      for dealers in government securities; the dealer sells the
      government securities to investors with an agreement to
      buy them back at a higher price at a later date.

Capital markets facilitate the raising of long-term funds. Here is
a breakdown of these markets:

  · Equity market: This market is where ownership stakes in
      companies are issued and traded. Investors who purchase
      equities are essential providing capital to the firms as
      owners.

  · Corporate debt market: his market is for the issuance and
      trading of corporate bonds, which are debt securities
      issued by companies to fund their operations, expansions,
      or investments. Investors who buy corporate bonds are
      essentially lending money to the issuing company in
      return for periodic interest payments and the return of the
      bond's face value at maturity.

  · Government debt market: Governments issue debt
      securities, such as bonds and treasury bills, to finance
      budget deficits and fund various projects. These securities
      are considered to be backed by the full faith and credit of
      the issuing government, making them one of the safest
      investment options. They can be traded in both domestic
      and international capital markets.

  · Foreign exchange market: This is a global decentralized
      market for the trading of currencies. It supports
      international trade and investment by enabling currency
      conversion. For example, if a company in one country
      wants to purchase goods from another country, it can use
      the foreign exchange market to convert its currency into

54 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
      the currency of the seller's country.
  · Derivative market: Derivatives are financial instruments

      that derive their value from an underlying asset or
      benchmark. This market provides instruments like
  · futures, forwards, options, and swaps, which are used for
      hedging against risks or speculating on future
      movements of the underlying assets. The derivatives
      market can be used to manage a range of risks, including
      interest rates, currencies, equities, and credit risks.

4.2.1.2. Primary markets versus secondary market

Primary markets are the financial venues where new securities
are created and sold for the first time to investors. Corporations,
governments, and other entities who need funding will issue
new financial assets to raise capital directly from investors.
Investment banks play a crucial role in facilitating this process.
They help issuers to determine the price of the new securities
and through rigorous marketing strategies, sell the securities
to investors. Investors in the primary market can be
institutional investors like pension funds and mutual funds,
or retail investors. By purchasing the newly issued financial
assets, investors provide the issuers with the funds they need.
In return, investors receive the financial assets which may
represent debt (bonds), equity (stocks), or other financial
interests in the company. An example of a primary market is
Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) where a company offers its shares
to the public for the first time. IPOs can involve equity, but
companies also issue debt and other financial assets through
similar primary market mechanisms.

   Secondary markets are marketplaces where investors buy
and sell existing financial assets, those that have already been
issued in primary markets. The financial instruments traded
in secondary markets are stocks, bonds and other financial

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 55
instruments. Unlike primary market, trading in the secondary
market does not result in the creation of new assets. It is purely
the exchange of ownership of existing securities. The trade
is between two investors, and the money involved in the
transaction goes from the buyer to the seller, not to the issuing
company. The role of secondary market is to provide liquidity
for financial assets. This liquidity is crucial because it gives
investors the confidence that they can readily convert their
assets into cash if needed. By providing liquidity, secondary
markets reduce the risk of investing in primary markets.
Investors are more likely to purchase new financial assets if
they know that they can later sell them in a secondary market.
This, in turn, helps primary markets function more effectively as
it broadens the investor base and potentially lowers the cost of
capital for issuers.

4.2.1.3. Exchange traded markets versus over the
counter market

Exchange-traded markets are structured and regulated
environments where securities are bought and sold. These
markets such as the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) or the
New York stock exchange (NYSE) are characterized by their
high level of organization, transparency, and stringent
information disclosure requirements. These markets operate
under strict regulatory oversight, which ensures fair trading
practices and the protection of investors. Regulatory bodies
establish rules that govern the operations of these markets
and the conduct of all market participants. Issuers of securities
in exchange-traded markets are required to provide
comprehensive information about their financial health,
performance, and any other material information that might
affect the value of their securities. This requirement is designed
to maintain a high level of transparency and allows investors to

56 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
make informed decisions. Trading on exchanges is transparent,
meaning that buy and sell orders, prices of securities and
completed transactions, are visible to all market participants.
This ensures that all participants have access to real-time
information regarding market prices, contributing to a fair and
competitive market environment.

   Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are decentralized markets
where trading of financial instruments is facilitated by a
network of dealers rather than on a centralized exchange. OTC
markets typically operate with less regulatory oversight
compared to exchange-traded markets. This can lead to a
wider range of products being traded, including those that
may not meet the stringent listing requirements of formal
exchanges. OTC markets offer more flexibility as the terms of
trades are not standardized. This allows for the customization
of trade agreements to suit the specific needs of the parties
involved. Unlike the centralized nature of exchange trading,
OTC markets do not have a physical location or central
exchange. Trading occurs directly between parties. Financial
institutions or dealers act as market makers by quoting prices
at which they will buy (bid) and sell (ask) financial instruments.
Dealers hold an inventory of financial instruments to facilitate
this trading. Prices in OTC markets can often be negotiated.
Since trades do not occur in a public venue, dealers can provide
private quotes to clients and may adjust prices based on the
size of the transaction or the relationship with the client.

4.2.1.4. Financial markets by products

Equity market: The market where equities, commonly known
as shares, are traded is typically referred to as the stock market
or equity market. These include ordinary shares, preference
shares and hybrid securities. Equities are most commonly
traded on organized exchanges, such as the Australian

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 57
Securities Exchange (ASX), which provide a platform for buyers
and sellers to transact in a regulated and standardized
environment.

   Bond market: The bond market, also known as the debt
market or credit market, is where investors trade bonds, which
are long-term debt instruments. These includes corporate
bonds and long-term government debt securities. While a
significant volume of bond trading occurs over-the-counter
(OTC), where trades are negotiated privately between two
parties, bonds can also be listed and traded on formal
exchanges like the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). OTC
transactions are typically larger and involve institutional
investors, whereas exchange trading can offer more
accessibility for retail investors.

   Foreign exchange market: The currency market, also known
as the foreign exchange market or FX market, is a global
decentralized marketplace for the trading of currencies. The
primary function of the FX market is to enable the conversion
of one currency into another. This is necessary for international
trade, where businesses and individuals need to pay for goods
and services in a foreign currency. The market consists of a
network of banks, financial institutions, brokers, and dealers
who are licensed to trade in foreign exchange. These
participants operate in major financial centres around the
world and conduct transactions directly with each other or
through electronic trading platforms. The FX market operates
24 hours a day, five days a week, and is the most traded market
in the world, with trillions of dollars exchanged daily.

   The derivatives market: is where financial instruments
known as derivatives are traded. These are securities whose
value is derived from the value of other underlying financial
assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest
rates, or market indexes. The types of derivative instruments
include:

   Options: Contracts that give the holder the right, but not the

58 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price
within a certain time period.

   Futures: Standardized contracts traded on an exchange that
obligate the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, an
underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specified future
date.

   Forwards: Customized contracts between two parties to buy
or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. These are
often used for hedging purposes.

   Swaps: Contracts to exchange cash flows or other financial
instruments for the purpose of exchanging risk (e.g., interest
rate risk, currency risk).

4.2.2. Australia's financial institutions

Financial institutions can be divided into three broad
categories: financial intermediaries, investing institutions and
financial agency institutions.

4.2.2.1 Financial Intermediaries

Intermediated Finance is a key feature of the financial system,
providing a more efficient allocation of resources, risk
management, and liquidity transformation. It allows for the
pooling of funds from many small investors to meet the large
capital requirements of borrowers, while also providing security
and return for the investors. During this process, the supplier of
funds i.e. the investor provide funds to a financial intermediary,
such as depositing money in a bank through instruments like
a term deposit. The user of the fund (the borrower) is the
individual or entity that requires funds for purposes such as
buying a house, starting or expanding a business, or other
financial needs. They receive funds from the financial

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 59
intermediary in the form of loans or other credit arrangements,
such as a housing loan. In the middle of the transaction is the
financial intermediary i.e. the bank who takes on the role of
managing funds between the suppliers and users. With the
funds collected from investors, the intermediary extends loans
or credit to those in need of funds. In this system, the claims of
the supplier of funds (investor) and the user of funds (borrower)
are solely with the financial intermediary. The investor does not
have a direct claim against the borrower, which means that if
the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank is responsible for
compensating the investor, not the borrower.

   Financial intermediaries refer to institutions who serve as
middlemen between parties in financial transactions. These
are typically known as ADIs (Authorised deposit taking
institutions). As the name implied, these institutions are
authorised by a financial regulatory body to accept deposits
from the public. Banks, credit unions, and building societies
are examples of ADIs. They pool the deposits they receive and
use these funds to provide loans or credit to borrowers. The
financial intermediary creates a separate contract with each
party--the lender (or depositor) and the borrower. Their
revenue is earned primarily through the interest spread. This
is the difference between the interest rates they charge
borrowers for loans and the interest rates they provide to
depositors for their savings. For instance, a bank may offer a
1% interest rate on savings accounts but charge 4% interest on
home loans, earning a spread of 3%.

4.2.2.2. Investing institutions

Investing institutions are entities that manage and sell
investment products to the public and use the pooled funds
to invest in a variety of asset classes. Depending on the

60 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
regulations, these institutions can invest in both real and
financial assets. These institutions include:

   Superannuation funds: These funds collect contributions
from employers on behalf of employees as well as from fund
members directly. They invest these contributions across
different asset classes with the goal of providing income
benefits for members upon retirement. Common investments
include equities, debt securities, real estate, and cash.

   Managed funds: These funds pool money from many
investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of financial assets.
Professional fund managers select and manage these assets
on behalf of the investors. Managed funds provide investors
with access to a wider range of investments than they might
be able to afford or manage on their own.

   Private equity firms: These firms invest in private companies
that are not listed on a stock market. Investments made by
private equity firms are usually long-term and can be high-risk,
partly because of the illiquidity of the shares--they are more
difficult to sell compared to public equities. Private equity can
be classified into two types:

  · Venture capital firms (VC): Venture capital firms focus on
      investing in start-up and early-stage companies with high
      growth potential. These investments are inherently risky
      due to the unproven nature of the businesses but can
      yield high returns if the companies succeed.

  · Private equities: In addition to venture capital, private
      equity also includes buyouts, growth capital, and
      mezzanine capital. PE investments are characterized by
      active ownership, where the PE firm seeks to add value to
      the company through strategic, operational, or
      managerial improvements.

Hedge funds: are often considered to be higher risk compared
to traditional investment funds that are often considered not

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 61
suitable for retail investors. Unlike traditional managed funds,
which may focus on a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds,
hedge funds often engage in a wide array of investment and
trading activities. These can include leveraged investments,
short-selling, derivatives trading, and other sophisticated
investment strategies. Hedge funds generally operate with less
regulatory oversight than other investment vehicles such as
mutual funds. This allows them more freedom in their
investment decisions, but it also means less protection for
investors. They are often only accessible to accredited or
qualified investors who have a higher degree of financial
literacy and can bear the risk of loss.

   General insurance companies: are financial entities that
collect premiums from households and businesses and
provide a range of insurance policies to protect individuals and
businesses against various risks. These include property, motor
vehicle and employer's liability insurance. In order to ensure
that they have sufficient liquidity to cover claims and
operational expenses, general insurance companies invest
their assets primarily in short-term financial securities such
as deposits, short-term loans, government securities or liquid
equities. he investment strategies of general insurance
companies are often conservative, emphasizing liquidity and
safety due to the nature of their liabilities. They need to ensure
that funds are available when claims are made, which can be
unpredictable. Consequently, they tend to avoid locking in
their assets in long-term or illiquid investments. Their
investment decisions are also subject to regulatory guidelines
that aim to maintain solvency and protect the interests of the
insured parties.

   Life insurance companies: unlike general insurance, life
insurance companies offer a range of financial products and
services, primarily focusing on risk mitigation and financial
planning for individuals. The type of products they offer include
life insurance which offers financial compensation to

62 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. They also provide
accident and disability insurance: which covers for losses due
to accidental injuries or disability, which can include lump-sum
payments or ongoing income support. To support their long-
term liabilities (such as life insurance payouts), life insurance
companies tend to invest in a mix of equities and debt
securities. Besides traditional insurance, life insurance
companies offer investment products that combine
investment with insurance coverage, such as annuities. They
may also manage superannuation (retirement savings)
products, allowing policyholders to invest and grow their funds
for retirement.

4.3 Financial regulators

The objectives of regulators are:
   Systematic Stability: This refers to the overall health and

functioning of the financial system. Systemic stability is
achieved when the system is resilient to economic shocks and
able to operate without significant crises, such as widespread
bank failures or bank runs. A bank run occurs when a large
number of depositors withdraw their funds simultaneously,
often due to fears that the bank will become insolvent.
Ensuring systemic stability is crucial to prevent such crises,
which can lead to severe economic and social disruptions.

   Deposit Protection: refers to safeguarding the interests of
bank depositors, those with small account balances who may
not have the financial expertise to fully understand complex
banking products and the health of the financial institutions
themselves. Asymmetric information is a situation where one
party, in this case, the financial institutions have more or better
information than depositors. To protect depositors, various
mechanisms such as deposit insurance schemes are put in

                Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 63
place, which guarantee to cover deposits up to a certain
amount, thereby reducing the risk for individual depositors.

   Social objectives: Many financial institutions are profit driven
therefore without appropriate mechanisms in place, they will
not serve the interest of the public as a whole. The institutions
need to be given incentives so that they will engage in
behaviours that benefit every members of society. This
includes keeping bank fees low to ensure affordability for all
segments of society, providing financial support to specific
sectors of the economy that may have social value, such as
small businesses or industries that create significant
employment opportunities. These objectives often align with
broader goals such as income redistribution, economic
inclusion, and the promotion of equitable growth.

   There are three main regulatory bodies in Australia:

  · The RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia): The RBA serves as
      Australia's central bank and its main functions are crucial
      to the nation's financial system and overall economic
      performance. The RBA oversees the payment systems to
      ensure they are safe and efficient, and providing banking
      services to the government and other financial
      institutions. The most important function of the RBA is
      formulating and implementing monetary policy. The main
      tool the RBA uses for this purpose is setting the cash rate,
      which is the interest rate on overnight loans in the money
      market. In the first Tuesday of every month except
      January, the RBA board meets to decide the outcome of
      its review of the cash rate and releases a statement that
      announces any changes to the rate. Changes to the cash
      rate can influence a range of other interest rates, including
      those for mortgages and savings, and can thereby affect
      the behaviour of borrowers and savers, the level of
      economic activity, and ultimately the rate of inflation.
      Finally, the RBA monitors and assess the health of the

64 | Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions
   financial system and work with other regulatory bodies to
   manage and mitigate systemic risks. The RBA aims to
   prevent problems that may arise from the financial
   system, such as bank runs or the collapse of financial
   institutions, that could have detrimental effects on the
   economy.
· ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission):
   is an independent Australian government body that acts
   as Australia's corporate regulator. Its role is to enforce and
   regulate company and financial services laws to protect
   Australian consumers, investors, and creditors. ASIC
   oversees companies to ensure they adhere to corporate
   governance standards. Corporate governance involves a
   set of rules and processes by which a company is directed
   and controlled, focusing on the internal and external
   corporate structures with the intention of monitoring the
   actions of management and directors and thereby
   mitigating the risks of corporate fraud. For the financial
   services sector: ASIC supervises and regulates the
   insurance, banking and superannuation industry to
   ensure they operate efficiently, honestly and fairly with the
   aim to promote transparency and market integrity.
· APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority): While
   ASIC is focused on consumer protection and market
   integrity, APRA is involved in the prudential oversight of
   financial institutions. APRA's core function is to oversee
   banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance
   companies, life insurance, and most members of the
   superannuation industry. It sets standards and supervises
   institutions to ensure that, under all reasonable
   circumstances, these financial promises made to
   consumers are met. APRA ensures that the institutions it
   supervises manage risks effectively, requiring them to
   hold sufficient capital and have appropriate risk
   management frameworks in place to deal with potential

             Chapter 4 - Financial markets and financial institutions | 65
      adverse scenarios. APRA is responsible for planning for
      financial crises and has a role in responding to them if
      they occur. This includes the power to take control of an
      institution if its viability is threatened and managing its
      restructure or orderly exit from the industry if necessary.

     Key Takeaways

          · This chapter provides an overview of on the
             operation of the financial system in Australia, the
             players within the system and the role that they
             serve. In the forthcoming chapter, we will apply
             the present and future value formulas to value
             the two classic financial instruments of the
             financial market namely, debt and equity.

5.1. What is a bond?

A bond is essentially a form of debt instrument, which can
be likened to an "I owe you" note. It represents a formal and

68 | Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation
enforceable contract between the issuer, who is the borrower,
and the investor, who acts as the lender. This agreement
outlines several key components:

  · Par value: This is also known as the face value or principal
      of the bond. It is the amount that the issuer agrees to
      repay the bondholder at the bond's maturity.

  · Coupon rate: The coupon rate is the interest rate that the
      bond issuer pays on the bond's face value. It is usually a
      fixed percentage, expressed as an annual percentage rate
      (APR). However, there can be variable or floating rates,
      which are often linked to benchmarks like the LIBOR or
      inflation indicators.

  · Coupon payment dates: These are the scheduled dates on
      which the bond issuer makes interest payments to the
      bondholder. The payments are typically made on a
      quarterly or semi-annual basis.

  · Maturity date: This is the date on which the bond will
      expire, and the issuer is obligated to pay the par value to
      the bondholder. Bonds can have varying lengths of
      maturity, ranging from a few months to several decades.

In the context of bonds, the issuer does not need to know
the identity of the bondholder. The bond issuer has a legal
obligation to make payments, such as interest or principal
repayments, to whom-ever is in possession of the bonds at the
time those payments are due. This means that if the bonds are
sold or transferred from one investor to another, the issuer's
responsibility is to make the due payments to the new holder
of the bonds. This anonymous nature of bond ownership allows
for easy trading of the bonds on the market, as the transfer of
ownership does not require the issuer's direct involvement or
notification.

                               Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 69
5.1.1 Types of corporate bonds

  · Coupon bonds: are a type of bond that feature fixed
      interest payments, known as coupons, which are paid to
      the bondholder periodically over the bond's lifespan. The
      rate of these coupon payments is predetermined and
      remains constant until the bond reaches its maturity date.
      Upon maturity, the principal amount of the bond is repaid
      to the bondholder, and the bond is then considered
      retired or concluded. Coupon bonds often include
      standard call provisions that are common in many types of
      bonds. This provision gives the issuer the right, but not the
      obligation, to pay back the face value of the bond before
      its maturity date under specific conditions. This can be
      beneficial for the issuer, particularly if interest rates have
      fallen since the bond was issued, allowing them to
      refinance at a lower cost. Coupon payments are often
      made on an annual or semi-annual basis.

  · Zero coupon bonds: are bonds that do not offer periodic
      coupon payments. Instead, investors receive a single
      payment at the bond's maturity. Since zero-coupon bonds
      do not provide coupon or interest payments, they are
      typically sold at a significant discount from their face (or
      par) value. The difference between the par value and price
      of the bond represents the interest that accumulates over
      the life of the bond.

  · Convertible bonds: are bonds that offer the bondholder
      the right to convert the bond into a predetermined
      number of shares of the issuing company's common stock
      at specific times during the bond's life, usually at the
      discretion of the bondholder.

5.1.2 Overview of Australian financial market

Have a look at the Figure 1: Australian Financial Markets on
this Australian Equity Market Facts page on the RBA website.
This depicts the types and historical trends of various financial
securities in Australia as a percentage of GDP, indicating their
relative size and importance within the economy over time.

   The graph depicts a contrasting trend between government
bonds and equities. While the proportion of government
bonds relative to GDP has generally decreased, the equity
market has shown growth, particularly from the 1980s
onwards. Corporate bonds have also grown but remain a
smaller fraction of the GDP compared to equities and
government bonds. Overall, there is a general shift in the
Australian financial markets from a strong reliance on
government and government-backed bonds in the early 20th
century towards a more diversified structure with significant
equity and corporate bond markets in the later years.

5.2 Coupon rate versus coupon yield

The bond contract often states the coupon rate and other
features of the bond such as par value, time maturity or
whether or not the bond is callable. However, it does not
specifies the yield to maturity i.e. coupon yield, another variable
that determines the price of the bond. So, what is yield to
maturity and how it differs from the coupon rate?

   Coupon rate determines the annual interest rate that the
issuer promises to pay the bondholder on the bond's face
value, expressed as a percentage.

   Coupon yield: is the return that an investor can expect to

                                Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 71
receive from the bond if it is held until maturity assuming all
the coupon payments are reinvested at the same rate.

   While coupon rate is often fixed, the coupon yield can
change over time if the price of the bond changes due to
market conditions.

5.3 Bond Valuation

5.3.1 The valuation principle

The value of a financial asset is equal to the present value of
all expected future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate
discount rate

          Equation 1:

Where:

· P = Value (price) of an asset at time 0, present value of the

stream of cash flows

· CFt = cash flow in period t

· i     = the market interest rate (discount rate)

· n     = number of discounting periods

72 | Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation
Based on this formula, the value or price of any financial asset
at time 0 can be calculated by forecasting the future cash flows
the asset is expected to generate and then discounting these
cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount
rate. Let's apply this valuation principle to price a coupon
paying bond.

5.3.2 Bond valuation

For a coupon paying bond, the cash flows comprise two
components: the coupon payments and the par value
component usually paid at the maturity date. The timeline of
the cashflows for a coupon bond is depicted as follows:

   Given that the coupon payments remain constant and the
first payment is made one period after time 0, this series of
coupon payments essentially constitutes an ordinary annuity.
Consequently, we can apply the present value formula for an
ordinary annuity to calculate the current worth of these
coupon payments at time 0.

   The second component is the par value, the lumpsum that
usually paid at maturity. Since it is a one-off payment, we can
use the formula for single cash flow to discount it back to
present. The price of the bond is the PV of coupons + PV of par
value.

          Equation 2:

                               Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 73
The price of the bond then becomes PV of an ordinary annuity
+ PV of one last single cash flow (or Par value)

          Equation 3:

where Fn is the par value.

Example: AR Ltd is issuing a 10-year bond with a coupon rate

of 8.89 per cent. The interest rate for similar bonds is currently

5.97 per cent. Assuming annual payments and a face value of

$1000, what is the present value of the bond?

Answer: Step 1: Outline the cash flows that the financial asset

i.e. the bond pays. The coupon payment each period is:

Coupon  payment             per                period   =

                                 =
   So, the cashflows are: 88.9 per year for 10 years and a one-off
1000 at the end of year 10. N = 10 and i = 0.0597. The discount
rate is the coupon yield. It reflects the opportunity cost of
capital i.e. the return that investors expect from the bond.

74 | Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation
5.3.3 Par, premium and discount bonds

  · Par bonds: When a bond's coupon rate (C) is equal to the
      market rate (i), the bond will trade at its face (or par) value.
      The reason is the market rate i.e. yield to maturity
      represent the rate of return that investors expect from
      holding the bond. If investors expect a rate of return of 10%
      p.a for holding the bond and the coupon rate is also
      exactly 10%, the bond will be selling at par.

  · Discount bond: If the coupon rate (C) of a bond is lower
      than the prevailing market interest rate (i), the bond will
      be sold at a price below its face (or par) value. The reason is
      the coupon rate that the bond is offering is less than what
      investors expect. Therefore, to achieve the required rate of
      the return, investors will sell the bond driving its price
      below the par value.

  · Premium bonds: When a bond's coupon rate (C) exceeds
      the current market interest rate (i), the bond will be traded
      at a price higher than its face (or par) value. In this case,
      the coupon rate that the bond is offering is higher than
      what investors expect which make investors willing to pay
      a price that is higher than the par value.

                               Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 75
5.3.4 Semi-annual bond valuation

Most corporate bonds make coupon payments semi-annually,
meaning twice a year. However, it's a standard practice to
quote their coupon rates on an annual basis. This means that
even though these bonds pay coupons every six months, the
stated coupon rate reflects the interest amount that would
be paid over a full year. For instance, if a bond has an annual
coupon rate of 4%, it would actually pay 2% every six months.
The formula for a semi-annual coupon paying bond is as
follows:

          Equation 4:

Since the coupon payment is made every six months if the
bond matures in n years, in total, there would be 2n periods. is
the par or face value paid in period 2n.

   Example: You are interested in investing in a 3-year bond
with a face value of $1000 that pays a 6.3 per cent coupon
with interest to be received semi-annually. Your required rate
of return is 6.6 per cent. What is the most that you would be
willing to pay for this bond?

   Answer: The coupon rate is 6.3% p.a, since the coupon is
paid every six months. The coupon payment each period is
0.063×1000/2 = 31.50. The number of periods is therefore 3×2 =
6. The discount rate each period is 0.066/2 = 0.033 since each
period is now 6 months instead of 1 year.

76 | Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation
5.3.5 Zero coupon bond

As the name implied, zero coupon bond has no coupon
payment. The only cash flow that the bond pays is the par
value. The value of the bond is simply the present value of
this final cash flow discounted back to the present using the
appropriate discount rate i.e. yield to maturity.

          Equation 5:

Example: You are thinking to invest in a zero coupon bond that
is matures in 6 years with a face value $100,000. How much are
you willing to pay for the bond if the current market interest
rate for similar bond is 6% p.a?

   Answer: Par value is $100,000, n=6 and yield to maturity I =
0.06.

                               Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 77
5.4 Bond yields

Yield to maturity (YTM): is the rate of return that an investor
expects to earn if they hold a bond until its maturity date,
and all scheduled coupon and principal payments are made
without default. It is used as a discount rate that makes the
present value of coupons and principal payments equal to the
price of the bond. YTM is not static, it changes in response to
changes in market interest rates and other economic factors.

   When market interest rates rise, investors expect a higher
return from their investments which lead the YTM of existing
bonds increases, often resulting in lower bond prices.
Conversely, when market interest rates fall, the YTM of existing
bonds generally decreases, leading to higher bond prices. This
inverse relationship between yield and price is a fundamental
principle of bond investing.

   Bonds with longer maturities experience greater price
fluctuations compared to bonds with shorter maturities for the
same level of change in their Yield to Maturity (YTM).

   For bonds valuation, since the cash flows are predetermined,
the price of the bond largely depends solely on the discount
rate (YTM). How do we know what investors required rate of
return on a bond is?

   Answer: We can invert the yield to maturity from the bond
price and once the YTM is obtained, it will enable us to price
similar bonds.

   Example: Westpac Banking Corporation has a 3-year bond
outstanding that pays a 7 per cent coupon and is currently
priced at $913.88. What is the yield to maturity of this bond?

78 | Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation
Assume semi-annual coupon payments and a par value of
$1000.

   Answer: Since the coupon is paid semi-annual, the number
of periods is 2 x 3 =6. The coupon payment each period is 0.07 x
1000 = 35.

   Applying formula in equation 4:

   Y denotes yield to maturity or i in equation 4.
   Using excel, y = 5.21% so i = 2 x y = 2 x 5.21% = 10.42%.

5.5 Risk of investing in bonds

Investing in bonds, like any other investments involves a
number of risks. The two major risks that associated with bonds
are:

  · Credit (Default Risk): This risk reflects the probability that
      the bond issuer will be unable to fulfill the debt payment
      obligations as they fall due. Generally, government bonds
      have lower credit risks compared to corporate bonds.
      Credit rating agencies assign ratings to bonds globally,
      serving as an indicator of their credit risk. These ratings
      essentially evaluate the likelihood that the bond issuer will
      default on its debt obligations, including interest
      payments and the repayment of the principal. A higher
      rating suggests a lower risk of default, indicating greater
      financial stability and strength of the issuer. Conversely, a
      lower rating indicates higher risk, implying a greater
      chance that the issuer might fail to meet its payment

                               Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 79
      obligations.
  · Interest rate: Interest rate risk refers to the possibility of

      incurring losses on investments due to a rise in market
      interest rates. When interest rates in the market go up, the
      appeal of holding existing bonds diminishes. This is
      because new bonds issued in the market offer higher
      coupons compared to the fixed coupons of existing bonds.

5.5.1 Interest rate risk

When interest rates in the market rise, the Yield to Maturity
(YTM) of bonds also increases. This is because YTM is essentially
a reflection of the opportunity cost of capital. If interest rates
are higher, investors naturally expect greater returns on their
investments since they could potentially earn more by
investing in other opportunities with higher yields.
Consequently, as market interest rates go up, the required rate
of return (or discount rate) for existing bonds increases, which
in turn lowers their market prices.

   The impact of rising interest rates on bond prices, however,
is not uniform across all bonds. Generally, bonds with longer
maturities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and
will experience greater price reductions compared to shorter-
term bonds. This is because the longer the time until a bond's
maturity, the longer the period during which the investor is
locked into lower coupons relative to the market, thus
increasing the bond's interest rate risk. The following picture
compares the price of a 1-year bond and a 10-year bond when
interest rate changes:

80 | Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation
   The graph demonstrates that when market interest rates
increase, the prices of both short-term and long-term bonds
decrease. However, the extent of the price decline differs
significantly between the two. While the short-term bond
experiences a relatively minor decrease in price, the long-term
bond's price drops much more sharply.

5.5.2 Default risk

As mentioned above, default risk that borrowers may not make
the promised payments. It is the risk of losing not just the
return on capital but the return of capital i.e. the principal.
Therefore, in order to hold bonds that have positive default risk,
investors must be paid a premium. Default risk premium (DRP)
is the difference between interest rate on a security that has
default risk (idr) and the interest rate on a risk-free (irf) security.

                                       DRP = idr - irf
   The DRP is essentially the extra return that a bond offering

                               Chapter 5 - Bond market and bond valuation | 81
a default risk pays over a risk-free security, like an Australian
Government Bond.

5.5.3 Bond ratings

Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's
Global Ratings (S&P) are the two leading credit rating agencies
that evaluate the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts,
effectively assessing their creditworthiness. Fitch Group ranks
as the third largest in this field. While Moody's and S&P have
their own unique rating scales, the meaning behind their
ratings is broadly similar.

   The highest quality bonds, considered to have the minimal
risk of default, are given the top ratings of Aaa by Moody's
and AAA by S&P. These ratings reflect the highest level of
creditworthiness.

   Bonds are categorized as investment-grade if they are rated
between Aaa (or AAA) and Baa (or BBB). These ratings suggest
a lower risk of default and are typically sought after by
conservative investors, including certain institutional investors.

   Conversely, bonds rated below Baa (or BBB) are classified as
non-investment grade. These include junk bonds, speculative-
grade bonds, or high-yield bonds, which carry a higher risk
of default but offer higher returns to compensate for this
increased risk.

   The following table shows the Investment ratings by S & P,
Moody and Fitch:

5.5.4 Australian bond market

In Australia, most corporate bonds are not traded on the
Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), the primary stock
exchange in the country. Instead, these bonds are typically
traded over-the-counter (OTC). OTC trading means that the
bonds are traded in a decentralized manner, often through
broker-dealer networks, rather than on a centralized exchange
like the ASX. To invest in these corporate bonds, an investor
usually needs to go through a broker. The broker executes the
order by finding a matching buyer or seller in the OTC market.
This method of trading can be less transparent than exchange
trading, with prices and availability varying more significantly.

   For individual investors looking to invest in bonds through
a more familiar and accessible platform, Exchange-traded
Treasury Bonds (eTBs) offer an alternative. eTBs are essentially
government bonds that are listed and traded on the ASX. They
represent an investment in an Australian Government bond,
providing the safety and stability associated with government
debt. These bonds are more accessible to individual investors
and offer benefits like regular interest payments and the return
of face value at maturity. eTBs can be bought and sold just like
stocks through the ASX, offering transparency, ease of trading,
and accessibility that might not be available with OTC
corporate bonds.

 Takeaways and looking ahead

   This chapter provided an overview of bonds and the
Australian bond market, detailing how bonds function
as a crucial method for companies and other entities to
raise capital. As debt securities, bonds involve lending
money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest
payments and the return of the principal at maturity.
We've explored the various aspects of bonds, including
their pricing, the relationship between bond prices and
interest rates, the distinction between a bond's coupon
rate and its yield to maturity, and the risks associated
with bond investing, such as interest rate risk and
default risk.

   In the next chapter, we will shift our focus to the
second major channel for companies to raise capital:
equity. Equity represents ownership in a company and
comes with different characteristics and valuation
methods compared to debt securities like bonds. We
will explore the different types of equity securities, and
the principles behind equity valuation. This will provide
a comprehensive understanding of how companies
raise capital and how investors can evaluate and invest
in these different types of securities

6.1 Overview of the share market

Suppose you have $10,000 to invest in 1989 and you decide to
put it in the share market. If the average annual rate of return

                              Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 87
is 8% p.a., by 2023, you would end up with $147,850. While
Australia is an island, separated from the rest of the world, our
share market does not seem to behave that way. In fact, our
market tracks the trend in the global market very closely and
since 2002, we seem to perform better than the global market.

   If we are doing so well, why investors from the rest of the
world does not seem to pour money into our market? Have
a look at this chart from Visual Capitalist showing the break
down of the global equity market. Here we can see is that
not all markets are created equal. Some are much bigger and
hence considered more important than others. The
construction of the global market does not involve putting the
same amount of money into each market. Rather, market with
larger size receives a higher weight.

   Once we zoom into the performance of a given stock market,
the same feature holds. That is, not all stocks are created equal.
Based on their size i.e. market cap, some are more important
than others. The performance of the overall stock market
largely depends on the performance of the very few. Have a
look at this visualisation of the US market return composition
by Morningstar to see how the largest companies have
changed between 2020 to 2023. How much has the size of the
rest of the market changed changed over this time?

6.2 Ordinary vs Preference Shares

6.2.1 What are ordinary shares?

Ordinary shares, also known as common stocks or common
equity, represent an ownership stake in a corporation.
Individuals holding these shares are essentially part-owners of
the company. This ownership represents a residual claimant,

88 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
which means shareholders are entitled to a share of the
company's earnings after all other obligations have been met.

   Those who invest in ordinary shares typically anticipate the
receipt of dividends, which are periodic distributions of the
company's profits. However, in scenarios where a company
defaults on its obligations, debt holders reserve the right to
initiate liquidation proceedings, subsequently assuming
control over the company's assets to recuperate owed funds.
Shareholders on the other hand cannot force the company to
go into liquidation. These shareholders are among the last to
be considered for repayment. They have to wait until all debts
and other financial obligations have been paid to receive the
residual claims on the company's assets. This underscores the
heightened risk that ordinary shareholders bear, a risk that
is counterbalanced by the potential for higher returns over a
long-term investment horizon, reflecting the fundamental risk-
return trade-off in finance.

   Holding shares give investors the right to vote on critical
corporate governance issues. Such issues may include strategic
decisions like mergers and acquisitions, executive
remuneration packages, and the election or removal of board
members. Essentially, this voting power enables shareholders
to influence the direction and management of the company,
something that debt holders do not get to enjoy since debt
holders do not own the company.

   Another advantage for ordinary shareholders is that their
liability is limited. In the worst-case scenario of company failure,
the personal financial exposure of shareholders is restricted
to the amount of their investment in the company's shares,
protecting their other personal assets. Finally, the life of
ordinary shares is infinity. Unlike debt securities, which have
specified maturity dates when the principal is to be repaid,
ordinary shares remain valid as long as the company is in
operation. Shareholders can choose to hold on to their shares

                              Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 89
indefinitely or sell them on the open market whenever they
choose.

6.2.2. What are preference shares?

Preference shares, also known as preferred stocks, are a class of
equity that exhibits characteristics of both bonds and common
stocks. These shares typically offer investors a steady income
stream through fixed dividends, which can either be a set
amount or a fixed percentage of the company's profits, much
like the coupon payment of a bond. Due to their equity nature,
preference shares do not have a maturity date. Shareholders of
these stocks are entitled to receive annual dividend payments
indefinitely, or for as long as they hold the shares. The
dividends received by preference shareholders can be
classified as a perpetuity and hence one can use the perpetuity
formula to ascertain the current value of a preference share.
Finally, preferred shareholders have lower ranking compared
to bond and other debt holders, but they have higher ranking
compared to ordinary shareholders when it comes to profit
distribution and claims on assets in the event of liquidation.

6.3 Equity Valuation

6.3.1 Preference share valuation

The valuation principle states that the value of any financial
asset is the present value of the future cash flows discounted
back to the present using the appropriate discount rate. Since
preference shareholders receive a constant stream of dividends

90 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
indefinitely, the present value of the preference share can be
obtained using a perpetuity formula.

   The value of the preference share is then given by:

          Equation 1:

Where:
  · PS0 = Preference share market price
  · Dp = Next period's dividend payment
  · rp = Discount rate

Example: Suppose we have a company, ABC Corp., which has
issued preference shares that pay an annual fixed dividend of
$5 per share. If the current market rate of return for similar
preference shares is 6%, what is the price of ABC Corp.'s
preference shares?

   Answer:

                               Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 91
6.3.2 How are equity returns are measured?

Investors earn returns from shares not only through dividend
payments but also via capital gains or losses. These gains or
losses are realized when investors sell their shares at a different
price from their purchase cost. The return on investment,
therefore, encompasses the change in the share's value over
time, alongside any income from dividends received. For each
share, the total dollar return is the sum of holding period
income and capital gains (losses). Since dividend payment
represents the income that the stockholder earns during the
holding period,

                    Total dollar return = Divt+1 + (Pt+1 - Pt)
   In finance, when it comes to return, we do not use dollar
returns to evaluate the performance of an investment. The
reason is dollar returns depend on the initial capital investment
which make it difficult to compare across stocks. For example,
suppose you buy 1 share A for $50 per share and sells it for $55
per share, your dollar return would be $5 per share. Meanwhile,
you can buy 1 share B for $10 and sell it for $12 per share, your
dollar return on share B would be $2 per share but which one
is a better investment? Based on just the dollar return alone, A
would seem to be a better share but instead of buying 1 share
of A, you could have bought 5 shares B for the same $50 and
if you do that, you would end up with 5 x 12 =$60 which clearly
yields a return that is higher than A.
   Therefore, to measure the performance of an investment, we
use a percentage return i.e. the rate of return.
   The rate of return on investment is given by the following
formula:

92 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
          Equation 2:

If we reorganise the formula, the current value or price of a
share can be calculated as:

          Equation 3:
                                         or

P0 is the price of the share at time 0 i.e. now. P1 denotes the
price in the future i.e. period 1 and D1 is the dividend received
during the period and r investors' expected rate of return.
Equation 3 corresponds to the present value formula with P1
and D1 represent the future cashflows and r the discount rate.

   Example: You are thinking whether or not to invest in XYZ
Manufacturing Co. where the investment expectations are as
follows: an anticipated dividend payment of $2.5 to be received
in one year. You expect to be able to sell the share for $30 at the
end of the year and investor required rate of return on shares
with similar risk is around 8% per year. What is the maximum
price you are willing to pay for XYZ manufacturing Co?

                               Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 93
   Answer: The value of XYZ today is the present value of the
future cashflows i.e. the incoming dividend and the potential
resale value discounted at the required rate of return of 8% p.a.

   You should be prepared to pay no more than 30.09 for XYZ
today. If you pay such price and assume that your cashflows
turn out to be as expected, the rate of return you achieve is 8%
p.a.

   This example assumes that you would only hold the share for
1 year. What if your investment horizon is 2 years. The company
announces that the dividend in the first year is $2.5 per share
and this dividend will increase by 10% in the following year. You
expect to be able to sell the stock at the end of year 2 for $37.
How much are you willing to pay for XYZ Co. today?

   No matter how long the investment horizon is expanded into
the future, the valuation principle still holds. The value of the
asset is the present value of all future cashflows where the
cashflows are all different.

   The dividend in year 2 is D2 = D1 x (1+0.1) = 2.5 x 1.1= 2.75

94 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
                   Price = PV(dividends) + PV(sale price)

6.3.3 Dividend discount model

The value of the stock today equals to the sum of all of its
future cashflows discounted back to their present values. If
dividends are the main cashflows that investors get for holding
the stock, the fair price of a stock can be computed using
the present value of these anticipated dividend payments. To
apply the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), it's necessary to
make projections about the future dividends a company will
pay. These projections often involve simplifying assumptions to
handle the uncertainty and variability of future dividends. Two
common methods used for this purpose are:

   Constant Growth Rate Model: This approach assumes that
dividends will grow at a constant rate indefinitely. It can also
consider a special case where the growth rate is zero, meaning
dividends are expected to remain constant over time.

   Variable Growth Rate Model: In contrast, this model allows
for dividends to grow at different rates during different periods.
It's more flexible and can accommodate various growth
patterns, such as a company expecting higher growth in the
initial years and lower growth thereafter.

   For an ordinary shareholder, the timeline for the cashflows
that the shareholder can expect is as follows:

                               Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 95
   The value of the stock can be calculated by discounting these
cashflows i.e. dividends and price to the present using the
discount rate r

   Since Pn, the price of the stock in period n, depends on the
present value of the future dividends starting in period n+1, the
price of the stock today can be simplified to:

   If these dividends are the same, the price of the stock can
be computed as the present value of a perpetuity. If these
dividends are not constant, calculating the price of the stock
involves forecasting future dividend until infinity which is
extremely difficult to do. However, when dividends are not
constant but growing at a constant rate forever then the above
formula becomes a perpetuity that grows at a constant rate
forever i.e. a growing perpetuity that we cover in chapter 3.

   Suppose that D0 is the dividend paid at time 0. If dividends
are growing at a constant rate g then D1 will be equal to D0 x (1
+ g), D2 = D1 x (1 + g). Substitute D1 = D0 x (1 + g) into D2, we have
D2 = D0 x (1 + g)2. Similarly, D3 = D0 x (1 + g)3 and so on.

   Using the growing perpetuity formula:

          Equation 4:

96 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
                                      or

   This is known as the Gordon Growth Model. The formula in
equation 4 reveals two important points: first, g has to be less
than r. The growth rate must be less than the discount rate. If
g = r then we have a situation where we have to divide D1 by
0 which is undefined. If g > r then the price will be negative
which is not possible since price can only be 0 under the worst
case scenario. It happens when you lose what have invested in,
price cannot be negative due to limited liability. Second, the
price of the stock today depends on dividends starting from
period 1 onwards. The value of a financial asset depends on
future cashflows not the cashflows in the past.

   Example: Suppose a company, XYZ Corp, just paid a dividend
of $3.00. Assume that this dividend is expected to grow at a rate
of 4% per year forever, if investors require a return of 15%, how
much are you willing to pay for XYZ stock today?

   Answer: The price of the stock today depends on dividend in
period 1 and onwards so the first thing we need to work out is
D1. Since the growth rate is constant at 4% per year, D1 = D0 x (1
+ g). D1 = $3 x (1 + 0.04) = 3.12.

   Applying the formula in equation 4, where D1= 3.12, g= 0.04
and r = 0.15. The price of the stock today is:

                               Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 97
6.3.4 Two-stage variable growth model

The Gordon Growth Model assumes that dividend will be
growing at a constant rate forever which is unrealistic for 2
reasons. First, if the growth rate is consistently higher than
some form of long-term average, for example, the global GDP
growth rate then it is possible that one day the company will be
larger than the world which is not possible. Second, companies
have different growth rates during its life cycle. When the
company is young, it will be growing at a very rapid rate. As
the company matures, the growth rate will be levelling off to
a steady state due to either increasing competition or running
out of innovations. To make the Gordon model more realistic,
we incorporate different stages of growth into the formula.

   The following example illustrates a scenario when the
company is growing very fast for the first 3 year. From year 4
onwards, the company grows at a smaller but stable rate until
infinity.

   If price is the present value of future cashflows then

   If D1 is growing at a constant growth rate of g then price at
time 0 can be calculated based on dividend in time 1

   In this scenario, the constant growth rate only take effects
from year 4 onwards so price at time 3 can be calculated based
on dividend in time 4

98 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
   Combining these two effects, the value of the stock at time 0
is therefore given by:

   The price at time 0 is the present value of a mixed stream
of cash flows for the first 3 years and growing perpetuity from
year 4 onwards. The last cashflow represents P3 i.e. value of the
stock at time 3. We need to discount it by further 3 periods to
arrive at the present value.

   Example: Suppose a firm is expected to increase dividends
by 20% in one year and by 15% in the second year. That is,
the first stage of rapid growth lasts for two years. After that
dividends will increase at a rate of 5% per year indefinitely. If the
last dividend was $1 and the required return is 20%, what is the
current price P0? What is the stock price at the end of year 2?

   Answer: As with any valuation exercise, the first task involves
estimating future cashflows. The timeline of the cashflows is
listed as follows:

   Since the constant growth rate will start taking effect from
dividend in year 3, this allows us to work out the value of the
stock at time 2.

   We know the discount rate r which is 20%, and the constant

                               Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 99
growth rate of 5%. However, we do not know dividend in time
3.

   The question states that dividend will increase in the first
year at 20% so D1 = D0 x (1 + 0.2).

   For the second year, dividend will increase further by 15% so
D2 = D1 x (1 + 0.15).

   After that, dividend will increase at a rate of 5% forever so D3
= D2 x (1 + 0.05).

   D3 = D0 (1 + 0.2) x (1 + 0.15) x (1 + 0.05) = 1 x 1.2 x 1.15 x 1.05 = $1.449.
   Once we have dividend in time 3 and since this dividend will
be growing at a constant rate forever, the value of the stock at
time 2 is:

   The cashflows for the stock can be simplified as:

   The current price of the stock can be computed using D1, D2
and P2 as follows:

             D0 = 1
             D1 = D0 * (1 + 0.2) = 1(1.2)=1.2
             D2 = D1*(1 + 0.15) = 1*(1.2)*(1.15)=1.38
             D3 = D2*(1 + 0.05) = 1*(1.2)*(1.15)*(1.05)=1.449

100 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
6.4 Other approaches to share valuation

The dividend discount model is one of the most popular
models used in share valuation. However, this model has a
number of limitations. First, the model is not applicable for
companies that do not pay dividends. Second, the model relies
heavily on projecting future dividends, growth rates for varying
phases, and a discount rate. Inaccurate predictions of these
variables can lead to a significantly erroneous stock valuation.
Essentially, the reliability of the valuation is contingent upon
the precision of the input data. Therefore, due to these
limitations, an alternative method of stock valuation that
employs market comparables is often used. This approach
assesses a company's value by comparing it with similar
companies in the market.

   Among the most commonly used metrics are the P/E (Price-
to-Earnings) ratio and the P/S (Price-to-Sales) ratio. The
underlying principle of this method is the assumption that
comparable firms should exhibit similar P/E ratios. Therefore,
if we possess the earnings information for the company of
interest, we can estimate its market value by multiplying its
earnings by the P/E ratio of its peers.

6.5 Overview of the Australian share
market (ASX)

The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is a principal financial
marketplace in Australia where securities including shares,
bonds, derivatives, and other financial instruments are actively
traded. As of 2024, there are 2200 companies listed on the ASX
with a total market capitalisation of 2.6 trillion dollars with an
average daily turnover around 6 billion dollars.

                              Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation | 101
6.5.1 Primary and secondary market

The primary market refers to the sector of the capital market
where new securities are created and offered directly to
investors by the issuing entities. This is the market where
businesses, governments, or public sector institutions can raise
capital by selling financial assets such as stocks, bonds, or other
instruments to investors for the first time. The funds raised
through these sales are typically used for expansion,
development projects, or other operational purposes. This
infusion of capital from investors to issuers is a fundamental
aspect of economic growth and corporate expansion.
Investment banks play a crucial role in this process by
underwriting these new financial assets and facilitating the
Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) or the issuance of new debt. The
process is characterized by several stages, including regulatory
approval, due diligence, and pricing, before the financial assets
are finally made available to the public.

   The secondary market on the other hand is where already-
issued securities are bought and sold by and to investors.
Unlike the primary market where securities are first issued by
companies in exchange for capital, the secondary market
involves the trading of existing ownership stakes in various
financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and other investment
instruments. Instead, the secondary market provides a
platform for investors to sell to and buy from one another,
offering a means to realize the value of their investments. In
this market, transactions are facilitated by brokerage firms and
do not involve the issuing companies; hence, no new capital
is raised for the corporations whose stocks are being traded. A
key feature of the secondary market is that it offers liquidity,
allowing for financial assets to be quickly converted to cash.
This process is crucial for the functionality of the primary
market, as investors are more likely to purchase new securities
if they know they can later sell them on the secondary market.

102 | Chapter 6 - Stock market and stock valuation
Moreover, it enables investors to diversify their portfolios and
manage risk more effectively by allowing them to adjust their
holdings in response to changes in market conditions or their
investment strategies.

6.5.2 Investment banking

Investment banks serve a pivotal role in the financial markets
by aiding companies in securing long-term financing. They
assist corporations through the complex process of issuing
bonds, which is a method of raising debt, as well as conducting
Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), the process through which a
company's shares are offered to the public in the equity
markets for the first time. In addition to helping the companies
with capital raising, investment banks also play a significant
role in facilitating mergers and acquisitions. They provide
strategic advisory services for both buyers and sellers, helping
to negotiate deals, structure transactions, and arrange the
financing needed to execute mergers or acquisitions.

   Investment banks are very different from commercial banks.
Commercial banks cater to the day-to-day banking needs of
individuals and businesses, offering services such as savings
accounts, mortgages, and personal loans. These banks play a
vital role in the economic cycle by accepting deposits, which
they then lend out, facilitating personal and business financial
growth.

      Summary and key takeaways

        This chapter explores the distinctive characteristics of
     equities and provides and overview of the Australian
     share market. We've acquired techniques for valuing
     stocks by employing methods like the Dividend
     Discount Model and analyzing market comparables.
     Shares are high-risk investments, yet they carry the
     potential for substantial returns. To determine the
     investment's merit, it's essential to assess if the
     expected returns from the stock adequately
     compensate for the risks. Upcoming chapters will
     broaden our understanding of this dynamic by
     examining the concepts of risk and return, providing a
     deeper insight into financial decision-making
     processes in the context of investing.

             return

7.1. Investment and the rate of return

An investment is the allocation of current money and resources
with the hope of achieving greater returns in the future. For
instance, buying a share in a company is done with the
expectation that the return generated from owning the share
will justify the time, the money locked up in the investment

106 | Chapter 7 - Risk and Return:
and the risk of the investment. An investment decision should
only be executed after considering the risk and return from the
investment. Let's first define what constitutes the return of an
investment.

   The return on an investment measures the performance of
the investment over a certain period. It captures the gain and
loss that the investor experienced on the investment. There are
two component that makes up the total return: the income
component i.e. dividends from the stock, coupon (interest)
payment from the bond or rental income from properties. The
second component is the capital gain (loss) from the
investment. It is the increase or decrease in the value of the
investment asset itself, which reflects the changes in the price
of the asset during the holding period.

   Realised return, as the name suggests, is the return from
an asset that has been realised. It measures the performance
of the asset during a given period, which is the change in
cashflows, divided by the initial investment. The realised return
takes into account both the capital gain and income
components.

          Equation 1:

where:

· Rt    Return over the period

· Asset Pricet Price at the end of the period

· Asset Pricet-1 Price at the end of the previous period

· CFt   Dividend received over the period

        Chapter 7 - Risk and Return: | 107
   Unlike realised return, expected return is the rate of return
expected to be earned from the investment over a period.
Expected return is about the future, while realised return is
about the past. Often, the expected return is also referred to
as the required rate of return, signifying the minimum rate of
return investors require to justify the risk of their investment
and to make the investment attractive to them.

7.2 Risk

7.2.1 Definition of risk

Webster's dictionary defines risk in the context of investments
as the potential for an asset, such as stock or commodity, to
decrease in value. Risk, in a broader sense, refers to the
likelihood that an investment's actual return will fall short of
its anticipated return. In the financial markets, since investors
dislike risks while prefer assets with high expected returns,
investors typically require higher expected returns as
compensation for assuming greater levels of risk. The principle
is that the more substantial the risk one takes, the greater the
return they will demand to justify the possibility of incurring a
loss. This dynamic is fundamental to investment strategy and
affects how portfolios are constructed, as investors seek to align
their risk tolerance with their financial goals.

7.2.2 Measuring expected return and risk

To determine the anticipated return and risk associated with
an asset, we employ two methodologies:

108 | Chapter 7 - Risk and Return:
   Historical data average: This approach involves calculating
the average return of the asset over a past period. By analysing
historical performance data, investors can get a sense of the
asset's average rate of return, which is then used as a basis to
estimate future returns. The expected return estimated using
the historical average is calculated as:

          Equation 2:

This process simply involves adding up each return
observations and divide by the number of periods. It is just a
simple arithmetic average:

          Equation 3:

Probability distribution method: This technique is applicable
when the potential outcomes and their respective probabilities
are known. By assigning probabilities to different possible
returns, one can calculate the expected return as a weighted
average, where each potential return is weighted by its
likelihood. This method is more nuanced and can
accommodate complex scenarios where returns are

                                                       Chapter 7 - Risk and Return: | 109
contingent on certain events or conditions. It allows for a more
tailored analysis based on specific forecasts or models of future
events.

7.2.3. How do we measure risk?

Harry Markowitz in his seminal 1952 "Portfolio Selection" paper
measure risk as the standard deviation of an investment's
returns. Standard deviation, a statistical measure, gauges the
range of possible outcomes, indicating the volatility of returns.

   To find standard deviation, we first need to compute variance
and standard deviation can be found by taking the square root
of the variance:

          Equation 4:

Intuitively, variance measures the "average" squared distance
from expected value i.e. what you expect to get compared to
what you might get. Since it is a squared measure, standard
deviation or risk is obtained by taking the square root of the
variance. Essentially, the wider the deviation from expected
value -- or the greater the standard deviation -- the higher the
risk associated with the investment.

   Most investors dislike risks or have an aversion to risk; this
phenomenon is termed `risk aversion.' Thus, investors typically
demand higher expected returns from investments that are

110 | Chapter 7 - Risk and Return:
perceived to be riskier. However, how large these
compensations for risk should be?

   It depends on individual risk preferences, which vary
significantly among investors as some are more risk averse
than others. In addition, the degree of risk aversion for a given
investor can change overtime and can be affected by various
factors such as personal financial situations, life stages, past
investment experiences, and even broader economic
conditions. Understanding this subjective element of
investment risk is crucial for both individual investors crafting
a personal investment strategy and for financial economists
designing models that attempt to predict market behaviour.

7.2.4. Risk premium

An investment with zero risk is called a risk-free asset. An
investment which has a risk element is called a risky asset, the
higher the risk the higher the expected return. Risk premiums
represent the additional returns that riskier investments
provide over safer alternatives, such as government bonds. This
premium serves as a form of compensation for investors who
tolerate the increased uncertainty inherent in riskier assets
compared to more secure ones.

   Consider the rationale behind an investor's decision to
engage in the stock market rather than depositing funds into
a bank account. The choice often stems from the expectation
that, although the stock market involves more risk, it also
typically offers a higher return as a reward for bearing that risk.
On average, historical data shows that stocks have yielded a
risk premium of approximately 4-6% over Treasury bonds. This
premium incentivizes investors to allocate capital to the stock
market, accepting the additional risk in anticipation of greater
financial rewards.

                                                         Chapter 7 - Risk and Return: | 111
7.3 Portfolio theory

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz
in 1952, is a revolutionary approach to investment strategy that
extends beyond the merit of individual asset selection to the
dynamics of portfolio composition. It's not solely about
identifying a good investment but about creating the optimal
mix of assets to balance the overall portfolio risk and return.

   At the heart of MPT is the concept of diversification. The
theory asserts that a portfolio composed of various
investments will, on the whole, bear less risk than the sum of
the risks of its individual components. This reduction in risk is
achieved because the price movements of different assets are
not perfectly correlated.

   The key question is how do we come up with a "diverse
investment"? This brings us to the concept of portfolio.

7.3.1 What is a portfolio?

A portfolio is a collection of assets. A portfolio is formed to
reduce risk. Suppose you have $10,000 to invest and you decide
to put $3,000 in stock A and $7,000 in stock B. Stock A earns
an expected return of 7% p.a. while stock B earns an expected
return of 10% p.a. What is the expected return of the portfolio?

   Answer: The weight of stock A in the portfolio is 7,000/10,000
= 0.7. A makes up 70 percent of the portfolio and B therefore
makes up 30 percent of the portfolio. The weight of all
securities that make up the portfolio has to be 1. The expected
return of the portfolio is the weighted average of the expected
returns of the assets that make up the portfolio. In this case, it
is 0.7 x 0.07 +0.3 x 0.1 = 0.052.

112 | Chapter 7 - Risk and Return:
7.3.2. How does diversification reduce risk?

The volatility of the portfolio can be reduced if the assets in the
portfolio do not perfectly move in the same direction. Suppose
you have two assets X and Y and if X goes up 10%, Y goes down
by 10% then by investing in both X and Y, you can achieve a
portfolio with zero risk. On the other hand, if X goes up by 10%,
Y also goes up by 10%, then putting both X and Y in the same
portfolios will not eliminate any risk. How much risk you can
reduce depends on the co-movement in returns between the
assets in the portfolio. The correlation coefficient is a statistical
measure that dictates the relationship between two variables.
A correlation coefficient only fluctuates between -1 and 1. The
lower the correlation coefficient, the greater the diversification
benefits. If the correlation is 1, there is no diversification benefit.

   Since every company is different, their correlation is not 1
and therefore the more companies you put into a portfolio, the
greater the diversification benefits or risk reduction. However,
there is a limit to diversification. As the number of companies
in the portfolio increases, there is some risk that still remains.
This risk is known as systematic risk.

   Assets tend to move positively with each other since they
are affected by macroeconomic factors that have pervasive
impacts on the whole economy. Through diversification, the
risk that we can reduce is unsystematic risk, risks that are
specific to individual companies. On the other hand, market
wide factors that affect all risky assets cannot be diversified
away. Risk can be decomposed into two components:

           Total risk = Systematic Risk + Firm Specific Risk.
   Systematic risk, also known as market risk, is the type of
risk that affects the entire market or economy. Examples of
systematic risks are interest rate changes, inflation, recessions
and wars etc.. Systematic risks cannot be diversified.
   Firm specific risk, also known as unsystematic risk, is the
type of risk that only affects a specific company or industry.

                                                        Chapter 7 - Risk and Return: | 113
Examples of unsystematic can include poor management
decisions, production capabilities or changes in consumers
demand for its products and services.

   Since unsystematic risks can be eliminated, the relevant
measure of risk should only be systematic risk. If investors wish
to hold an undiversified portfolio and hence be exposed to
unsystematic risk then that is purely the decision of the
investors which the market will not compensate for.

7.3.3 How is systematic risk quantified?

In finance, we measure systematic risk using beta. Beta
captures the proportionate movement in the stock returns
relative to the returns on the market as a whole. For example,
consider a stock with a beta of 1.5. This suggests that if the
market return increases by 2% during a specific timeframe,
the stock's return is expected to increase by 3% (1.5 times the
market movement) in that same timeframe. On the other
hand, a stock with a beta of 0.5 implies that if the market return
rises by 2%, the stock's return would likely increase by just 1% in
that period, showing less sensitivity to market movements.

   Stocks with a beta greater than 1 are considered more volatile
than the entire market, while those with a beta equal to 1 have
volatility that mirrors the market average. Stocks with a beta
less than 1 are less volatile in comparison. The market itself has
a beta fixed at 1.0. Typically, a stock's beta is found between
0 and 2, although negative betas can occur. Over time, it is
observed that betas generally gravitate toward the mean value
of 1.0.

114 | Chapter 7 - Risk and Return:
7.4. The Capital Asset Pricing Model

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) developed by William
Sharpe (1964) provides a description on the relationship
between expected return and risk of the asset. According to the
CAPM, the only relevant measure of risk is not the variance or
the total risk but only the systematic risk component, which is
the covariance with the market portfolio, known as beta. The
higher the beta, the higher the expected return.

   Expected return = Risk free rate + risk premium

          Equation 5:

The CAPM provides a useful concept for evaluating investment
risks and returns. It suggests that the expected return on a
security is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The
risk premium is determined by the beta of the security,
reflecting how much risk the investment adds to a diversified
portfolio.

   Since beta is computed based the covariance with the
market portfolio, we need to define what is the market
portfolio. The market portfolio is a portfolio that includes all
securities in the market. Since constructing such portfolio is
typical costly and hence not feasible, we can get a pretty good
proxy for the market portfolio. In Australia, we use the All
Ordinaries Index or S&P/ASX 200 Index to proxy for the market
portfolio. In the U.S, the S&P500 index or Russell 2000 are often
used as the market portfolio.

   Once you know the betas of the individual assets that make

                                                        Chapter 7 - Risk and Return: | 115
up the portfolio, you can calculate the beta of the portfolio as
follows:

          Equation 6:

Example: Support you have 3 stocks in your portfolio A, B and
C. You invest $10,000 in stock A, $15,000 in stock B and $25,000
in stock C. The beta of stock A is 0.8, the beta of stock B is 1.2
while beta of stock C is 1.5. What is the beta of the portfolio?

   Answer:
   Total Portfolio Value=$10,000+$15,000+$25,000=$50,000.
   The weight of stock A is 10,000/50,000 = 0.2.
   The weight of stock B is 15,000/50,000 = 0.3
   The weight of stock C is 25,000/50,000 = 0.5.
   Beta of the portfolio is (0.8×0.2)+(1.2×0.3)+(1.5×0.5) = 1.27.

      Summary and Key Takeaways

        In this topic, we define risk and expected return of an
     individual asset. Next, we learn to form portfolio in
     order to reduce risk. In equilibrium, investors will prefer
     a well-diversified portfolio since it will give investors the
     lowest risk for a given level of expected return or the

116 | Chapter 7 - Risk and Return:
     highest expected return for a given level of risk. When
     investors hold a well diversified portfolio, what matters
     is the systematic risk component. A security's expected
     return only depends on the systematic risk and market
     risk premium.

8.1 An overview of the foreign exchange
market

The foreign exchange market is a global venue for the trading
of currencies, allowing participants to convert one type of
currency into another. The primary purposes of the foreign

118 | Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange
exchange (FX) markets include enabling the settlement of
cross-border transactions that stem from international trade
activities, investment and financing operations, establishing
the relative prices of different currencies, and providing a
platform for market participants to hedge against potential
losses due to currency value fluctuations.

   These markets play a critical role in supporting international
business by ensuring that entities can engage in financial
transactions in the appropriate currency for their needs.
Moreover, the FX markets contribute to the determination of
exchange rates, which are vital economic indicators
influencing global economic health. Investors and businesses
utilize these markets to manage their exposure to foreign
exchange risk, ensuring that currency volatility does not
adversely impact their financial strategies and operations.

8.1.1 What is an exchange rate?

An exchange rate is the price at which one currency can be
exchanged for another. It's an expression of the value of one
currency in terms of another. For instance, if the exchange rate
between the US dollar (USD) and the euro (EUR) is 1.2, it means
that one USD can be exchanged for 1.2 euros. Exchange rates
can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic
indicators, market speculation, political stability, and interest
rates. The US dollar plays a pivotal role in the world of exchange
rates due to several factors:

   Reserve Currency: The USD is widely held by governments
and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves. This
widespread use as a reserve currency underpins its
significance in global trade and finance.

   Benchmark Currency: Many commodities and goods traded
on the global market are priced in USD, including oil, gold,
and many other raw materials. This means that the dollar is

                                                     Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange | 119
a benchmark currency against which the value of other
currencies is often measured.

   Global Trade: The USD is the primary medium of exchange
in international trade. For countries that do not have widely
traded currencies, the USD serves as the intermediary,
enabling easier trade between countries with different
currencies.

   Financial Markets: The United States hosts some of the
world's largest and most liquid financial markets. This makes
the USD a dominant currency for international borrowing and
investing.

   In addition to the USD, The Trade Weighted Index (TWI) is
a complex measure that evaluates the Australian Dollar (AUD)
against a portfolio of various international currencies. These
currencies are selected based on their significance in
international trade with Australia. The TWI assigns different
weights to each currency, reflecting the proportion of trade
that Australia conducts with each respective currency's
country of origin.

8.1.2 Pegged versus floating exchange rates

In the aftermath of World War II, the Bretton Woods
Agreement and System were established, shaping a new
international monetary framework that spanned from the
mid-1940s until the early 1970s. This system brought together
44 Allied nations in an unprecedented cooperative effort to
manage currency exchange and foster financial stability across
nations. At the heart of the Bretton Woods System was the
requirement for other countries to peg their currencies to the
value of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar, in turn, was linked to
gold at a fixed rate of 35 dollars per ounce. This gold standard
for the dollar provided a sense of security and stability, as it

120 | Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange
guaranteed that the dollar's value was backed by a tangible
asset.

   However, by 1971, it became evident that the United States
did not possess sufficient gold reserves to support the
burgeoning supply of dollars worldwide. This discrepancy led
to a `run on the gold reserve' as countries began to doubt
the sustainability of the fixed exchange rate and sought to
exchange their dollar holdings for gold. Developed countries
started to shift from the Bretton Woods System and move
towards a floating exchange rate system, where the value of
a currency is allowed to fluctuate according to the foreign
exchange market. In this new era, exchange rates were no
longer fixed to a specific gold quantity or pegged to the dollar.
Instead, they were determined by supply and demand
dynamics, influenced by factors such as interest rates,
economic performance, and geopolitical events.

   This transition marked the beginning of modern foreign
exchange markets which is a complex global system where
currency values are subject to rapid changes and are
influenced by a multitude of economic conditions and policies.
The shift to floating rates also reflected a broader trend towards
liberalized trade and capital flows, setting the stage for the
integrated global economy that continues to evolve in the
present day.

   In today's global economy, most currencies are subject to
floating exchange rates, where their values are determined by
the forces of market supply and demand. This market-driven
approach can lead to greater short-term fluctuations in
currency values, as they respond to real-time economic events
and sentiment. However, this system also tends to prevent the
build-up of imbalances that require large, disruptive
adjustments.

   For instance, Australia made a significant shift in its
monetary policy by allowing the Australian Dollar (AUD) to float
on the 12th of December 1983. This transition from a fixed

                                                     Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange | 121
exchange rate meant that the AUD's value was no longer tied
to any specific foreign currency or set of currencies, and
instead, its value could change from moment to moment
based on trading in the foreign exchange market. This move
was aimed at giving the Australian economy greater flexibility
to absorb external shocks and to align more closely with the
constantly changing conditions of the global economy.

   In contrast, some developing countries employ a managed
floating rate system. This hybrid approach allows a currency
to float in the foreign exchange markets, but the central bank
might intervene to stabilize or adjust the currency's value in
relation to other currencies. The Chinese Yuan (CNY), for
instance, has been managed in such a way that it is loosely
pegged to a basket of currencies, allowing the People's Bank of
China to guide its valuation while still letting market dynamics
play a role.

8.1.3 The role of exchange rates in the
economy

Exchange rates hold critical significance within an economy, as
they are the determining prices at which a country values its
international transactions. They directly affect the local cost of
goods and services that are traded in foreign currencies, as well
as the domestic valuation of foreign assets and liabilities held
by investors within the country.

  · Exporters: Companies based in Australia that
      manufacture goods or provide services domestically and
      then sell these to international customers are subject to
      exchange rate risk. A rise in the value of the Australian
      Dollar (AUD) against other currencies can make their
      products more expensive and less competitive in global
      markets. Exporters will favour a low exchange rate.

122 | Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange
  · Importers: Businesses that import goods and services to
      sell within Australia will benefit if AUD appreciates as the
      same AUD now buys more of the foreign goods. A weaker
      AUD on the other hand increases the cost of purchasing
      these foreign goods, affecting profitability.

  · Investors: Australians investing in international markets,
      whether in stocks, bonds, or real estate, must consider the
      impact of exchange rate movements on their investments.
      If the AUD depreciates against the currency of the
      investment, the value of the investment in AUD terms
      increases, and vice versa.

  · Borrowers: Entities or individuals that take out loans
      denominated in foreign currencies face risks if the AUD
      weakens against the currency they must repay their debt
      in. This could increase the cost of servicing the debt when
      converted back into AUD.

The influence of exchange rates extends beyond these groups
to almost every sector that engages with the global economy,
from tourism operators to multinational corporations. It affects
decisions ranging from pricing strategies and budget
forecasting to international expansions and hedging policies.

8.2. Quotes of foreign exchange

A direct quote in the context of foreign exchange (forex) is the
price of one unit of a foreign currency expressed in terms of the
local or domestic currency.

   In Australia, the value of the Australian dollar is measured as
the value of 1 AUD relative to the US Dollar, often abbreviated as
AUD/USD. For example, if AUD/USD equals to 0.68, this means
that 1 AUD can be exchanged for 0.66 USD or 66 US cents. An
increase in this measure reflects an appreciation of the AUD,

                                                     Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange | 123
while a decrease in AUD/USD reflects the AUD has depreciated
against the USD.

8.2.1. Cross rates

Cross rates are exchange rates between two currencies
calculated from their common relationships with a third
currency, often known as the intermediary currency.

   Example: Imagine you are an investor or a traveller looking to
exchange EUR for AUD, and there's no direct EUR/AUD quote
available. You can calculate the cross rate EUR/AUD using USD
as the intermediary currency. EUR/USD = 1.15 (1EUR = 1.15 USD).
AUD/USD = 0.77 (1 AUD= 0.77 USD).

   EUR/AUD = EUR/USD * USD/AUD. You do not have USD/AUD,
what you have is AUD/USD which is 0.77. Therefore, USD/AUD =
1/0.77 = 1.3. EUR/AUD = 1.15 * 1.3 = 1.495. So, 1EUR = 1.495 AUD.

8.2.2 Explaining exchange rate movement

Exchange rates movements are very difficult to predict. There
are a number of factors that influence the fluctuations of
exchange rates and these factors do not happen in isolation,
they often interact with each other which makes exchange rate
movements very difficult to predict.

 1. Purchasing Power Parity: PPP is based on the law of one
      price which states that in the absence of transaction costs
      and other barriers to trade, the price of identical goods
      and services should equalize across different countries
      when prices are expressed in a common currency. This is
      because any significant price differences would be
      eliminated through arbitrage--the practice of buying

124 | Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange
     goods in a cheaper market to sell them in a more
     expensive one. In practice, PPP does not hold because of
     transaction costs, tariffs and other trade barries exist and
     can prevent the prices of the same goods to be equal. In
     addition, PPP only applies to tradable goods and not to
     services such as haircuts.
2. Expected interest rate parity (EIRP): Interest rate parity
     suggests the difference in interest rates between two
     countries will be equal to the differential between the
     forward exchange rate and the spot exchange rate of their
     currencies. Carry trade is a strategy used by investors
     where they borrow money in a currency with a low-
     interest rate and invest it in a currency with a higher
     interest rate. The goal is to profit from the interest rate
     differential as long as the exchange rate between the two
     currencies does not offset the profit from the interest
     rates. Even though carry trades are based on exploiting
     the interest rate differentials, they are not reliable
     predictors of currency movements because currency
     values are influenced by many factors other than interest
     rates, including economic data, political events, and
     market sentiment. Central banks can change interest
     rates unexpectedly, affecting currency values and carry
     trade positions or high-interest rate currencies often come
     with higher risk, which can lead to sudden and sharp
     "unwinding" of carry trades if the market sentiment
     changes.
3. Expected interest rates: When a country is expected to
     raise its interest rates, it often leads to an inflow of foreign
     capital. Investors and international capital tend to seek the
     highest return, so if they expect a country's interest rates
     to rise, they might start moving funds into that country's
     assets in anticipation of higher returns. This increased
     demand for the country's currency (needed to purchase
     the local assets) tends to drive up its value.

                                                    Chapter 8 - Foreign Exchange | 125
4. Terms of trade (ratio of export prices to import prices):
      The terms of trade measure the rate at which a country's
      exports can be exchanged for imports. An improvement in
      the terms of trade (where export prices rise relative to
      import prices) typically generates more revenue from
      exports relative to the cost of imports. As international
      buyers purchase a country's exports, they need to acquire
      the country's currency to make payments, leading to
      increased demand for that currency on the foreign
      exchange market. As demand for the currency increases,
      its value will generally appreciate. If the terms of trade
      deteriorate (export prices fall or import prices rise),
      demand for the currency weakens, leading to
      depreciation. For a country like Australia, which is a major
      exporter of commodities such as iron ore, coal, and natural
      gas, the terms of trade are significantly influenced by
      global commodity prices. When commodity prices are
      high, Australia's terms of trade improve, strengthening the
      AUD.

 5. Current account balance: The current account includes
      the trade balance (exports and imports of goods and
      services), net income from abroad (like dividends and
      interest), and net current transfers (such as foreign aid,
      remittances). When a country's exports exceed its imports,
      it has a trade surplus, and there is a higher demand for its
      currency. This is because foreign buyers need to exchange
      their currency for the exporting country's currency to pay
      for the goods or services. This increased demand can
      cause the currency to appreciate. Conversely, if a country's
      imports are greater than its exports, it has a trade deficit.
      This condition means that more of its currency is being
      used to purchase foreign goods and services than is being
      brought in by exports. This increased supply of the
      currency on the global market can lead to depreciation.

6. RBA intervention: Central banks may intervene in foreign

    exchange markets to influence the value of their currency.
    This is typically done to counteract excessive volatility or
    misalignments that are not consistent with the country's
    economic fundamentals. If a central bank believes its
    currency is undervalued and has depreciated too much
    due to market overshooting or speculation, it may
    intervene by buying its own currency. This demand can
    prop up the currency's value. Conversely, if the currency is
    deemed to be overvalued, the central bank may sell its
    own currency to push down its value, making exports
    more competitive. Interventions are generally large in
    scale to ensure they have the necessary impact on the
    market. However, they tend to be infrequent to maintain
    the market credibility of the central bank and avoid the
    expectation that the central bank will always act to correct
    movements in the exchange rate.
7. Speculation: Speculation in the context of foreign
    exchange (FX) refers to the act of trading currencies with
    the aim of making a profit from fluctuations in exchange
    rates. Speculators do not necessarily intend to take
    delivery of the currency; instead, they seek to predict and
    capitalize on market movements.
