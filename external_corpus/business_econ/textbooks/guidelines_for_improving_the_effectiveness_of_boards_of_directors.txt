               About the Textbook

The purpose of this book is to help boards of directors of nonprofit organizations improve
their performance after completing the Board Check-Up, online board performance self-
assessment tool found at www.boardcheckup.com.

    It is important to understand, however, that this book can also be used as a stand-alone
resource for any board seeking to assess its performance in that it contains the diagnostic
questions on which the online self-assessment tool is based. It goes further by providing a
framework for boards to use in discussing needed changes in board performance.

    It also forms an integral part of a University at Albany, SUNY online course titled, The
Governance of Nonprofit Organizations. This massive open online course (MOOC) can be
taken for free or academic credit through Coursera's online teaching and learning platform.

    For more information about this book, the Board Check-Up, and the nonprofit gover-
nance MOOC, please contact Prof. Yvonne Harrison at yharrison@albany.edu.

Review by Mike Flinton

Dr. Vic Murray and Dr. Yvonne Harrison have created a truly unique "how-to manual" that
surpasses that clichéd label and successfully developed a management and leadership tool
designed to help nonprofit board members, their CEOs, and aspiring nonprofit profes-
sionals to lead in an effective and efficient manner that insures participation by all.

    This book is suitable for current board members and CEOs of nonprofit organizations
in the U.S., Canada, or abroad, as well as graduate level faculty and students in the U.S. or
Canada. Still others may find it helpful depending on the legal, social, and cultural environ-
ments that they and their nonprofit organizations operate in.

    Having worked as a team, and by engaging hundreds of veteran board members and
their organizations, Murray and Harrison use what they refer to as a "health check-up" as-
sessment model and methodology. Using this, they've created a paradigm shift that enables
nonprofit leaders to identify and explore the "Symptoms," "Diagnosis," and "Treatment"
of the illnesses most common to nonprofit organizations. Throughout the 11 chapters of
this guidebook, the authors remain committed to the health check-up analogy and process,
which enables those in the trenches of nonprofit organizations, as well as those in the
classroom, to use the text as a highly functional analysis and remedy tool.

    Going well beyond a simple "how-to" mindset, the Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treat-
ment discussions on each topic are backed up with additional information accompanied by
a plethora of .org, .com, .edu, and .gov web sites and print materials supporting what these
two respected educators have to offer.

    This publication can serve either as a standalone textbook or a supporting tool to
the online Board Check-Up, which the authors developed before writing the guidebook.
Hence, www.boardcheckup.com and the textbook were wisely developed for a variety of
purposes and audiences.

    Whether using it as an individual tool, or accompanying the self-assessment online
through Board Check-Up, whether you are directly faced with the challenges of overseeing
a nonprofit organization, responsible for teaching others "how to," or seeking to someday be
a nonprofit professional yourself, you would be wise to examine this guidebook.

    Mike Flinton has over 20 years experience as a not-for-profit and higher education pro-
fessional. In addition to having served as the director of the Saratoga Automobile Museum in
Saratoga Springs, NY he has enjoyed being a board member and leader in a variety of organiza-
tions ranging from the Executive Service Corps of the Tri-Cities (ESCOT) to the Underground
Railroad History Project of the Capital Region among many others.

    Before retiring from SUNY, Mike taught not-for-profit administration and management
at SUNY Oneonta's nationally recognized Cooperstown Graduate Program in Museum Studies.
He has also worked at four other SUNY campuses and mentored students from Skidmore College
pursuing careers in the not-for-profit sector. He has advised and supported such widely recognized
organizations as the Schenectady Museum (now called MiSci), Capital District Habitat for Hu-
manity, Historical Albany Foundation, the World Awareness Children's Museum in Glens Falls,
and Wiawaka Holiday House, a women's retreat center in Lake George. He is a regular guest
lecturer at graduate level not-for-profit administration and management classes at UAlbany.
    Before becoming a museum professional and consultant, Mike had a successful career in the
United States Air Force where he lived and worked in more than a dozen countries and became
involved in diverse social and public services programs, as well as history, art and cultural orga-
nizations in the U.S. and abroad.

    Mike has an MS degree in Public Administration from Central Michigan University, an MA
in History from University at Alabany SUNY, a BS in Business Management & Administration
from University of Maryland's European Division and a BS in Human Resource Management

Review by Hélène Cameron

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations will
interest those who care about the governance of NPOs, especially board members, man-
agers, and students of nonprofit organizations.The authors, Dr. Vic Murray and Dr. Yvonne
Harrison, are specialists in the study of voluntary sector organizations and their deep un-
derstanding of the subject matter shows. As a practitioner with many years of experience
with and on boards of nonprofit organizations, I have lived much of what is described in
these guidelines. Murray and Harrison's comprehensive yet concise and accessible treat-
ment of what makes boards tick is dead-on. They use an effective device patterned on the
health check-up to link the "symptoms" of poor board performance with a "diagnosis" and
"treatment" and recommend resources to consult for a deeper understanding and practical
tools. It's all in one place... and it is readable and credible.

    The guidebook mirrors Board Check-Up, an online self-assessment tool they designed
to assist in improving board performance. Each chapter deals with one of the nine ef-
fectiveness challenges faced by the board: authority and responsibilities; role in planning,
performance assessment, and fundraising; structure and operating procedures, including
meetings; composition and development; informal culture; and finally, leadership.

    Whether used in conjunction with the online tool or not, the guidebook should prove
useful in several ways:

       · as a framework for understanding the role, structure and operation of a board
         within a nonprofit organization

       · as the basis for orienting novice board members to the nature and scope of their
         new environment

       · in identifying the action that boards might take to improve performance and the
         resources and tools available to assist them

       · in setting priorities for corrective action, based on an understanding of the poten-
         tial impact of the assessed area and the feasibility of the remedy.

    As the authors repeatedly counsel, boards have to do their own homework and find
their own fit. This guidebook should help get the job done.

    Through employment and community service, Hélène Cameron has an extensive background
in non-profit governance, primarily in the areas of education and health. She gained valuable
experience as the former executive director of non-profit organizations and as a volunteer and
director on several non-profit boards in British Columbia. As a consultant, she has assisted several
societies in the governance and strategic renewal process.

                     Chapter 1

             Introduction

The purpose of this book is to help boards of directors of nonprofit organizations improve
their performance after completing the online board self-assessment tool found at www.
boardcheckup.com. However, it can also be used as a stand-alone resource for any board
seeking to enhance its effectiveness in that it contains the diagnostic questions on which
the online tool is based.

    The approach taken here is similar to that which lies behind health checkups for indi-
viduals. Doctors usually begin by asking us to review a lengthy list of possible health issues
and we check those about which we have concerns. The doctor and patient then focus their
discussions on these issues. The typical process proceeds through the following three stages:

      1. Understanding the symptoms. The doctor and patient begin by trying to define the
         issues more clearly.

      2. Diagnosis. Effort is made to understand the causes of the problems through tests
         and further examinations.

      3. Treatment. Once the problem has been properly diagnosed, a treatment program
         to remedy it is begun.

    While the Board Check-Up survey on which this book is based does not claim to be as
scientifically rigorous as a medical examination, it is based on the same logic. It begins by
having those who belong to, or relate to, boards provide their perceptions of how well the
board is working by guiding them through a list of potential "health issues," i.e. statements
of possible problems, issues, or challenges that boards might encounter in their work. These
statements have been derived from comments made by those who serve on boards or in-
teract with them as well as from the work of researchers and consultants who have studied
boards over the past 30 years. The process reveals both the things that the respondents
feel the board is doing well in addition to those that are seen as problematic. Once issues
(symptoms) have been identified, they become the focal point for discussions that explore
how serious they are, what might be causing them (diagnosis), and what can be done to
resolve them (treatment).

The Theory Behind the Guidelines

    The conceptual framework on which the Board Check-Up is based is shown in Figure
1 below. It shows that effectiveness challenges faced by boards can be grouped in two
dimensions: (a) the board's roles and responsibilities as a governing body; and (b) the fac-

                                         Introduction|1
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

tors that influence how well the board carries them out. Figure 1 further shows that within
these two dimensions there exist nine basic sets of board effectiveness challenges. They are,

A. Effectiveness challenges related to the performance of the
board's roles and responsibilities in the governance process.

      1. The clarity of the board's role vis a vis management and other stakeholders in the
         organization's environment;

      2. How well it carries out its duty to establish the organization's mission and the
         broad guiding strategic plans, priorities and general policies within which the or-
         ganization should operate;

      3. How clear and effective it is in carrying out its fiduciary role in assessing the per-
         formance of the organization and those to whom it delegates authority (e.g. the
         Chief Executive Officer) as well as its assessment of risks facing the organization.

      4. How well it contributes to ensuring that the organization has the financial re-
         sources it needs to operate and achieve its mission.

B. Effectiveness challenges related to the factors that influence
the board's ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities.

      5. Aspects of the formal structure and operating procedures of the board such as
         its size, by-laws, job descriptions, committee structure, information systems, and
         administrative support;

      6. The effectiveness of board meetings;
      7. Various aspects of the makeup of the board's membership and how well board

         members are oriented and trained;
      8. The role played by informal, shared attitudes and beliefs about how the board

         should behave, commonly known as the board's "culture";
      9. The influence of two key people who provide formal and informal leadership to

         the board--the board Chair and the organization's top paid manager or CEO, if
         there is one.
    Figure 1 recognizes that, taken together, these nine effectiveness challenges influence
the performance of the organization as a whole (e.g. advancement of the mission, financial
condition, efficiency, ability to learn and grow, motivation of paid staff and volunteers, and
the support provided by stakeholders in the external environment).
    It should be noted that boards are not the only contributors to the effectiveness of the
organization.
    Figure 1 shows the host of contextual factors that influence the governance process
and the organization's effectiveness. Though they may often not be aware of it, a board's
behavior may be affected by characteristics of the organization it governs--for example
its history, size, and the nature of its mission. The actions of external stakeholders such as
funders, regulators, and other organizations in the community or industry of which they
are a part are also significant. Some of them have actual legal authority over some aspects
of board responsibility while others have informal, yet powerful, forms of influence. Finally,
all nonprofit organizations exist within a larger society. Countries and communities can

                                         Introduction|2
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

differ widely in the political and economic climates they create. Cultural values about the
nature of charity, volunteering and the role of nonprofits create different environments for
the NPO's within them (see Salamon and Anheier, 1997).

    For the purposes of this book we will not enter into in-depth discussions of these
contextual influences on governance effectiveness. However, it must be noted that these
influences are included in the Board Check-Up survey and are a focus of the larger research
study of which the survey is a part. Papers produced from this research are available to reg-
istered users of the Board Check-Up (www.boardcheckup.com). Because the focus of this
book is primarily practical, it will deal with the issues that challenge boards (symptoms),
why they occur (diagnosis) and the ways that boards can consciously choose to improve their
effectiveness in the governance process (treatment). Those interested in the growing body
of academic research on the topic of contextual influences should see the 2014 Routledge
Press book, Innovative Perspectives in Nonprofit Governance, edited by Chris Cornforth and
Will Brown.

                                   Nine Elements of Board Effectiveness

Organization of this Book

    As noted above, this book is intended to help boards assess their own performance
and make decisions to improve the effectiveness of the governance process. Each chapter
focuses on one of the nine dimensions of governance effectiveness described in Figure 1.
The chapter starts with items relating to that dimension on the Board Performance Self-
Assessment Questionnaire.These items represent the symptoms that indicate possible issues,
problems, or challenges faced by the board. This is followed by a discussion of possible

                                         Introduction|3
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations
reasons that such symptoms might exist (diagnosis). The third part of each chapter looks
at what might be done to alleviate the symptoms once a diagnosis is made (treatment).
Included in this final part of the chapter are references to websites, books, and articles that
provide additional advice and assistance on how to deal with the issues raised.

      The Board's Role and
          Responsibilities

Symptoms

While virtually everyone agrees that the role of the board in nonprofit organizations is to
enable them to achieve their mission, differences arise when it comes to specifying exactly
what the board's authority and responsibilities should be. In fact, this is probably the most
frequently written about topic in the literature on nonprofit organization boards. Since
most nonprofits also have paid or volunteer CEOs and managers, the question arises: what
should the board's role and authority be compared to that held by these other important
positions?

    A high percentage of agreement with the following statements indicates that there is a
lack of clarity in and around the board as to what its role ought to be:
 The board seems to be unclear about what its role ought to be.
 The board and the CEO or Executive Director sometimes seem to have different

    ideas about the authority each should have.
 The board tends to act too much as a "rubber stamp" for decisions made by the

    organization's top management.
 The board gets too involved in making decisions about operational details that

    ought to be made by management.
 Board members are unclear about their legal liabilities and what protection they

    have against them.
    A closer look at the above statements shows there are actually two basic issues involved

      1. What is the board's legal authority? There are certain duties boards must perform

         because they are legally responsible for the actions of the organization (as defined
         by those who authorize the organization to exist or give it tax exempt status). Their
         primary role is that of a fiduciary, which is to say that they are entrusted to look
         after the interests of the organization. In practical terms this translates into making

                           The Board's Role and Responsibilities|5
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

         sure that the organization is achieving its mission, not wasting its money and not
         breaking any laws.
      2. However, it is usually not feasible for boards to make all the decisions. While re-
         taining responsibility for the overall performance of the organization, the board
         must delegate authority to others such as the CEO. (If it is an all-volunteer orga-
         nization with no paid CEO, it may still delegate authority to volunteer committees
         or office holders). Those to whom authority is delegated have the power to make
         certain decisions, which the board can review only in the context of assessing the
         organization's overall performance. The question is, therefore, what matters should
         boards decide on and what should they delegate? This question is discussed under
         "Treatment" below.

Diagnosis

    Why do boards and those who relate to them become confused about the authority of
the board?

    Regarding the board's legal authority, a lack of clarity usually exists because board
members are not properly informed about the laws defining that authority and legal li-
ability with respect to board activities. Confusion and lack of clarity about the board's
responsibilities and decision-making authority arises for a number of reasons.

       · The most common cause is that boards fail to adapt to changes in the organization's
         environment. Many nonprofit organizations start with very little money and few
         or no paid staff. As a result, volunteers conduct much of the work, and among the
         most active volunteers are board members. Meetings of boards often deal with
         everyday operating problems and small crises. When these organizations become
         more successful and are able to employ professional managers, many board mem-
         bers experience great difficulty in letting go of their involvement in day-to-day
         operations. At the same time the management team becomes frustrated over not
         knowing what they can decide and what they must refer to the board for deci-
         sion. Once patterns of decision-making become established they form part of the
         board's informal culture and thus recede into the background to the point that they
         are taken for granted and never questioned.

       · The same kind of confusion can arise when an organization experiences sudden
         major crises such as large funding cuts or unanticipated resignations of key staff. At
         such times boards often find themselves pushed into making operating decisions
         and don't know how or when to relinquish this role.

       · In some cases, the lack of clarity exists because the CEO and key board members
         simply differ in their opinions about what the role of each party should be. If these
         root philosophical differences are never addressed directly, this situation leads to an
         endless series of disagreements over many issues.

Treatment

Lack of Clarity about the Board's Legal Authority
and Liability

    The basic knowledge about the board's legal authority and responsibility can be most
easily obtained from a few good websites or written publications. These also provide impor-
tant information about the nature and extent of a board's legal liabilities--the grounds on
which boards can be sued for failure to carry out their duties properly. Normally, providing
board members with orientation and simple written materials on this subject will suffice;
however, if specific circumstances suggest that the organization faces any unusual situa-
tions, lawyers with specialized knowledge of this field should be consulted. It is important
to realize that the laws on the duties and responsibilities of boards and their legal liability
can vary from country to country and, in federated countries such as the U.S. and Canada,
from one state or province to another.

Clarifying the Board's Role in Decision-making

    The only way to deal with confusion or conflict around the role of the board is through
education and discussion among all affected parties. This includes all board members, the
board Chair, the organization's CEO, and other members of the management team who
have expectations about the board carrying out certain actions. It should also include key
funders or stakeholders who might feel they have some kind of authority to make decisions
involving the organization.

Basic board responsibilities

    To clarify the board's role, all those involved must understand the basic board responsi-
bilities. These are described below. This material is adapted from Murray (2009).

    To deal with the problem of achieving clarity regarding board roles and responsibili-
ties, we need an understanding of what it is that boards do. The most common areas of
responsibility in which boards may become involved are:

      1. Mission, values, goals, strategic priorities and performance assessment. Setting the
         overall purpose for the organization--why it should exist, who it should serve,
         what services it should provide, and what values and ethical guidelines it should
         follow in providing them. This area also includes the setting of objectives and the
         development of broad strategic plans for achieving them. To do this properly re-
         quires assessing how well the organization has performed in achieving the goals
         set for it as well as understanding the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

      2. Fiscal/legal oversight and risk assessment. Ensuring that the organization behaves in
         a fiscally and legally responsible manner. This includes such matters as overseeing
         operating and capital budgets, investments, property management and compliance
         with various laws applying to the organization. It also includes risk assessment--
         attempting to identify areas in which the organization is subjected to high risk to
         its assets or reputation.

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

      3. CEO selection and evaluation. Ensuring that the best person holds the position of
         CEO and performs it at a satisfactory level of competence.

      4. Community relations (also known as "Boundary Spanning"):

             · Representing the interests of the organization to its external publics;
             · Building alliances and partnerships with others that benefit the community;

                and
             · Ensuring that the interests of key external stakeholders are made known

                inside the organization.
      5. Resource development. Ensuring that the organization obtains adequate funds to

         enable it to achieve its objectives.

      6. Management systems. Ensuring that the organization is managed efficiently and
         effectively, e.g., that it has the right administrative structures and policies, informa-
         tion systems, human resources policies, etc.

      7. Board self-management. Activities aimed at ensuring the board itself is as effective
         as it can be, e.g., recruiting, selecting and training its members, evaluating the ef-
         fectiveness of its meetings and committees.

Roles of board members

    To list the areas in which boards should have some kind of involvement is important,
but it does not indicate how they should be involved. This is the question of the roles the
board can play in the organization. It is common in writing about boards to talk only about
the role of members as decision-makers. In addition, however, they may play two other
critical roles: advisor and implementer. Thus there are at least three roles for board members:

      1. Decision-maker/evaluator. The most important thing to understand about the deci-
         sion-making role of the board is the concept of delegation. Except in the smallest
         of NPOs, the board cannot make all the decisions needed to get things done. It
         must trust staff and volunteers to make many decisions that it will never hear about.
         When the organization employs a CEO, the authority to make many decisions
         is delegated to that position and the CEO may, in turn, delegate some of that
         authority to others. The only decision the board makes about all these delegated
         matters is whether they all add up to satisfactory performance for the organization
         as a whole. This is the evaluation function of boards and it cannot be delegated.
         When the board does make decisions, it usually occurs only at the level of the whole
         board meeting in a formal session in which it votes on motions put forward to it.

      2. Advisor. In this role, board members provide information and expert advice to their
         board and, less formally, to others such as the CEO or other management and staff.
         This role is usually played at the level of board committees, which may develop rec-
         ommendations for the whole board or CEO. Individual members typically derive
         the information and advice they provide from the following sources:
             · Knowledge gleaned through their training and experience; and
             · Contacts in their networks. This latter contribution--the result of board
                members interacting with the outside world--has only recently been recog-
                nized as a vital part of the board's overall potential contribution (Renz, 2006;
                2012)

                           The Board's Role and Responsibilities|8
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

      3. Implementer. In a few instances, board members may actually carry out the activities
         required by the decisions they (or others) make. For example, they usually carry out
         the work of selecting future board members and selecting the CEO. They may also
         approach prospective donors for funds; participate in advocacy and community
         outreach efforts; or represent the organization in dealings with critical stakeholder
         groups. Implementation activities are usually carried out at the level of task forces
         or committees charged with specific governance functions such as fundraising or
         board recruitment. Occasionally, individual board members may get involved in
         implementing decisions such as approaching prospective donors to ask for contri-
         butions or presenting briefs on behalf of the organization to government bodies.

Patterns of Board Responsibility and When They
are Appropriate

    Understanding the kind of matters boards might get involved in and the various roles
members can play is the first step to achieving clarity about what the board should do.
However, the temptation is then to assume that there is a single pattern of board respon-
sibilities and roles that is best for all NPOs. In spite of the assertions by some "how to do
it" writers on boards that there is a "one best way" for all types of boards and governance
situations, the limited research on what makes for an effective board suggests that there is
not. Let us look at several models or common patterns of board roles and responsibilities
and discuss when each may be appropriate.

The working board

    There are conditions when it is quite acceptable to have board members who simul-
taneously participate in setting strategic directions, manage the implementation of plans
and actually carry out "the work." The term for a board like this is the working board. A
successful working board can exist when the nonprofit organization is new, small, or made
up of all (or nearly all) volunteers and offers services that are not numerous or complex. For
example, many self-help groups, small grassroots advocacy organizations, housing and food
co-operatives, collectives, and sport organizations operate very successfully with working
boards (Gill, 2005).

    In working boards, board members are often the most committed and knowledge-
able members of the organization and have worked up to the board as volunteers or were
founders of the organization. It is not surprising, therefore, that some of them bring op-
erational concerns to board meetings. In fact, in this model of board, it may be impossible
to differentiate between "strategic" and "operational" leadership issues. For example, one
botched special event fundraiser or bad story about a mishandled client in the newspaper
could end the organization's existence. Almost anything and everything has the potential
to be a "strategic" leadership issue. Getting established requires that the people involved are
competent and have the energy to successfully wear many hats.

    All that is needed to create an effective working board is to make sure that everybody
is clear about who can make which decisions and who is going to do what. There should
also be basic agreement about what things are the most important (priorities). In general,
whole-board meetings of working boards should still focus on governance issues--planning
for the future, setting broad objectives, setting priorities and assessing performance. But
time at board meetings spent on apparent "details" is not necessarily wasted if the chair

                           The Board's Role and Responsibilities|9
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

or others can spot the larger strategic issues that can be buried in them. In these kinds of
small organizations the board can benefit by holding periodic special meetings of all active
participants (such as other key volunteers and any staff ) to discuss "how well are we doing
in fulfilling our mission?," and "where do we go from here?"

    The working board is not appropriate under conditions opposite to those that fit it best,
that is, organizations with paid staff and full-time managerial personnel who are operating
programs competently. Most public institutions such as universities, hospitals and mid to
large sized social service agencies are examples of the kinds of organizations that fit these
conditions. Such organizations cannot tolerate the confusion created by board members
trying to "micro manage" the organization's affairs when others are better prepared to do so.

The governance-only board

    A governance-only board is one that restricts itself to providing broad, strategic leader-
ship (Gill, 2005) to the organization by focusing primarily on issues that relate to the basic
strategic question of "who is to receive what services at what cost" (Carver, 2006). This
means that decision-making/evaluating becomes the key role being played by the board.

    The dilemma facing the large, complex institutions for whom governance-only boards
are the most appropriate, and one of the reasons they can so easily become rubber-stamp
boards, is that most board members are busy civic leaders who, though great supporters of
the organization, have very little time to become thoroughly knowledgeable about it or the
sector in which it operates (such as healthcare, education, or the arts). This makes informed
debate about major strategic issues very difficult. For example, it takes a lot of expertise
to know whether an organization should merge with another (or cease to exist), whether
a university should open (or close) a department or whether a hospital should convert a
certain percentage of its beds from active to chronic care.

    The secret of creating an effective governance-only board lies in developing a shared
understanding of basic levels of policy, deciding which of them are basic "strategic" or
"landmark" governance issues and devising information systems that supply valid data on
past performance and future needs in ways that clearly relate to them (see Chait et al, 2005
for a discussion of "landmark" governance issues).

The mixed model board

    Many boards in practice are neither purely working boards nor governance-only boards.
They tend to be located between the two ends of the board involvement continuum. Some-
times they may become very involved in making decisions about day-to-day operations
while at other times they keep their involvement limited to matters of policy and strategy.
In these organizations, paid managers may make most of the operating decisions but may
not have the time or expertise to handle certain functions with which they are not familiar,
for example, publicity, fundraising or government relations. In such situations it might be
expedient to turn to board members for expertise and implementation assistance.

    Other times that a governance-only board might revert to a mixed model state is during
a major crisis such as the loss of large grants, financial mismanagement, serious labor unrest
or the actions of militant client groups. Insofar as the paid manager has trouble handling
these situations, the temptation on the part of the board to get involved in the direct man-
agement of them can be strong; indeed managers may ask for it and it may be necessary.
Once the crisis is over, however, it is easy to allow things to continue in an inappropriate
mixed model state rather than reverting to the prior governance-only model.

                          The Board's Role and Responsibilities|10
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

    It is possible to sustain a mixed model form of governance that can work well. In this
situation, certain board members or committees take responsibility for managing specific
operational leadership functions. These would typically be seen as working committees and
their chairs become de facto operating managers. At the level of the whole board, effort
must still be made to focus primarily on strategic issues. Insofar as possible, the operational
committees and board members with specific operational responsibilities should work
under the authority of the Executive Director.

    The mixed model is a difficult one to implement successfully because there are so many
occasions where confusion can arise, especially as the organization's environment continues
to change. The secret of success lies in exceptionally full and open communication in which
all parties feel free to raise questions over gaps or overlaps in authority and responsibility.
There must also be high levels of tolerance for ambiguity. For example, even though the
primary purpose of meetings of the whole board should be for discussing major issues of
policy and strategy, some board members will want to talk about matters pertaining to their
responsibilities as operational managers. They may thus seem to be cluttering the meetings
with "managerial" details and undermining the authority of the CEO. The key to success
lies in training everybody--management and board alike--to recognize what is "strategic"
and redirect the non-strategic matters to the CEO.

Summary

    In summary, there is no "one best way" of structuring the roles and responsibilities of a
board of directors that fits all situations. The board cannot avoid its legal requirement of ex-
ercising due diligence in ensuring that the organization achieves its mission, has a strategic
plan and does not get into financial or legal difficulties. However, the way it gets involved in
the other responsibility areas discussed above, can be highly variable. The important thing
to understand is that the board is part of the whole organizational system that includes paid
mangers, staff, volunteers, and external stakeholders. All have roles to play in the process
of deciding what to do and then implementing those decisions. Everyone must be clear
about who will do the deciding, who will have input into those decisions, who will do the
implementing and what information will be obtained to assess how well the decisions have
worked out.

nance effectiveness in the area of the board's legal authority and fiduciary responsibilities.

        The Board's Role in
               Planning

Symptoms

It is commonly accepted "best practice" that a major role for boards ought to be thinking
about the "big picture" of how the organization is doing and where it ought to be heading
in the future. It is usually recommended that this big picture thinking be captured in a
"Strategic Plan" which can be used as a guide by all in the organization in making specific
policy decisions. A high percentage of agreement with the following statements would
indicate that the board might be having problems with its role in the planning function:
 The board has not spent enough time establishing a clear mission and vision for

    the organization.
 The board never seems to have time to explore external challenges and opportu-

    nities that the organization might face.
 The board does not do a very good job of learning about the concerns of external

    stakeholders who can influence the organization.
 The board does not do a very good job of learning about the concerns of the

    communities that the organization serves.
 The board rarely holds "creative thinking" sessions aimed at trying to find new

    ways the organization could develop.
 The board does little to learn about innovations tried by others that might help

    the organization.
 The board is not provided with a clear enough picture of the organization's internal

    strengths and limitations in dealing with its external environment.
 The board has not developed a clear, well-researched, strategic plan that sets out

    broad goals and establishes priorities for the organization.

                               The Board's Role in Planning|13
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

 Plans exist on paper but they don't get implemented at the operational level, i.e.
    other concerns drive what actually gets done.

Diagnosis

    The main reasons that boards have difficulties with fulfilling their planning function
effectively are:

       · The organization faces an external environment that is too turbulent or complex
         to understand hence the board feels it is not possible to make plans for the future.
         (Note, however, that it may be possible to develop useful scenarios based on several
         different hypothesized futures.)

       · Lack of clarity about who should play what role in the planning process. Boards are
         often accused of "rubber-stamping" when they think their job is simply to approve
         the plans brought to them by management (Chait et al., 2005).

       · Lack of understanding of the planning process. This can occur because the board
         does not contain enough members who have experience in strategic planning, or
         who have not been provided with the opportunity to learn about it.

       · Lack of time. This is usually due to meeting agendas that are too full of "routine"
         matters or short-term "firefighting" issues that do not allow the board to step back
         and look at the big picture.

       · Structural problems. The board has not created a committee whose function it is
         to engage in the in-depth information gathering and analysis that is necessary for
         effective strategic planning.

Treatment

    To treat planning problems, consider the following points:
       · Decide on the role in the planning process that is best for the board given the
         organization's unique characteristics (its age, size, presence of experienced senior
         managers, number of members with strategic planning experience, etc.). Choose
         between one of these three basic roles:
             · Doing it all themselves, i.e. the board obtains all needed information and
                decides on recommended directions;
             · Using a board committee with responsibilities for planning to work along
                with members of the management team in obtaining the needed information
                and creating the recommended directions;
             · Having the needed information and recommendations developed by the
                management team (with or without the help of consultants) and presented in
                draft form for the board to discuss and decide upon.
       · Ensure that there is sufficient time, money, and expertise for those responsible for
         preparing the initial draft of the strategic plan to carry out that work.
       · Provide education in strategic planning to all board members who lack sufficient
         experience (see below for a brief outline of what is involved in strategic planning).

    Always involve the organization's CEO and other members of the management team
in providing needed information on the state of the organization's external environment

                               The Board's Role in Planning|14
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

and internal capacity. But, also attempt to find reliable information from independent
sources on these same matters. For example, many sub-sectors within the nonprofit world
have evolved associations and professional bodies that monitor and report on opportunities
and potential threats in the environment. There are also usually a number of experienced
consultants in each industry of whom boards should be aware.

    The next section provides an overview of strategic leadership questions within the basic
elements of a strategic plan, from Murray (2014).

Overview of Key Questions Addressed in a
Strategic Plan

1. Mission

    What is the purpose of the organization? Why does it exist? Who does it serve?

2. Values

    What values should the organization uphold in the process of doing its work? For
example:

       · What is the underlying philosophy behind its approach to the way it seeks to
         achieve its mission?

       · What beliefs and attitudes should be shared regarding the way the organization
         wants to work with the public, its clients, volunteers, staff and other stakeholders?

3. Vision

    Many strategic plans contain a statement describing a vision for the organization's
future. A vision statement answers such questions as:

       · What should the organization look like in 5 years?
       · What will it be known for?
       · What will it be doing that is different from what it does now?
       · What will be its reputation among other organizations in the same field?
    (Note: Many find it is better if this section is tackled after steps 4 and 5 below.)

4. The environmental context of the organization's operations

    This is a very important section that outlines the challenges and opportunities that
shape the reality within which the board must work. It addresses such questions as:

       · What changes are likely to occur in the next 2-3 years in the following aspects
         of the external world and what implications will they have on the organization's
         operations:
             · The economy
             · The political environment
             · Societal values and beliefs
             · Technology
             · Demographics

       · Who are the critical stakeholders who influence the ability of the organization to
         succeed? Examples of stakeholders include those the organization seeks to serve,

                               The Board's Role in Planning|15
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

         funders (and potential funders) of all types, regulators, potential allies and col-
         laborators, key "competitors" for funds, or clients/audience.

             For each of the key stakeholders answer these questions:
             · What do they want from the organization, and how are these wants likely

                to change in the next 2-3 years? How much influence do they have over the
                organization's ability to carry out its mission?
             · To what extent do their expectations of the organization conflict with one
                another?
             · What are the organizations that are similar in size, mission, types of programs,
                etc. and what are they doing that the organization might learn from?

5. The internal capacity of the organization

    What are the present internal strengths and weaknesses of the organization in terms
of resources, people, administrative systems and leadership capabilities? In other words,
what is the organization's capacity for influencing, or successfully adapting to, the external
environment that it will likely be facing in the next few years?

6. Strategic goals and priorities

    There is usually no way that any organization is able to find the time, money and
people to do everything that it would like to do in an ideal world. So what should be the
key strategic goals for the organization over the next two years in these major components
of your operations?

    (a) Programs
       · Should there be any changes in the kind of people the organization serves?
       · What changes are needed in the quantity and quality of the programs or services
         provided to those people?
       · How many and what kind of additional programs (beyond those currently in place)
         are needed to support the mission?

    (b) Resources
       · What is the potential for increasing financial support from all sources to support
         programs priorities?
       · What should be the organization's resource development goals and which of them
         are most feasible to implement?

    (c) Capacity building
       · What changes are needed in leadership development, staffing, volunteering, in-
         formation technology and other management systems to support program and
         resource development priorities? Which of these changes are needed most?

7. Prioritization

    Among the goals identified, which have the highest priority in terms of importance
and urgency?

                               The Board's Role in Planning|16
           Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

           8. Implementation

               Strategic plans are often ineffective because the goals and priorities they identify do
           not get translated into implementable operational plans for which individuals take respon-
           sibility. Are there connections between the strategic priorities and more detailed business
           plans and budgets? Are these connections obvious and strong?

           9. Accountability

               As well, ineffectiveness can result when results are not tracked or when there are no
           widely accepted systems in place for doing this. This can result in an outdated or obsolete
           plan. To avoid this, the organization's plan must contain agreed upon procedures for the
           assessment of progress and the plan must be reviewed and updated annually in the light of
           this assessment.

               For additional guidelines on strategic planning and the board's role and capacity to
           engage in it, see the resources in Table 2.

        The Board's Role in
    Performance Assessment

Symptoms

Boards of nonprofit organizations are required to exert due diligence in ensuring that the
organizations they govern are achieving their missions effectively and efficiently. Quite
aside from legal requirements, most boards feel an obligation to hold those who run the
organization accountable for achieving results in carrying out the responsibilities delegated
to them. They also wish to be able to identify and recognize what is being done well in the
organization. In turn, boards are morally and legally accountable to those for whom they act
as trustees. To fulfill all these accountability responsibilities requires that the board receive
reliable and valid information on how things are going. The areas in which due diligence
assessments need to be carried out are:

       · The performance of the organization as a whole. This includes:
             · Attainment of strategic plan objectives.
             · Assurance of the organization's financial and legal soundness.
             · Assurance that the organization is aware of serious potential risks it may face
                and is mitigating them as well as possible.
             · Assurance that all members of the organization (including board members
                themselves) are behaving ethically and in accord with the espoused values of
                the organization, e.g. avoiding conflicts of interest, mistreatment of clients or
                staff, etc.

       · The performance of the organization's CEO (paid or unpaid top management
         person).
             · Assurance that the CEO is meeting the performance expectations of the
                position.

       · The performance of the board itself.
             · Assurance that the board is governing effectively and is meeting its own ac-
                countability objectives.

    Indications that the board is experiencing challenges in this area of their responsibili-
ties arise when a significant numbers of board members or others related to the board, such
as the CEO, management team and other key stakeholders report high levels of agreement
with the following statements:

                      The Board's Role in Performance Assessment|19
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

 The board does not do a satisfactory job of assessing how well the organization
    is achieving its mission.

 The board does not get enough of the right kind of information to give it a clear
    picture of how well the organization is doing.

 The board does not ensure that an analysis is done of serious risks that the
    organization might face.

 The board does not do a very good job of ensuring that the organization's fi-
    nances are being managed soundly.

 The board does not regularly and systematically carry out assessments of the
    CEO's performance (e.g. Executive Director, President, etc.).

Diagnosis

    The main reasons for difficulties that boards may have in carrying out their duties in the
critical area of performance assessment are as follows:

       · There is lack of clarity about the amount and kind of assessments the board should
         undertake. Either the management and board have differing ideas about this, or
         the board itself is unsure what its role in performance assessment is.

       · The board may wish to assess performance but it does not get sufficient informa-
         tion to enable it to carry it out. This could be because there are inadequate systems
         for gathering and reporting it (including metrics and frameworks to organize it)
         or because it is intentionally or unintentionally withheld from the board by the
         management team.

       · The board does not create suitable internal structures and processes for carrying
         out its assessment duties, i.e. there are no board officers or committees with re-
         sponsibility for gathering the needed performance data, analyzing it and bringing
         assessment results to the full board for proper consideration.

       · The board is not adequately trained in performance management, or does not have
         enough members with knowledge of how to analyze and interpret performance
         data.

       · The board has evolved an informal culture in which it believes that it does not have
         to take one or more of its performance assessment responsibilities seriously. For
         example, it may feel uncomfortable monitoring and evaluating the performance
         of the CEO or raising questions about the validity or amount of information it is
         given about the organization's finances or reputation in the community.

Treatment

    Some of the general approaches to improving the board's ability to carry out its perfor-
mance assessment responsibilities are as follows.

       · The most important requirement is to develop a supportive culture for evalua-
         tion not only within the board but also in the whole organization. There must

                      The Board's Role in Performance Assessment|20
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

         be an atmosphere of collaboration, trust and respect between the board, the top
         management team and, indeed, all those who control information on how well the
         organization is doing. If there is a feeling that information is going to be used by
         the board to `blame' or punish somebody for doing a bad job, the process of assess-
         ment will turn into one of political game playing between the evaluators and those
         under evaluation. This is why boards must be willing and able to communicate
         positive evaluation results as much, or even more, than those that suggest problems.
       · The next question, of course, is: How do you change a board's culture when most
         people are not even aware such a thing exists? This is where the leadership of the
         board chair and the organization's CEO becomes important. Boards are more
         likely to face the need to change aspects of their culture when those they respect
         lead them in examining their heretofore taken-for-granted assumptions about how
         they do things like performance assessment.
       · It is also vital that board members receive training and development in performance
         management, including how to obtain and interpret the information provided in
         each of the key areas of assessment: strategic plan objectives, financial soundness,
         risk mitigation, CEO performance and the board's own performance.
       · Finally, it is necessary to create structures within the board that facilitate carrying
         out its performance assessment responsibilities. This usually means creating com-
         mittees or officer positions in which the duties include gathering, analyzing and
         making recommendations about performance in each of the areas identified above.
         Leaving such matters to the board as a whole, or delegating them to the CEO and
         management team, will usually result in less than effective oversight.
    What follows is a discussion of resources that will help boards in each of the specific
areas of performance assessment identified above.

Assessing the Performance of the Organization as a
Whole

    As mentioned above, the major problems with evaluation of organizational perfor-
mance lie in the areas of choosing suitable effectiveness criteria, developing a framework to
organize criteria, and choosing the best methods of measurement and analysis.

       · For information on what constitutes nonprofit organizational effectiveness see
         Herman and Renz (2008). Herman and Renz advance "Nine theses" to explain
         nonprofit organizational effectiveness. For a discussion of the subjectivity inherent
         in assessing effectiveness and how to deal with it, see Murray (2010).

       · For a conceptual framework for understanding organizational effectiveness criteria,
         see The Competing Values Framework (CVF) Quinn and Rohrbaugh (1981; 1983).
         The CVF depicts means and ends effectiveness criteria in two dimensions (struc-
         ture and focus) drawn from the four schools of organizational thought (rational
         goal, internal process, human relations, and open systems). It has been useful as a
         diagnostic and leadership development tool at the individual and group levels (see
         Quinn, Faerman, Thompson, McGrath, & St. Clair (2010).

       · For yet another framework to help boards conceptualize, organize, and measure
         performance, see Robert Kaplan and David Norton's (1996) Balanced Score Card.
         The BSC organizes measurements along different organizational perspectives (e.g.
         financial, internal operations, client/customer and learning and innovation). In a
         2013 study titled Board Member Self-Perception of Organizational Governance and

                      The Board's Role in Performance Assessment|21
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

         the Role of the Balanced Score Card, Aulgur found support for use of the BSC to
         help boards become clear about their role as well as overcome problems from social
         construction of organizational performance (i.e. what matters most). Others have
         found that it does not work as well in some types of nonprofit organizations (e.g.
         social service).

The Board's Role in Financial Management

    As stewards of nonprofit organizations, one of the board's responsibilities is to ensure
there are enough financial resources to advance the mission and work of the organization
and that these resources are being spent wisely. Effective oversight in this area involves
tracking the following aspects of financial management:

       · Audits of past financial expenditures;
       · Oversight of the adequacy of incoming financial resources and reserves (e.g. en-

         suring there is enough money to cover planned and unexpected expenditures); and
       · Monitoring the annual budget.
    Most boards are highly conscious of their responsibility for ensuring that their orga-
nization is managed in a financially responsible manner. But this is easier said than done,
especially when many board members have little or no expertise in understanding financial
statements, auditor's reports, budget documents and the concepts behind financial strate-
gies. Nevertheless, it is possible for boards to improve their competency in this vital area by:
       · Conducting regular reviews of board competency in understanding the financial

         condition of the organization and providing training in overcoming areas in need
         of improvement.
       · Insisting that CEOs provide all relevant financial information needed to adequately
         understand the organization's finances.
       · Obtaining independently generated reports on the organizations financial man-
         agement, e.g. from auditors, industry associations, consultants, etc.
    For research on the relationship between board effectiveness and nonprofit financial
health see Hodge and Piccolo (2011). For guidance on financial management, Miller
(2008) answers important financial questions, including the relationship between revenue
sources and profitability. This article provides helpful information for boards considering
financial decisions such as diversification of revenue streams as well as whether to fund new
programs or not.

Risk Management

    The concept of risk management in nonprofit organizations refers to becoming aware
of actions or events which have the potential to harm the organization's reputation in the
community, its financial stability, or cause it to incur legal liabilities. Examples include risks
to client or employee health and safety, high-risk investments, actions that could be con-
strued as negative by the public, etc. The aim of risk management is to balance the possible
benefits derived from taking risks against their possible negative effects.

       · Good advice and a sample conflict of interest policy can be found in Gill (2005).
       · Jackson (2006) contains specific guidance along with useful tools and resources.

Assessing the Performance of the CEO

    One of the most important decisions a board makes concerns the selection of the CEO.
Much time and energy goes into preparing the job description, recruiting and selecting the
right candidate, and orienting them to the top job. Equally important, however, is the need
to assess how well CEOs are working out once they are in office. For more specific guidance
on the topic of performance assessment, check out the websites in Table 3.

        The Board's Role in
             Fundraising

Symptoms

Effectively performing the board's role in fundraising is one of the most common chal-
lenges reported by both board members and those with whom they have relationships.
Dissatisfaction in this area comes in three forms:

    1. A lack of clarity about the board's role in fundraising relative to that of paid staff
        and/or professional fundraisers.

    2. A feeling of dissatisfaction with the board's activities related to fundraising.
    3. Individual board member reluctance or lack of knowledge about how to engage in

        fundraising.
    High levels of agreement with the following statements indicate challenges in this area:
 The board seems confused about its role in fundraising for the organization.
 The board has not approved an overall strategy for fundraising.
 The board has problems engaging in actual fundraising activities.

Diagnosis

    The main reasons for dissatisfaction with the board's role in fundraising are:
       · Criteria used (formally or informally) in selecting board members do not include
         checking for a prospective recruit's willingness to help with fundraising or experi-
         ence with this activity.
       · Potential board nominees are not informed beforehand regarding expectations of
         board members in the fundraising area.
       · Differing expectations exist between the board's understanding of what its role in
         fundraising should be and those held by the CEO and/or professional fundraising
         staff.
       · Orientation and training of new board members does not include coverage of the
         board's role in fundraising.

                             The Board's Role in Fundraising|27
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

· There is a lack of a clear overall fundraising strategy for the organization and/
  or a clear structure indicating who is responsible for what in implementing the
  fundraising plan.

· There is lack of awareness of the range of roles and responsibilities that board
  members may play in fundraising.

· There is a lack of leadership within the board that helps members accept a more
  active role in fundraising activities.

Treatment

    The first step in optimizing the board's contribution to the generation of financial
resources for the organization is to understand the full range of roles and responsibili-
ties it could undertake. Table 4 illustrates the potential board roles and responsibilities in
fundraising.

                                          Table 4

                                                                                 Member

It can be seen from Table 4 that there that there are three possible roles for board

member involvement:

1. As part of the board acting as a whole in the same way it does during official board

meetings.

2. As part of a special fundraising committee containing board members. Note: It is
   important to understand that fundraising committees do not have to be committees of the
   board and, if they are, they can contain some members who are not board members. Such
   committees should normally only help develop plans and policies to recommend to others
   for approval or assist in actually implementing fundraising activities.

3. As an individual acting alone, for example as one does when making a donation to
   the organization or visiting a potential donor.

    Down the left hand side of Table 4, it can also be seen that there are four possible levels
of responsibility that can be taken up by the board:

      1. Responsibility for reviewing and approving fundraising strategies, plans and poli-
         cies developed by others such as fundraising professionals, a fundraising committee,
         etc. This is usually done at official meetings of the board as a whole.

                           The Board's Role in Fundraising|28
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

      2. Becoming involved in the creation of fundraising strategies, plans and policies,
         often within a fundraising committee.

      3. Once plans are in place, there is the hard work of actually raising the money--
         holding special events, soliciting corporate sponsorships, applying for grants,
         running mail campaigns, asking potential big donors for support or just giving
         fundraisers contacts to approach. Insofar as these tasks involve the board (as they
         might in the case of a working board for example), they would usually be carried
         out through a fundraising committee or by individual board members volunteering
         their time.

      4. Finally, there is the job of developing systems for obtaining valid data on how
         effective fundraising activities are, tracking the results--receiving and reviewing
         reports and suggesting changes if needed. This responsibility is often the job of a
         board fundraising committee but could, in some circumstances, be carried out by
         the board as a whole.

    It is important to understand that there is no "one best way" when it comes to the
board's involvement in fundraising. The content in each of the boxes in Table 4 represents
common practice and should not be taken as the way it ought to be in all cases. Each orga-
nization must decide for itself which responsibilities should be carried out by whom and
at what level--that of the board as a whole, a committee or the individual board member.
Where the board belongs on the fundraising involvement continuum depends greatly on
a few factors:

       · The ability of the organization to employ professional fundraisers. Such people are
         experts in developing plans and leading teams who will implement them. Small,
         new and low budget nonprofits can rarely afford this kind of support so the work
         has to be undertaken by volunteers and staff usually working in a committee struc-
         ture. Board members can sit on committees and contribute as individuals.

       · The level of commitment and experience/knowledge about fundraising among
         board members.

       · The availability and expertise of other volunteers, external supporters and potential
         partners who could provide assistance in this area.

    Once it is decided who should play what roles in doing what, the next job is making
sure everyone is capable of performing those roles. In the case of fundraising, this can
involve making the following changes:

       · Developing criteria for the kind of person you want to recruit to your board so as to
         increase fundraising competency. If members will be expected to play a role other
         than general oversight, they should be ready and willing to do so. Note: It is not
         necessary for all board members to be fundraising whizzes but, if you want involvement,
         some should be.

       · Provide training and development. Much of fundraising consists of learnable skills.
         Orientation and training for board members should address them.

       · If the analysis of possible roles carried out in Table 4 reveals that a committee
         should be involved, be careful and thorough in defining its terms of reference so
         it does not tread on the toes of fundraising staff or take over the job of the board
         as a whole which is responsible for policy decisions made in this area of board
         responsibility.

   The Board's Structure and
      Operating Procedures

Symptoms

One of the major, yet often unrecognized, influences on how well a nonprofit organization
board carries out its duties and responsibilities is the way it is organized. All boards have
at least a minimum amount of formal organization and a set of policies that constrain, and
support the way they operate. For example, most nonprofits have a constitution and/or a set
of by-laws among which are rules regarding the role of the board, its size and composition,
when and how annual meetings will be held, who has voting rights, etc. In addition, most
boards create their own operating manuals (or have a collection of documents) that cover
such matters as how many and what kind of board committees and board officer positions
will exist and so on.

    Once these kinds of structures and procedures are in place they often come to be taken
for granted and their influence on the way the board governs goes unrecognized.This means
they are not carefully examined when boards seek to improve their own performance and
orient new members.

    A high percentage of agreement with the following statements indicates a board that
might have formal structures and operating procedures that are inhibiting its effectiveness:
 The by-laws that provide the rules within which the board operates are in need of

    a thorough review.
 We don't have a board policy manual or we have one that is badly in need of

    revision.
 The board seems too large and cumbersome to enable it to act as an effective

    decision-making body.
 Job descriptions for the positions of board members and board officers (e.g.,

    Chair, Vice-Chair, Treasurer, Secretary, etc.) are nonexistent or not well understood.
 Administrative support for the board (secretarial assistance, record keeping, as-

    sistance in arranging meetings, etc.) is inadequate.

                    The Board's Structure and Operating Procedures|32
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

 The board lacks access to potentially useful information and communications
    technology (e.g. computers, software, internet, the web and social media).

 Most board members don't make much use of the information and communica-
    tions technology made available to them.

 Some board committees are not very useful.

 Some board committees are unclear about their responsibilities and/or authority.

 Some board officers and chairs of committees lack the training or experience
    needed to meet the demands of their position.

 Some committees have members who contribute very little or don't have enough
    experience to be of much help.
    In essence, these items can be clustered in two categories: Procedures and Structures.
      1. Issues related to matters of procedure:
             · The organization's constitution and by-laws within which the board must
                operate;
             · Board manuals that contain basic information on the board's responsibilities
                and operating procedures;
             · Position descriptions for board members and officers of the board; and
             · The nature and extent of administrative and technical support provided to
                assist the board in carrying out its work efficiently.
      2. Issues related to the formal structure of the board:
             · Board size;
             · Officer positions;
             · Committees--number, function, authority.

Diagnosis

    Why do boards experience problems with inadequate structures and procedures? There
are three basic explanations for these problems:

       · The most common is simply that boards fail to pay attention to the existing tools
         that have already been created to help them govern. When boards first come into
         existence they usually begin in a friendly, informal way. Creating a lot of rules and
         procedures seems unnecessary as everyone wants to focus on doing whatever they
         can to help the organization succeed. As the organization grows and the man-
         agement of the organization professionalizes (i.e. it becomes necessary to create
         separate positions and introduce paid executives), the board often fails to realize
         that it, too, needs to become more professional. Instead, the original culture of
         informality tends to dominate governance practices without anyone realizing it
         even though it is no longer suitable for dealing with the growing complexity of the
         organization and its environment.The kinds of boards that are most likely to "drift"
         without being conscious of the need to update structures and procedures are those
         which do not make time for assessing their own performance and which do not
         provide training and development for their members on their roles as governors.

       · A lack of focus on developing optimum structures and procedures can also occur
         when the leadership provided by the board chair and/or the CEO is not conscious
         of the negative impact that arises when people are unclear about what to do or get
         into conflicts because by-laws are confusing or absent all together. In a few cases
         it is possible that those in leadership positions might actively seek to dominate
         the board by unofficially blocking attempts to increase clarity and transparency in
         board procedures.

       · A similar situation can arise when boards become dominated by an informal "core
         group" of insiders (for example a dominating Executive Committee or group of
         "old hands" who hold informal "backstage" meetings to predetermine board votes
         on contentious issues.

Treatment

Procedural Issues

Constitution and by-laws

    Most nonprofit organizations that become incorporated must submit to the govern-
ment body that approves incorporation a copy of their constitution and by-laws. Various
publications or websites exist which provide things like sample by-laws. Note that specific
requirements for the content of by-laws can vary by governmental jurisdictions--national, state
or provincial.

    An example of the kinds of questions that each board needs to answer for itself, based
on its analysis of its own unique environment and history, is that regarding terms of office
for board members and officers of the board. Generally, it is desirable to infuse boards with
"new blood" at regular intervals. This can be assured by having a by-law specifying how long
a board member's term of office will be and how many times it can be renewed before the
incumbent must leave the board. A clause specifying term lengths of two or three years,
renewable two or three times is common. In the absence of such a statement, it is often
assumed board members can serve indefinitely, which can be problematic.

    There are instances, however, when specifying term limits could be unwise; for example,
when it is clear that there is a relatively small pool of qualified candidates to draw from.
The same problem holds true for officer positions, e.g. Chair, Treasurer, etc. Is it good for
the board to have the same leadership team year after year? Generally, no, but sometimes
it is difficult to replace certain people, such as treasurers. In cases like this, by-laws can be
written with qualifying words like "normally the term of office for board officers will be
three years." This allows a board to make exceptions to the rule if necessary.

    Other examples of by-law variations for which there is no "one best rule" and which
therefore need to be thought out in the light of the organization's unique history and en-
vironment are:

       · Definitions of who can and cannot be a member of the organization and vote at
         general membership meetings;

       · How to remove members from the board and organization;
       · The authority of members--what they must approve;
       · Quorums for board meetings and annual meetings;

                    The Board's Structure and Operating Procedures|34
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

       · Matters which can be decided by members attending the annual meeting versus
         those that must be put to a vote of the whole membership via mail ballots, etc.;

       · The nature and extent of board decisions that can be made via telephone confer-
         ence calls, email voting, etc.; and how to amend by-laws

    Whatever the board decides with respect to by-laws, it is helpful to have an attorney
familiar with nonprofit law in the local jurisdiction advise the board on them. For example,
new regulations have emerged in some jurisdictions that require board procedures to be in
compliance with the law in such matters as electronic voting, auditing of financial state-
ments, records of minutes, retention of documents and conflict of interest policies. Many
legal cases concerning governance decisions have been decided on the basis of the board
not following them. See the following link for a nonprofit case concerning by-laws: http://
www.501c3.org/blog/why-nonprofit-bylaws-matter-a-tragic-tale/

Board manual

    While general guidelines on what to put in by-laws are useful, due to the number and
diversity of nonprofits that exist, there are still many decisions that need to be made for
which there are no universally agreed to rules of thumb. These kinds of issues should be
identified and addressed in a Board Manual. This important document is invaluable for
new board members to orient them to the governance role and how the board works but
it is also crucial in resolving occasional disputes over how the board should handle various
matters.

Position descriptions for board members and officer/committee
chair positions

    For many small nonprofit organizations, the idea of having written "job descriptions"
for board members and officer positions such as the Chair or President, Treasurer, Vice-
Chair, and Chairs of various committees may seem unnecessarily bureaucratic and formal.
And indeed this might be the case especially if there is little likelihood that people might
get into conflict over who has what authority After all, the desired culture most people
want in a board is one of collegiality where anybody is willing to lend a hand with anything
that needs doing without getting fussy over whose territory it is.

    On the other hand, if no effort is made to clarify who is responsible for getting things
done, even the most well-meaning team can get into trouble with things "falling between
the cracks" or being duplicated. For this reason, for most nonprofits, the time required to
develop, and periodically review, position descriptions is worth the effort. Position descrip-
tion documents, which could be incorporated into the Board Manual, should cover:

       · The responsibilities of the position--the work it does;
       · The authority that goes with the position--what matters the holder of the position

         is able to decide and what matters need to be decided by the board as a whole or
         other office holders; and
       · The qualifications and competencies required for carrying out the responsibilities
         of the position.

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

Administrative support

    One of the major conditions that can lead boards to feeling ineffective is inefficient
internal administrative support--minutes are not taken or not done well, records of past
decisions on who is going to do what and when are not kept, meetings are poorly organized
or there is not enough support to prepare for them, etc. If budgets permit, investment in
professional staff to support the board is well worth it. If there is no money for paid staff,
the next best approach is to clearly define the role of the volunteer board secretary as the
de facto administrator then seek a volunteer who is well organized and at least somewhat
detail oriented and provide them with adequate training and the equipment and supplies
needed to do the job well. Time taken to develop simple, well-organized record systems is
also well spent.

    Another important aspect of the internal administration of the board that is often ne-
glected is the extent to which it makes full use of the potential of modern information and
communications technology, i.e. Internet, intranet, online calendars, video-conferencing,
voice over Internet-Protocol (e.g. Skype), email, social media, etc.

    Boards should consider three questions when making technological decisions:
       · For what purposes are modern information and communications technology
         (ICT) tools needed?
       · Do we have the capacity to implement and support the use of them in our board
         and organization (e.g. can volunteers use them, be trained to use them, or do we
         need to hire people)?
       · Which tools are most likely to return the greatest value for the investment of time
         and effort?

    In work on ICT use by boards, Harrison (2014) concludes that the key to getting the
most value out of a technology is to think of it as a means to an end in terms of meeting
strategic performance objectives. Once performance objectives have been established (a
committee of the board or task force could develop them) and agreed upon (at the whole
board level), strategies should be implemented to achieve them. With respect to future
strategies, nonprofits should consider enterprise-wide solutions to align strategic and op-
erational work. Boards need to assess the scalability and flexibility of proposed technology
in order to facilitate governance and other functions. In the governance context this means
the capacity of ICT tools to meet, store documents, share information, communicate, con-
duct performance assessments, facilitate opinion surveys, engage constituents, etc.

Board Structures

    There are three important aspects of the basic formal structure of the board that, if they
are improperly designed for the board's situation, can cause major problems: (a) the size of
the board; the number and nature of formal "officer positions" within the board; and (c) its
committee structure.

(a) Board size

    The "how-to" books on boards are fairly consistent in warning against boards that
exceed 15 or so people. This recommendation arises because the greater the number of
people involved in the complex business of setting strategic direction (the board's number
one responsibility), the more difficult it will be to give them meaningful roles and arrive at a
consensus on contentious issues. Conversely, the smaller the number involved, the more dif-

                    The Board's Structure and Operating Procedures|36
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

ficult it will be to get valid representation of the views of the community the organization is
serving or, in the case of working boards, enough people to carry out the work of the board.
It may also be too easy for "group think" to take hold (a feeling that one should not criticize
if the majority share the same point of view) thus keeping out radical ideas for change.

    Nevertheless, large boards (e.g. 20 to 30 or even more) do exist. They often occur in
part because it is believed that this is the way to gain the support of a lot of influential
community leaders who will be useful in raising money and for other purposes. They are
also common in national NPOs that feel the need to have representation on the board
from many geographical regions. However, it should be realized that it is possible to get the
support of prestigious people or input from all regions without resorting to the creation of
unwieldy sized boards. One of the more common alternatives is to create advisory boards
or funding campaign "cabinets" or "committees."

    Even large boards can be effective, however, as long as everyone recognizes and accepts
that a smaller subset of board members will probably evolve to play a leadership role. Meet-
ings of the whole board will tend to be dominated by a "core group" and others will usually
have to be satisfied with less input on issues though ample opportunity for input should
always be provided. The contributions from non-core-group members will come mostly
at the individual and committee levels. At these levels they can provide useful advice or
contacts on request though, as noted, the same thing could be provided in other ways.

    Equally problematic is the very small board (five or fewer) where there is a real risk that
the board will not become aware of changing conditions that threaten the organization.
They are also not very effective when the board needs to be a working board. Members tend
to become overloaded with work and "burn out" can occur rapidly. However, many small
boards are not necessarily a problem until a crisis hits. To cope in such situations requires
the small board to ensure that it has independent sources of information and expert outside
advice on how the organization is doing.

(b) Formal offices

    The generally accepted recommendation is to keep formal offices few in number on
the grounds that many of them have no real function other than ceremonial. At minimum,
however, there must be a board leader (chair, president), and someone (usually a vice-chair)
to step in if the leader cannot perform her or his duties as well as learn the ropes to take
over when the current leader's term is up. A skilled treasurer is also a very important office
with the role of taking the lead in carrying out the fiscal oversight responsibility of the
board. As discussed above, the office of board secretary is important because of its record
keeping and document retention function. Wherever possible, however, it is usually prefer-
able to have professional staff employed to support board leadership and administrative
functions. The main point is that these functions must be performed; the actual titles used
are not so important. For example, in some small, simple organizations all functions might
reside in the offices of chair and vice-chair.

    Other formal leadership positions are usually the chairs of the board committees
discussed below. The important requirement of all formal offices is that there be clear de-
scriptions of the duties of the office and that provision be made for training those who
fill these positions. Too often office holders take up their jobs without a clue as to what is
required. With luck, they can learn by on the job trial and error before a major issue arises,
otherwise they can get themselves and their organization into serious trouble.

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

(c) Board committees

    At one extreme in the "how-to" literature on boards are those writers who state that the
number of committees of the board should be kept to an absolute minimum. It is argued
that some committees do more harm than good because they either try to dabble in opera-
tions, thereby subverting the authority of managers, or make decisions on policy issues that
are the responsibility of the whole board or the CEO. The board and committees therefore
end up duplicating each other's work and wasting everyone's time. These are real problems,
but eliminating committees is not the only approach to solving them. In fact, in smaller
organizations with small budgets unable to hire paid staff to manage all its programs and
functions, committees may be vital to the operation of the organization.

    There are two basic types of committees:
         Policy committees

    These are small problem-solving groups, which can study important issues in depth
and produce reports for the whole board with recommendations and supporting data. Note
that they do not decide on policies, they only make recommendations to those with the
authority to do so, i.e. the board as a whole.

         Working committees
    These are policy implementation groups which either assist paid staff in carrying out
tasks that staff cannot do alone or are used instead of paid staff because none are available.
Some argue that, strictly speaking, such operational committees should not be considered
as committees of the board of directors, rather they should report only to managers. This
is fine in theory but, in many organizations with working or mixed model boards, the best
people to head such committees are already board members. Besides, in doing their work,
operational committees often must make decisions that have large-scale implications.These
kinds of policy issues must be recognized and brought to the whole board for discussion.
Trained and sensitive board members as committee chairs may well be the best judges of
whether a major operational issue has strategic implications or not.
    Even in governance-only boards, some working committees may be needed at times
to help with new operational activities in which the management has little experience, e.g.
implementing shared services or a merger with another organization, a new kind of fund-
raising activity, implementation of a pay equity program, property acquisition or investment
decisions.
    This said there is much to support the commonly offered recommendation that standing
committees (i.e. permanent committees created by the organization's by-laws) be kept to a
minimum. Too many committees with titles such as Property Committee, Program Com-
mittee, Purchasing Committee, etc., may have no clear function as either policy or working
committees. Instead they waste the time of managers who have to think of things for them
to do when they are not really needed, or they necessarily confuse the lines of authority of
both managers and the whole board.
    Many consultants urge that standing committees be replaced by task forces or special
project groups to be created on an "as needed" basis with very clear terms of reference and
deadlines for doing their jobs, after which they disappear. It is important to note that a big
advantage of temporary task forces of the board is that well-qualified non-board members
can more easily augment their membership. At the extreme, only the chair need be a board
member to bring any policy issues to the board.

                    The Board's Structure and Operating Procedures|38
       Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

           Should boards using the governance-only board model have any standing committees,
       then? Since giving strategic direction is a key board responsibility, a good argument can
       be made for a planning committee to work with other strategically-oriented groups in the
       organization (such as the management team). It would work with these other groups to
       help define the issues, assemble relevant information and lay out strategic options for the
       whole board to consider.

           Often the role of taking the lead in strategic planning is played by the executive com-
       mittee so it is worth saying a few words about the risks and benefits of such a committee.
       An executive committee is usually made up of those holding formal offices on the board
       (e.g. President, V. P., Treasurer, Secretary etc.) and, in some cases, the chairs of standing
       committees. Its formal role is usually to look after board business between meetings and
       set the agenda for board meetings. The pitfall with executive committees is that they can
       become a powerful "inner cabinet" that arbitrarily makes decisions the board should make
       and filters the way issues are put before the board so as to favour a predetermined posi-
       tion. For this reason, some board experts advise against the existence of such a committee.
       On the other hand, someone must perform the function of setting the board agenda and
       ensuring that everything that goes before the board is of sufficient importance and is well
       enough prepared and supported with good information. Leaving these matters solely up
       to the Board Chair and/or CEO increases the possibility of just these two becoming the
       overly powerful "inner circle." Hence an executive committee with strictly limited powers as
       to what it can decide is probably a worthwhile entity especially for governance-only boards.

           Because the board's responsibility for fiscal oversight is so critical, there is also usually
       need for a finance committee, provided it can be kept from making de facto strategic decisions
       when it reviews the accounts and budgets. Organizations with unique characteristics may
       well identify other areas where constant operational assistance from volunteer directors is
       required, thereby necessitating standing committees.

           Finally, most boards need help to ensure that they manage themselves well. This
       self-help is sometimes provided in part by a standing committee of the board such as a
       nominating committee. It attempts to locate the best possible people to stand as potential
       board members. The trouble is that the conventional nominating committee does not go
       far enough. Who will arrange to have new board members oriented and trained? Who will
       take the lead in assessing the board's performance or deal with the cases of individual board
       members who fail to live up to the role expectations? In some cases, these very important
       matters are the responsibility of the executive committee. In others, the terms of reference
       of the nominating committee are expanded and it is renamed as, for example, the "Board
       Development" or, better, the "Governance Committee."

    Effective Board Meetings

Symptoms

For most people with little experience with boards of directors, the belief is that the main
work of boards takes place at its official, formal meetings. In actual fact a great deal of
important board work takes place before and after those meetings. Nevertheless, the quality
of formal board meetings can make a considerable difference to a board's success. At the
very least, having to sit in on a number of poorly run meetings can destroy the commit-
ment of even the most dedicated supporter of an organization's cause. Meetings that are
poorly organized, go on too long, go off on tangents instead of sticking to the point, feature
personal conflicts or domineering individuals turn people off and can cause serious damage
by leading to poorly considered decisions.

    A high percentage of agreement with the following statements indicates a board that
might have problems in carrying out its meetings effectively and efficiently.
 The agenda for board meetings does not get into the hands of board members in

    time for them to familiarize themselves with the issues before the meeting.
 When the agenda does come, there is too much information to digest or not

    enough to adequately familiarize board members about the issues.
 The agenda for meetings is too full of "routine" motions or items "for information

    only" so there isn't time to discuss more important matters.
 The agenda items of greatest importance often come up too late in the meeting

    when board members are too tired to concentrate on them.
 We have problems when it comes to attendance at board meetings; too many

    members miss too many meetings.
 Board meetings often go on too long.
 Once the board has finished discussing something, it is not clear who is going to

    do what and when.
 There is too much unconstructive arguing among some members during

    meetings.

                                 Effective Board Meetings|42
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

 Meetings are run too informally, for example with more than one person talking at
    once, no time limits on discussions, etc.

 Meetings stick too much to formal "rules of order" so that thorough, probing
    discussions are discouraged.

 A few members seem to dominate discussions and this discourages quieter
    board members from contributing.
    In essence, problems with board meetings can be grouped under five headings:

1. Agenda clarity and timing

    Critical to the success of any formal meeting is having a clear agenda that organizes the
planned content of the meeting. Also, if the agenda document is delivered to participants
too late (or, even worse, is not made available until the beginning of the meeting), people
cannot prepare adequately.

2. Supporting information

    There is also a need for the agenda to contain enough documentation on the matters
to be discussed to get everyone "up to speed" on them before they are brought up. Nothing
renders a board ineffective more than members scrambling to read important materials
at the same time as an issue is being discussed or, worse, not having important material
available for them to read beforehand.

    On the other hand, it is also possible to provide too much in the way of supporting
materials with agendas--materials that are not really relevant to the matter at hand but
that the agenda preparers misguidedly think "might be useful." The regrettable tendency
of many board members, when faced with a huge pile of documents that do not obviously
relate to the issues at hand, is to give it a glance at best.

3. Meeting content

    The most common problems with board meetings is that too much time is spent lis-
tening to reports "for information only" (i.e., that do not require any decisions other than
a motion to "accept the report"), or discussing matters that could better be discussed and
decided upon by the CEO and her/his management team or a committee of the board. The
ideal meeting puts the most important matters requiring motions and decisions as close to
the top of the agenda as possible and provides enough time for careful deliberation.

    To be sure, some of the matters that are "for information only" could be conceived of
as necessary in that they help the board carry out its due diligence function of ensuring
that everything is running well and according to plan. Identifying these matters requires
careful thought. However, certain reports from committees or managers may not neces-
sarily have to actually take up the time of board meetings to deal with them unless they
contain motions requiring board level decisions (see discussion of "consent agendas" under
"Treatment" below).

4. Clarity and effectiveness of decisions made at board meetings

    Even when the agenda and the meeting content are well-designed, board meetings can
be less than successful if the decision-making process is flawed. For example:

                                 Effective Board Meetings|43
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

             · Meetings that are dominated by a small group of "talkers" while quieter mem-
                bers with useful things to say are not drawn into the conversation;

             · Not enough time is scheduled for a full discussion of an issue;
             · The discussion goes off on tangents that are not relevant to the issue;
             · Decisions are reached but lack clarity about who is going to do what and

                when;
             · No follow up is provided to permit the board to check on progress made in

                implementing decisions taken at prior meetings.

5. Attendance

    If there are problems with meetings in any or all of the four areas discussed above,
they may result in poor attendance at board meetings--too many people missing too many
meetings. Whatever the cause of poor meeting attendance, it is a good indicator of possible
problems in the way the board is working.

Diagnosis

    Since very few people like taking part in meetings that are too long, confusing or boring,
why do so many boards seem to get into situations where this is exactly what happens? The
simplest explanation is that these practices become part of the culture of the board and no
one seems to recognize that they could be changed.Typically, when a nonprofit organization
is young and being run by a small handful of enthusiasts who are willing to do anything and
everything needed to keep things going, informal board meetings that deal with everything
and have to move quickly from crisis to crisis are common. As the organization evolves and
professionalizes to the extent that it can afford to hire a paid CEO or develop committees
to whom things can be delegated with confidence, the old meeting practices of the board
fail to change even though they become more and more inappropriate for the situation.

    Another major reason for poor meetings is lack of a good meeting facilitator in the role
of the board chair. Our research and that of a few others on the role and impact of the board
chair suggests that meetings become ineffective when the chair is either under-controlling
(lets the meeting get off track, or allows a few members to dominate) or over-controlling
(the meeting becomes very formal and rigid). Poor chairing can occur when the skills and
aptitude needed for effective meeting leadership are overlooked when choosing a chair or
the chair has not had time to develop the skills needed for the role. Meeting management
skills are very learnable if proper training is provided but many of those who end up ac-
cepting nomination for the Chair or President role may not see they need to develop them.
A more detailed discussion of the role of the Chair appears in the chapter on Leadership
in these Guidelines.

    Sometimes the reason for ineffective board meetings, unfortunately, is the presence
of a CEO (paid top manager) who, consciously or unconsciously, does not want a strong
board but rather one that is dependent on him/her for information and guidance in all its
deliberations. Such CEOs can provide too little information on important issues which
leads to "rubber-stamp" decision-making. Conversely some CEOs try to manipulate their
boards by providing too much information--"a snow job." They can also bias the informa-
tion that is provided so as to favor one position on an issue over another. Also, they can
strongly influence the selection of new board members so as to ensure that only those with

                                 Effective Board Meetings|44
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

the same point of view on issues as themselves are chosen. All of these actions by CEOs
can reduce board effectiveness.

Treatment

    The goal of official meetings of the whole board should be to focus on issues that have
implications for the strategic direction of the organization or that create understanding
about an issue or situation the organization is facing. Even with a clear focus on matters of
strategic importance, the effectiveness of boards can be influenced by a number of factors,
including meeting frequency and times, meeting length and design, and meeting rules and
attendance.

Meeting Frequency and Times

    There is definitely no fixed rule about the optimum frequency of official meetings of the
whole board. Actual practice can vary from monthly to annually. The governing criterion,
which can be stated in by-laws or board policy manuals, ought to be that the board should
hold a formal meeting when it has enough business to warrant doing so. For example, in
working boards, meetings could occur quite often. In governance-only boards, they may
occur less often. Chairs and CEOs can recognize if they are calling too many board meet-
ings if they have an attendance problem or if they find themselves thinking, "Another board
meeting coming up. How can we fill up the agenda this time?"

    In the case of some governance-only boards in very stable environments, meetings
might be only three times a year: a meeting to approve the strategic plan; an interim prog-
ress report meeting; and an evaluation meeting to assess how well the organization has
performed. These, however, are official decision-making meetings. But in today's complex
governance environment with multiple stakeholders and a fast changing and threat-laden
world, it is much more likely that issues will come up that will require boards to come
together more often and to interact with people other than themselves and the top manage-
ment team. In Governance as Leadership (2005), Chait, Ryan and Taylor suggest "landmarks"
or "characteristics of an issue" boards should recognize as opportunities to engage in what
they call "Generative Governing":

       · The issue or situation is ambiguous or there are multiple perspectives on it;
       · The issue or situation is salient in that it is important to different people or

         constituents;
       · The issue or situation is high stakes in that it relates to the organization's purpose

         or core values;
       · The issue or situation may be polarizing and there is a need to bring people to-

         gether; and
       · The issue or situation is irreversible in that it cannot be easily changed after a deci-

         sion is made (p. 107).
    For this reason, many nonprofit organizations today find that it is useful to differentiate
between decision-making meetings and "information briefing meetings" held for the pur-
pose of becoming informed about a single important strategic issue. These latter meetings
are usually characterized by less formal discussions and feature input from invited staff,
experts from outside or representatives from clients, members or external stakeholders.
Specific motions are not debated; instead, information is provided, alternatives identified

                                 Effective Board Meetings|45
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

and opinions sought. This is all fed to relevant board or management working groups, who
then develop specific policy recommendations in the context of the organization's strategic
plan. Formal discussion and voting on such recommendations occurs at one of the decision-
making board meetings.

    The question of the time of board meetings is important when board membership is di-
verse and everyone's time of availability does not fit the same period of the day, or day of the
week (mothers caring for children unable to attend midmorning meetings, shift workers
unable to attend evening meetings, or others unable to meet on weekdays). The organiza-
tion must be conscious of the need to vary meeting times in such circumstances so all board
members have an equally fair opportunity to attend. It is also worth considering the use of
modern communications technology such as conference calls, Skype, and online meeting
applications etc., as a means of allowing participation by those not able to physically attend.

Meeting Length

    Another indicator of board meeting mismanagement is meeting length. The span of
time that the average person can focus on complex decision-making tasks without losing
their clarity of thought is no longer than 50 minutes, though this can be extended some-
what with refreshment breaks. Board meetings that regularly last longer than two hours
can be an indication of problems. Either too much time is being spent on issues that do not
need to be considered by the whole board or there are too many items that involve long-
winded reports "for information only." Alternatively, the regular occurrence of long debates
that extend meeting times may indicate badly-worded motions or poorly-prepared reports
that do not contain enough supporting data. When these kinds of long discussions occur
often, attention should be paid to how to improve the work of the committees or managers
who prepare the agenda items in question.

    Occasionally, some CEOs seeking rubber stamp approval of their recommendations
on contentious issues deliberately create long agendas. They then insure that the issues they
want the board to rubber stamp are placed at the end. By that time, no one has the energy
to think, let alone discuss and object.

The "consent agenda" option

    When board meetings go on too long because too many of the items being presented
are "for information only," a solution increasingly adopted by many is the introduction of a
"consent agenda." The following is an example of the use of a consent agenda suggested by
board expert David Renz (2006):

         When a by-law or some other rule or regulation requires formal approval by the
    board, yet there is no value added by engaging the board in discussion about the item
    (e.g., a routine lease renewal for a facility already included in the approved agency
    budget). The procedure is to have all items of this type sent beforehand to board
    members. When these items come up at the meeting, there is no oral presentation or
    discussion of the information. Instead, it is taken as understood that the information
    has been reviewed by members beforehand and will only be discussed if anyone has a
    question or wants to comment on it.
     Consent agenda items are usually put forward at the beginning of the meeting. Use of
a consent agenda can save large amounts of time though the disadvantage is that it might
hurt the feelings of those who prepared the reports and would like to have their "moment
in the sun" before the whole board. A conscious effort to recognize and praise the work of

                                 Effective Board Meetings|46
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

individuals and committees that prepare material that is included in a consent agenda can
help mitigate this problem.

    Another tactic for controlling the length of meetings is to have the agenda preparers
estimate the length of time that will be needed for presentation and discussion of each item
and insert the "estimated time" on the agenda document. These estimates should be treated
as guidelines only, however. Sometimes issues end up requiring more than the time al-
located to them. Rather than arbitrarily cutting off important discussion, it is better for the
Chair to ask permission of the meeting to extend the time, then either postpone discussion
of less important matters or reduce the discussion time on them.

    The flip side of meetings that go on too long is the meeting that ends too soon. Meet-
ings that the board rushes through in, say, half an hour could be an indication of a rubber
stamp board. If this happens regularly it might be that the board has been conditioned not
to question whatever is put before it or simply that there should be fewer meetings.

Meeting Design

    As discussed above, one of the most common complaints of board members is that
meetings are "not properly organized." Specific problems include the following:

       · The agenda does not reach board members until very shortly before, or even at, the
         meeting so they have no time to prepare;

       · The agenda contains too much information that is irrelevant to the issues to be
         discussed or there is not enough relevant information;

       · The order of the agenda items places unimportant and routine items at the top
         while important ones are at the end, when energy tends to run out;

       · Meetings fail to follow accepted "rules of order" so can become too disorganized;
         or, conversely, are too formal or rule bound, thereby discouraging full and frank
         debate.

    Except in rare emergency situations, there is really no excuse for not getting agendas
into the hands of board members three to five working days before the meeting. It is often
helpful when planning the content of the Agenda to request board members to submit
suggestions for matters needing discussion. Agendas should be organized so that items
requiring decisions are put at the top. All supporting material should be directly relevant to
the impending discussion.

Meeting Rules

    Even the most informal working boards should adopt one of the standard authori-
ties on "rules of order" for meetings, such as Roberts Rules (http://www.robertsrules.org/
rulesintro.htm) to be used as a guide in conducting official board meetings. It is also impor-
tant that the Chair, or a designated other person, be familiar with these rules and how they
are applied. This, however, does not mean that all meetings must be run in strict accordance
with these "parliamentary" rules. The rules are primarily of benefit when the items to be
discussed are likely to be highly controversial with a lot of disagreement among board
members. As in any emotion-laden debate, rules are needed to make it fair. These would
include: how often a person can speak, rules regarding how amendments to motions can be
made, when and how a motion can be tabled, what constitutes being "out of order," etc. In
most non-crisis situations, however, a much more relaxed approach can be taken to meeting
rules provided the informal culture of the board is one that values an orderly, business-like
approach.

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

Meeting Attendance

    Spotty attendance by a high proportion of board members is usually an indication
that a significant number of members are dissatisfied with the board and/or their role on
it though sometimes it indicates logistical problems like meeting times that don't suit a
number of people. Some consultants urge compulsory attendance rules as a way of getting
the members out to meetings, e.g., "Members must attend at least 2/3rds of the meet-
ings each year or resign unless a valid excuse is provided and accepted by the Executive
Committee." This may get out the members but can mask the real problems behind low
commitment.

nance effectiveness of the organization through high quality board meetings.

      The Composition and
   Development of the Board

Symptoms

A major component of effective boards is having the right combination of people on them
and providing them with ample opportunity to learn what they need to know to be good
governors. The two basic requirements for all board members is that they be committed to
the mission of the organization and have the time and energy to devote to the work of the
board. After that, the specific mix of leadership competencies that is best for a given board
in the environment in which it works can vary greatly from one organization to another.
Even though most boards probably have members who get along quite well some may have
a sense that, as a group, the mix of people might not be ideal. They may feel that the board
as a whole is lacking in expertise, is not diverse enough and/or has not received the level of
orientation and training it needs to become highly effective. A high percentage of agree-
ment with the following statements indicates that board composition and development
might be improved:
 Looking at the board as a whole, there is not enough "new blood" coming on to

    it to bring fresh energy and ideas.
 Finding high quality new board members is a problem for us.
 We do not pay enough attention to making sure we get the mix of skills and

    backgrounds we need in the new board members we recruit.
 The diversity of public with an interest in this organization is not well represented

    in the make-up of the board.
 We don't do a very good job of orienting and training new board members.
 There is not enough ongoing professional development and training for regular

    board members.

                    The Composition and Development of the Board |49
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

Diagnosis

    There are several possible reasons for issues relating to composition and development
of the board:

      1. As with so many problem areas in board governance, the root of difficulties with
         the composition of the board may lie in the culture that the board has evolved.
         Unspoken shared attitudes may exist such as, "We can always find good members
         just by asking our friends"; or, "It's too hard to find new people so let's just keep the
         ones we have"; or, "New members can easily learn the ropes just by sitting in on our
         meetings and watching how we do things." Where do such attitudes come from?
         Sometimes there are informal subgroups within boards--older members who have
         been around a long time, for example--whose opinions dominate the rest of the
         board. Since their selection and training was informal and based on connections to
         prior board members, they feel there is no need to change.

      2. Another source of the difficulty in developing a better mix of members and a trained
         board is failure to allocate responsibility for doing this to a specific role (e.g., chair)
         or board committee (e.g., governance committee). Thus, even though the board
         may sometimes talk about developing the board or recruiting different kinds of
         new members, it may not be knowledgeable or organized enough to implement
         those practices.

      3. Board by-laws that make no provision for limited terms of office for board mem-
         bers invite the possibility that the board will not attempt to rejuvenate itself.

      4. It could also be the case that the board does not carry out regular assessments of its
         own performance and is thus "blind" to the need for change in board composition
         selection criteria or development practices.

      5. A special kind of blockage to changes in board composition can arise in relatively
         new organizations dominated by one or more "founding fathers." The problem
         created is called Founder's Syndrome. It occurs when the founding fathers (or
         mothers) of the organization have created a culture, like that described above, in
         which board turnover is believed not to be necessary. Instead, the founders see
         themselves as the "keepers of the flame" and don't want to risk newcomers making
         changes in how things are done.

Treatment

    To increase the effectiveness of the governance function, consider the following ap-
proaches to board composition and development.

Board Composition

    Critical to having a successful board is getting the right people on it in the first place.
The difficult part is deciding who will be "right"for the organization.Too often the tendency
is to appoint members who resemble existing members or who are suitable for conditions as
they were but who may not be suitable for a changing future. There is a good deal of advice
available to those who are seeking to put together a successful board but there are only two
universal criteria which are supported both by research and the "how-to" authors:

                    The Composition and Development of the Board |50
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

1. Board members must be committed to the organization's mission, i.e., they must
   believe strongly in what the organization is trying to do and seriously want to help.
   A board dominated by people who sit on it as a favor to a friend or because they
   believe it will look good on their resumé will not usually be effective.

2. Prospective members must have the time and energy to devote to the board's
   business.

Establishing board recruitment needs

    The first step in finding the best potential members for a board is to be clear about the
kind of people one is seeking in the first place. One way to do this is by compiling a board
needs document. Table 8 provides one example of a simple recruitment needs grid that can
be used to identify possible composition gaps on the board.

           Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

             Demographic Representation
Balanced diversity among the desired demographic
characteristics such as:

Gender
Geographic Location (region, district, state, country)
Age
Ethno-Racial Background
Socio-Economic Background

                Down the left hand column of Table 8 are listed some of the kinds of background
           characteristics of individuals that might be important to have on the board. The actual char-
           acteristics chosen should be decided on by each organization as they might vary depending
           on local conditions. Across the top of Table 8 are listed the names of the current board
           members. The committee doing the nominating then informally assesses the composition
           of the board by checking and describing the extent to which each member possesses each
           of the characteristics in column 1. The board could then be "rated" according to the extent
           to which it meets these criteria: in terms of being "high" (present board members fulfill each
           criterion), "medium" (some criteria are met but not all) or "low" (a number of the criteria
           are not met by the present board members. A careful examination and discussion of the
           results of this process should give the committee an indication of the "gaps" in desirable
           background characteristics needed by the board at that time. This becomes the basis for the
           subsequent recruitment drive.

                Note: The needs matrix discussed above will identify potentially useful characteristics in future
           board members. However, to know that someone possesses a certain qualification or experience does
           not necessarily mean that they will perform well as a board member. They must be able and willing
           to `do', not just `be'.

                There are also many other important questions to answer when it comes to finding the
           ideal mix of people for a board. The main ones are discussed below.

         Should boards be composed primarily of "important" people?

                Having many "big name" people on the board can help in giving the organization
           credibility and a high profile in the community. And some, if not all, "names" have valu-
           able talents. The dilemma is that many of these people may be on other boards or are so
           busy in their day jobs that they don't really have time to do much more than make token
           appearances.

                Many organizations elect to keep the percentage of "prestige" members relatively small
           and tolerate minimal involvement as the price that must be paid for their ability to provide
           contacts and credibility. The majority of the board carries the workload. Of course if the
           "busy names" become the majority of the board, this can often lead to a rubber stamp board
           that simply approves recommendations brought to it by management.

                The other approach is to put the prestigious names on an "Advisory" or "Honorary"
           Board comprising those who can give useful help with specific matters (such as fundraising)
           and heighten the organization's profile but who are not expected to govern.

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

What is the right amount and kind of diversity to have among
board members?

    It is generally agreed that boards should represent the diversity of the people that they
serve but research has established that many boards do not achieve this representation
(Bradshaw, Fredette & Sukornyk, 2009). Instead, the majority of their members have sim-
ilar demographic and other background characteristics (usually middle class, middle-aged,
well-educated, with business or professional experience and of European ethnic origin). To
what extent this affects the board, or organization's performance depends on how diverse
the populations are that the organization serves.The hypothesis is that a non-representative
board will increase the chances that the agency will serve the needs of non-mainstream
communities poorly. Put in positive terms, the advantage of expanding a board's diversity
along ethno-racial, social class, gender and other dimensions is that this will improve the
board's "boundary spanning" function and lead to better strategic leadership.

    On the other hand, the fear associated with a very diverse board is that these new kinds
of members won't always understand how the board operates and won't be able to make
decisions in the best interest of the organization as a whole. Again, there is no research
evidence that this frequently happens. Differences in background may sometimes make it
more difficult to develop a comfortable, open, problem-solving climate but it is not impos-
sible. Given careful selection of the individual nominees, placement in the "right" role (also
known as functional inclusion), and an adequate board development program, a diverse
board can be much more effective than a homogeneous one (Fredette & Bradshaw, 2011).

How much should the board be made up of "stakeholders" who
have specific interests in the organization, as opposed to more
general "community representatives"?

    Stakeholders consist of organized interest groups, e.g., on a university board of gover-
nors, there would be representation from the student government, the faculty association,
government departments, the alumni association, support staff association and associations
representing the community. Again, the positive side of organized stakeholder representa-
tion is it promotes "bringing the outside in" and "taking the inside out." Once more, the
downside risk is the possibility that the representatives will feel they must act solely in what
they see as the interests of the organized group they represent. Hard data on the extent to
which this actually happens is very scarce. The probability is that problems arise only infre-
quently, but stakeholder organizations can cause major upheavals during crisis periods such
as downsizing, opening or closing programs, or shifting attention from one client group to
another. Again, great care in selecting the individual representatives and thorough board
training in putting the interests of the organization first can help minimize the frequency
of destructive approaches to conflict during periods of change.

How well should candidates know the organization and the field
that it is in?

    Another dilemma is the extent to which the board should consist of members who
already have an in-depth knowledge of what the organization does and how it operates.
For boards using the working board model, this is quite important, at least for selection of
the majority of their members. For Governing Boards, it may be impossible, other than by

                    The Composition and Development of the Board |53
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

choosing internal stakeholder representatives. A majority of Governing Board members
will not be "experts" in the organization they govern or the "industry" in which it operates.
This raises the question: how can they provide strategic leadership? As noted, the solution
to this problem lies in thorough orientation and provision of at least partially independent
information systems for the board.

How much should "business skills" be emphasized?

    What is the extent to which board members should possess specific skills or knowledge
based on their employment or training in areas such as business administration, corporate
law, accounting, marketing, human resources, performance management, IT, and public
and government relations. One school of thought says this kind of talent is very useful for
providing the executive director with invaluable free advice on all sorts of management
issues. The other says it is overrated and runs the serious risk of creating a board which is
going to be primarily interested in management and unable to focus on governance issues.
Again, there are no data to support either of these assertions so probably there is not a
universally correct mix. Organizations with working and mixed model boards are, by defi-
nition, deficient in certain operational leadership and management skills so board members
who can help fill such gaps are important. Even in large professionally managed institutions
there can be certain areas of specialized knowledge that the organization cannot afford to
pay for but which a board member might possess. As a general rule, it is wise to be aware
of the skill, knowledge and abilities of the Executive Director and his/her management
team. The better they are, the less need for board members to fill gaps. When it is necessary
to select board members with specific skills, the key is to train these useful specialists to
understand that their expertise will be sought in the roles of advisors or implementers only,
not as decision-makers.

A note on the need for board candidates being willing and able to
donate money to the organization

    In some cultures and certain nonprofit organizations that depend heavily on donations
from the public or corporations, there is an expectation that board members show their
support for the organization by making a personal donation of money. The belief is that
showing the public that all board members make donations will help in fundraising appeals.
There are two points to consider when thinking about making board member donations a
criterion for member selection:

       · Though most professional fundraisers tend to believe that publicizing a unanimous
         board donation record makes a difference to how much external donors will give,
         there is no actual evidence from empirical research showing that this is so.

       · If showing unanimous donor support is deemed to be necessary, it is not necessary
         for such donations to be large. They need only be what each member is willing and
         able to afford.

What individual personal qualities to look for?

    Developing broad criteria for board selection such as those discussed above is important
but, in the end, the most important criteria are those that are the most difficult to specify
and measure in potential candidates for membership. These are the personality characteristics
that one wants to see in board members. Everyone who has ever spent much time watching

                    The Composition and Development of the Board |54
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

different boards come and go in an organization will agree that, some years, the majority of
board members seem particularly quick to understand issues, be creative and constructive
in their handling of differences and business-like, while in other years the opposite qualities
prevail. Since most boards don't like to check carefully into the personal qualities of the
people they nominate, it is almost a matter of chance how well the mix works out in any
particular year.

    What is needed, clearly, is: (a) an attempt to articulate the kinds of personality char-
acteristics and personal values that are being sought and (b) a serious attempt to state how
they will be discerned in any given nominee. Under heading (a), the following are some
of the qualities that we found were associated with high impact leadership on nonprofit
boards:

       · Honest, helpful, and humble.
       · Self and socially aware.
       · Able to "see the big picture."
       · Creative and open to change.
       · Able to communicate, work well with others, and handle conflict respectfully.
    Regarding (b), there is not enough space here to provide a full review of the most
valid methods for assessing these characteristics in people; most textbooks on human re-
source management will do that. Suffice it to say here that the essence of the process lies
in how the candidates' past behavior is checked through references. This process needs to
be systematically thought out in advance and implemented with care. The all-too-common
method of nominating someone whom one other board member believes "is a wonderful
person" just is not good enough. These days, most people called to provide references are
loath to communicate negative things especially in writing. However, some might be more
open sharing useful information in response to oral conversations in which they are asked
questions that relate to specific actions, e.g., "What role did `x' play in your strategic plan-
ning process?" or "How was `x' involved in your fundraising activities?"
    A carefully designed board recruitment process looks something like this:
       · It is carried out by a Governance (or Nominations) committee of the board.
       · The committee looks at the strengths of the existing board and tries to identify

         gaps in skills, abilities and background that need to be filled.
       · A widely broadcast call for nominations is made highlighting the qualifications

         sought.
       · Those making nominations are asked informally to provide information on why

         their candidate(s) is suitable using the criteria in Table 8.
       · Those who are willing to act as references for the potential nominee should be

         asked how they perceive him/her in specific situations.
       · A short list of suitable nominees is created and ranked as strong, medium or weak

         candidates. Each person on the list would then be approached by the board chair
         in the order in which they are ranked.

The special problems of low profile organizations

    Unfortunately, for a large number of worthy but low-profile organizations that support
less popular causes, the problem of board composition is not one of how to choose among
a range of possible candidates; rather it is to find enough people of any kind who meet
the basic criteria of commitment to the organization's mission and willingness to devote

                    The Composition and Development of the Board |55
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

enough time and effort to the cause. This is a problem of recruitment, rather than selection.
Solving it requires developing a focused, formal recruitment program for board members.

    The usual method employed by successful nonprofits of this type is the "grow-your-own"
approach. This is accomplished by concentrating on getting a lot of working volunteers to
help with programs and projects. The best of these are then identified and systematically
wooed and trained to accept increasing amounts of responsibility, including the leadership
of others. Before long, those with skills and attitudes required on the board can be asked
to join it (which, in these situations, is almost always a working board). In desperation, one
can trust recruitment to the efforts of a few board members to pressure their friends to join,
but don't expect a very effective board as a result.

A final word on board composition

    Though there are no hard and fast rules about how a board should be made up, there
is probably one generalization that fits all voluntary organizations that are facing rapidly
changing, often threatening, environments: strive for balanced diversity. The exact kind of
mix will vary from situation to situation, but a mix it should be. Older, younger; men,
women; rich, poor; "old hands," "young blood"; business and non-business backgrounds;
multi-ethnic and multi-racial--the criteria can vary. But only with a balanced mix can the
organization improve its chances for getting the fresh ideas and specialized information it
needs to cope with its changing world. Remember, however, that to make it all work, the
board needs training in how to work together as a team and in how to discern the greater
good of the organization as the basis for making all decisions.

Board Development

    Even though boards may manage to find the ideal mix of skilled and committed people
to become members, they may still end up losing some of them or having them perform
ineffectively. This may be because members do not know what is expected of them, or lack
the skill and knowledge needed to make good decisions in the governor role. The most
direct way to deal with this problem is through a well-planned system of board orientation,
development and evaluation (Brown, 2007, Brudney & Murray, 1998; Green & Gresinger,
1996; Herman, 2005; Herman & Renz, 1998, 1999; Herman, Renz & Heimovics, 1997;
Holland & Jackson, 1998; Brudney & Nobbie, 2002). The components of such a system are:

       · A board manual which provides full background information on the organization
         and its articles of incorporation and by-laws, current programs and plans, descrip-
         tions of the position of board members, and outlines of the responsibilities of board
         officers and committees, and minutes of recent board meetings.

       · A formal orientation program at which new board members meet top manage-
         ment officials, tour facilities and hear presentations on the organization's programs
         and background information on strategic issues. Also helpful here are informal
         "mentoring" programs, which pair new members with current members. A good
         mentoring program will "train the trainer" by providing the mentor with a checklist
         of topics to discuss and the necessary information to cover.

       · Periodic formal occasions at which the board assesses its own performance, for
         example by using Board Check-Up or questionnaires covering much the same
         topics as the content of this guide. Feedback from the management team and staff
         and stakeholders who interact with the board should also be obtained. Also useful
         in helping boards get a realistic picture of how they are doing is obtaining periodic

                    The Composition and Development of the Board |56
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

         feedback from key external stakeholders on how they view the board's work. Dif-
         ferences in perceptions of board effectiveness between the board, staff and external
         stakeholders are often an indicator of a potentially harmful situation that should
         be addressed.
    Finally, there is value in creating a "buddy system" for new board members in which
individual existing board members with good knowledge of how the board and organiza-
tion works are formally asked to mentor new members during their first year on the board.
    There is also a need to assess the performance of individual board members with an eye
toward continuous growth and effective support of the organization. This can be done by
having board members self-assess their performance informally or through formal analysis
of data collected from a questionnaire. It is remarkable how honest many are willing to be.
However, attendance records and feedback from the Chair and Committee Heads can also
be useful. The main problem is that assessing individual performance often feels like a very
awkward thing to do because members are volunteers, have egos and a certain amount of
prestige in the community. It is not impossible, however, if board members are shown when
they join that there is a formal system of board self-evaluation and understand how the
information obtained through it is to be used. This problem can be overcome if the culture
of the board is understood to be one of support for each board member in order to help
them contribute as best they can. Rather than identifying and concentrating on shortfalls,
individual performance discussions can be opportunities to set goals for the coming year,
identify areas of interest that the board member may want to expand on and new roles they
may assume in order to help the organization prosper.

effectiveness of the organization through board composition and development.

   The Informal Culture of the
                 Board

Symptoms

Board culture is the collection of taken-for-granted attitudes, social norms, perceptions and
beliefs about "how we do things around here" shared, usually unconsciously, by a majority
of board members. A high percentage of agreement with the following statements might
indicate problems with the informal culture of the board:
 Too many board members seem unwilling to devote much time or effort to the

    work of the board.
 There are many differences of opinion among board members that never get

    resolved. The board doesn't handle conflict very well.
 The board does not regularly and systematically assess its own performance and

    change itself if it thinks it can improve.
 Board members tend not to be involved in representing the organization to the out-

    side community or bringing the concerns of that community into the organization.
 As far as I know, many board members have contacts among people who might

    help the organization but they are not encouraged, or given the opportunity, to
    make use of them.
 Individual board members with skills and knowledge that might be of use to the
    organization are rarely approached informally for their assistance.
 Little effort is made to help board members get to know one another and develop
    "team spirit" as a group.

Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

Diagnosis

    Why do cultures evolve the way they do? There are at least six major sources of influ-
ence that can shape board culture without the members being aware of it:

      1. Sometimes there are external pressures for boards to act in certain ways that come
         from critical stakeholder groups such as funders, members or associations of other
         nonprofit organizations in the same "business."

      2. In the case of boards of relatively young organizations or those with a high per-
         centage of new members, certain beliefs, attitudes or social norms may come from
         founders or members who have previous experience on other boards.

      3. Similarly when most board members share a homogenous background in terms of
         such things as age, social status, ethnicity, etc., there is a greater likelihood that they
         will quickly evolve similar attitudes toward the way their roles and responsibilities
         on the board should be carried out.

      4. In some boards, there are members with disproportionately larger resources (largest
         checkbooks, influential friends, political connections, etc.) who have a greater
         amount of influence in the group. It is not that they intentionally manipulate
         others, but nonetheless they may have a larger voice than others in shaping board
         culture.

      5. One of the strongest influences shaping board culture is the behavior of those in
         the critical leadership positions of Board Chair and CEO. While these positions
         do not have formal authority to make board decisions, they do carry a great deal of
         informal influence over the process.

      6. Finally, in addition to the influence of the Board Chair/CEO positions, some
         boards evolve small sub-groups within themselves, sometimes referred to as cliques
         or "core groups" (Bradshaw, Murray, & Wolpin, 1992). These informal groups are
         not recognized officially in any way though they may dominate certain commit-
         tees or formal offices. They are important because the attitudes and beliefs of their
         members regarding how the board should operate or what position it should take
         on various issues can significantly impact those who are not part of the group. It
         is important to realize that "core groups" are not necessarily a bad thing. Some-
         times they emerge simply because some people have more time and interest in
         the organization so do more and find others with a similar outlook to whom they
         naturally gravitate. Other inner groups develop because they are made up of people
         with similar periods of long tenure on the board (part of the founder's syndrome
         phenomenon discussed earlier). This is especially common when there are no fixed
         maximum terms of office for board members. New members might come and go
         but a core of "old timers" stays around.
             Core groups become a problem when they engage in any of the following
         behaviors:
             · Control of information or a willful disregard for providing proper orientation
                to new members thus leading them to feel like outsiders;
             · Pushing an "agenda" of their own based on interests or positions on important
                issues that may not be shared by others; and
             · Engaging in "backstage" politicking in the form of "secret" informal meet-
                ings outside of regular board meetings to plan how to have their positions on
                issues approved at the meeting.

                            The Informal Culture of the Board |60
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

    However, whether or not core groups are a positive or negative influence on the board,
it is useful to recognize they may exist and discuss the role they play so everything is out
in the open.

Treatment

    Changing a board's culture can be very difficult because, by definition, it is something
that has developed over time about which many are not consciously aware. So the first step
in the change process must be that of surfacing what has heretofore been taken for granted.
How to do this?

       · One way is through the use of fully confidential self-assessment exercises such
         as the Board Check-Up, University at Albany, SUNY sponsored research project
         offered online for free by www.boardcheckup.com. This questionnaire, which in-
         cludes the items above, is especially useful if effort is made to obtain accurate,
         anonymous perceptions of the board's culture from board and non-board people
         who have occasion to observe and/or interact with the board. When results show,
         for example, that some respondents perceive that there is an inner group that has
         more influence than others, this finding needs to be put before the whole board for
         discussion. This discussion should cover the following points:
             · What is the evidence that suggests such a group exists?
             · If there is consensus that it does, why has it emerged?
             · Most importantly, is the behavior of this group good for the board or not-so-
                good? That is, on balance, do the group's actions contribute to, or reduce the
                effectiveness of the board's decisions and/or individual members in meeting
                duties of their fiduciary role?
             The objective of this open discussion of the perception of an inner group on the
         board is not necessarily to do away with it. Indeed the board might well want to
         encourage it since they often do more than others are able to do. Instead, the goal
         is to work on ways to keep them open and communicating with all board members
         and discourage "backstage" maneuvering. One of the best ways to prevent negative
         sub-groups from developing is to conduct regular exercises in team building for
         the board. The more the board as a whole thinks of itself as a team, the more sub-
         groups within it are likely to be positive, open and sharing.

       · In a similar way, the use of outside consultants may yield insights into the workings
         of the board that the board has been unable to see for itself.

       · One advantage to having, and enforcing, by-laws that specify fixed terms of office
         for board members is that there will always be new members joining at regular in-
         tervals. Usually new members are expected to adopt social norms or go along with
         the ways of operating the board has followed in the past. However, if a conscious
         effort is made to ask new board members to provide critical feedback on their
         perceptions of how the board is working, a surfacing process might take place and
         needed changes in board culture might be made. However, if a board does engage
         new members in a change process, it must be open to new information and careful
         not to be critical of those who are honestly trying to share their perceptions in a
         constructive way.

       · Finally, it is difficult to over emphasize the importance of the Board Chair and the
         organization's CEO in creating and changing the unspoken culture of the board.
         Their leadership styles often set the tone for the way in which the board exercises
         its collective leadership of the organization. To learn more about the competencies
         of highly effective chairs, boards, CEOs, and leadership volunteers, see the next
         chapter on leadership.

    Leadership on the Board

Symptoms

Most literature on the leadership function of nonprofit organization boards concentrates
on the role of the board as a whole. This emphasis is because, legally speaking, it is the final
authority for the organization--even though it may delegate some of its authority to a
CEO. Similarly, it recognizes that no one board member may legally act as a representative
of the entire board on a given matter unless given authority to do so by the Board itself.

    Just as in other work groups, however, boards have both formal and informal individual
leaders within them--people who have a significant influence over how the group works
and how effective it is. For example, as previously discussed, some boards develop influential
core groups within them and they can be a positive or negative force for change

    While these kinds of informal leaders and groups are important to identify, it is gener-
ally agreed that the most influential leaders in nonprofit organizations are the board chair
and the CEO. In many small voluntary organizations with no paid staff, the board chair
and CEO may be the same person (though it should be noted that it is illegal for charities
in some jurisdictions such as New York, to have Chair/CEO leadership roles held by the
same person).

    A high percentage of agreement with the following statements might indicate prob-
lems with leadership of the board:
 There is a kind of "inner group" that seems to run things on the board and those

    who are not part of it sometimes feel left out.
 The board chair tends to be overly controlling.
 The board chair seems to have her/his own "agenda," which is not always shared

    by others.
 The board chair is a bit too passive and/or disorganized in her/his leadership

    style.
 The board chair's meeting leadership skills are not as strong as they could be.
 As far as I know, the board chair is reluctant to speak to board members who

    don't carry out their responsibilities properly.

                                  Leadership on the Board|63
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

 As far as I know, the relationship between the CEO and the board chair is quite
    formal; they don't talk much "off the record."

 As far as I know the CEO rarely consults individual board members for informal
    advice or assistance.

 There seems to be a lack of trust between the CEO and the board.

 The information that the CEO provides the board to help it make decisions is
    sometimes inadequate or too slanted.

 The CEO seems to be trying to dominate or control the board too much.

Diagnosis

    It is important to realize when respondents check the statements dealing with leader-
ship that they are providing their perceptions only, not an "objective" reality. Also, it must
be remembered that the reasons people are perceived as being more or less effective leaders
may, or may not, lie within the leaders themselves. In other words, it is possible that situ-
ations and circumstances may create conditions that make it difficult for almost anyone in
a leadership position to be perceived as effective. It is also possible that a person in such a
position might be very effective under one set of circumstances but not in another. The case
of Winston Churchill is often presented as the most vivid example of this--a universally
acclaimed leader during WWII who was defeated in the polls once peace was restored after
the war. Times changed and he was no longer seen as the leader people wanted.

    With respect to reasons for perceptions of leader ineffectiveness, our research suggests
there are five major ones:

      1. Lack of role clarity. In our research on board chairs, we found a significant positive
         relationship between clarity of key actor roles and perception of chair leadership
         effectiveness.

      2. Situational factors. For example, in our research, we found evidence of a negative
         relationship between CEO turnover and perception of chair leadership effec-
         tiveness and impact. This finding suggests that stability in CEO tenure may be
         associated with being seen to be effective.

      3. The board's own prior ineffectiveness--its failure to adopt "good governance
         practices" is associated with perceptions of poor leadership. Our research and
         that of others (e.g., Ostrower, 2007) points to a significant positive relationship
         between the reported use of good governance practices (e.g., strategic planning,
         board performance assessment, assessment of CEO leadership and organizational
         effectiveness, etc.), and perceived leadership effectiveness. Because all of this re-
         search was based on one-point-in-time correlational methodologies, however, it
         is not possible to say whether the presence of good governance practices makes it
         more likely that leaders will be seen as effective, or whether leaders who are seen
         as effective are more likely to use their influence to help their boards adopt good
         governance practices.

      4. The personality traits leaders bring to their position. In our research it was found
         that chairs who were perceived as being honest, humble and helpful were also more

                                  Leadership on the Board|64
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

         likely to be seen as having more impact on the performance of the board, the CEO
         and the organization. The same relationship was found between perceived chair
         effectiveness and perceptions of chair's "emotional intelligence" (i.e., as someone
         who is self-aware and able to manage others in relationships) and in possession of
         the traits associated with team leadership (being open, fair, respectful, able to create
         a safe climate where issues can be discussed, one who recognizes others, and does
         not distract them from goals, etc.). The findings of this research are supported by
         general leadership studies that show leader personality to be a strong influence on
         leader effectiveness (see Miller & Droge, 1996).
      5. The involvement of followers with leaders. Our research on board chairs found that
         when members of a group spend more time with the leader and have more interac-
         tion with her/him, they are more likely to see the leader as effective. This could be
         due to the nature of the role they play. (For example, the CEO, board officers and
         committee chairs are more likely to interact frequently with the Chair than "ordi-
         nary" board members, staff or external stakeholders). This explanation assumes that
         the "closer" people get to their leaders, the more likely they are to think favorably
         of them. These results suggest that leaders will benefit from spending time building
         high quality relationships with others.
    Whatever the reason, leadership ineffectiveness can be costly for the board and or-
ganization that fails to address it. Cost can be seen in board and CEO turnover, level
of engagement, job dissatisfaction, low social cohesion, poor board morale, lack of public
trust, inability to innovate, etc. For a full discussion of the informal leadership that may be
exerted by "core groups" within the board, see Chapter 8 on Board Culture.

Treatment

    The results obtained from this section of the Board Check-Up are the most sensitive
and potentially difficult to handle of any. Most people, when asked if they would like to
have their job performance reviewed, tend to say they welcome feedback on how they are
doing so they can use it to improve. In practice, however, many do not appreciate being
what they see as "unfairly criticized" no matter how much effort is made to make it "con-
structive" criticism. Varying degrees of defensiveness and hostility are common reactions
even though they may not be made obvious at the time. In one early experience with the
Board Performance Self-Assessment instrument, for example, an instance arose in which
a third of respondents indicated that they thought the board chair had difficulties running
effective meetings. The board chair said nothing at the time but within a month quietly
resigned, well before her term was up. One might argue that this was all for the best but this
overlooks the possibility that, if these results had been handled differently, she might have
reacted differently and, for example, obtained some training in meeting leadership.

    The following are suggestions for dealing with perceptions of leadership issues:
       · It is best if, before the results of the survey are revealed to anyone, the Survey Co-
         ordinator hold a discussion with both the CEO and the Chair about a hypothetical
         situation in which some board members report perceptions that these leaders are
         engaged in one or more of the problematic situations described in this section of
         the survey. This discussion should cover to whom these results should be com-
         municated and how they should be interpreted.

                                  Leadership on the Board|65
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

       · It is recommended that, at first, results should be communicated only to the person
         involved, e.g., the Chair or the CEO. It should also be agreed that there are various
         possible reasons for such results as described above, which should be explored and
         that they do not necessarily mean that the board is dissatisfied with the leader. It
         could be that there is a situation that the board needs to address that negatively
         impacts the leadership of the chair or CEO.

       · Finally, it should be understood that all the behaviors described in this section
         could be addressed through additional training and/or coaching. It is quite possible
         that a different style of leadership is new to many leaders. Also, it is not always
         possible for Chairs or CEOs to find the time or opportunity to take leadership
         development courses. What is more possible, in many cases, is to find effective
         experienced leaders of boards who are willing to act as mentors or coaches to the
         Chair or CEO for short periods of time. Retaking the Board Check-Up after a
         period of such coaching can provide useful indicators of the extent to which leader-
         ship from these critical officers has improved and to what extent agreed upon goals
         have been reached.

Leadership Development

    The preceding discussion addresses how to help key leaders such as the Board Chair
and CEO develop their leadership competency but it does not get into detail about what
these competencies should be. There is not the space here to get into this very large and
complex topic, however, a few key points can be made. Perhaps the most important is
that there is no "one best way" to lead in all situations. Different mixes of board member
personalities and different external conditions call for differing approaches to leading. The
key question the board should consider is how can nonprofit leadership be managed for higher
board performance?

    The majority of the items in the list of board leadership issues above relate to the
leadership competencies of effective chairs and CEOs. Other items relate to leadership in-
fluence and impact. For example, our research has shown that board chairs seen as exerting
too little or too much influence in the role are also seen as having limited impact on the
board, the CEO, the organization, and the support of external stakeholders.

    This research identified the following behaviors of highly effective chairs. Organized
in clusters, they are:

       · Motivation and style (e.g., is helpful, has a sense of humor, is empowering, friendly
         and humble).

       · Capacity to lead (e.g., is committed to the organization, devoted in terms of time
         given to it, capable of seeing the big picture, able to handle contentious issues, and
         collaborative).

       · Personal attributes (e.g., is bright/intelligent, trustworthy, confident, thoughtful,
         organized, focused, and creative).

       · Ability to relate(e.g., is flexible, easy going, non-judgmental and calm).
       · Ability to advance the organization externally. (e.g., possesses connections and in-

         fluence with key people and is willing to use them (see Harrison & Murray, 2012;
         Harrison, Murray, & Cornforth, 2013).
    Herman and Heimovics (2005) identified the following competencies of "board cen-
tered" CEOs. They are:
       · Facilitate interaction in board relationships;

                                  Leadership on the Board|66
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

       · Show consideration and respect toward board members;
       · Envision change and innovation for the organization with the board;
       · Provide useful and helpful information for the board; and
       · Promote board accomplishments and productivity.
    The National Learning Initiative (2003) also identified competencies of effective lead-
ership volunteers saying they:
       · Are motivated to serve (e.g., recruited for the right reasons, empowered for the

         service of mission/others)
       · Create, shared vision, and align strategically (e.g., are informed, consider best prac-

         tices, contribute to the development of. and commitment to. a shared vision that
         provides meaning and direction)
       · Develop effective relationships (e.g., nurture a healthy organization and work envi-
         ronment, are socially aware and maintain effective relationships)
       · Create value (e.g., open to innovation, creativity, and change; translate theories into
         action; are responsive and accountable)
    One of the better ways to design the kind of leadership that is best for your organiza-
tion is that offered by the Competing Values Approach to leadership effectiveness (see
Quinn et al., Becoming a Master Manager: A Competing Values Approach, 5th edition, for a
description of the leadership competencies, and assessment tools that can be used to assess
leadership effectiveness). The Competing Values Approach to assessing and developing
leadership competency recognizes there are different values that underlie leadership styles
(e.g., the tendency to focus on people, strategic goals, management processes, innovation
and changes in the external environment etc.) and that these values can create tensions
between leaders involved in the governance process. They have created a set of diagnostic
criteria to assess leadership effectiveness and surface tensions in the leadership process.
To develop leadership, they say leaders simply need enough information to adjust their
behavior rather than to alter it altogether. This "balanced" approach to leadership develop-
ment, which recognizes there are competing values and leadership styles, should reduce
tensions and the tendency for organizations to swing from one ineffective leader to another.
    Regardless of the approach or tool used, leadership development is an opportunity for
nonprofit boards to:
       · Assess leadership competency and isolate the contributions nonprofit leaders make
         to the board and organization through the governance process.
       · Discuss tensions that exist between leaders and groups in the governance process.
         Nonprofit leaders should also discuss how to develop leadership competency and
         overcome situations in cases where leadership effectiveness is challenged (e.g.,
         crisis, board chair or CEO turnover, etc.).
       · Develop a focused plan for nonprofit leadership development that will be reviewed
         as part of the board performance assessment process.
       · Increase responsibility of leaders in the governance process (e.g., from board
         member with no committee responsibilities, to committee member, officer and
         ultimately, chair of the board).
       · Recognize leaders for their leadership contributions to the board and organization.
    Table 11 contains additional useful information and resources to increase the gover-
nance effectiveness of the organization through leadership.

             Conclusion

The purpose of this guidebook has been to a) help you understand some of the issues that
challenge the effectiveness of nonprofit boards, b) offer some explanations as to why they
exist, and c) provide guidance on how to manage them so as to improve the effectiveness of
the governance function.

    The book, and the Board Check-Up research project of which it is a part, is derived
from the idea of health checkups in medicine. The social science that underlies the research
is that of the theory of organizational change. Simply put, by surfacing issues (symptoms)
in the governance process, the stage is set for potential change in governance practices
(treatment). However, as anyone involved in nonprofit organizations and governance
knows, making change is easier said than done. In fact, our early research results that track
the impact of Board Check-Up show that, while the majority of boards do report making
changes in governance practices in each of the dimensions assessed in the Board Check-
Up not all boards do so and some kinds of changes are made more often than others (e.g.,
issues related to board meetings are made more frequent than changes in board culture
and leadership) (see Harrison and Murray, forthcoming). For this reason, we recommend
boards take the Board Check-Up on a regular basis and use it as an opportunity to delve
deeper into discussions of the symptoms and why they exist in the board (diagnoses), and
what can be done about them (treatment). Results from our research of the change process
show the Board Check-Up fills gaps in board leadership and technical capacity to self-
assess performance (Harrison, 2014).

    In addition to providing a model, theory and online tool for deciding change, we've
also provided links to additional resources that may be useful when deciding what practices
need to change. While resources are organized by country, many provide useful guidance
and tools that apply across countries. By no means do we provide an exhaustive review of
the websites and literature on governance effectiveness in this book. Please consider ad-
ditional sources and adopt those that seem to be a good fit for your board and organization.

Where Do You Go from Here?

    The final section of these Guidelines is directed primarily at those who are using them
to self-assess board performance as part of an organization registered to take the Board
Check-Up at www.boardcheckup.com or who are part of a course on nonprofit governance
of which the Board Check-Up is a learning activity. It describes ways in which the results

                                         Conclusion|69
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

of the Board Check-Up can be used to promote dialogue and decisions regarding needed
changes in governance practices.

    The results of the Board Check-Up will give you some ideas about possible difficulties
that could be keeping your board from performing at its best. How these results are used
will determine how valuable they might be in helping to make changes that will make the
governance function of your organization more effective. Here are some suggestions for
getting the most from the self-assessment process.

      1. As a general rule, it is desirable to take action on the results of the questionnaire as
         quickly as possible after it is completed, while the process is still fresh in everyone's
         minds. If possible, create a small "Board Self-Assessment Implementation Task
         Force" to take the lead in this final phase. Alternatively, an existing board com-
         mittee such as a Governance or Executive Committee could take on this job.

      2. This committee should choose a chair--possibly the person who acted as Board
         Check-Up Coordinator.

      3. It should review the findings and discuss the best way to present them to the board
         as a whole.

      4. A special board meeting, or retreat, should be organized to review the findings. If
         possible, all those who were originally asked to participate should be invited, e.g.,
         in addition to board members, ask top managers, senior volunteers, etc.

      5. The special board meeting or retreat should proceed as follows:

         A. The Chair of the meeting should begin by reviewing the reasons for engaging
             in this self-assessment exercise and go on to make the following points:
             · The discussion should not take the form of blaming anyone for any of the
                issues identified.
             · It is possible that some problems, on further discussion, will be found to be
                simply the result of lack of knowledge or experience on the part of some
                participants. These can be corrected by better communications.
             · When there is a strong consensus that certain issues are real problems it is
                important not to jump to conclusions about why they exist or what should
                be done about them. Instead, they should be carefully analyzed. We therefore
                recommend that this special board meeting not be used to make decisions
                but only to seek consensus on issues and identify possible solutions. The Task
                Force would promise to take this input and return later with well-thought-
                out formal recommendations for change, if needed.

         B. Discuss the significance of the results obtained in each of the topic areas cov-
             ered in this Final Report.
             · Response rate
             · Percentage of "Not Sure"
             · Total score
             · The 10 things we do best
             · The 10 issues that might be the most challenging
             · Results for each of the nine distinct elements of board effectiveness

         C. If the group is large enough, consider breaking into smaller groups to discuss
             the following questions, otherwise pose them in a plenary format:
             · What are the issues that most need working on in terms of importance and
                immediacy?

                                         Conclusion|70
Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations

             · For each of the top priority issues, why do they exist? (The meeting should be
                reminded that the reasons might not always be simple. For example, if there
                is strong agreement that board meetings are too long, this could be for many
                reasons: a failure to establish and enforce time limits for agenda items, board
                members being unprepared, poorly prepared committee reports, too much
                time spent on routine leaving important policy issues until late in the meeting,
                etc.)

             · What positive, future-oriented changes might be made to end the problems?
      6. The Implementation Task Force should take the input provided at the special board

         meeting and use it to prepare a series of recommendations for change along with
         supporting arguments for them. These would be brought to a formal meeting of the
         board for discussion and approval.
      7. Finally, responsibility for tracking the outcomes of these changes should be al-
         located to a person or committee who will report at the end of a year on the degree
         of improvement in the governance process. This should signal the beginning of a
         process of board self-evaluation that occurs every year.
    Continuing and long-lasting effectiveness in governance practices are best achieved
if the board commits itself to assessing its performance on a regular and long-term basis.
Here are three options for you follow to ensure this kind of long term success:

1. Be part of cutting-edge research

    This guidebook is part of a larger research study of nonprofit board effectiveness. Par-
ticipants gain access to free online tools and resources produced from the research on the
state of nonprofit board effectiveness in nonprofit organizations around the world. If you
have taken the Board Check-Up online (www.boardcheckup.com), then you are a partici-
pant in this research. If you haven't, then consider registering for the University at Albany,
SUNY sponsored research project online through the website or contact Professor Yvonne
Harrison yharrison@albany.edu for more information.

2. Take an interactive nonprofit governance course for free or
credit

    In January 2015, Professor Harrison opens her University at Albany, SUNY Nonprofit
Governance course to the public as part of the Open SUNY strategy to increase access to
education through online learning. Coursera's online teaching platform hosts the course
and interactive instructional strategies are incorporated to teach course concepts, which
include main concepts in this and other nonprofit governance books. Through the course
learning activities, participants receive guided instruction on board performance assess-
ment. Along with faculty and specialized educational technology support, peer learning
groups support and evaluate teaching and learning in the online environment.

3. Join a peer learning group to develop and help grow your
board and the field of nonprofit leadership

    Participants in the Board Check-Up research and Nonprofit Governance course will
be invited to join various nonprofit leadership peer learning groups on topics of importance
to participants. These groups will be facilitated by faculty, nonprofit leaders, and students in
the University at Albany and SUNY Open community.
