This open-access textbook was first released in the 2022

Autumn semester at Western Sydney University. Since then

it has been the recommended text for business students at

WSU Online, WSU Sydney City Campus, and the University

of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We welcome any

suggestions  for              improvements  at:

a.khan@westernsydney.edu.au.

   In line with developments in the field, and feedback received
from students and academics the second edition has several
modifications:

 This is now a multi-authored book as the entire teaching
   team helped in putting together the second edition

 We adopted the `students as partners' philosophy. Our
   student partners have contributed to the content of the
   book. They have also provided us with valuable
   feedback, which helped us in undertaking revisions

 This edition includes `new' content that the authors feel
   is critical for all professionals to be familiar with.
   Additional chapters include `Use of census data' and
   `Aboriginal research methods' which have traditionally
   not been part of marketing research

 With its groundbreaking launch on November 30, 2022,

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
OF COUNTRY

Acknowledgment of the
traditional owners of
Western Sydney University
land

Western Sydney University acknowledges the custodians of the
lands in which we meet, work, learn, and socialise. We pay
respect to the peoples of the Darug, Tharawal, Eora, and
Wiradjuri nations where our campuses are located. We
acknowledge that the teaching, learning, and research
undertaken across our campuses continue the teaching,
learning, and research that has occurred on these lands for tens
of thousands of years. We acknowledge and pay our respect to
the Elders past, present, and emerging.

Source: `Matta: Meeting place' by Jason and Trevor Dalmarri
   Co-created by the team of WSU School of Business,

Parramatta, this artwork represents the lands and communities
upon which the Parramatta City campus is built. The word
Parramatta comes from the Aboriginal word `Baramada or
Burramatta'. The Burramatta people (Burra meaning place
and Matta meaning the eels) belong to the Dhurug people,
who lived in this food-rich area before the time of the white
invasion.
                                    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY | 11

   The story to this artwork is the land you work on today,
showing the diversity of the area and paying respects to the
past.

   The "Matta" roamed along these rivers and grew large along
the banks of the Burramatta river and in abundance. The green
and blue waterways run through the artwork as they moved
ever so gracefully up and down the inlets. The artwork shows
the bubbles, the current, and the plentiful fish running
through what today is known as Parramatta. The shoreline
depicts the edge of the land as the waters head out to Sydney
Harbour and the ocean.

   The colourful sections represent all the towns surrounding
Burramatta. inside those towns are circles belonging to
multicultural families now living on Dhurug country. The dot
lines and tracks were once walking lines of the Dhurug people,
now turned into roads, routes, and railway lines.

   These lands occupy the growth of the town now called
Parramatta in honour of the first Australians. Western Sydney
University acknowledges the Dhurug nation as the traditional
owners of the lands we work and live on today.

     Learning objectives
16 | DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKETING RESEARCH AND
CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:

           recognise the emergence of the concept of
             customer insights over the years

           understand the key differences between
             marketing research and customer insights

           identify existing forms of data for analysis.

The emergence of customer
insights

Traditionally, marketers have used tools such as surveys,
interviews, and focus groups to undertake marketing research.
While these tools are still very important, they have some
inherent limitations. For a start, to get good quality data from
these tools a key assumption is that respondents will accurately
respond to research questions. In many cases, these
respondents are expected to recall a previous experience and
report on it. In other situations, customers are presented with
scenarios and asked to predict the likelihood of them
undertaking a certain behaviour (e.g., purchase). Therefore,
the key to good quality data depends on respondents'
    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKETING RESEARCH AND CUSTOMER
                                                                             INSIGHTS | 17

  engagement with, ability, and willingness to provide all
  necessary information.

     Another limitation of the traditional marketing research
  methods is the bias that can creep in as per the wording or
  presentation of a question. It is well-known that responses to
  a question can vary depending on who is asking the question,
  how it is being asked, and perhaps, even the time when it
  is asked. Moreover, survey questions are pre-determined and
  offer little flexibility to bring in new ideas. Respondents are
  usually restricted in the way they can respond. Similarly,
  generating good data in an interview usually requires a good
  rapport between the interviewer and the participant. Not all
  researchers are skilled in this area.

     Moreover, traditional data collection methods - such as
  surveys and focus groups - require time for survey design,
  data collection, and analysis. Marketers require information
  immediately which is often not available while using such
  tools. There is also the possibility of `social desirability bias'
  creeping in. Respondents may have an unconscious bias to
  please the researcher, especially when the researcher is
  physically present. Such bias will affect the participant's
  responses1.

     Finally, marketing research methods are not inexpensive. It

  time, Harvard Business Review, <https://hbr.org/2012/09/better-customer-
  insight-in-real-time>.
18 | DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKETING RESEARCH AND
CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

takes resources - both money and expertise - to design a
survey, an interview, or a focus group. Many small and
medium-sized enterprises are usually not able to employ
traditional tools effectively to gather information.

   The current world is making use of digital technologies.
With the use of smart wallets, smartphones, smart appliances,
streaming services, and social media platforms instantaneous
information is being generated. This creates an ever-growing
repository of `Big Data' which - logically speaking - should
be mined to gain insights into consumer behaviour. While the
traditional marketing research methods are still useful, these
need to be supplemented by other forms of data which is being
created and stored on a regular basis.

   Many organisations have developed `Insights Teams' which
consist of staff members from a variety of backgrounds. As
opposed to a market research department, the task of the
Insights Team is to be able to `synthesise' the massive amounts
of data being generated. Team members play the role of
aggregators, interpreters, and disseminators. It is not sufficient
to only present `findings' to survey questions. As an Insights
specialist, the critical role is to be able to aggregate different
pieces of information, interpret the data by collaborating with
colleagues from other departments and be able to suggest key
action points for future growth.

Use of existing data to gain
insights

The concept behind `customer insights' is not to gather
information through traditional sources of data collection, but
to mine the existing sources which generate data continuously.
Some of these sources which may provide useful insights are
discussed below:

Internal sales data

Organisations have a wealth of internal data being collected in
various forms. Every time a transaction is made there is a record
generated. Analysis of such sales data, revenue per customer,
time, and place of sale may generate useful information for
making decisions.

Customer queries and
complaints

Every time a customer reaches out to make a query (or a
complaint), a piece of data is being created. Many companies
have learned that by analysing customers' queries and
complaints a wealth of information can be mined. This
includes analysing customers' chat transcripts or emails or
voice mails.

Website analytics

In today's online world, customer interest in a company's
offering can be judged by web traffic and interactions. Tapping
into relevant metrics may help to explain various aspects of
visitors' online behaviours (e.g., time spent on the website) as
well as their interest

Previous marketing research
data

While some managers may toss away old research as `obsolete',
it is quite possible that some of the findings could prove to be
useful. Qualitative data may hold some interesting insights and
quantitative data could be `sliced and diced' in a number of
ways.

Social media analytics

It is expected that there will be over 4 billion social media
users by the year 2025. This is more than half of the world's
population of 7.9 billion (2021). Ignoring social media is not
affordable. While many organisations aim to have some
presence on social media, small companies with a limited
budget are still recommended to monitor - at the very least -
conversations taking place on various social media platforms.
Online communities, though different from Facebook and
Instagram are also known to have discussions that could be
vital for managers to follow.

Wearable technologies and
smart devices

smartphones can store a wealth of information. Integrating
such data with other pieces of information collected is known
to be helpful to marketers.

Third-party sources of
information

Some information is shared by stakeholders across the
network, while other types of information may also be
available for sale. Getting consumer data, for instance from a
credit card company may assist a manager in gaining a useful
understanding of customers' purchases.

Employees

A company's own employees are generally the first point of
face-to-face contact with a customer. Employees can provide
firsthand information about the customer. There could be a
wealth of information already present within a company that
could be explored to better understand the customer.

Ethics is defined as the moral principles that govern a person's
behaviour, especially when this individual is a member of a
professional body. Ethics are based on an individual's choice
and are not governed by law. Legal matters involve the law,
and not adhering to them is punishable (e.g., drunk driving).
On the other hand, ethics are individuals' principles and values
such as, accurately presenting information to customers.
  28 | RESEARCH ETHICS

  While ethical beliefs are held by individuals, they can also be
  reflected in the values, practices, and policies that shape the
  choices made by decision-makers on behalf of their
  organizations. Professions and organizations regularly
  establish a "Code of Ethics" that serves to guide the behaviour
  of members of the profession or organization.1

     In Australia, The Research Society - the peak body for
  everyone involved or interested in the market, social, and
  opinion research - provides codes and guidelines regarding
  ethical conduct in research. All Research Society Members and
  Company and Client Partners must comply with the Code. It
  applies to the professional activities of Members and Partners.
  Company and Client Partner organizations are required to
  ensure that all individuals employed or engaged by them
  (whether Research Society Members or not) comply with this
  Code. The Research Society Code of Professional Behaviour
  (the Code) was introduced in 1955 and has been reviewed
  regularly since then. The Code is designed as a framework for
  self-regulation. Its aim is to foster public confidence in research
  and to demonstrate that activities carried out by Members are
  carried out in a professional and ethical manner.

 Code of Professional
 Behaviour in Research

  While industry associations have their set of codes and
  guidelines, any research undertaken at academic institutions
  involving human participants (or animals) has to obtain ethical
  clearance from the university's Ethics Committees. Academic
  institutions also expect their researchers to abide by a code
  of practice to ensure integrity and responsibility during the
  research process. Some of the highest standards of conduct are
  expected from researchers by Australian universities and the
  Research Society. The key points are discussed below. A full
  document is available on The Research Society 2 and National
  Health and Medical Research Council websites 3.

 Respect

  Respect for all research participants is a key value that
  researchers and their organisations need to abide by. This is

3. National Health and Medical Research Council, National statement on ethical

  conduct of research: (NHMRC manual):, 2018.
30 | RESEARCH ETHICS

discussed in the context of respect for participants' privacy,
confidentiality, and sensitivity around cultural matters. Any
agreements with research participants need to be fulfilled.

Rigour

When conducting their professional activities, researchers
must ensure that their work is carried out in accordance with
appropriate scientific research principles, methods, and
techniques. No doubt, this is a key requirement for all projects
seeking `ethical approval' at universities and research
institutions. Research must be carried out honestly, following
the recognised principles of research conduct. Research
findings - whether favourable or unfavourable - must be
communicated/disseminated - so they can contribute to
better knowledge and understanding.

Misleading information

Researchers must not make false or misleading statements
about their own or their organisation's skills, experience, or
activities. A researcher must not mislead participants when
                                                             RESEARCH ETHICS | 31

soliciting their assistance. It is acknowledged that all research
causes some levels of discomfort and inconvenience. For
instance, responding to lengthy surveys may result in
annoyance for some respondents. At no stage should the
researcher attempt to `hide' the actual time needed for research
participation. Similarly, some research questions may cause
participants anxiety or distress. This could relate to a medical
condition or religious views etc. Researchers need to be
mindful of how to manage such a `risk', even if they feel the
likelihood of it happening is very small.

Distinguishing research from
other activities

Any marketing activity aimed at individual participants, such
as sales promotion, direct marketing, direct selling, and similar
activities, must be clearly distinguished and separated from
research. At all stages of the research process ( proposal
development, data collection, analysis, and reporting) a
researcher must never engage in activities that aim to
manipulate, mislead, or coerce individuals.
32 | RESEARCH ETHICS

Consent and voluntary
participation

If the researchers intend to disclose identifiable research
information about participants, they must obtain consent.
Participants, for example, must be informed before
observation techniques or recording equipment are used for a
project. At all stages of a project, participants' participation is
entirely voluntary and a participant must be able to voluntarily
opt-out of providing information at any point during the data
collection process.

Disclosure of participants'
information

Researchers must inform participants at the start of the project
whether the project is anonymous or identifiable. If
anonymous, a participants' anonymity must be strictly
maintained. If identifiable, participants must be informed at
this stage of the purpose and the recipient of identifiable
research information, unless there are methodological reasons
not to do so at this point. Once the data has been collected,
researchers must inform participants of the purpose and
request that they reconfirm their consent for disclosure.
                                                             RESEARCH ETHICS | 33

Researchers must inform participants who will receive the
research information and for what purpose it will be used.

   Sugging and a related practice of frugging bring market
research into disrepute. Undertake the following activity to
guess what the two terms mean.

        insights/?p=29#h5p-17

Consideration for vulnerable
groups

At times information needs to be collected from specific
groups of people. Such groups may consist of people who are
pregnant, require constant medical care, or have a cognitive or
physical disability. On other occasions, researchers may need
to interview people who have been involved in illegal activities.
Due consideration needs to be given in the design and conduct
of research with such population segments. The well-being
34 | RESEARCH ETHICS

of both the participant and the researcher is of utmost
importance.

   When gathering information from children and young
people, researchers must exercise extreme caution. Before
gathering information, a parent or responsible adult's
permission must be obtained. Moreover, the child or young
person's safety, emotional and psychological security should be
assured.

   In some situations, a person can be in an unequal or
dependent relationship (e.g., an employee of an organisation
being asked to participate in a study by his employer) and
may feel coerced into participating in a research study. The
researcher would need to consider all such situations and take
steps to minimise the detrimental effect of such a situation on
the study as well as on the participants' relationships.

Data storage and security

Researchers must ensure the security of all project-related
information. Researchers must take reasonable precautions to
safeguard identifiable research data. Identifiable research data
collected and stored in accordance with this Code must be
kept for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which
the data was collected or further processed. When identifiable

research information is no longer required, reasonable steps
must be taken to destroy it or ensure that it is de-identified.

        insights/?p=31#oembed-1

What is secondary research?

In situations where the researcher has not been involved in the
data-gathering process (primary research), one may have to rely
on existing information and data to arrive at specific research
conclusions or outcomes. Secondary research, also known as
desk research, is a research method that involves the use of
information previously collected for another research purpose.

   In this chapter, we are going to explain what secondary
research is, how it works, and share some examples of it in
practice.
38 | SECONDARY RESEARCH

Sources of secondary data

The two main sources of secondary data are:

   Internal sources
   External sources

Internal sources of secondary data exist within the
organisation. There could be reports, previous research
findings, or old documents which may still be used to
understand a particular phenomenon. This information may
only be available to the organisation's members and could be a
valuable asset.

   External sources of secondary data lie outside the
organisation and refer to information held at the public
library, government departments, council offices, various
associations as well as in newspapers or journal articles.

Benefits of using secondary data

It is only logical for researchers to look for secondary
information thoroughly before investing their time and
resources in collecting primary data. In academic research,
scholars are not permitted to move to the next stage till they
demonstrate they have undertaken a review of all previous
                                                     SECONDARY RESEARCH | 39

studies. Suppose a researcher would like to examine the
characteristics of a migrant population in the Western Sydney
region. The following pieces of information are already
available in various reports generated from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics' census data:

   Birthplace of residents
   Language spoken at home by residents
   Family size
   Income levels
   Level of education

By accessing such readily available secondary data, the
researcher is able to save time, money, and effort. When the
data comes from a reputable source, it further adds to the
researchers' credibility of identifying a trustworthy source of
information.

Evaluation of secondary data

Assessing secondary data is important. It may not always be
available free of cost. The following factors must be considered
  40 | SECONDARY RESEARCH

  as these relate to the reliability and validity of research results,
  such as whether1:

      the source is trusted
      the sample characteristics, time of collection, and

        response rate (if relevant) of the data are appropriate
      the methods of data collection are appropriate and

        acceptable in your discipline
      the data were collected in a consistent way
      any data coding or modification is appropriate and

        sufficient
      the documentation of the original study in which the

        data were collected is detailed enough for you to assess its
        quality
      there is enough information in the metadata or data to
        properly cite the original source.

  In addition to the above-mentioned points, some practical
  issues which need to be evaluated include the cost of accessing
  and the time frame involved in getting access to the data is
  relevant.

Introduction

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is Australia's central
agency responsible for designing, conducting, storing, and
44 | USE OF CENSUS DATA

tabulating information relating to the national census. It is the
most comprehensive source of data on all aspects of Australian
life, including population, economy, environment, and
industry.

   Census data can be accessed using a few Census data tools,
including QuickStats. QuickStats is a simple way to
understand an area at a glance. The tool provides a summary
of an area including demographics and tables on key
characteristics of the people living in the area, their families,
and their dwellings. Here is a quick overview of the Australian
population: https://abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/
quickstats/2021/AUS

Accessing QuickStats

   QuickStats is useful to access customised information about
people living in Australia. There are three types of information
available via QuickStats:

   All persons
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
   Country of Birth

PRIMARY RESEARCH

          Learning Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:
           define primary research and identify the
             different methods for primary data collection
           explain the pros and cons of different
             (primary) data collection methods
           realise the advantages and disadvantages of
             primary research
           understand the key differences between
             primary and secondary research.
  52 | PRIMARY RESEARCH

 What is primary research?

  Primary data refers to information that is collected by the
  researcher specifically for the project at hand. This method is
  useful when simply relying on secondary data is not sufficient.
  Some research questions - such as, what do consumers think
  of our new brand of soft drink? - require first hand collection
  of primary data. While it can take time and resources to collect
  good, rigorous primary data, the benefit is that the data
  belongs to the researcher or his/her organisation.

     Given below are some of the key tools used to collect
  primary data. It should be noted that primary data can be both
  quantitative as well qualitative information.1

1. Qualtrics, Everything you need to know about primary research, 2022.
            PRIMARY RESEARCH | 53

Interviews

   Interviews involve one-on-one sessions, either on phone or
in a face-to-face context between the researcher and the
interview participant. As a result of COVID-19, a lot of
interviews were moved online and were carried out on
different meeting platforms such as Zoom. Interviews are great
for exploring a topic more deeply. For example, a researcher
may wish to understand people's motivations behind making a
charitable donation to a particular organisation. A one-on-one
approach is far more effective in probing and understanding
the reasons behind such an action. Interviews are also useful
when one talks to experts. An expert in an area, such as a
supply chain can provide useful insights into a problem. With
their previous experience, such experts can be a useful addition
to a researcher's list of interviewees. A drawback of interviews
54 | PRIMARY RESEARCH

is the time spent interviewing different people. It can also
become expensive and tedious, especially if interviewees are
geographically spread out.

Surveys

Surveys or questionnaires are structured tools to collect
quantitative data. Surveys can be conducted either face to face
(for example in a supermarket) or these can also be undertaken
on phone. Many surveys are disseminated via email. In other
cases, specific individuals (such as employees of an
organisation) will be invited to participate in a survey hosted
on a specific website. Generally speaking, surveys will be
completed by a large number of people so the results can be
statistically significant. While surveys can be used to collect
textual data, many people do not provide detailed information
in writing. Thus, surveys should be used for closed-ended
questions (e.g., "do you own a car", "when did you last purchase
a fridge" or "on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not at all likely
and 5 is highly likely, what is the likelihood of you purchasing a
new smartphone this year?"). Surveys need to be well-designed
so useful information can be collected. They are not flexible,
so all relevant questions need to be inserted before the
commencement of the research project.
              PRIMARY RESEARCH | 55

Observations

Observational research requires no interaction between the
researcher and the subject. Qualitative and quantitative
information is collected on the basis of making a systematic
observation and documenting it. While such an approach
reduces the chance of researcher's bias, it is also limited in
not providing an explanation for actions undertaken by an
individual. For instance, while a retail store manager - with the
help of in-store cameras - can see how customers shop in the
aisles but he or she may not be able to get an explanation for
this behaviour. Similarly, mystery shoppers who are disguised
as shoppers and are used by supermarkets such as Coles to
evaluate their own service also carry out observational research.

Focus groups

Focus groups are effective at generating a significant amount
of information in a limited time. Focus groups are particularly
useful when a discussion amongst participants may lead to
new ideas or solutions. This primary research method requires
the expertise of a good facilitator who can skillfully get all
group members to participate. While these are a favourite with
some practitioners, care needs to be taken while running a
56 | PRIMARY RESEARCH

focus group. Some people may not participate at all or may
respond in a particular way to fit in with the majority.

Smart devices

A consumer in the year 2022 uses a range of smart devices such
as a smartphone, wearable technologies, smart appliances such
as fridges and televisions. Since these devices are connected to
the internet, not only do they create data but also store, process
and transmit this information. While there can be many ethical
questions around what kind of data is being accessed by
whom, the fact is that this information can be useful to many
businesses.

Social media data: secondary
or primary?

This is a point often discussed in the research community.
Should data from social media be classified as secondary or
primary? It depends on how data on social media is being
retrieved. If a social media platform such as Twitter is being
used to collect all those tweets with a hashtagged brand (e.g.,
#Nike) then it must be considered as primary data. This
primary data is being collected - firsthand - by the researcher
for a specific purpose. Some people may argue that the
researcher did not actively seek tweets from account holders.
Yet, such a dataset is primary in nature as no one else has
compiled this information (with #Nike) for a specific research
objective. However, if the same researcher makes use of a
report on social media analytics or downloads a report posted
on Twitter (e.g., an article on the use of Twitter by
20-something-year-olds), such information may be classified as
being `secondary'.

             research questions
           recognize limitations of qualitative and

One of the main categories used to classify information is
whether it is quantitative or qualitative. In many situations,
researchers combine the two methods to arrive at `mixed-
methods research'. In the discussion below, we look at the
differences between the two types of data and the situations in
which these two types of data can be usefully sourced.

What is qualitative data?

Qualitative data involves a descriptive judgment using concept
words instead of numbers. Gender, country name, animal
species, emotional state, feelings, and opinions are examples of
qualitative information.

What is quantitative data?

Quantitative data involves a measurable quantity, that is
numbers are used. Some examples are temperature, time, the
amount spent, number of units bought and hours spent on
the computer.

research

Which type of data to
collect?

Generally, the choice of data is directly linked to the research
                         QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH | 63

question being investigated. Below are some general guidelines
on the kind of information produced with the help of different
methods:

   Qualitative research: is mostly used to understand a
phenomenon, such as customers' experiences at a retail outlet.
For example, a researcher may choose to interview a number
of shoppers by asking them open text questions, e.g. "Did
you face any problems in this store today?" or "Did you enjoy
shopping here?" Such questions may encourage customers to
chat freely and highlight any issues (e.g., parking issues, rude
employees, or poor ventilation) which at times cannot be
identified through a quantitative survey alone.

   Quantitative research: is useful in estimating overall
frequencies or numbers. For example, how many people
visited the restaurant this evening? It is also used to test or
confirm a hypothesis - that is, a manager's educated guess. For
example, a teacher may survey his class, asking them, "On a
scale of 1-5, how bored are you in this class? (with 1 = not
at all bored and 5 = very bored)" By analysing the numerical
responses, the teacher may conclude that his guess is accurate
about student boredom as the average class score is 4.5.

   Mixed method: as the name suggests makes use of both
qualitative and quantitative research. A researcher may use
qualitative research to better understand a phenomenon, and
then use quantitative research to statistically test it. For
64 | QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH

instance, while interviewing customers a manager may find
that some of them are complaining about parking issues. In
order to understand how widespread this complaint is the
manager may initiate a quick, short survey to find out how
many customers require parking at the store's premises.

   Alternatively, a researcher may stumble upon an unexpected
finding via a survey (such as very low scores for customer
service in a Sydney store). Interviews can be conducted to find
out the reason for customer dissatisfaction. The store manager
may find it useful to initiate conversations with customers to
better understand the poor scores.

Limitations of qualitative
research

   Subjectivity: Qualitative data is written or spoken and
      requires careful interpretation. In some situations, the
      researcher may not be familiar with the participants'
      language. Analysing the data may require time and help
      from someone who is from the community and fluent at
      conversing in the relevant language. Even when language
      is not an issue, interpretation of textual content can be
      done differently by different researchers.

   A smaller number of participants: Interviews and
      focus groups can only be conducted with a smaller
                         QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH | 65

      group of participants. While surveys can be sent out and
      completed by hundreds (or thousands) of people, it is
      simply not possible to undertake interviews with the
      same number of informants. Thus, any findings from
      qualitative research need to be generalized with care.
   Bias: The researcher or analyst plays a much bigger role
      in the interpretation of qualitative information than
      simply running a statistical test. At times, the interviewee
      may make a very important point but mention it only
      once - and that too, casually. While it is easy for a novice
      researcher to completely miss such information, a more
      experienced researcher would make a note of it.

Limitations of quantitative
research

   Large sample size: In order for quantitative research to
      be statistically valid, a large number of respondents must
      be included in the survey. While there is no exact figure
      which is seen as being accurate, the larger the sample size
      the greater would be the confidence in the findings. This
      requires a large number of resources in terms of skills at
      designing the research project, time, and money.

   Pre-determined questions: When a large survey has to
66 | QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH

      be undertaken, all questions in the survey need to be pre-
      determined. In case the researcher wants to include any
      additional questions, it is not possible to do it in a short
      period of time.

TYPES OF RESEARCH
DESIGN

     Learning objectives

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:
           explain the three types of research design
             used by marketers
           understand the application of these designs.

Research design

This chapter looks at the types of research designs that are
utilized by marketers. A research design is an overall plan or
structure for a research project. A research design will use
68 | TYPES OF RESEARCH DESIGN

different combinations of primary, secondary, qualitative, and
quantitative data. Depending on the overall research
questions, research designs in marketing may fall into one of
the following three categories:

   Exploratory research design
   Descriptive research design
   Causal research design (experiments)

An exploratory research design is more informal and
unstructured than the other two types of designs. Exploratory
design is used to explore a situation, especially when the
researcher is in unfamiliar territory. Most academic projects
begin with exploratory research when researchers undertake
desk research. Similarly, when marketers plan to venture into
new markets, such as India, it is advisable to employ an
exploratory research design. This could mean going through
case studies, accessing published reports (i.e., secondary data)
on the market, undertaking experience interviews with
experts, and conducting focus groups - if needed. Exploratory
design is useful in gaining background information and
deciding about future research approaches. It may generate
more questions, which need to be tackled with other research
designs.

        insights/?p=37#h5p-18

   As the name suggests, descriptive research design is
employed to describe the market or respondents'
characteristics. This type of research design generates
quantitative information. Therefore, such a design would
often involve surveys. Surveys are useful to measure the
descriptive numbers relating to respondents' age groups,
income levels, expenditure patterns, and even attitudes. This
can be done by employing relevant scales, such as, "On a scale
of 1-5, how satisfied were you with this organisation's
service?".

Physiological measurements, such as people's involuntary
responses (such as heart rate, skin changes, and eye movement)
to marketing stimuli, such as an advertisement may also be
categorised in descriptive research. While recording such
information requires special instruments, it is nevertheless a
70 | TYPES OF RESEARCH DESIGN

type of descriptive information that can be useful for
marketers.

                   An interactive H5P element has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=37#h5p-20

A descriptive research design could be either a cross-sectional
study that is undertaken at one point in time (such as in
March 2022) or a longitudinal study that is implemented with
the same respondents - repeatedly - over a given time period.
Thus, a longitudinal survey may be undertaken with WSU
students in April, May, and June to track student satisfaction
with a subject over a semester.

                   One or more interactive elements has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=37#oembed-1

Causal research design (also known as experimental research
design) examines cause-and-effect relationships. A well-
designed experiment is the best way of understanding how one
variable (e.g., advertisement) may influence another variable
(e.g., sale of a product). An experiment involves one or more
independent variables (for example, price level, and product
features) which are manipulated to determine how they may
impact one or more dependent variables (such as customer
preference or customer satisfaction). Independent variables
can be `manipulated' by the researcher while the dependent
variables are variables that get influenced due to changes in the
independent variables.

   Experiments can be categorised as field experiments or lab
experiments. When an experiment is conducted in a natural
setting - such as in a retail store - it is referred to as a
field experiment. On the other hand, experiments conducted
in a researcher's office or a university classroom are lab
72 | TYPES OF RESEARCH DESIGN

experiments. A lab experiment may be undertaken to measure
the impact of an ad on the subject's attitude.

                   An interactive H5P element has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=37#h5p-19

A field experiment is often seen as providing researchers with
reliable results as it is undertaken in the actual environment.
However, it is not easy to implement a field experiment. It is
difficult to control other factors - in the real environment -
which may also impact the final results. Moreover, running an
experiment requires expertise in the design of the experiment.
It may also require financial and time resources. As an example,
Mcdonald's may wish to see if a drop in the price of its
cheeseburger results in greater sales. The fast-food restaurant
may drop the price in one locality, such as Fairfield. It may
also tediously measure the sales around the time of a price
reduction. While interpreting the results, it would need to be
assured that any changes in sales figures can be attributed to
the price change - and not to other environmental factors such
as an increase in prices at Hungry Jacks or an overall increase
in customers due to a local football match. Thus, controlling
                                             TYPES OF RESEARCH DESIGN | 73

such extraneous variables - that is, all those variables besides
the identified independent variables which may also affect the
dependent variable.

Example

One of the popular experimental research designs is the
`Before-After' Testing design. As the name suggests, it
measures the dependent variable, before and after a change
in the independent variable. An example will help clarify the
concept:

   Experimental Group (R)          O1  X  O2
   Control Group
   Experimental Effect (E) =       O3     O4
O3)
                                   (O2 - O1 ) - (O4 -

   R = random allocation of subjects to experimental or
control group

   O = observation
   X = treatment or manipulation of the independent variable,
such as a change in price

Explanation of the above example:
74 | TYPES OF RESEARCH DESIGN

 1. Subjects or research participants are randomly allocated
      to one of the groups

 2. The experimental group is the one in which the
      independent variable (e.g., price) is manipulated (e.g.,
      reduced)

 3. The control group is not exposed to any changes in the
      independent variable

 4. Measurements (i.e., O) for the dependent variable (e.g.,
      sales) - for both groups - are taken before the change in
      price (X) - PRE-TEST

 5. Measurements (i..e., O) for the dependent variable are
      taken after the change in price - POST-TEST

 6. The difference between O2 and O1 demonstrates the
      change in the dependent variable due to the change in X
      (independent variable)

 7. The difference between O4 and O3 demonstrate any
      change in the dependent variable due to factors other
      than X

 8. Therefore, the difference between the two groups (O2 -
      O1 ) - (O4 - O3) demonstrates the true effect of the
      independent variable as it removes any influence of
      extraneous variables.

What is a Focus Group?

A focus group is a small-group discussion guided by a trained
facilitator. It is used to learn about participants' opinions on a
designated topic, and to guide future action.

Examples:

   A focus group of parents of preschoolers meets to
      discuss childcare needs. Parents share their views on local
      childcare programs, and on what could be done to
      improve them.

   A focus group of senior citizens meets at the new senior
      centre. What do they think of the programs being
      offered? What are their own suggestions and ideas?

   An agency wants to open a group home for
      developmentally disabled adults in a quiet residential
78 | FOCUS GROUPS

      area. It convenes a group of prospective neighbours.
      What are their concerns? Can this work?

How are focus groups
different from regular
groups?

A focus group is different from any general group in three
basic ways:

   the main difference is the group has a specific, focused
      discussion topic.

   the group has a trained leader or facilitator.
   the group's composition and the group discussion are

      carefully planned to create a nonthreatening
                                                                FOCUS GROUPS | 79

      environment in which people are free to talk openly.
      Members are actively encouraged to express their
      opinions.

Why are focus groups used?

Responses in a focus group are typically spoken, open-
ended, relatively broad, and qualitative. They have more
depth, nuance, and variety. Nonverbal communications and
group interactions can also be observed. Focus groups can
therefore get closer to what people are really thinking and
feeling, even though their responses may be harder to score on
a scale.

When should you use a focus
group?

   When you are considering the introduction of a new
      program or service.

   When you want to ask questions that can't easily be
      asked or answered on a written survey.

   When you want to supplement the knowledge you can
80 | FOCUS GROUPS

      gain from written surveys.
   When you know, or can find someone, who is an

      experienced and skilled group leader.
   When you have the time, knowledge, and resources to

      recruit a willing group of focus group participants.

The pros and cons of groups

One advantage of focus groups is the depth and complexity of
the response, as mentioned before. Group members can often
stimulate new thoughts for each other, which might not have
otherwise occurred. The researcher is able to collect a lot of
information from a group of people in a relatively short period
of time.

   There are some limitations to running focus groups. For
example, focus groups usually take more time per respondent
than individual surveys -- because recruiting a group and
organizing the session can take time. Some group members
might feel hesitant about speaking openly. The focus group
leader needs to be familiar with the dynamics of running focus
groups. Good focus group moderators can be expensive to
recruit. Very importantly, sensitive topics (e.g., religion or
individuals' sexuality or medical conditions) may not yield
good data if discussed via a focus group.

   Here is an example of a screening questionnaire:
                                                                FOCUS GROUPS | 81

        insights/?p=39#h5p-5

How do you run a focus
group?

Part A: Before you begin

The group's composition and the group discussion should
be carefully planned to create a non-threatening environment
so that participants feel free to talk openly and give honest
opinions.

State your goals

   "Why do I want to conduct a focus group?"
   "Why am I doing this?"
   "What do I hope to learn?"
82 | FOCUS GROUPS

Consider other methods

Are you planning to use other methods for learning about
opinions as well?

   In other words, so far: Think before you start, look before
you leap.

   If yes, which ones, and why?
   If not, is this the single best method to use to find out

      what you want?

Find a good leader/facilitator/
moderator

A good focus group facilitator will usually have the following
qualities:

   Has experience facilitating groups
   Knows something about the topic OR is willing to

      research the topic
   Will relate well to the focus group participants
   Will work together with you to give you the outcomes

      you want
                                                                FOCUS GROUPS | 83

Find a recorder and appoint an
observer

One has to make sure the discussion is documented/recorded.
Someone should be writing down what is said, in the same way
as taking minutes at a meeting. Arrange for this in advance.
Alternatively, you can audio-record, with the group's
permission. This will take more time -- to transcribe the
audio, and interpret the transcription- but you will have a
more complete, accurate, and permanent record. In some
sessions, it is useful to have both an observer as well as a
recording device.

Decide who should be invited i.e.,
focus group participants

Ideally, those invited should be a representative sample of those
whose opinions you are concerned about.

   Or suppose you are concerned about the opinions of Main
Street shopkeepers. Get a complete list. Select a representative
group, for example by size, type, or whether they have local or
outside ownership. You probably want to hear from all kinds
of businesses; so make sure you do.

   A screening questionnaire may assist a researcher in
ensuring that only those people are recruited who fulfill
inclusion criteria.
84 | FOCUS GROUPS

Decide about incentives

Should you offer an incentive for people to participate?
   Possibly people will come just because they want to help.

Or because they think they will meet other interesting people,
learn something, or just have fun. Maybe the novelty of the
experience itself will be a motivator. And maybe all these
reasons are true.

   But maybe those reasons aren't enough, and some other
incentive is called for. Money is one; sometimes focus group
members get paid, even a small amount. If you can afford
this, consider it. If you can't, then think about other possible
incentives: food and drink (more than chips and soda?); public
recognition; something to take home; a later training
opportunity.

Decide on the meeting particulars

Specifically:
   Pin these down before you start signing people up.

   What day?
   What place?
   What time?
   How long?
   How many groups?
                        FOCUS GROUPS | 85

Prepare your questions

Go in prepared. Write out in advance a list of topics and
questions you want to ask. This will serve as your guide.

   Below are some examples of general questions. These apply
largely to groups discussing a current program or service, but
they can be adjusted for planned programs, as well as for
groups dealing with other concerns. The precise language and
order of presentation will depend on your topic and group,
but some of these questions may be adapted to your own
needs.

 "What are some of your thoughts about what's going on
   now?"

 "Would you say you are satisfied with the current
   situation, with the way things are going on?"

 (If so) "What are you satisfied about? Why is that?" (Or,
   "What's going well...?")

 "Are there things you are dissatisfied with, that you
   would like to see changed?" (Or, "What's not going
   well...?")

 (If so) "What are they? Why is that? How should they
   change? What kinds of things would you like to see
   happen?"

 "How about this particular aspect (of the topic). What
   do you think about that?"

 Repeat for different aspects of the topic, with variations
86 | FOCUS GROUPS

      in style. For example, if the main focus group topic was
      "community policing," some key aspects to cover might
      be visibility, sensitivity, interaction, respect, etc.
   "Some people have said that one way to improve X is to
      do Y.
   Do you agree with this?' (Or, "How do you feel about
      that?")
   "Are there other recommendations that you have, or
      suggestions you would like to make?"
   "Are there other things you would like to say before we
      wind up?"
   Some "probes" or follow-ups" designed to get more
      information on a given question:

          "Can you say more about that?"
          "Can you give an example?"
          "Jane says X. How about others of you. What do

            you think?"
          "How about you, Joe. [Or, "you folks in the corner

            over there...."] Do you have some thoughts on
            this?"
          "Does anyone else have some thoughts on that?"

Part B. During the meeting

Conduct the group

A common sequence of events for many focus groups goes
something like this: (The leader usually takes responsibility for
carrying them out.)

   Thank people for coming.
   Review the purpose of the group, and the goals of the

      meeting. Set the stage.
   Go over the flow of the meeting -- how it will proceed,

      and how the members can contribute. Lay out the
      ground rules. Encourage open participation.
88 | FOCUS GROUPS

   Set the tone. This is important because probably few of
      your members will have been in a focus group before.

   Ask an opening question. This could be a very general
      question ("What are your general thoughts about X?"),
      or something more specific. Both choices are justifiable,
      and both types of questions might be asked before the
      group ends.

   Make sure that all opinions on that question get a
      chance to be heard. How do you do this?

Some common techniques

   Summarize what you think you have heard, and ask if
      the group agrees

   Phrase the same question in a different way
   Ask if anyone else has any comments on that question
   Ask a follow-up question
   Look around the room, and make brief eye contact,

      especially with those who may not have spoken

       Reminder: The leader's job is to elicit opinion,
       and not judge it. All opinions should be
       respected.
                                                                FOCUS GROUPS | 89

   Ask your next question -- and proceed with other
      questions in the same general manner. The phrasing of
      the questions, the follow-ups, the ordering of the
      questions, and how much time to spend on each one are
      points that the leader will have to decide -- sometimes
      on the spot. An experienced leader will be able to do
      this. This is why you have spent time looking for one!

   When all your questions have been asked, and before the
      group ends, ask if anyone has any other comments to
      make. This can be an effective way of gathering other
      opinions that have not yet been voiced.

   Tell the members about any next steps that will occur,
      and what they can expect to happen now.

   Don't forget to thank the group for coming!

Part C. After the meeting

Look at the data

If you have audio-recorded, make a transcript. If not, make a
written summary from the group notes. But in any case, look
closely at the information you have collected.

   In some cases, you can devise and use a coding system to
"score" the data and count the number of times a particular
theme is expressed. Experience helps here. But whether you
90 | FOCUS GROUPS

do this or not, try to have more than one person review the
results independently. (Because even the best of us have our
biases.) Then come together to compare your interpretations
and conclusions.

   What patterns emerge?
   What are the common themes?
   What new questions arise?
   What conclusions seem true?

Share results with the group

They gave you their time. The least you can do is to give them
some feedback -- it's an obligation that you have. This can be
done by mail, phone, or email if you'd like. Sometimes it's even
possible to bring the group back for a second session, to review
results, verify their accuracy, and/or explore other themes.

   And note: Perhaps members have now become more
interested in the issue, and would like to get more involved.
Consider offering them an opportunity to do so. A focus
group, indirectly, can be a recruiting tool.

Use the results

Collecting useful information was the reason you wanted to
do a focus group in the first place. Now you have
the opportunity, and perhaps also the responsibility, to put it to
                                                                FOCUS GROUPS | 91

use. You can improve the situation that originally motivated
you, and made you think about a focus group at the very
beginning.

             particular situation

What is observational
research?

The term observational research is used to refer to several
different types of non-experimental studies in which
behaviour is systematically observed and recorded. The goal
of observational research is to describe a variable or set of
94 | OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH

variables. More generally, the goal is to obtain a snapshot of
specific characteristics of an individual, group, or setting. As
described previously, observational research is non-
experimental because nothing is manipulated or controlled,
and as such, we cannot arrive at causal conclusions using this
approach. The data that is collected in observational research
studies are often qualitative in nature but they may also be
quantitative or both (mixed-methods). There are several
different types of observational research designs that will be
described below.

Naturalistic vs contrived
observation

Naturalistic observation is an observational method that
involves observing people's behaviour in the environment in
which it typically occurs. Thus naturalistic observation is a
type of field research (as opposed to a type of laboratory
research). Jane Goodall's famous research on chimpanzees is a
classic example of naturalistic observation. Dr. Goodall spent
three decades observing chimpanzees in their natural
environment in East Africa. She examined such things as
chimpanzees' social structure, mating patterns, gender roles,
family structure, and care of offspring by observing them in
the wild. However, naturalistic observation could more simply
                                              OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH | 95

involve observing shoppers in a grocery store, children on a
school playground, or psychiatric inpatients in their wards.
Researchers engaged in naturalistic observation usually make
their observations as unobtrusively as possible so that
participants are not aware that they are being studied. Such
an approach is called disguised naturalistic
observation. Ethically, this method is considered to be
acceptable if the participants remain anonymous and the
behaviour occurs in a public setting where people would not
normally have an expectation of privacy. Grocery shoppers
putting items into their shopping carts, for example, are
engaged in public behaviour that is easily observable by store
employees and other shoppers. For this reason, most
researchers would consider it ethically acceptable to observe
them for a study. On the other hand, one of the arguments
against the ethicality of the naturalistic observation of
"bathroom behaviour" is that people have a reasonable
expectation of privacy even in a public restroom and that this
expectation was violated.

   Contrived observation occurs in an artificial environment,
such as a lab setting. For example, researchers may wish to
measure people's physiological responses to an ad that is being
screened in the university researcher's classroom.

        insights/?p=41#oembed-1

Disguised vs undisguised
observation

In cases where it is not ethical or practical to conduct disguised
naturalistic observation, researchers can conduct undisguised
naturalistic observation where the participants are made
aware of the researcher's presence and monitoring of their
behavior. However, one concern with undisguised naturalistic
observation is reactivity. Reactivity refers to when a measure
changes participants' behavior. In the case of undisguised
naturalistic observation, the concern with reactivity is that
when people know they are being observed and studied, they
may act differently than they normally would. For instance,
you may act much differently in a bar if you know that
someone is observing you and recording your behaviors and
this would invalidate the study. So disguised observation is less
reactive and therefore can have higher validity because people
                                              OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH | 97

are not aware that their behaviors are being observed and
recorded. However, we now know that people often become
used to being observed and with time they begin to behave
naturally in the researcher's presence. In other words, over
time people habituate to being observed. Think about reality
shows like Big Brother or Survivor where people are constantly
being observed and recorded. While they may be on their best
behavior at first, in a fairly short amount of time they are,
flirting, having sex, wearing next to nothing, screaming at each
other, and at times acting like complete fools in front of the
entire nation.

Participant vs mechanical
observation

Another approach to data collection in observational research
is participant observation. In participant observation,
researchers become active participants in the group or
situation they are studying. Participant observation is very
similar to naturalistic observation in that it involves observing
people's behavior in the environment in which it typically
occurs. As with naturalistic observation, the data that is
collected can include interviews (usually unstructured), notes
based on their observations and interactions, documents,
98 | OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH

photographs, and other artifacts. The only difference between
naturalistic observation and participant observation is that
researchers engaged in participant observation become active
members of the group or situations they are studying. The
basic rationale for participant observation is that there may
be important information that is only accessible to or can be
interpreted only by, someone who is an active participant in
the group or situation. Like naturalistic observation,
participant observation can be either disguised or undisguised.
In disguised participant observation, the researchers
pretend to be members of the social group they are observing
and conceal their true identity as researchers. In contrast
with undisguised participant observation, the researchers
become a part of the group they are studying and they disclose
their true identity as researchers to the group under
investigation. Once again there are important ethical issues
to consider with disguised participant observation. First, no
informed consent can be obtained and second passive
deception is being used. The researcher is passively deceiving
the participants by intentionally withholding information
about their motivations for being a part of the social group
they are studying. But sometimes disguised participation is the
only way to access a protective group (like a cult). Further,
disguised participant observation is less prone to reactivity
than undisguised participant observation.

   One of the primary benefits of participant observation is
that the researcher is in a much better position to understand
                                              OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH | 99

the viewpoint and experiences of the people they are studying
when they are a part of the social group. The primary
limitation of this approach is that the mere presence of the
observer could affect the behaviour of the people being
observed. While this is also a concern with naturalistic
observation when researchers because active members of the
social group they are studying, additional concerns arise that
they may change the social dynamics and/or influence the
behaviour of the people they are studying. Similarly, if the
researcher acts as a participant-observer there can be concerns
with biases resulting from developing relationships with the
participants. Concretely, the researcher may become less
objective resulting in more experimenter bias.

   Exhibit 1: Different types of equipment are used to
study physiological/neurological responses in humans.

In many situations, the means of observation are mechanical
rather than human. This involves video cameras, traffic
100 | OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH

counters, checkout scanners, smartphones, and a range of
devices that measure physiological responses. These devices
include eye-tracking monitors, pupilometers,
psychogalvanometers, voice pitch analyzers, and instruments
to measure neurological signals.

Structured vs unstructured
observation

In structured observation, the emphasis is on gathering
quantitative rather than qualitative data. Researchers using
this approach are interested in a limited set of behaviours. This
allows them to quantify the behaviours they are observing.
In other words, structured observation is less global than
naturalistic and participant observation because the researcher
engaged in structured observations is interested in a small
number of specific behaviours. Therefore, rather than
recording everything that happens, the researcher only focuses
on very specific behaviours of interest. For example, a marketer
may be interested in the number of people entering a mall, or
the number of times people stop to take a look at a displayed
ad. Unstructured observation, on the other hand, is flexible
and more informal. There is no checklist for the researcher
to follow. The researcher may observe all aspects of a
                                             OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH | 101

phenomenon and then provides details about things that he/
she found to be relevant in understanding a situation. This
technique can be more subjective than the structured
approach.

   When the observations require a judgment on the part of
the observers (e.g., do customers look happy while shopping
in a store?) this process is often described as coding. Coding
generally requires clearly defining a set of target behaviours.
The observers then categorize participants individually in
terms of which behaviour they have engaged in and the
number of times they engaged in each behaviour. The
observers might even record the duration of each behaviour.
The target behaviours must be defined in such a way that
different observers code them in the same way. In one study,
for example, researchers video-recorded a subset of their
participants' reactions and had two observers independently
code them. The two observers showed that they agreed on the
reactions that were exhibited 97% of the time, indicating good
interrater reliability.

   One of the primary benefits of structured observation is
that it is far more efficient than naturalistic and participant
observation. Since the researchers are focused on specific
behaviours this reduces time and expense. Also, oftentimes
the environment is structured to encourage the behaviours of
interest which again means that researchers do not have to
invest as much time in waiting for the behaviours of interest
102 | OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH

to naturally occur. Finally, researchers using this approach can
clearly exert greater control over the environment. However,
when researchers exert more control over the environment it
may make the environment less natural which decreases
external validity. It is less clear for instance whether structured
observations made in a laboratory environment will generalize
to a real-world environment. Furthermore, since researchers
engaged in structured observation are often not disguised there
may be more concerns with reactivity.

Observation of physical
evidence

Market researchers are able to gather data by observing physical
evidence which can provide key insights. Artefacts - such as
food cans in garbage bins and counting of physical inventories
are key methods that can be used. Content analysis of ads,
newspapers, images, or memos can help researchers
understand certain aspects of a phenomenon.

Variables

Data and Variable Types

This chapter details some important concepts that will be
referred to in subsequent pages, including what data and
variables are, and how to distinguish between different types.

What is data?

The word data refers to observations and measurements
which have been collected in some way, often through
research.

   Data that is recorded as numbers (and therefore measures
quantities) is quantitative data, while data that is recorded
as text (and therefore records qualities) is qualitative data.
Quantitative data can be analysed using statistics, as can
qualitative data that records qualities in terms of different
categories (for example what hair colour someone has, what
country someone was born in, what their marital status is,
etc.), as opposed to data that records qualities in terms of
thoughts, feelings and opinions.

   It is the former two types of data that you will be working
within this module, and shortly you will be introduced to
some other terms that are typically used in statistics to describe
data of this nature.
106 | MEASURES OR TYPES OF VARIABLES

What is a variable?

Variables are the characteristics or attributes that you are
observing, measuring and recording data for - some examples
include height, weight, eye colour, dog breed, climate,
electrical conductivity, customer service satisfaction and class
attendance, just to name a few.

   As the word suggests, the value of a variable varies from one
subject (i.e. person, place or thing) to another. For example,
the variable height could have a value of 170cm for one person,
163cm for another person and 154cm for another person; the
variable climate could have a value of arid for one city, tropical
for another city and the Mediterranean for another city; and
the variable class attendance could have the value 17 for one
class, 25 for another class and 32 for another class, etc.

Categorical and continuous
data

Choosing the correct statistic or statistical test to analyse your
data depends on the type of data, and hence type of variable(s),
so it is very important to be able to distinguish between these.
                                 MEASURES OR TYPES OF VARIABLES | 107

Most of the time you will simply need to classify your data
(and hence variables) as either categorical or continuous, but
each of these types can also be sub-classified. Definitions and
sub-classifications for each are as follows:

Categorical data

is data that is grouped into categories, such as data for a
`gender' or `smoking status' variable. Categorical data can be
further classified as:

   nominal when the categories do not have an order, such
      as for a `marital status' variable (furthermore, if there are
      only two categories then the terms binary and/
      or dichotomous are sometimes used); or

        insights/?p=43#h5p-23
108 | MEASURES OR TYPES OF VARIABLES

   ordinal when the categories do have an order, such as
      for a `best' car, the `runners up' car and the `third' car in
      a list of Australia's most favourite vehicles.

                   An interactive H5P element has been

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=43#h5p-22

Continuous data

is data that is measured on a continuous numerical scale and
which can take on a large number of possible values, such as
data for a `weight' or `distance' variable. Continuous data can
be further classified as:

   the interval when it does not have an absolute zero, and
      negative numbers also have meaning, such as for a
      `temperature in degrees Celsius' variable. In marketing,
      any variable which is measured on a Likert scale is seen as
      an interval variable. Here's an example:
                   MEASURES OR TYPES OF VARIABLES | 109

Example: On a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 = extremely dissatisfied)

and 5 = extremely satisfied), how would you rate the restaurant

on the following criteria:

Cleanliness                 1 2 3 4 5

Food presentation           1 2 3 4 5

Food (taste)                1 2 3 4 5

Prompt service              1 2 3 4 5

Courteous employees         1 2 3 4 5

   Customers' ratings on the above criteria can be averaged to
arrive at a score for `satisfaction with restaurant'.

 ratio when it does have an absolute zero, and negative
   numbers don't have meaning, such as the `expenditure'
   on groceries or `time spent' in the kitchen

           excluded from this version of the text. You
           can view it online here:
https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
insights/?p=43#h5p-21
110 | MEASURES OR TYPES OF VARIABLES

   One final thing to note on this topic is that any continuous
data can always be turned into categorical data, by simply
creating categories out of it. Continuous data for a `weight'
variable could be turned into categorical data by creating
categories of 50-59kg, 60-69kg, 70-79kg, etc., for example,
and this can be useful if you want to analyse your continuous
data using statistics and statistical tests designed for categorical
data. You can't go the other way around though and turn
categorical data into continuous data, so if you have the choice
then for maximum flexibility it is preferable to collect
continuous data.

           Highlight the steps in the questionnaire

112 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

Questionnaire Design

The questionnaire can influence the response rate achieved
in the survey, the quality of responses obtained, and
consequently the conclusions drawn from the survey
results. Questionnaire design should be started by considering
the objectives of the survey and the required output, and then
devising a list of questions to accurately obtain this
information. Careful consideration should be given to a
number of factors including the types of questions to be asked,
the questionnaire wording, the structure and design of the
questionnaire, and testing the questionnaire to ensure that
quality data is collected. A poorly designed questionnaire can
be the biggest source of non-sampling error (either directly or
indirectly).

   This section discusses the developmental phase of
questionnaire design, question wording, different types of
questions, and the structure and design of the questionnaire.
Testing the draft questionnaire will also be covered in this
chapter.

Questionnaire Development

This section lists the various steps involved in the development
                                                   QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 113

of a questionnaire. This development phase needs to ensure
that the data items in the final questionnaire are appropriate
and can be collected accurately. It is also important to consider
early on, the coding of questionnaire responses and the type of
processing system to be used to process the questionnaire.

Step 1: Defining the Objectives
with the Client

Before a questionnaire can be designed, time must first be
spent clarifying the objectives of the survey with the client.
It is important that the reasons for collecting the information
are clearly articulated. Defining the objectives with the client
includes:

   clarifying the objectives of the survey;
   justifying the collection in terms of the benefits;
   determining the scope of the survey, ie who is to be

      surveyed;
   determining the desired output, ie specify the tables

      according to the objectives and the precision required;
   preparing a list of content, ie information needed

      according to the objectives. A number of questions may
      be necessary to obtain the desired information;
   defining the content;
   justifying the content i.e. is all the information collected
114 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

      necessary; and
   establishing priorities for each data item. This is

      important in ensuring that the most important data
      items are collected. It also makes it easier to discard less
      important questions if the survey budget is reduced.

Step 2: Researching the Topic

It is very important that the researcher who is going to design
the questionnaire undertakes background research into the
topic under consideration. In terms of questionnaire design,
the research should aim to:

   clearly define the concepts and definitions to be used in
      the survey. The use of standard definitions and
      classifications will enhance data comparability; and

   accurately identify the target population characteristics.
      This needs to be done so that questions can be pitched
      at an appropriate level

It is also worthwhile looking at past surveys on the same topic
to learn from past experiences. Such collections can prove to be
useful as it helps to avoid possible mistakes. It is important to
look at the concepts, definitions, and question wording of past
collections if a time series is to be created since changes in these
                                                   QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 115

will result in changes in responses. For example, a question
in the 1981 Population Census, `Do you have a mortgage?'
received very different responses from those that were obtained
in the 1986 Census when the question was changed to `Have
you paid off your house?' Many people who had second
mortgages included this in the 1981 Census but not in the
1986 Census.

Step 3: Decide on Screening
Questions (to select the
respondents)

Screening questions (also known as "screeners") are used to
either qualify or disqualify respondents from taking the
survey--depending on how they answer. To make a
comprehensive list of screening questions, researchers need to
develop a clear set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion
criteria may be based on demographics (e.g., females, based
in Sydney, between the ages 18-25 years, and enrolled in a
Business degree), attitudes (such as preferring to purchase
locally-grown produce), lifestyle (spending weekends on the
beach), and/or behaviour (a regular purchaser of Nescafe
coffee).
116 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

       Imagine you work for Nestle. You want feedback
       on a new blend of instant coffee. However, you
       only want to collect information from heavy
       users in Sydney. Your screening questionnaire
       could include questions such as:

             Where do you live? (NOTE: Stop survey if
                the response is anything other than
                Sydney)

             Do you enjoy instant coffee? (If No, - or
                not sure or not applicable - then do not
                proceed with questions)

             On average, how much instant coffee
                would you have in a day? (Anyone with
                less than 4 cups will be screened out)

Step 4: Finalising the Questions
and Type of Scales

Deciding on the content of the questions and the scale used
to measure them will have an impact on data analysis. All
question content should be linked to the original objectives
decided in consultation with the client.

Open vs. Closed Questions

Questions can generally be classified as one of two types -
open or closed - depending on the amount of information
that can be provided. Open questions allow the respondents to
answer the question in their own words. An example is `What
is your occupation?' The advantage of these types of questions
is that they allow many possible answers and they can collect
exact data from a variety of possible responses. However, they
are more demanding than closed questions, both to answer
and process. Open questions are often used in pilot tests to
determine the range of likely responses.

   Closed questions provide respondents with a range of the
most likely answers to choose from. These questions are
appropriate when the researcher can anticipate most of the
responses and when exact values are not needed. However,
they require more effort than open questions in the
development and testing stages. The processing time of closed
responses is much less than that of open-ended responses.

Questions    license?

Questions    instance, soft drinks

Behavioural  Respondent's actions or undertaking an activity,

Questions e.g., what would you do if....

Demographic  Respondent's personal information, such as

             creating respondent segments

Knowledge    Used to check respondents' knowledge about
Questions    certain issues, e.g., who is the current PM of
             Australia?

While the type of question relates to the information sought
from the respondent, the way it is `measured' (with
appropriate scales) will make it feasible to carry out different
types of statistical analyses. Given below is an example that
demonstrates how the four scales can be used to measure the
same concept.

Assume, a marketer is interested in measuring
120 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

people's ice cream-related attitudes and
purchase behaviours. Below are some of the
ways in which questions/scales could be drafted:

A. "Have you purchased an ice cream

product in the past few days?"               Yes

___ No ___                  (Nominal scale)

B. "Assume you are making a shopping list.

Step 5: Check Question-Wording
and Response Categories

There are a number of factors to consider when designing
questions to ensure that appropriate answers are obtained.
Several aspects of question design can introduce errors,
namely:

Language

Questions that employ complex or technical language or
jargon can confuse or irritate respondents. In the case of
interviewer-based surveys, respondents who do not
understand the question may be unwilling to appear ignorant
by asking the interviewer to explain the questions. The
124 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

respondent may then either refuse to answer or give an
inaccurate response.

   Technical language or jargon should only be used in cases
where it is part of the normal language of the survey's target
population. An example of this case would be a survey of
information technology specialists: the survey would need to
use language that is `jargon' to the survey designer, but
appropriate for the respondent.

                   excluded from this version of the text. You
                   can view it online here:
        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=45#h5p-29

   A general principle to keep in mind is that the wording of
questionnaire items should be specific, definitive, consistent,
brief, simple, and self-explanatory.

Ambiguity

If ambiguous words or phrases are included in a question, the
                                                  QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 125

meaning may be interpreted differently by different people.
This will introduce errors in the data since different
respondents will be virtually answering different questions.

   For example, consider the question `Has your standard of
living decreased substantially because of a sharp increase in
your monthly mortgage repayments?' A `No' answer could
mean any one of a number of things - for instance: `No my
standard of living has not dropped because of increased
repayments' or `No, my repayments have not increased'.

   A question may also seem straightforward but allow for a
variety of different kinds of answers. It is important to include
the measurement unit you require wherever one applies, e.g.
dollars, days, litres.

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=45#h5p-24
126 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

Double-Barrelled Questions
(Multiple Concepts in one Question)

These are apparently single questions that actually incorporate
two different questions. For example: ` Do you intend to leave
work and return to full-time study this year?' A person may
be intending to leave work, but not to return to study, and
vice versa. When different parts of the question have different
answers or parts of the question are not relevant, respondents
may be unsure how to answer. When attempting to interpret
answers to such questions, it can be unclear to which part of
the question the answer corresponds.

Leading Questions

An error will be introduced if questions lead respondents
towards a particular response. For example, the question `How
many days did you work last week?', if asked without first
determining whether respondents did in fact work in the
previous week, is a leading question. It implies that the person
would have or should have been at work. Respondents may
answer incorrectly to avoid telling the interviewer that they
were not working.

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=45#h5p-26

Unbalanced Questions

Another form of leading questions is unbalanced questions.
For example, `Are you in favour of gun control?' provides only
one alternative to consider. The question should be reworded
to something like `Do you favour gun control or are you
against gun control?', which gives respondents more than one
alternative. The answer options of a question can also be
unbalanced. For example, a respondent could be asked in a
neutral way "Please rate your overall health" but required to
select from the answers "Poor", "Good" and "Excellent".

        can view it online here:
        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=45#h5p-27

Recall/Memory Error

A significant degree of error can be introduced in questions
that require respondents to recall events, expenditure, etc.,
particularly if details are being sought for a long period. The
quality of the data collected from recall questions is influenced
by the importance of the event to the respondent and the
length of time since the event took place. Respondents also
tend to remember what should have been done rather than
what was done.

   Subjects that are of greater importance or interest to
respondents, or events that happen infrequently, will be
remembered over longer periods and more accurately. Where
possible (eg. with financial information), questions should be
framed so that respondents can refer to their own records
which would enhance accurate reporting. Minimising the
recall period also helps to reduce memory bias.

   A specific type of memory error is telescoping. This occurs
                                                  QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 129

if respondents report events as occurring either earlier or later
than they actually occur, incorrectly bringing events into the
reference period. This effect is alleviated somewhat by being
very specific about when the reference period begins and ends,
for example using "the week ending Saturday 1st September"
rather than "last week".

Intrusive (Sensitive) Questions

Questions on topics that respondents may see as embarrassing
or highly sensitive can produce inaccurate answers.
Respondents may refuse to provide information on personal
issues such as health or income details. If respondents are
required to answer questions with information that might
seem socially undesirable, they may provide the interviewer
with responses they believe are more `acceptable'. In these
cases, it is often better to provide the respondent with a self-
administered questionnaire that the interviewer doesn't see.

                   excluded from this version of the text. You

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=45#h5p-25
130 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

   Business survey respondents can also find some topics
sensitive, such as IT security breaches or donations to charity,
as well as not wanting to reveal commercial-in-confidence
information about their business. Business surveys add a new
dimension to collecting sensitive data as it is often necessary
for different respondents, sometimes from different areas, to
complete parts of the form and approve its content. Some
respondents might not want others to see particular answers.

   The negative effect of sensitive questions may be aggravated
if they are placed at the beginning of the questionnaire and
can therefore contribute to non-response if respondents are
unwilling to continue with the remaining questions. If a
sensitive question is further into a form the respondent is more
committed to completion, and if they do refuse to continue,
the partial response is more useful. Ways of overcoming
difficulties associated with sensitive questions may include
reassuring respondents that the information they provide is
confidential, and not requiring respondents to write their
names anywhere on the survey form.

Acquiescence

This situation arises when respondents have a general
tendency to agree rather than disagree with anything. It occurs
when respondents are asked whether they agree or disagree
                                                   QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 131

with a statement, especially when the supplied statements are
presented as plausible generalities. It can also appear for
questions requiring a yes or no response.

   This tendency can be due to a combination of factors, such
as the personality and education level of respondents, as well
as conditions of the interview or design of a self-completed
questionnaire. Respondents will often agree when the
question is ambiguous or otherwise difficult to answer. The
effect may be exaggerated when the respondent is fatigued or
has to answer a long string of questions with the same response
categories. A related effect is satisficing, where respondents
select the first reasonable answer rather than make the effort to
find or remember the best answer.

Adequate Response Categories

It is important to make sure that there are adequate response
categories and that they incorporate every possible response.
For example:

   Age: 15-19, 21-25
This provides a problem for those respondents whose age is 20.

   Another problem that could arise is overlapping response
categories. Ranges should always be mutually exclusive. For
example:

   Age 15-20, 20-25
This provides a problem for respondents whose age is 20 since
they could respond in either or both categories.
132 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

   Response categories also need to be worded carefully, as
respondents will use them to clarify or extend the meaning
of the question. For example, if a question using a frequency
scale with five points "Never", "Rarely", "Average", "Often",
and "Frequently" a respondent may incorrectly assume the
scale represents the population distribution. If they consider
themselves to be normal or extreme compared to the
population on the activity of interest their answers will differ
regardless of the actual frequency they engage in the activity.

Number of Response Options

The number of response categories can influence the quality
of the data as both too few and too many categories can cause
errors. Too many can cause respondent fatigue and
inattention, resulting in ill-considered answers. If there are too
few categories respondents may have difficulty finding one
which accurately describes their situation.

Don't Know Category

The decision about whether to include or exclude a Don't
Know option depends to a large extent on the subject matter.
The remaining responses are usually evenly distributed on the
negative and positive sides of a scale if this category is excluded,
although it depends to a large extent on the nature of the
question. Excluding this option may not be a good idea, as
                                                  QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 133

respondents may be forced to give an answer when, for
example, they really do not know what their attitude is to a
particular subject, or they do not know the answer to a factual
question that has been asked. When respondents are forced
to develop an attitude on the spot this attitude will be highly
unreliable.

Tone

A change in wording can result in a change in responses. For
example, different responses may be obtained by using the
following two questions:

   `Do you think that gun ownership should be forbidden?'
   or
   `Do you think that gun ownership should not be allowed?'
   Minor changes in wording can also have a significant effect
on responses. One should therefore be careful when looking
at alternative wordings. The use of negative words like "not"
should be avoided in questions as they are easily missed by
respondents. In addition, using "not" in a scale such as
"Satisfied", "Neither" and "Not satisfied" doesn't provide a
true opposite. "Dissatisfied" would be a better alternative,
however "Unsatisfied" could also be used and would mean
something slightly different to respondents.

        insights/?p=45#oembed-1

Step 6: Finalise the Structure
and Layout of the Questionnaire

Not only does the wording of questions require attention to
detail, but also the `look' of the questionnaire. Poorly designed
questionnaires (eg. hard-to-read text) not only serve as a
disincentive to respondents completing the questionnaire but
can also result in respondents making errors. Some of the
important elements of the questionnaire structure and layout
are outlined below.

Sequencing

The questions on a form should follow a sequence that is
logical to the respondents. Regardless of the method used to
administer the questionnaire, the sequence should flow
smoothly from one question to the next. A smooth
progression through the questions is particularly important if
                                                  QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 135

the questionnaire is answered in difficult circumstances (e.g.
a mother trying to fill in a questionnaire while her children
are seeking her attention). It is a good idea to start the
questionnaire with pleasant and easy questions to promote
interest in the survey, and to give respondents confidence in
their ability to answer the remaining questions. In particular,
the opening questions should establish that the respondent is
a member of the survey population.

   The remaining questions should be logically structured so
that the interviewer or respondent does not need to alternate
between pages of the questionnaire. For example, any
explanatory notes should be presented as part of the question
they refer to, not on a separate page.

   Questions that may be sensitive to respondents should
generally not be placed at the beginning of a questionnaire.
Rather, they should be placed in a section of the form where
they are most meaningful to the context of other questions.
In this way, the format of the questionnaire can act as a buffer
to help the respondent feel more comfortable with sensitive
questions after establishing rapport.

   In self-enumeration questionnaires, to ensure that
respondents answer only those parts of the questionnaire that
are relevant, filter questions may be used to direct respondents
to skip the questions that do not apply to them. Filter
questions are also used in interviewer-based surveys to direct
interviewers to follow a series of questions according to
answers given by respondents. Filter questions need to be used
136 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

with care as respondents (and interviewers) need to have
sufficient information about the skip condition to judge
whether the respondent should skip. Filters should also
generally be avoided for sensitive topics as respondents will
tend to give an answer that avoids answering sensitive
questions.

   If the instructions are not clear and straightforward,
interviewers or respondents can follow an incorrect sequence
or miss questions. In general, only one or two conditions
should be placed in each sequence guide. Computer-assisted
interviewing and electronic self-completion forms can make
complex sequencing much easier.

   Filter questions also identify sub-populations. For example:
   Q7 `Were you born overseas?'
If `Yes' go to Q8,
if `No' go to Q12.

Order of Questions

The order in which the questions appear may influence the
responses given to particular questions. Responses given to
earlier questions can influence responses to later questions. For
example, if a question asks participants whether they believe
trade unions are disruptive in the community, and then a later
question asks about problems in the Australian industry, the
negative influence of trade unions on the industry may receive
                                                  QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 137

much more attention than would otherwise have been the
case.

Order of Response Options

The actual order of response options can also introduce bias.
The options presented first may be selected because they make
an initial impact on respondents, or because respondents lose
concentration and do not hear or read the remaining options.
Equally, the last options may be chosen because they are more
easily recalled, particularly if respondents are given a long list
of options. Thus, the order of response options has a greater
effect on data quality when a question includes a large number
of response options.

   If possible, options should be presented in a meaningful
order. If some options are more socially desirable than others
these should go last to reduce bias. For example, an education
question should present the qualifications in order from
lowest to highest. For some self-completed lists, alphabetical
order is the most appropriate to help the respondent find
which option they want, for example, if respondents have to
select which crops they produce.

Response Options and Respondent
Difficulties

When the survey is interviewer-based, the response options can
138 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

be presented either verbally or on a prompt card. A prompt
card is a list of possible responses to a question that are shown
by the interviewer to assist the respondents. This helps to
decrease errors resulting from respondents being unable to
remember all the options read out to them. However,
respondents with poor eyesight, migrants with limited
English, or adults with literacy problems will experience
difficulties in answering accurately.

                   An interactive H5P element has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You
                   can view it online here:
        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=45#h5p-28

Length

The length of a questionnaire can be described in different
ways. Survey designers tend to worry about the number of
pages, whereas the number of questions (especially mandatory
ones) and the time taken to complete are usually more
important. How long is too long varies across the mode of data
                                                  QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 139

collection, the ease and interest of the topic and the design of
the questionnaire. Towards the end of a long questionnaire,
respondents may give less thought to their answers and
concentrate less on the instructions and questions, thereby
decreasing the accuracy of the information they provide. If a
respondent is told an interview will last several hours, or they
receive a questionnaire that is many pages thick, that can lead
the respondent to refuse to participate at all.

Questionnaire Layout

Respondents or interviewers using a questionnaire with a poor
layout can miss questions, follow an incorrect sequence or
enter responses in the wrong response box, which will result
in missing or incorrect data. Poor layout can also contribute to
errors at the processing stage. For example, if response boxes
are not aligned some answers may be missed completely during
the data entry.

   Particularly for those questionnaires which are completed
by respondents, the design may contribute to errors as a result
of:

 1. poor legibility (e.g. unclear printing or very small text);
 2. violating the normal reading path of the respondent

      (English readers expect to read from the top left to the
      bottom right and e.g. big headings and bright pictures in
      the middle of pages disrupt this);
140 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

 3. instructions that can be easily overlooked (e.g. those
      which are not clearly differentiated from the questions
      or are not placed near the relevant part of the question);
      and

 4. inadequate space for answers.

Physical Design

The questionnaire should be physically set out so as to
minimise the time needed to interview, respond and process
the results. Specifically, consideration should be given to the
form's construction, graphics, and layout. Poor layout leads
to mistakes in understanding questions and recording the
responses. In general, the questionnaire:

 1. needs to be understood by respondents, interviewers,
      and processors. This is done by providing clear
      instructions. For respondents, this means an adequate
      layout of questions and response categories with
      appropriate sequencing. Interviewers require prompts to
      be clearly understood and response codes need to be
      adequate for processors;

 2. should have a good appearance as it might affect the
      response, i.e. the questionnaire should be well designed
      and presented and therefore easy to answer;

 3. should clearly identify the date, title, and organisation;
 4. should clearly outline the purpose of the survey;
                                                   QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN | 141

 5. should assure respondents about the confidentiality of
      the information they are providing;

 6. should provide a contact number so that respondents
      can obtain help if they require it and due date; and

 7. should have pages that are numbered consecutively, with
      a simple numbering system.

Step 7: Testing the
Questionnaire

Once the understanding of concepts and definitions has been
investigated through focus groups, a rough questionnaire can
be produced and tested informally on a small group of people,
perhaps one's colleagues at work. Such testing is not intended
to obtain representative results but aims to find out the major
flaws with the questions, for example, awkward wording. This
testing is designed to take the `rough edges' off a questionnaire.
It is a good idea to use open questions to work out the likely
responses. The questions can be restructured and developed
into a draft questionnaire which can be used in rounds of
informal pretesting and later pilot testing.
142 | QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

Conclusion

Questionnaire design begins by clarifying the objectives of the
survey, determining the data which is to be produced by the
survey and devising a list of questions to obtain this data.
Careful consideration should be given to a number of factors,
including the type of questions to be used, the logical sequence
and wording of questions, and the physical design of the
form. It is important to test each of these aspects of
questionnaire design with a group of respondents before
finalising the questionnaire. If necessary, the form can then
be modified and retested until respondents can complete it
accurately and quickly with a minimum of errors.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:
           understand the steps in a sampling plan
           differentiate between different types of
             sampling methods

Introduction

In most situations, it is not feasible for the researcher to collect
144 | SAMPLING METHODS

information from all people within a population, usually
referred to as a census. It is important to have a plan on how
to select a `sample' of individuals who could be tapped for
data collection. The major decisions to be made for a `sampling
plan' are:

   defining the population and sampling units;
   identifying the sampling frame;
   estimating the sample size;
   determining the sampling methodology; and
   choosing a sampling technique

   This chapter will examine all these topics in detail.

Defining the population and
sampling units

The population is the aggregate or collection of units (e.g.,
individuals, households, schools, hospitals, businesses) about
which the survey will be conducted. The target population is
also known as the scope of the survey. It is the `population' that
the survey is aimed at.

   A critical component of sampling is to accurately define
the population that the researcher is interested in surveying.
This means making sure that the definition includes key
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 145

characteristics of the population units, which would make it
easier to identify the exact group of individuals to target.

        insights/?p=47#h5p-31

Identifying the sampling
frame

The frame refers to the list of units (eg, persons, households,
businesses, etc) in the survey population. Since the selection of
the sample is directly based on this list, the frame is one of the
most important tools in the design of a survey. It determines
how well a target population is covered and affects the choice
of the data collection method. It is also desirable that the frame
contains auxiliary information on the units so that a more
efficient sample plan can be developed. The frame should
contain contact points for each of the units listed so that it can
146 | SAMPLING METHODS

be used to access the population. This means that for postal
surveys the frame should contain postal addresses; for
interviewer-based surveys, the frame should contain street
addresses, and for telephone surveys, the frame should contain
telephone numbers.

   A good frame is up-to-date, does not have any missing units,
contains only relevant units, does not include duplicates, is
accessible to frame users, and contains sufficient information
to uniquely identify and contact each unit.

Sample size determination

An important aspect of sample design is deciding upon the
sample size given the objectives and constraints that exist. Since
every survey is different there are no fixed rules for determining
sample size. However, factors to be considered include

   the population size and variability within the
      population;

   resources (time, money, and personnel);
   level of accuracy required of the results;
   level of detail required in the results;
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 147

   the likely level of non-response; and
   the relative importance of the variables of interest

Once these issues have been addressed, you are in a better
position to decide on the size of the sample.

Variability

The more variable the population is, the larger the sample
required to achieve specific levels of accuracy. However, actual
population variability is generally not known in advance;
information from a previous survey or a pilot test may be used
to give an indication of the variability of the population.

   When the characteristic being measured is comparatively
rare, larger sample size will be required to ensure that sufficient
units having that characteristic are included in the sample.

Population size

An aspect that affects the sample size required is the
population size. When the population size is small, it needs
to be considered carefully in determining the sample size, but
when the population size is large it has little effect on the
sample size. Gains in precision from increasing the sample size
are by no means proportional to population size.
148 | SAMPLING METHODS

Resources and accuracy

As discussed earlier, the estimates are obtained from a sample
rather than a census, therefore the estimates are different from
the true population value. A measure of the accuracy of the
estimate is the standard error. A large sample is more likely to
have a smaller standard error or greater accuracy than a small
sample.

   When planning a survey, you might wish to minimize the
size of the standard error to maximize the accuracy of the
estimates. This can be done by choosing as large a sample as
resources permit. Alternatively, you might specify the size of
the standard error to be achieved and choose a sample size
designed to achieve that. In some cases, it will cost too much
to take the sample size required to achieve a certain level of
accuracy. Decisions then need to be made on whether to relax
the accuracy levels, reduce data requirements, increase the
budget or reduce the cost of other areas in the survey process.

Level of detail required

If we divide the population into subgroups (strata) and we are
choosing a sample from each of these strata then a sufficient
sample size is required in each of the subgroups to ensure
reliable estimates at this level. The overall sample size would be
equal to the sum of the sample sizes for the subgroups. A good
approach is to draw a blank table that shows all characteristics
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 149

to be cross-classified. The more cells there are in the table, the
larger the sample size needed to ensure reliable estimates.

Likely level of non-response

Non-response can cause problems for the researcher in two
ways. The higher the non-response the larger the standard
errors will be for a fixed initial sample size. This can be
compensated for by assigning a larger sample size based on an
expected response rate, or by using quota sampling.

   The second problem with non-respondents is that the
characteristics of non-respondents may differ markedly from
those of respondents. The survey results will still be biased
even with an increase in sample size (ie. increasing the sample
size will have no effect on the non-response bias). The lower
the response rate, the less representative the final sample will
be of the total population, and the bigger the bias of sample
estimates. Non-response bias can sometimes be reduced by
post-stratification as well as through intensive follow-up of
non-respondents, particularly in strata with poor response
rates.

The relative importance of the
variables of interest

Generally, surveys are used to collect a range of data on a
150 | SAMPLING METHODS

number of variables of interest. A sample size that will result
in insufficiently precise information for one variable may not
result in sufficiently precise information for another variable.
It is not normally feasible to select a sample that is large enough
to cover all variables to the desired level of precision. In
practice, therefore, the relative importance of the variables of
interest are considered, priorities are set and the appropriate
sample size is determined accordingly.

Sampling methodology:
probability and
non-probability

A probability sample is one in which every unit of the
population has a known non-zero probability of selection and
is randomly selected. A probability sample allows inferences
about the target population to be made. By knowing the
selection probability for each unit, objective selections can
                                                        SAMPLING METHODS | 151

then be made which should produce a more representative
sample. Known probabilities also allow the measurement of
the precision of the survey estimates in terms of standard errors
and confidence intervals.

   If the probability of selection for each unit is unknown, or
cannot be calculated, the sample is called a non-probability
sample. Non-probability samples are often less expensive,
easier to run, and don't require a frame. However, it
is not possible to accurately evaluate the precision (ie.
closeness of estimates under repeated sampling of the same
size) of estimates from non-probability samples since there is
no control over the representativeness of the sample. If a non-
probability sample is carried out carefully, then the bias in the
results can be reduced.

Choosing between probability
and non-probability samples

The choice between using a probability or a non-probability
approach to sampling depends on a variety of factors:

   the objectives and scope of the survey;
   the method of data collection suitable to those

      objectives;
   the precision required of the results and whether that
152 | SAMPLING METHODS

      precision needs to be able to be measured;
   the availability of a sampling frame;
   the resources required to maintain the frame; and
   the availability of extra information about the units in

      the population.

   Probability sampling is normally preferred when
conducting major surveys, especially when a population frame
is available ensuring that we are able to select and contact each
unit in the (frame) population. However, where time and
financial constraints make probability sampling infeasible, or
where knowing the level of accuracy in the results is not an
important consideration, non-probability samples do have a
role to play since they are inexpensive, easy to run and no
frame is required. For this reason, when conducting qualitative
(investigative), rather than quantitative research, non-
probability samples & techniques such as case studies are
generally superior to probability samples & quantitative
estimation. Non-probability sampling can also be useful when
piloting surveys.

Sampling techniques -
non-probability samples

Different types of non-probability samples are discussed
below. In a non-probability sample, all members of a
population do not have an equal chance of being selected for
a sample. However, if a non-probability sample is carried out
carefully, then the bias in the results can be reduced.

Quota sampling

To select a quota sample, the interviewers select respondents
until a pre-determined number of respondents in certain
categories are surveyed (eg. the interviewers might select the
sample to achieve a certain age/sex breakdown reflective of the
target population).

   This is the method of sampling commonly used by market
154 | SAMPLING METHODS

researchers and political pollsters as it can produce fairly good
estimates if it is properly conducted. When top-up units are
selected randomly to fill a quota, and no element of judgment
is used by the researcher for unit selection, it is very similar to a
probability sample. However, when non-response is significant
(which is almost always the case for voluntary surveys), quota
sampling can under-represent those portions of the
population that are unwilling to respond or hard to contact.

Convenience and haphazard
sampling

Street corner interviews, magazine and newspaper
questionnaires, and phone-in polls are all examples of
convenience or haphazard samples. These types of surveys are
subject to biased or unrepresentative samples as only persons
who feel strongly about the topic will respond. These surveys
also have a tendency to ask questions that are loaded or have
biased wording.

   Street corner interviews can be biased depending on the
timing and the placement of the interviewer. There is no
control over selecting the sample of respondents in any of these
methods, however, they are very cheap and easy to administer.

Judgment or purposive sampling

Judgment sampling is where a `representative' sample is chosen
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 155

by an expert in the field of study. Judgment sampling is subject
to unknown biases but may be justified for very small samples.
This form of sampling can be used to choose a sample for
a pilot test of a probability survey but inferences about the
population should not be made from judgment samples.
Judgment sampling is also known as purposive sampling.

Snowball sampling (or chain referral
sampling)

According to this type of sampling technique, the researcher
seeks assistance from research participants to help identify and
recruit other participants for the study. This can be particularly
useful in a situation where the target population is hard to
find. Examples include minority groups, people with a medical
condition, or people with a particular ideology.

Sampling techniques -
probability samples

Simple random sampling

Simple random sampling (SRS) is a probability selection
scheme where each unit in the population is given an equal
probability of selection, and thus every possible sample of a
given size has the same probability of being selected. One
possible method of selecting a simple random sample is to
number each unit on the sampling frame sequentially and
make the selections by generating "selection numbers" from a
random number table or, from some form of random number
generator.

   Table: Advantages and Disadvantages - Simple Random
Sampling

                        implement

In practice, simple random sampling is rarely used because
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 157

there is almost always a more efficient method of designing
the sample (in terms of producing accurate results for a given
cost). Nevertheless, simple random sampling forms the basis of
a number of the more complex methods of sample design, and
is used as a benchmark to which other designs are compared.

       Example of a situation where a simple random
       sampling technique could be employed:
       To participate in a focus group discussion, a
       teacher could use a computer to randomly
       generate the names of five students from a
       complete class list of twenty students.

Systematic sampling

Systematic sampling provides a simple method of selecting the
sample when the sampling frame exists in the form of an
explicit list. Where the frame contains auxiliary information
then the units in the frame are ordered with respect to that
auxiliary data (eg employment size of a business). A fixed
interval (referred to as the skip) is then used to select units from
the sampling frame. Systematic sampling is best explained by
describing how the sample selections are made.

               skip is calculated as

                     7, a bias is
               introduced yielding
                samples which are
               not representative of

                 the population.

Example of a situation where a systematic
sampling technique could be employed:
Surveying every fifth household on a street

Stratified sampling

Stratified sampling is a technique that uses auxiliary
information which is referred to as stratification variables to
increase the efficiency of a sample design. Stratification
variables may be geographical (eg. state, rural/urban) or non-
geographical (eg. age, sex, number of employees).
                              SAMPLING METHODS | 159

Stratified sampling involves

 the division or stratification of the population into
   homogeneous (similar) groups called strata; and

 selecting the sample using SRS or systematic sampling
   within each stratum and independent of the other strata.

Stratification almost always improves the accuracy of
estimates. This is because the population variability can be
thought of as having components within strata and between
strata. By independently sampling within each stratum we
ensure each stratum is appropriately reflected in the sample,
so between stratum variability is eliminated and we are left
only with the within stratum component. With this factor
in mind we see that the most efficient way to stratify is to
have strata which are as different from each other as possible
(to maximise the variance which is being eliminated) while
being internally as homogeneous as possible (to minimise the
variance remaining).

Practical considerations

When planning a stratified sample, a number of practical
considerations should be kept in mind:

   the strata should be designed so that they collectively
      include all members of the target population;
160 | SAMPLING METHODS

   each member must appear in only one stratum, ie strata
      should be non overlapping; and

   the definitions of boundaries of the strata should be
      precise and unambiguous.

       As an example of stratification, if we were
       interested in the educational background of
       members of a Science faculty at a University, we
       could select a sample from the faculty as a whole
       or select samples independently from each of
       the departments within the faculty, such as
       mathematics, physics, chemistry etc. This latter
       method would ensure that each department was
       adequately represented (which would not
       necessarily happen otherwise), and should
       increase the precision of the overall estimate.
       If on the other hand, we were interested in the
       level of education (PhD, Masters, Bachelor)
       rather than the background we should stratify
       the faculty by level (Professor, Senior Lecturer,
       Lecturer) rather than by department. Using this
       stratification we are more likely to find
       uniformity of educational standards within a
       level rather than an area of work, and we are
                                              SAMPLING METHODS | 161

also more likely to separate the better-qualified
from the less-qualified.

Number of stratas

There is no rule as to how many strata the population should
be divided into. This depends on the population size and
homogeneity and the format in which the output is required.
If output is required for some sub-groups of the population
these subgroups must be considered as separate strata.
162 | SAMPLING METHODS

ABS surveys

All surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
employ stratification. Household surveys (such as the Monthly
Population Survey and the Household Expenditure Survey)
use geographic strata. Business surveys use variables such as
state and industry strata and use some measure of size (eg
employment) to form size strata.

Cluster and multi-stage sampling

So far we have considered a number of ways which a sample
of population units can be selected and population
characteristics estimated on the basis of this sample. In this
section consideration is given to a sampling scheme where the
selection of population units is made by selecting particular
groups (or clusters) of such units and then selecting all or some
of the population units within selected groups for inclusion in
the sample.

Cluster sampling

Cluster sampling involves selecting a sample in a number of
stages (usually two). The units in the population are grouped
into convenient, usually naturally occurring clusters. These
clusters are non-overlapping, well-defined groups which
usually represent geographic areas. At the first stage of
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 163

selection, a number of clusters are selected. At the second
stage, all the units in the chosen clusters are selected to form
the sample.

Practical considerations

   The clusters should be designed so that they collectively
      include all members of the target population;

   each member must appear in one and only one cluster;
      and

   the definitions or boundaries of the clusters should be
      precise and unambiguous; in the case of geographical
      clusters natural and man-made boundaries such as rivers
      and roads are often used to delimit the cluster
      boundaries.

164 | SAMPLING METHODS

       If we take a simple random sample of 10,000
       households across the whole of Australia then
       we are more likely to cover the population more
       evenly, but it is more expensive than sampling
       50 clusters of 200 households.

Multi-stage sampling

Multi-stage sampling involves selecting a sample in at least two
stages. At the first stage, large groups or clusters of population
units are selected. These clusters are designed to contain more
units than are required for a final sample.

   At the second stage, units are sampled from the selected
clusters to derive the final sample. If more than two stages
are used, the process of selecting "sub-clusters" within clusters
continues until the final sample is achieved.

   The same practical considerations apply to multi-stage
sampling as to cluster sampling.

       The following is an example of the stages of
                                                       SAMPLING METHODS | 165

       selection that may be used in a three-stage
       household survey.

             Stage 1. Electoral Subdivisions
                Electoral subdivisions (clusters) are
                sampled from a city or state.

             Stage 2. Blocks
                Blocks of houses are selected from within
                the electoral subdivisions.

             Stage 3. Houses
                Houses are selected from within the
                selected blocks.

Uses of multi-stage sampling

Multi-stage sampling is generally used when it is costly or
impossible to form a list of all the units in the target
population. Typically, a multi-stage sample gives less precise
estimates than a simple random sample of the same size.
However, a multi-stage sample is often more precise than a
simple random sample of the same cost, and it is for this
reason that the method is employed.
  166 | SAMPLING METHODS

 Advantages and disadvantages

  The advantages and disadvantages of multi-stage sampling are
  similar to those for cluster sampling. However, to compensate
  for the lower accuracy, either the number of clusters selected
  in the first stage should be relatively large (but this increases
  the cost of the survey) or the sampling fraction for later stages
  should be high (i.e. a large percentage of each cluster should be
  selected).

 River sampling and panel
 sampling

     There are two common approaches used in non-probability
  online surveys. The simplest non-probability approach to
  recruiting respondents online is "river" sampling, also known

  panel surveys; using non-probability samples in social and policy research', Policy
  and Internet journal, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 134 - 155.

as intercept sampling or real-time sampling (Olivier, 2011;
Walsh et al., 1992; Yun & Trumbo, 2000, cited in Lehdonvirta,
Oksanen, Rasanen and Blank 2020). The second approach is
referred to as panel sampling.

   River sampling means recruiting respondents by inviting
them to follow a link to a survey placed on a web page, email,
or somewhere else where it is likely to be noticed by members
of the target population. The name refers to the idea of
researchers dipping into the traffic flow of a website, catching
some of the users floating by. This method is similar to the
convenience or haphazard sampling method described above.
A basic problem with river sampling is the coverage bias.
Coverage bias occurs because not every subpopulation is
represented proportionately or indeed at all in digital media
(Rsnen, 2006, cited in Lehdonvirta, Oksanen, Rasanen and
Blank 2020).

   Panel sampling refers to the recruitment of survey
respondents usually with the help of commercial
non-probability online panel providers. There are many such
providers today, ranging from new startup companies to
established media and research outfits such as Ipsos Mori,
Qualtrics, and Survey Sampling International (SSI) (Callegaro
et al., 2014a, cited in Lehdonvirta, Oksanen, Rasanen and
Blank 2020). In contrast to probability-based online panels,
typical recruitment strategies of non-probability online panels
168 | SAMPLING METHODS

include placing ads on websites or social media and
distributing invitations to newsgroups and mailing lists.
Interested users opt in to become panel members, and users
from multiple sources are often blended into a single panel
(Lorch, Cavallaro, & van Ossenbruggen, 2014, cited in
Lehdonvirta, Oksanen, Rasanen and Blank 2020). A key
difference to river sampling is that the panel providers
undertake to manage the demographic compositions of their
respondent pools, trying to correct the biases stemming from
digital medias' uneven coverage so that the panels would be
demographically similar to national populations. Online panel
surveys are widely used by social scientists as well as policy
consultants and think tanks. However, previous work suggests
that panel surveys still systematically over-represent some
groups and under-represent others (Willems et al., 2006, cited
in Lehdonvirta, Oksanen, Rasanen and Blank 2020). For
instance, U.S. online panel surveys over-represent white,
better-educated, active Internet users (Chang & Krosnick,
2009; Dever, Rafferty, & Valliant, 2008; Malhotra & Krosnick,
2007, cited in Lehdonvirta, Oksanen, Rasanen and Blank
2020).

Introduction

The accuracy of a survey estimate refers to the closeness of
the estimate to the true population value. Where there is a
discrepancy between the value of the survey estimate and the
true population value, the difference between the two is
referred to as the error of the survey estimate. The total error
of the survey estimate results from two types of error:

   sampling error, which arises when only a part of the
      population is used to represent the whole population.
      Sampling error can be measured mathematically

   a non-sampling error can occur at any stage of a sample
      survey

   It is important for a researcher to be aware of these errors,
in particular non-sampling errors, so that they can be either
minimised or eliminated from the survey. An introduction
                                                       ERRORS IN RESEARCH | 171

to sampling error and non-sampling error is provided in the
following sections.

Sampling error

Sampling error reflects the difference between an estimate
(e.g., average) derived from a sample survey and the "true
value" (i.e., actual population average) that would be obtained
if the whole survey population was enumerated. It can be
measured from the population values, but as these are
unknown (or very difficult to calculate), it can also be
estimated from the sample data. It is important to consider
sampling error when publishing survey results as it gives an
indication of the accuracy of the estimate and therefore
reflects the importance that can be placed on interpretations.
If sampling principles are applied carefully within the
constraints of available resources, sampling error can be
accurately measured and kept to a minimum.

Factors Affecting Sampling Error

Sampling error is affected by a number of factors including
sample size, sample design, the sampling fraction, and the
variability within the population. In general, larger sample
172 | ERRORS IN RESEARCH

sizes decrease the sampling error, however, this decrease is not
directly proportional. As a rough rule of thumb, you need to
increase the sample size fourfold to halve the sampling error.
Of much lesser influence is the sampling fraction (the fraction
of the population size in the sample), but as the sample size
increases as a fraction of the population, the sampling error
should decrease.

   The population variability also affects the sampling error.
More variable populations give rise to larger errors as the
samples or the estimates calculated from different samples are
more likely to have greater variation. The effect of the
variability within the population can be reduced by increasing
the sample size to make it more representative of the survey
population. Various sample design options also affect the size
of the sampling error. For example, stratification reduces
sampling error whereas cluster sampling tends to increase it. A
sampling error can be estimated statistically and is used while
interpreting statistical results.

 Non-sampling error

  Non-sampling error is comprised of all other errors in the
  estimate (e.g., a sample average). These include all errors which
  occur due to reasons other than sample plan or sample size.
  Some examples of causes of non-sampling error are a low
  response rate to the questionnaire, a badly designed
  questionnaire, respondent bias, and processing errors. Non-
  sampling errors can occur at any stage of the process. These
  errors can be found in censuses and sample surveys.

     Sources of non-sampling errors are discussed below.

 Non-Response Bias

  Non-response refers to the situation when respondents either
  do not respond to any of the survey questions (i.e., total non-
  response) or do not respond to some survey questions owing
  to sensitive questions, recall problems, inability to answer, etc.
  (partial non-response). To improve response rates, care should

  watch?v=XE7QDfdaQ68>.
174 | ERRORS IN RESEARCH

be taken in designing the questionnaires, training interviewers,
assuring the respondent of confidentiality, and calling back at
different times if having difficulties contacting the respondent.
"Call-backs" are successful in reducing non-response but can
be expensive for personal interviews. A gentle email reminder
for online surveys is also used as a tool to improve survey
response rates.

Questionnaire problems

The content and wording of the questionnaire may be
misleading and the layout of the questionnaire may make it
difficult to accurately record responses. Questions should not
be loaded, double-barrelled, misleading, or ambiguous, and
should be directly relevant to the objectives of the survey.

   It is essential that questionnaires are tested on a sample of
respondents before they are finalised to identify questionnaire
flow and question-wording problems and allow sufficient time
for improvements to be made to the questionnaire. The
questionnaire should then be re-tested to ensure changes made
do not introduce other problems.

Respondent Bias

At times, respondents may provide inaccurate information as
                                                      ERRORS IN RESEARCH | 175

they believe they are protecting their personal interests and
integrity. Careful questionnaire design and effective
questionnaire testing can overcome these problems to some
extent. Given below are two types of situations that can be
avoided through better design and implementation of surveys.

   Sensitivity
      If respondents are faced with a question that they find
      embarrassing, they may refuse to answer, or choose a
      response that prevents them from having to continue
      with the questions. For example, if asked the question:
      "Are you taking any oral contraceptive pills for any
      reason?", and knowing that if they say "Yes" they will be
      asked for more details, respondents who are embarrassed
      by the question are likely to answer "No", even if this is
      incorrect.

   Fatigue
      Fatigue can be a problem in surveys that require a high
      level of commitment from respondents. For example,
      diary surveys where respondents have to record all
      expenses made in a two-week period. In these types of
      surveys, the level of accuracy and detail supplied may
      decrease as respondents become tired of recording all
      expenditures.
176 | ERRORS IN RESEARCH

Processing Errors

There are four stages in the processing of the data where errors
may occur: data grooming, data capture, editing, and
estimation. Data grooming involves preliminary checking
before entering the data onto the processing system in the
capture stage. Inadequate checking and quality management
at this stage can introduce data loss (where data is not entered
into the system) and data duplication (where the same data is
entered into the system more than once). Inappropriate edit
checks and inaccurate weights in the estimation procedure can
also introduce errors to the data. To minimise these errors,
processing staff should be given adequate training and realistic
workloads.

Misinterpretation of Results

This can occur if the researcher is not aware of certain factors
that influence the characteristics under investigation. A
researcher or any other user not involved in the collection stage
of the data gathering may be unaware of trends built into the
data due to the nature of the collection, such as its scope.
(eg. a survey which collected income as a data item with the
survey coverage and scope of all adult persons (ie. 18 years
or older), would expect to produce a different estimate than
that produced by the ABS Survey of Average Weekly Earnings
                                                         ERRORS IN RESEARCH | 177

  (AWE) simply because AWE includes persons of age 16 and
  17 years as part of its scope). Researchers should carefully
  investigate the methodology used in any given survey.

 Time Period Bias

  This occurs when a survey is conducted during an
  unrepresentative time period. For example, if a survey aims
  to collect details on ice-cream sales, but only collects a week's
  worth of data during the hottest part of summer, it is unlikely
  to represent the average weekly sales of ice cream for the year.

 Minimising non-sampling error

  Non-sampling error can be difficult to measure accurately, but
  it can be minimised by

178 | ERRORS IN RESEARCH

   careful selection of the time the survey is conducted,
   using an up-to-date and accurate sampling frame,
   planning for follow up of non-respondents,
   careful questionnaire design,
   providing thorough training for interviewers and

      processing staff and
   being aware of all the factors affecting the topic under

      consideration.

   Since many surveys suffer from poor response rates, we have
especially discussed ways of reducing non-response from the
potential respondents.
                                                      ERRORS IN RESEARCH | 179

Minimising Non-Response

Response rates can be improved through good survey design
via short, simple questions, good forms design techniques and
explaining survey purposes and uses. Assurances of
confidentiality are very important as many respondents are
unwilling to respond due to a fear of lack of privacy. Targeted
follow-ups on non-contacts or those initially unable to reply
can increase response rates significantly. Following are some
hints on how to minimise refusals in a personal or phone
contact:

   Find out the reasons for refusal and try to talk through
      them

   Use positive language
   State how and what you plan to do to help with the

      questionnaire
   Stress the importance of the survey
   Explain the importance of their response as a

      representative of other units
   Emphasise the benefits from the survey results, explain

      how they can obtain results
   Give assurance of the confidentiality of the responses

Other measures that can improve respondent cooperation and
maximise response include:
180 | ERRORS IN RESEARCH

   Public awareness activities include discussions with key
      organisations and interest groups, news releases, media
      interviews, and articles. This is aimed at informing the
      community about the survey, identifying issues of
      concern, and addressing them.

   Advice to selected units by letter, giving them advance
      notice and explaining the purposes of the survey and
      how the survey is going to be conducted.

In the case of a mail survey, most of the points above can
be stated in an introductory letter or through a publicity
campaign.

Allowing for Non-Response

Where response rates are still low after all reasonable attempts
of follow-up are undertaken, you can reduce bias by using
population benchmarks to post-stratify the sample, intensive
follow-up of a subsample of the non-respondents, or
imputation for item non-response (non-response to a
particular question).

   The main aim of imputation is to produce consistent data
without going back to the respondent for the correct values
thus reducing both respondent burden and costs associated
with the survey. Broadly speaking the imputation methods fall
into three groups:
                                                      ERRORS IN RESEARCH | 181

   the imputed value is derived from other information
      supplied by the unit;

   values by other units can be used to derive a value for the
      non-respondent (e.g., average);

   an exact value of another unit (called the donor) is used
      as a value for the non-respondent (called recipient);

When deciding on the method of imputation it is desirable to
know what effect will imputation have on the final estimates.
If a large amount of imputation is performed the results can
be misleading, particularly if the imputation used distorts the
distribution of data.

   If at the planning stage it is believed that there is likely to
be a high non-response rate, then the sample size could be
increased to allow for this. However, the non-response bias will
not be overcome by just increasing the sample size, particularly
if the non-responding units have different characteristics from
the responding units. Post-stratification and imputation also
fail to totally eliminate non-response bias from the results.

Example: Effect of Non-Response

Suppose a postal survey of 3421 fruit growers was run to
estimate the average number of fruit trees on a farm. There was
an initial period for response and following low response rates,
182 | ERRORS IN RESEARCH

two series of follow-up reminders were sent out. The response
and results were as follows:

                         Response Ave. no. of Trees

Initial Response         300           456

Added after 1 follow up reminder 543   382

Added after 2 follow up reminders 434  340

Total Response           1277

After two follow-up reminders, there was still only a 37%
response rate. From other information, it was known that the
overall average was 329. The result based on this survey would
have been:

Initial Response         Cumulative    Combined
                         Response      Average
Added after 1 follow up  300           456
reminder
                         843           408
Added after 2 follow up
reminders                1277          385

If results had been published without any follow-up then the
average number of trees would have been too high as farms
with a greater number of trees appeared to have responded
more readily. With follow-up, smaller farms sent back survey
forms and the estimate became closer to the true value.

 What is a research panel?

  A research panel is a group of people who have agreed to
  participate in future research studies after having been pre-
  screened and pre-profiled, then given clear expectations about
  the types of research to be conducted, the frequency, and the
  types and amounts of compensation or incentives to be
  offered. These days most of the research panels are based
  online. "Proprietary panels" refers to those research panels
  which are owned by a panel provider. This organisation is
  responsible for building and maintaining the panel. The panel
  owner is responsible for the `quality' of the panel, ensuring
  that the panel is regularly validated and `refreshed'.

     The main benefit of using a research panel is the ease and
  speed of accessing potential survey respondents. The overall
  per head cost of surveying people can be low in comparison
  to other methods. Moreover, researchers have the ability to
  recruit potential respondents from all across the world. This
  can be especially useful when marketers are planning to
  operate in new regions. Finally, online panels offer greater
  privacy and confidentiality to respondents. Therefore, it is

1. https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/vector-emotion-feedback-scale-on-

  easier to discuss sensitive topics (e.g., a medical condition) or
  recruit hidden populations (such as members of the LGBTQ+
  community). 2

     There are four main issues that have been identified by
  researchers and practitioners in using research panels.

    The first one refers to `professional survey-takers' who
 intentionally participate in surveys frequently.
 Such survey-takers are bound to respond
 differently to survey questions than other
 respondent groups. Panel providers are
 encouraged to participation-rates in their panel.
 Similarly, the reimbursement rate (such as a movie
 ticket or $10 or donation to favourite charity) to
 panel members needs to be made available so
 clients can evaluate the incentive behind
 respondent participation.

     The second issue relates to the `representativeness' of an
  online panel. While this used to be an issue during the early
  days of the internet, it is useful to still give it some
  consideration. With widespread access to online data, the
  digital divide is becoming smaller. In Australia, 99% of adults
  have access to the internet 4. Researchers are now more

188 | RESEARCH PANELS

confident of finding greater representation of the overall
population in online panels since internet access is no longer
bound by age, education, income or cultural/linguistic
background. However, researchers may still want to examine
whether an online panel has sufficient representation of a
specific population. For example, if a study requires the
recruitment of "housewives living in Sydney AND who were
born in Sudan" may need to be discussed with the panel
provider.

   The next point relates to the `health' of the online panel
As with all databases, it is not enough to simply have a list of
people willing to respond to surveys and interview questions.
A constant review and monitoring of the panel is required.
If this is not done, then there is a risk of possessing a panel
with outdated member information. Panel members' profiles
change all the time. People move away, switch jobs, get
married, have children, develop new opinions, and alter
previously held beliefs. Unless there is a mechanism to refresh
and update information about panel members, there is a
greater chance of `non-response', as the panel will not fit with
the required respondent profile. There are some practitioners
who feel regular recruiting of new panel members may solve
the problem. While increasing the panel size is a good selling
                                                             RESEARCH PANELS | 189

  point, it is more cost-effective to update the information of
  existing members than recruit new ones5.

     Finally, there is a concern about the `quality of data'
  generated from online panels as recruited panel members may
  not fully engage with the survey content, not make an effort
  in thinking about survey questions or have a general lack of
  inattentiveness. While this is an important issue, it is also easy
  to identify such errant survey takers. Panel providers can
  discuss criteria with clients and delete responses from
  `speeders' (i.e., those respondents who complete a survey in
  an impossibly quick time) and `straight-liners' (i.e., those
  respondents who repetitively select the same option for all
  survey questions. This is especially common for a survey with
  a Likert-scale type of questions. Any buyers of online panels
  want to be assured that the integrity of the panel is maintained
  by removing any members who are found to display such
  behaviour repeatedly.

 Panels

  The four stages of the panel-management process are6:

      Recruitment of panellists
      Selection of a sample
      Panel monitoring and maintenance
      Panel engagement

 Recruitment of panellists:

  The main recruitment method used to build a panel is referred
  to as the `opt-in method' (Goritz 2007, as cited in Kahn 2012).
  With `opt-in' or `volunteer' panels there is usually no
  restriction on who can participate. Ideally, a panel should be
  constructed by using a range of methods (both online and
  offline) used to recruit participants. Usually, interested
  individuals are directed toward the panel organisation's
  website where panel-related terms and conditions can be
  found. Potential respondents are asked to fill in a registration
  form that automatically generates a socio-demographic

database. By applying different recruitment methods, perhaps
with collaboration with diverse affiliate partners, the resulting
panel is bound to be more diverse and representative than the
one based on a limited source of member recruitment.

Selection of a sample:

A sample is selected as per the requirements of the research
project. It is always useful to discuss the respondent profile
with the panel provider beforehand. For instance, if the
researcher specifically wants to survey "Sydney-based
Indonesian-born mothers with school-going children", not all
online panels might comprise this population group.

   Quota sampling is often undertaken while selecting an
online panel sample. The researcher may decide that he/she
wants an equal split between males and females. Even if more
female panel members are available to respond to a survey, they
will not be included in case the quota limit has been reached.

Panel monitoring and maintenance:

One of the signs of a good panel provider is its strategies
regarding the monitoring and maintenance of its online panel.
To ensure the quality of the panel, it needs to be ensured
that members are `active'. Moreover, any members found to be
192 | RESEARCH PANELS

`speeders' or `straight liners' are given warnings and removed
from the panel, if such behavior continues. The panel provider
must also have policies to prevent `over-use' of panel members.
For instance, no respondent should be attempting a survey
more than once a month. Similarly, if a panel is already
responding to a survey they should not be asked to do another
survey simultaneously.

   Over a period of time, panel members may become inactive
because of a loss of interest, a lack of appreciation for the
amount of work involved, or a change in household
circumstances. Other reasons like natural mortality, invalid
email addresses, and member concerns with data security may
also contribute to members' inactivity. It is useful for the
service provider to monitor the panel for any such signs and to
explore options for keeping the panel alive and healthy.

Panel engagement:

Similar to the way companies engage with their employees,
engaging with panel members is also important. While the
respondents are often provided with a (financial or other)
incentive, it is recognised that strong respondent cooperation
needed for data quality is something that cannot be paid for.
Online panel providers need to manage their panels by
building trust and commitment through multi-channel levels
                                                          RESEARCH PANELS | 193

of communication such as via personal contact, newsletters
and telephone calls. This is also an opportunity to `train' the
respondents in good practice by clearly communicating the
researcher's expectations and the importance of generating
good quality data.

 Survey Distribution for Data
 Collection

  There can be a number of ways surveys can be distributed for
  collecting data. These are the most commonly used methods.

Choosing a Data Collection
Method

A number of factors may play a role in selecting the most
appropriate data collection method(s). These are discussed
below:

Time:

Organisations have tight deadlines to meet. Researchers are
under pressure to provide information. This often means that
only those methods (such as an online survey or a telephone
interview) can be used for data collection which has a quick
turnaround. More traditional methods, such as in-home
surveys are not appropriate at this stage.
198 | SURVEY DISTRIBUTION METHODS

Cost:

The researcher has to keep in mind the funds available. In
case there is a big budget for research, then it is quite feasible
to employ field workers who collect data in malls, offices, or
homes. If there is a limited budget, then the researcher may
have to rely on survey distribution modes that are cost-
efficient, such as hosting the survey on the company's social
media platform.

Access to Population Groups:

The quickest and most cost-effective data collection method
becomes useless if the right population group cannot be
reached. This is one of the key points which needs to be
considered while selecting a method to distribute a survey
questionnaire. A group of university students in Iran could
be accessible using in-person methods, while in Australia
alternative strategies may need to be employed.

Suitability (for Research Aim):

If a survey is designed so respondents can view certain images,
then a telephone interview may not be an appropriate method.
Similarly, if a questionnaire expects respondents to access a
link or a website, it is important that the right data collection
methods are employed.

  Descriptive statistics refers to a set of techniques for
  summarizing and displaying data (of a sample). Let us assume

here that the data are quantitative and consist of scores on one
or more variables for each of several study participants. We
begin by looking at some of the most common techniques for
describing single variables.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF A
VARIABLE

Every variable has a distribution, which is the way the scores
are distributed across the levels of that variable. For example,
in a sample of 100 college students, the distribution of the
variable "number of siblings" might be such that 10 of them
have no siblings, 30 have one sibling, 40 have two siblings, and
so on. In the same sample, the distribution of the variable "sex"
might be such that 44 have a score of "male" and 56 have a
score of "female."
                                                  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 203

FREQUENCY TABLES

One way to display the distribution of a variable is in
a frequency table. Table 12.1 "Frequency Table Showing a
Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the Rosenberg Self-
Esteem Scale", for example, is a frequency table showing a
hypothetical distribution of scores on the Rosenberg Self-
Esteem Scale for a sample of 40 college students. The first
column lists the values of the variable--the possible scores on
the Rosenberg scale--and the second column lists the
frequency of each score. This table shows that there were three
students who had self-esteem scores of 24, five who had self-
esteem scores of 23, and so on. From a frequency table like this,
one can quickly see several important aspects of distribution,
including the range of scores (from 15 to 24), the most and
least common scores (22 and 17, respectively), and any extreme
scores that stand out from the rest.

15  1

   There are a few other points worth noting about frequency
tables. First, the levels listed in the first column usually go from
the highest at the top to the lowest at the bottom, and they
usually do not extend beyond the highest and lowest scores in
                                                  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 205

the data. For example, although scores on the Rosenberg scale
can vary from a high of 30 to a low of 0, Table 12.1 "Frequency
Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale" only includes levels from 24 to
15 because that range includes all the scores in this particular
data set. Second, when there are many different scores across
a wide range of values, it is often better to create a grouped
frequency table, in which the first column lists ranges of values
and the second column lists the frequency of scores in each
range. Table 12.2 "A Grouped Frequency Table Showing a
Hypothetical Distribution of Reaction Times", for example, is
a grouped frequency table showing a hypothetical distribution
of simple reaction times for a sample of 20 participants. In a
grouped frequency table, the ranges must all be of equal width,
and there are usually between five and 15 of them. Finally,
frequency tables can also be used for categorical variables, in
which case the levels are category labels. The order of the
category labels is somewhat arbitrary, but they are often listed
from the most frequent at the top to the least frequent at the
bottom.

HISTOGRAMS

A histogram is a graphical display of a distribution. It presents
the same information as a frequency table but in a way that is
                                                  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 207

even quicker and easier to grasp. The histogram in Figure 12.1
"Histogram Showing the Distribution of Self-Esteem Scores
Presented in " presents the distribution of self-esteem scores
in Table 12.1 "Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical
Distribution of Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale".
The x-axis of the histogram represents the variable and
the y-axis represents frequency. Above each level of the variable
on the x-axis is a vertical bar that represents the number of
individuals with that score. When the variable is quantitative,
as in this example, there is usually no gap between the bars.
When the variable is categorical, however, there is usually a
small gap between them. (The gap at 17 in this histogram
reflects the fact that there were no scores of 17 in this data set).

DISTRIBUTION SHAPES

When the distribution of a quantitative variable is displayed
in a histogram, it has a shape. The shape of the distribution
of self-esteem scores in Figure 12.1 "Histogram Showing the
Distribution of Self-Esteem Scores Presented in " is typical.
There is a peak somewhere near the middle of the distribution
and "tails" that taper in either direction from the peak. The
distribution of Figure 12.1 "Histogram Showing the
Distribution of Self-Esteem Scores Presented in " is unimodal,
meaning it has one distinct peak, but distributions can also
be bimodal, meaning they have two distinct peaks. Figure 12.2
"Histogram Showing a Hypothetical Bimodal Distribution of
Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory", for example, shows
a hypothetical bimodal distribution of scores on the Beck
Depression Inventory. Distributions can also have more than
two distinct peaks, but these are relatively rare in psychological
research.

HYPOTHETICAL
BIMODAL DISTRIBUTION

INVENTORY

   Another characteristic of the shape of a distribution is
whether it is symmetrical or skewed. The distribution in the
center of Figure 12.3 "Histograms Showing Negatively
Skewed, Symmetrical, and Positively Skewed
                                                   DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 211

Distributions" is symmetrical. Its left and right halves are
mirror images of each other. The distribution on the left is
negatively skewed, with its peak shifted toward the upper end
of its range and a relatively long negative tail. The distribution
on the right is positively skewed, with its peak toward the lower
end of its range and a relatively long positive tail.

DISTRIBUTIONS
212 | DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

   An outlier is an extreme score that is much higher or lower
than the rest of the scores in the distribution. Sometimes
outliers represent truly extreme scores on the variable of
interest. For example, on the Beck Depression Inventory, a
single clinically depressed person might be an outlier in a
sample of otherwise happy and high-functioning peers.
However, outliers can also represent errors or
misunderstandings on the part of the researcher or participant,
equipment malfunctions, or similar problems. We will say
more about how to interpret outliers and what to do about
them later in this chapter.

MEASURES OF CENTRAL
TENDENCY AND
VARIABILITY

It is also useful to be able to describe the characteristics of
distribution more precisely. Here we look at how to do this in
                                                   DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 213

terms of two important characteristics: their central tendency
and their variability.

CENTRAL TENDENCY

The central tendency of a distribution is its middle--the point
around which the scores in the distribution tend to cluster.
(Another term for central tendency is average.) Looking back
at Figure 12.1 "Histogram Showing the Distribution of Self-
Esteem Scores Presented in ", for example, we can see that the
self-esteem scores tend to cluster around the values of 20 to
22. Here we will consider the three most common measures of
central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode.

   The mean of a distribution (symbolized M) is the sum of
the scores divided by the number of scores. As a formula, it
looks like this:

   M=XN.
   In this formula, the symbol  (the Greek letter sigma) is
the summation sign and means to sum across the values of
the variable X. N represents the number of scores. The mean
is by far the most common measure of central tendency, and
there are some good reasons for this. It usually provides a good
indication of the central tendency of a distribution, and it is
214 | DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

easily understood by most people. In addition, the mean has
statistical properties that make it especially useful in doing
inferential statistics.

   An alternative to the mean is the median. The median is the
middle score in the sense that half the scores in the distribution
are less than it and half are greater than it. The simplest way to
find the median is to organize the scores from lowest to highest
and locate the score in the middle. Consider, for example, the
following set of seven scores:

   8 4 12 14 3 2 3

   To find the median, simply rearrange the scores from lowest
to highest and locate the one in the middle.

   2 3 3 4 8 12 14
   In this case, the median is 4 because there are three scores
lower than 4 and three scores higher than 4. When there is an
even number of scores, there are two scores in the middle of
the distribution, in which case the median is the value halfway
between them. For example, if we were to add a score of 15 to
the preceding data set, there would be two scores (both 4 and
8) in the middle of the distribution, and the median would be
halfway between them (6).

   One final measure of central tendency is the mode.
The mode is the most frequent score in a distribution. In the
self-esteem distribution presented in Table 12.1 "Frequency
Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the
                                                   DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 215

Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale" and Figure 12.1 "Histogram
Showing the Distribution of Self-Esteem Scores Presented in ",
for example, the mode is 22. More students had that score than
any other. The mode is the only measure of central tendency
that can also be used for categorical variables.

   In a distribution that is both unimodal and symmetrical,
the mean, median, and mode will be very close to each other
at the peak of the distribution. In a bimodal or asymmetrical
distribution, the mean, median, and mode can be quite
different. In a bimodal distribution, the mean and median will
tend to be between the peaks, while the mode will be at the
tallest peak. In a skewed distribution, the mean will differ from
the median in the direction of the skew (i.e., the direction of
the longer tail). For highly skewed distributions, the mean can
be pulled so far in the direction of the skew that it is no longer
a good measure of the central tendency of that distribution.
Imagine, for example, a set of four simple reaction times of
200, 250, 280, and 250 milliseconds (ms). The mean is 245
ms. But the addition of one more score of 5,000 ms--perhaps
because the participant was not paying attention--would raise
the mean to 1,445 ms. Not only is this measure of central
tendency greater than 80% of the scores in the distribution,
but it also does not seem to represent the behavior of anyone
in the distribution very well. This is why researchers often
prefer the median for highly skewed distributions (such as
distributions of reaction times).

   Keep in mind, though, that you are not required to choose a
216 | DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

single measure of central tendency in analyzing your data. Each
one provides slightly different information, and all of them can
be useful.

MEASURES OF
VARIABILITY

The variability of a distribution is the extent to which the
scores vary around their central tendency. Consider the two
distributions in Figure 12.4 "Histograms Showing
Hypothetical Distributions With the Same Mean, Median,
and Mode (10) but With Low Variability (Top) and High
Variability (Bottom)", both of which have the same central
tendency. The mean, median, and mode of each distribution
are 10. Notice, however, that the two distributions differ in
terms of their variability. The top one has relatively low
variability, with all the scores relatively close to the center. The
bottom one has relatively high variability, with the scores being
spread across a much greater range.

HYPOTHETICAL
DISTRIBUTIONS WITH
THE SAME MEAN,
MEDIAN, AND MODE (10)
BUT WITH LOW
VARIABILITY (TOP) AND
HIGH VARIABILITY
(BOTTOM)
218 | DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

One simple measure of variability is the range, which is simply
the difference between the highest and lowest scores in the
distribution. The range of the self-esteem scores in Table 12.1
"Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of
Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale", for example, is
the difference between the highest score (24) and the lowest
score (15). That is, the range is 24 - 15 = 9. Although the
range is easy to compute and understand, it can be misleading
when there are outliers. Imagine, for example, an exam on
which all the students scored between 90 and 100. It has a
                                                  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS | 219

range of 10. But if there was a single student who scored 20,
the range would increase to 80--giving the impression that
the scores were quite variable when in fact only one student
differed substantially from the rest.

   By far the most common measure of variability is the
standard deviation. The standard deviation of a distribution
is, roughly speaking, the average distance between the scores
and the mean. For example, the standard deviations of the
distributions in Figure 12.4 "Histograms Showing
Hypothetical Distributions With the Same Mean, Median,
and Mode (10) but With Low Variability (Top) and High
Variability (Bottom)" are 1.69 for the top distribution and
4.30 for the bottom one. That is, while the scores in the top
distribution differ from the mean by about 1.69 units on
average, the scores in the bottom distribution differ from the
mean by about 4.30 units on average.

   The computations for the standard deviation are illustrated
for a small set of data in Table 12.3 "Computations for the
Standard Deviation". The first column is a set of eight scores
that has a mean of 5. The second column is the difference
between each score and the mean. The third column is the
square of each of these differences. Notice that although the
differences can be negative, the squared differences are always
positive--meaning that the standard deviation is always
positive. At the bottom of the third column is the mean of
220 | DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

the squared differences, which is also called
the variance (symbolized SD2). Although the variance is itself
a measure of variability, it generally plays a larger role in
inferential statistics than in descriptive statistics. Finally, below
the variance is the square root of the variance, which is the
standard deviation.

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:
           understand the concept of association (or

             variables

   While analysing data, researchers are interested in finding
out the association (or relationship) between different types of
variables. Two types of association are of particular interest:

   Association between categorical/nominal/ordinal
      variables

   Association between interval/continuous variables
  224 | ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VARIABLES

 Association between categorical
 variables

  Sometimes a researcher wants to understand the relationship
  between categorical variables, which are also referred to as
  nominal or ordinal variables. Examples of such variables
  include gender, age categories, occupation, and brand
  preferences. Such associations can are explored via:

     a) cross-tabulation and/or,
     b) the chi-square test

 a) Cross-tabulation

  A cross-tabulation table is simply a frequency distribution for
  two variables together. A crosstab is a matrix that shows the
  distribution of one variable for each category of a second
  variable.2

     To run a crosstab on SPSS, go to: Analyze, Descriptive

   What does this crosstab mean? This is relatively easy to
interpret. 28.7% of males and 29.4% of females claimed that
they are very happy. But what about a crosstab that has many
attributes? For example, what if you wanted to analyze the
relationship between the number of children that you have
and your general happiness? This is the output of that analysis:
  228 | ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VARIABLES

 b) Chi-square test

  While cross-tabulation is simply a frequency/percentage table
  for two variables, the Chi-Square test is undertaken to examine
  if the results of the cross-tabulation are statistically significant.
  The Chi-square test is a non-parametric test used to determine
  whether there is a statistically significant association between
  two categorical variables. 3

includes this information in footnote `a'; none of our cells
have a frequency less than 5 and therefore we have not
violated this chi-square assumption.

   Now look at the "Pearson Chi-Square Asymp. Sig (2
sided)"*. Since Chi-Square is testing the null hypothesis, the
Sig value must be .05 or less for there to be a significant
statistical for the relationship between the variables. In this
example, the Sig. is .001, so there is very strong statical
significance for the relationship between gender and political
party identification.

Association between interval/
continuous variables

When the aim is to explore the relationship between two
variables which are measured on an interval/ratio scale, then
researchers use the correlation test.

 Pearson's correlation

  A hypothesis test of Pearson's correlation coefficient is used
  to determine whether there is a statistically significant linear
  correlation between two continuous variables (for example,
  dollars spent on groceries and a consumer's age - in years). 5

     To calculate Pearson's r, go to Analyze, Correlate, Bivariate.
  Enter your two variables. For example, we can examine the
  correlation between two continuous variables, "Age" and
  "TVhours" (the number of tv viewing hours per day). Your
  screen should look like this:

236 | ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VARIABLES

   Click OK. Look in your output for the following:
   Note that the Pearson's r value for comparing age to age is
1, suggesting perfect correlation. If you think about this, that
                                  ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VARIABLES | 237

makes logical sense. What you are truly interested in examining
is the Pearson's r value of the 2 different variables (in this case,
the value is .139). This suggests that someone ages, they watch
more television.

   Here are guidelines for interpreting the strength of
association for Lambda, Gamma, and Pearson's r (remember,
lambda can only have a positive value):

Strength of Association                  Value of Lambda, Gamma,
None                                     0.00
Weak association                         + .01- .09
Moderate Association                     + .10 - .29
Evident of strong association            + .30 - .99
Perfect association, strongest possible  + 1.00

DIFFERENCES

RESPONDENT GROUPS

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:
           understand the difference between an
             independent samples t-test and ANOVA
           interpret the output from these tests

 One sample t-test

  A one-sample t-test is used to test whether the sample mean
  of a continuous variable is significantly different to a `test
  value' (some hypothesised value). For example, you would use
  it if you had a sample of student final marks and you wanted
  to test whether they came from a population where the mean
  final mark was equal to a previous year's mean of 70. In this
  case, the hypotheses would be:

     H0: The sample comes from a population with a mean final
  mark of 70 (final mark=70)
  HA: The sample does not come from a population with a
  mean final mark of 70 (final mark70)

     Before conducting a one-sample t-test you need to check
  that the following assumptions are valid:

1. Curtin University 2021, Inferential statistics, viewed 11 May 2022,

  inferential#s-lg-box-wrapper-25242003>
                DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS | 241

   Assumption 1: The sample is a random sample that is
representative of the population.

   Assumption 2: The observations are independent, i.e.
measurements for one subject have no bearing on any other
subject's measurements.

   Assumption 3: The variable is normally distributed, or the
sample size is large enough to ensure normality of the sampling
distribution.

   If the last assumption of normality is violated, or if you
have an ordinal variable rather than a continuous one (such as
final grades of F, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), the one-sample Wilcoxon
signed-rank test should be used instead.

   Assuming the assumptions for the one-sample t-test are met
though, and the test is conducted using statistical software (e.g.
SPSS as in this example), the results should look something like
the following:

   Note that the first of these tables displays the descriptive
statistics, which you should observe first in order to get an idea
242 | DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS

of what is happening in the sample. For example, the sample
mean is 73.125 as compared to the test value of 70, giving a
difference of 3.125 (this value can be calculated, or it is also
displayed in the second table). To test whether or not this
difference is statistically significant requires the second table
though and in particular the p-value (which in this table is
listed as `Sig. (2-tailed)') and the confidence interval for the
difference. In terms of the p-value:

   If p.05 we reject H0, meaning the sample has come
      from a population with a mean significantly different to
      the test value.

   If p>.05 we do not reject H0, meaning the sample has
      come from a population with a mean that is not
      significantly different to the test value.

In this case, our p-value of .03 shows that the difference is
statistically significant.

                   An interactive H5P element has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You
                   can view it online here:

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/customer-
        insights/?p=60#h5p-36

   This is confirmed by the confidence interval of
(.3217, 5.9283), for the difference between the population
mean and our test value (70). Because this confidence interval
does not contain zero, it again shows that the difference is
statistically significant. In fact, we are 95% confident that the
true population mean is between .3217 and 5.9283 points
higher than our test value.

   Note that while the test statistic (t) and degrees of freedom
(df) should both generally be reported as part of your results,
you do not need to interpret these when assessing the
significance of the difference.

   If you would like to practise interpreting the results of a one
sample t-test for statistical significance, have a go at one or both
of the following activities:

Independent samples t-test

An independent samples t-test is used to test whether there
244 | DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS

is a significant difference in sample means for a continuous
variable for two independent groups. For example, you would
use it if you collected data on hours spent watching TV each
week, and you wanted to test if there was a significant
difference in the mean hours for males and females. In this
case, the hypotheses would be:

   H0: There is no significant difference in TV hours per week
for males and females (males=females,
or males-females=0)
HA: There is a significant difference in TV hours per week for
males and females (malesfemales, or males-females0)

   Before conducting an independent samples t-test you need
to check that the following assumptions are valid:

   Assumption 1: The sample is a random sample that is
representative of the population.

   Assumption 2: The observations are independent, i.e.
measurements for one subject have no bearing on any other
subject's measurements.

   Assumption 3: The variable is normally distributed for
both groups, or the sample size is large enough to ensure the
normality of the sampling distribution.

   If the last assumption of normality is violated, or if you
have an ordinal variable rather than a continuous one (such as
                DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS | 245

hours recorded in ranges), the Mann-Whitney U test should
be used instead.

   Assuming the assumptions for the independent samples t-
test are met though, and the test is conducted using statistical
software (e.g. SPSS as in this example), the results should look
something like the following:

   Note that the first of these tables displays the descriptive
statistics, which you should observe first in order to get an
idea of what is happening in the sample. For example, the
difference between the sample means for males and females
is 1.70833 (this value can be calculated from the means in the
first table, and is also displayed in the second table - the fact
that it is negative is simply because females watched more TV
than males).

   Next, note that there are actually three p values (and two
confidence intervals) in the second table; one is used in the
situation where the variances for the two groups are
approximately equal (the one in the `Sig. (2-tailed)' column in
the top row of the table), one is used in the situation where the
variances for the two groups are not approximately equal (the
one in the `Sig. (2-tailed)' column in the bottom row of the
table), and the other one (the first one in the table, in the `Sig.'
column) is used to determine which situation we have.
246 | DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS

   We need to interpret the latter first; this p-value is for
Levene's Test for Equality of Variances, for which the null
hypothesis is that there are equal variances. Hence, if p.05 it
is evidence to reject this null hypothesis and assume unequal
variances, while if p>.05 it is evidence to fail to reject this null
hypothesis and assume equal variances. Depending on which is
which, determines which of the other p values (and confidence
intervals) you should interpret. In this case, the p-value of .966
means we can assume equal variances and should interpret the
p-value in the top row of the remainder of the table. Again, the
interpretation of this p-value is that:

   If p.05 we reject H0, meaning the means of the two
      groups are significantly different.

   If p>.05 we do not reject H0, meaning the means of the
      two groups are not significantly different.

   In this case, our p-value of .564 (in the top row of the
remainder of the table) shows that the difference between the
means is not statistically significant.

   This is confirmed by the confidence interval of
(-7.654, 4.238) for the difference between the means. Because
this confidence interval contains zero it again means the
      DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS | 247

difference is not statistically significant. We are 95% confident

that the difference in mean hours spent watching TV each

week  for  males                 and  females  is

between -7.654 and 4.238 hours.

   Note that while the test statistic (t) and degrees of freedom
(df) should both generally be reported as part of your results,
you do not need to interpret these when assessing the
significance of the difference.

   If you would like to practise interpreting the results of an
independent samples t-test for statistical significance, have a go
at one or both of the following activities:

One-way ANOVA

One-way ANOVA is similar to the independent samples t-
test but is used when three or more groups are compared.
For example, comparing the mean weights of people who do
no exercise, who do moderate exercise and who do lots of
exercises.

   The null hypothesis for a one-way ANOVA states that all
the population means are equal, while the alternative
hypothesis states that at least one of them is different.
248 | DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESPONDENT GROUPS

   Before conducting a one-way ANOVA you need to check
that the following assumptions are valid:

   Assumption 1: The sample is a random sample that is
representative of the population.

   Assumption 2: The observations are independent, i.e.
measurements for one subject have no bearing on any other
subject's measurements.

   Assumption 3: The variable is normally distributed for
each of the groups, or the sample size is large enough to ensure
normality of the sampling distribution.

   Assumption 4: The populations being compared have
equal variances.

   If a one-way ANOVA is conducted and it turns out that at
least one of the means is different, you will need to investigate
further to determine where the difference lies using post hoc
tests, for example Tukey's HSD.

What is sentiment analysis?

   Sentiment analysis in marketing is the process of
determining people's opinions about a product or a company
by analysing public's comments on various online platforms.
Besides leaving comments on an organisation's own website,
online users may also provide feedback and engage in
discussions, and conversations on a variety of different
platforms. Examples of such platforms include social media
websites (e.g., Instagram), knowledge platforms (such as
Quora), media sharing platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo,
                                                      SENTIMENT ANALYSIS | 251

Spotify), service-providing platforms (e.g., Uber, Airbnb), and
several shopping websites (e.g., Amazon). In the olden times,
this concept was known as `product reviews'. However, now
with the amount of information being generated, analysts are
able to `crawl' the web and mine relevant data. Online
statements or customer comments are turned into categorical
data (like "positive", "negative" or "neutral"), and summarised
to give a manager a bird's eye view of how the general public is
responding to their brand or product.

   While sentiments may also be revealed in customer
conversations with an organisation's call center, much of the
research in this area has focused on analysing people's written
comments online.

Advantages in Using Sentiment
Analysis

   Gauging public sentiment has never been easier, quicker,
cheaper, and less biased. Sophisticated tools have made
sentiment analysis accessible to many businesses. Marketers are
able to make swift changes to their campaigns (e.g., changing
the music being played in an ad by Expedia) in view of the
`sentiment' being expressed. In comparison, using traditional
tools of research would be prohibitively expensive and time-
252 | SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

consuming. Moreover, the results would also be prone to a
degree of human error.

   Sentiment analysis can help reveal `influencers' for a brand
or a product. While many companies are able to `recruit' social
media influencers to market their brands, it is quite possible
that a brand already has a cohort of loyal supporters. These
are the people who are a brand's advocates and are able to
influence others through their comments. While social media
influencers are often viewed as people with a huge following,
there is now a realisation that `micro-influencers' are also
important. The number of followers for micro-influencers
may be relatively small, yet their bond with their followers is
strong. This could be critical when people are seeking sincere
advice on matters which are important to them.

   Similar to the above point, it is equally important to be able
to identify hate speech online, especially when it involves the
brand or any of its key values. Brand hate is different from
other negative sentiments such as mere disappointment,
dissatisfaction, or frustration. There could be different levels
of brand hate with the most extreme one leading to brand
bullying. People who display such a strong negative sentiment
are also likely to indulge in negative online word of mouth,
online public complaining, and driving boycott campaigns.
Sentiment analysis is useful in highlighting such a trend, even
if it is only limited to a certain group. Strategies to navigate
                                                      SENTIMENT ANALYSIS | 253

through such consumer negativity in the digital world is
critical.

Steps in sentiment analysis

   Below is a simple process through which sentiment analysis
could be undertaken:

 1. Detecting sentiment
      This is the most basic level of conducting sentiment
      analysis. It simply provides a quick overview of the
      overall opinion of customers. This means growing
254 | SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

      through online comments and extracting opinionated
      data (such as "I love this!"). In comparison, there could
      be other types of data such as objective data (like "the
      restaurant is located downtown"), which may not
      display any consumer sentiment at all

   2. Categorising sentiment and identifying the
intensity
This step involves detecting whether the sentiment is positive,
negative, or neutral. Depending on the type of software being
used, managers may also add weighting to these categories, e.g.,

   very positive
   somewhat positive
   neutral
   somewhat negative
   very negative

   These categories demonstrate the intensity of the sentiment

   3. Mixed Connotation
Sometimes, the text contains mixed or ambivalent opinions,
for example, "staff was very friendly but we waited too long
to be served". One would need to separately interpret such
                                                         SENTIMENT ANALYSIS | 255

  statements which might be difficult for a simple machine-
  based program to code and analyse

 Limitations of sentiment
 analysis

  Below are a few, key limitations of sentiment analysis tools as
  recognized in the industry:

  May 2022, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUyUaouisZE/>.
256 | SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

   Machine-dependent sentiment analysis is based on the
      way people use language to express their opinions. A
      word's meaning in the dictionary could be very different
      from the way people use it in everyday conversations.
      Sentiment analysis may run into issues when online
      users utter phrases to display sarcasm

   It is still felt that sentiment analysis is most effective
      when it is used with large and numerous data sets. Small
      businesses may find that there is not much data available
      for their products/services which can be effectively
      analysed

   Moreover, sentiment analysis is not a one-off activity. It
      has to be integrated into a firm's information-gathering
      strategy. To get real value out of sentiment analysis tools,
      one needs to analyse large quantities of textual data on a
      regular basis

computing costs, the availability of big data, and the advance
of machine learning algorithms and models. We see wide
applications of AI in various areas of marketing. For example,
Amazon.com's Prime Air uses drones to automate shipping
and delivery. Domino's pizza is experimenting with
autonomous cars and delivery robots to deliver pizza to the
customer's door.

   Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence
demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural
intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Artificial
Intelligence is, machines behaving intelligently and
undertaking problem-solving or completing tasks. It is a very
broad subject that involves computer science, cognitive
science, mathematics, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics,
etc.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Marketing Research

AI can be used in three different ways in marketing research:
a) data collection; b) market analysis; and c) understanding the
customer and developing key insights.
                    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION | 261

AI and Data Collection:

AI can automate data collection about the market, the
environment, the firm, the competitors, and the customers.
In the digitally connected world, market data can be easily
tracked and monitored. Data sensing, tracking, and collection
are routine, repetitive tasks that can be easily automated via AI.
Existing studies have shown various ways of using AI for data
collection. For example:

   customer intelligence, including data about consumers,
      their activities, and their environments, can be collected
      if they use connected devices (e.g., wearable devices,
      smart fridges, and digital assistants such as Siri)

   product usage and consumption experience can be
      visualized with Internet of Things (IoT)

   various advanced technologies and analytics can capture
      unstructured marketing activity data

   in-car sensors can track driving behavior for determining
      insurance premiums

   retail technologies, such as heat maps, video surveillance,
      and beacons, can be used for profiling and recognizing
      retail shoppers

   Previous studies show that, given the repetitive, routine,
262 | ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION

but high-volume nature of market data, AI can collect data
efficiently at scale. The data collection capability of AI is not
limited to observable behavioral data; it can also be used to
facilitate survey or experimental data collection to capture
consumer psychographics, opinions, and attitudes. For
example, human administration and supervision of ongoing
surveys are no longer required and can be automated.
SurveyMonkey and SurveyCake are two commercial survey
platforms that automate survey design and data collection. By
incorporating the principles of gaming and AI better quality
data is being collected online. Online surveys have become
more fun and engaging. Survey participants are also more
likely to complete such surveys and recommend them to
others. In fact, by using AI technology, researchers believe that
in the next few years, nearly 1 in 4 surveys will be spoken to a
digital assistant (Qualtrics 2022).

AI and Data Analysis:

AI can be used to analyse information. Here are a few examples
of how researchers have used AI to undertake analysis:

   Automated text analysis is applied to gain insights into
      consumers' behaviour (e.g., by analysing customer
      reviews on a website)

   Machine learning algorithms and lexicon-based text
                   ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION | 263

      classification is used to analyse various social media
      datasets
   Big data marketing analytics is a mainstream approach
      for generating marketing insights. Specific applications
      include mapping market structures for large retail
      assortments using a neural network language model, by
      analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping
      baskets, detecting copycat mobile apps using a machine
      learning copycat-detection method, and aiding social
      media content engineering by employing natural
      language processing algorithms that discover the
      associations between social media marketing content
      and user engagement

AI and Improved Understanding
of the Customer:

AI can be used to understand existing and potential customer
needs and wants, for example, who they are, what they want,
and what their current solutions are. The major distinction
between market analysis and customer understanding is that
the latter often involves emotional data about customer
sentiments, feelings, preferences, and attitudes. Thus, AI does
not only churn out quick numbers, it also has the capability
of analyzing emotional data. For example, Affectiva partnered
264 | ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION

with Ford to create AutoEmotive sentiment analysis, to try to
figure out drivers' emotional states.

   For potential customers, marketers can use feeling AI to
understand what they want and why they are happy with
competitors or outside options. Some marketers may feel that
potential customers' needs and wants are more difficult to
predict as their emotional data is less available. However,
Unilever has proved otherwise. With the help of AI data
centers, Unilever synthesized insights through social listening
and CRM, and discovered a link between ice cream and
breakfast. Unilever discovered that there were at least 50 songs
with `ice cream for breakfast' in their lyrics (which people were
listening to), as well as Dunkin Donuts selling ice cream during
the morning part. With this insight, Unilever developed a new
brand Ben & Jerry's with a range of cereal-flavored ice-creams
for breakfast.

ChatGPT

The recent release of the ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022
has generated significant public interest. In essence, ChatGPT
is an AI-powered chatbot allowing users to simulate human-
like conversations with an AI.

   GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a
language processing model developed by the American
artificial intelligence company OpenAI. The GPT language
model uses deep learning to produce human-like responses.
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that involves
  266 | ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION

  training artificial neural networks to mimic the complexity of
  the human brain, to produce human-like responses.

     ChatGPT has a user-friendly interface that utilizes this
  technology, allowing users to interact with it in a
  conversational manner. In light of this new technology,
  businesses and consumers alike have shown great interest in
  how such an innovation could revolutionize marketing
  strategies and customer experiences.

     When a user puts forward a query, the world's most popular
  search engine Google - using a traditional route - scans
  billions of web pages and presents the most relevant results.
  On the other hand, ChatGPT serving a similar purpose
  presents a more focused, human-like response. Instead of
  presenting the user with a list of `search results', ChatGPT
  behaves like an expert. For example, when asked to find a recipe
  for a boiled egg, Google provides us with different web links
  and lets the user select the most appropriate result. In

  comparison, ChatGPT provides the user with a tailored
  response in a human-like language4. Such interactions with
  users are seen as more `meaningful' from the users' perspective.
  Meanwhile, ChatGPT is smart enough to not give any answer
  to questions that are sexually inappropriate or may harm the
  sentiment of races and religions around the globe.

 What's so special about
 ChatGPT?

  What sets ChatGPT apart from other chatbots is the size of its
  dataset. Chatbots are usually trained on a smaller dataset in a
  rule-based manner designed to answer specific questions and
  conduct certain tasks.

     ChatGPT, on the other hand, is trained on a huge dataset
  -- 175 billion parameters and 570 gigabytes -- and is able to
  perform a range of tasks in different fields and industries.
  570GB is equivalent to over 385 million pages on Microsoft
  Word.

     Given the amount of the data, ChatGPT can carry out
  different language-related activities which includes answering

Open AI has a beta version available here:
https://labs.openai.com/ (DALL.E preview app). The
DALL.E model generates an image within seconds from any
text prompt.

   Such a tool provides an opportunity for everyone to be
creative. A user can type in a detailed description (of up to 400
characters), and an image is generated within seconds. DALL-
E 2 plays with different types of artistic mediums, so an image
can be produced as a painting, stained glass, digital art, etc.

   The following images are produced for the
description:"superman style uni students eating ice cream and

 Emotional intelligence:

  ChatGPT provides a state of the art human-like response and
  content. However, it is important to be aware that the tool
  is only human-like. Similar to traditional challenges with
  chatbots, the degree of human-likeness will be essential for
  process enhancement and content creation.

     Marketers could use ChatGPT to enhance customer
  experience, but without humans to provide relevancy,
  character, experience and personal connection, it will be
  challenging to fully capitalize on ChatGPT. Relying on
  ChatGPT to build customer connections and engagement
  without the involvement of humans may diminish meaningful
  customer connection instead of enhancing it.

Financial and Human Resource
Cost:

Using AI requires financial and human resources. The initial
cost of setting up an AI infrastructure is always resource-
intensive. Thus, it may not be feasible for all organisations.
Investing in AI can mean heavy expenditures on data
acquisition, computing, and storage equipment, as well as
spending on recruiting relevant personnel and training them.
As with all investments, the returns may not be immediate. It
may take a while to realise the benefits of using AI.

   AI systems should not be seen as a replacement for human
capital. In fact, AI systems only work best when it is best
integrated with the expertise of the organisation. It is not
advisable to leave customers or suppliers at the mercy of a
`digital assistant'. There are numerous case studies that
demonstrate the limitation of such an approach.

Unrealistic Expectations from AI/
Threatened by AI:

At times, managers can have unrealistic expectations from AI
technologies. Not all aspects of AI will add value to all business
operations. Managers need to analyse what is feasible for
achieving specific objectives. The author of this book has
worked in the area of social robotics. Deploying a social robot
within a business environment often posed challenges. Either
the expectations of the business managers were too high for the
social robot (e.g., "will it be able to answer the phone?") or - in
some cases - it did not help with their overall communication
objectives. In another few cases, employees were threatened
with the arrival of a social robot as they feared job losses. In
many instances, the overall evaluation of the technology was
undertaken by individuals who may have had a bias towards
the use of the machine.

     The application of social media within programs has grown

  to measure impact. These data can help managers understand

What Is Social Media Analytics?

Social media analytics is the ability to gather and find meaning
in data gathered from social channels to support business
decisions -- and measure the performance of actions based on
those decisions through social media. Social media analytics is
broader than metrics such as likes, follows, retweets, previews,
clicks, and impressions gathered from individual channels.
Social media analytics uses specifically designed software
platforms (e.g. Twitonomy) that work similarly to web search
tools. Data about keywords or topics are retrieved through
                                                   SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYTICS | 279

  search queries or web `crawlers' that span channels. Fragments
  of text are returned, loaded into a database, categorized, and
  analyzed to derive meaningful insights.

 Should social media analysis be
 conducted?

  Metrics available for social media are extensive and not all are
  useful for determining the impact of a program's social media
  efforts. As Sterne (2010)4 explains, there needs to be
  meaning with social media metrics because "measuring for
  measurement's sake is a fool's errand"; "without context, your
  measurements are meaningless"; and "without specific business
  goals, your metrics are meaningless.". Therefore, it is important
  to consider specific program objectives and which metrics (key
  performance indicators [KPIs]) are central to assessing the
  progress and success of these objectives.

     Additionally, it is also worthwhile to recognize that popular
  social media platforms are always changing, categorizing
  various social media platforms is difficult, and metrics used by
  different platforms vary.

     In order to provide more meaning to the social media

4. Sterne, J 2010, Social media metrics: how to measure and optimize your marketing
  investment, John Wiley, Hoboken NJ.
280 | SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYTICS

analyses of a program, it may be helpful to consider using
a framework to provide a structure for aligning social media
metrics to the program's objectives and assist with
demonstrating progress and success towards those objectives.

   Knowing when and if to conduct a social media analysis is
an important concept to consider. Just because a social media
analysis can be conducted doesn't mean one should be
conducted. Therefore, before beginning one it is important to
take the time to determine a few things:

 1. What are the specific goals that will be answered through
      social media?

 2. How will these goals be measured using social media?
 3. Which platforms will be most valuable/useful in

      reaching the targeted audience?

Social Media Metrics across
different platforms

     Social media metrics are used to measure if particular
  communication objectives are being achieved. An
  organisation's performance on social media should not only be
  measured through quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis of
  comments and posts is equally important.

 Introduction

  In Australia, 812,000 people identified as Aboriginal and/or
  Torres Strait Islander in the 2021 Census of Population and
  Housing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
  represented 3.2% of the population. This was up from 2.8% in
  2016, and 2.5% in 2011.

     In 2021, the largest proportion of the Aboriginal and Torres
  Strait Islander population lived in New South Wales (34.2%)
  and Queensland (29.2%). While only 7.5% of Australia's
  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population lived in the
  Northern Territory, they made up just over one-quarter
  (26.3%) of the Northern Territory's population. This was
  much higher than the other states and territories1.

Historical Context of Research
with Indigenous Australians:

Undertaking ethical research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander communities is an important topic. From the earliest
periods of colonisation, views about Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander cultures and social organisation (including their
values and mores) were based on ill-informed perceptions and
assumptions. These perceptions arose from inappropriate
comparisons of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people to European colonisers' spiritual, social, political, and
economic perspectives. Colonists viewed the Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander cultures and societies through their own
cultural lenses and judged these attributes by the degree to
which they perceived them as conforming to European
customs and norms. Not surprisingly, the early colonisers
knew nothing about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Peoples and their cultures. The substantial errors of judgment
and the misconceptions that followed have significantly

  impacted Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples ever
  since2

     There are concerns that Indigenous Australians have been
  over-researched without corresponding improvements,
  especially with reference to health outcomes. Key reasons for
  the poor translation of research findings into indicators of
  social change or benefits have been because, in large measure,
  research has been controlled by non-Indigenous people,
  conducted `on' Indigenous people; and has been strongly
  biased toward the incentives of the colonising society. Despite
  some reforms aligned with Indigenous political agitation and
  environments over time, an underlying mistrust of researchers
  and associated research activities still persists in Indigenous
  populations. Anecdotally, poorly undertaken government
  projects and consultations about public policy
  implementation have also led Indigenous Australian
  communities to categorise these activities as research; often
  adding to a perception that research has not benefited
  communities 3.

  Strait Islander Australian health research', BMC Public Health, vol. 15. no. 696,
  290 | RESEARCHING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES

     The actions of some researchers have also damaged
  Aboriginal communities' trust in research activities. In 1948,
  Frank Setzler, the head curator of anthropology at the the
  Smithsonian Institution in Washington, was a member of a
  US-Australian scientific expedition. The researcher's own field
  notes document the clandestine processes he adopted to ship
  hundreds of `bones' of deceased individuals to the US. These
  bones became part of one of the world's biggest collections
  of human anatomy. These collections remained at the
  Smithsonian for more than 60 years. Finally, after intense
  lobbying, the bones were returned to Australia in 2011. 4.

     Finally, marketing researchers may find it difficult to build
  a relationship with this segment of the Australian population.
  Undertaking research requires trust, which has partly been
  eroded due to the treatment of Indigenous consumers and
  communities by corporate Australia. The destruction of
  Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto was one of the most recent
  inexcusable acts. Woolworths was forced to abandon plans to
  build a liquor warehouse near three dry Aboriginal
  communities. Then, in 2021. Telstra was fined $50m by the

  federal court which found it had exploited Indigenous
  customers by signing them up for phone contracts they could
  not understand or afford5. Finally, marketing scams also
  impact Indigenous Australians. In 2020, Scamwatch received
  3,455 reports with over $2 million in losses from Indigenous
  Australians. While the losses were 4 percent lower than those
  in 2019, the reports increased by nearly 25 percent. The most
  financially damaging scams for Indigenous communities were
  dating and romance scams, followed by investment scams and
  online shopping scams.

 Code of Ethics for Research with
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait
 Islander peoples

  Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies) first
  published ethics guidelines in 19996. This Code represented

a new approach by positioning Indigenous people as research
partners, rather than merely research subjects. The Code sets
national standards for the ethical and responsible conduct of
all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research, across all
disciplines and methodologies. It is for use by those
undertaking research, reviewing research, or funding research,
including individuals, universities, governments, industry, and
community organisations.

   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research includes all
research that impacts on or is of particular significance to
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, including the
planning, collection, analysis, and dissemination of
information or knowledge, in any format or medium, which is
about, or may affect, Indigenous peoples, either collectively or
individually.

   Details of the four principles informing the recommended
ethical framework can be found here: https://aiatsis.gov.au/
sites/default/files/2020-10/aiatsis-code-ethics.pdf

   Principle 1: Indigenous self-determination
   The recognition of, and respect for, Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples' right to self-determination is
fundamental to all research conducted in Australia. This Code
recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples'
unique connection to the land and waters of this continent
from time immemorial. Australian research should embrace
the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have
                       RESEARCHING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES | 293

existed continuously as distinct societies, with diverse and
unique laws, cultures, knowledge and worldviews that can
inform research across a wide range of disciplines including
physical sciences, social sciences and humanities.

   Principle 2: Indigenous leadership
   To demonstrate merit, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
research should be led by Indigenous people.54 Research is
considered Indigenous-led in Australia when Aboriginal and/
or Torres Strait Islander people have genuine decision-making
responsibility and the research is informed by Indigenous
priorities, values, perspectives, and voices. Indigenous
leadership should be evident both in the `why' as well as the
`how' of research, from conceptualisation to communication
of research.

   Principle 3: Impact and value
   Research with Indigenous peoples must aim to benefit
Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, for informed consent to be
valid it requires mutual understanding of the benefits and
risks.

   Principle 4: Sustainability and accountability
   Respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
and their worldviews in the conduct of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander research requires researchers and institutions to
  294 | RESEARCHING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES

  have accountability, over the long term, for the impacts of their
  actions.

  In addition to these principles, it is worth mentioning the role
  of Indigenous Elders in any research-related projects. Elders in
  the community are respected for their stories, art, song and
  language. While many of them are caring for their
  grandchildren, they are also consulted about programs and
  services. Elders are known to sit within the local court. The
  men and women facing charges sit with the Aunts and Uncles
  and yarn about their journeys and a way forward. Elders not
  only play an integral part in preserving traditional knowledge,
  they are also pivotal in helping tackle broader community
  issues. Any research work aimed at understanding these
  communities, need to recognise the importance of consulting
  Elders 7.

 Indigenous Research Methods

  In most cases, research methods have been developed by
  Western academics and practitioners. While such methods

7. Mroelli, L 2017, What role does an Elder have in Indigenous Communities?,
  NITV, <https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/what-role-does-an-elder-have-in-
  indigenous-communities/6k7u18el6>.
                          RESEARCHING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES | 295

  may have been useful in collecting data from within the
  researchers' sphere of life, these methods may not work well
  with Indigenous communities. Thus, there is a need to
  `decolonise' the research process to make it more relevant for
  research Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations.

     Interviews and focus groups, the main tools for interacting
  with participants, can only provide rich quality data if the
  researcher-participant relationship is based on trust and
  authenticity. The interaction between the two parties will
  remain superficial if participants perceive the research aim to
  be purely based on the collection of data. To strengthen the
  relationship, there must be a sincere aim of helping
  participants improve their lives.

     We discuss two approaches that have received attention
  from academics.

 Yarning8

  Yarning, derived from the word `yarn' (a thread of wool, cotton
  etc.), may linguistically refer to the act of using the yarn for

8. Ober, R, Oliver, R & Dovchin, S 2022, '`You can't just show up and start asking
  questions': why researchers need to understand the importance of yarning for First
  Nations', Australian Council of Graduate Research, <https://www.acgr.edu.au/

  tand-the-importance-of-yarning-for-first-nations/>.
296 | RESEARCHING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES

knitting or weaving. However, when used in conversational
English it implies the narration of a `tale' or an entertaining
story.

   `Yarning' in Research:
   Yarning is a tradition practised for thousands of years by
many First Nations people in Australia. It is an integral part of
Indigenous ways of learning and sharing.
   It is usually undertaken by Aboriginal people coming
together informally to unwind or in more formal ways such
as discussing community or cultural matters. Storytelling is an
important part of yarning that allows for reflection on recent
or past histories and lived experiences and sharing knowledge.
   Researchers can take part in "yarning" by talking to First
Nations people about where each of them is from, people they
know in common, and their connection to the place on which
they meet, just to give a few examples.
   It's essential for non-Aboriginal researchers to establish
relationships with First Nations people when conducting
research in their communities. This is where research practices
such as "yarning" can offer an opportunity to establish
relationships with these communities.
   Once researchers establish a connection with people from
the place they're wishing to conduct their research, a mutual
and inclusive relationship can be forged. This is essential to
ensuring First Nations research participants are included in
research, and not seen as research subjects.
   Being able to build a relationship is vital to ensuring the lives
                       RESEARCHING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES | 297

of First Nations people are accurately portrayed and recorded,
participants are not taken advantage of, and communities can
benefit from the research.

Art-based methods

Art-based methods embrace multiple ways of knowing that
are typically given little space in scientific discourse. Arts-based
methods (ABMs) include an array of modalities such as
theatre, visual arts, painting, photography, music, and dance.
Aboriginal People convey their important cultural stories
through the generations, via symbols/icons in their artwork.

   One of the many art-based methods is Photovoice, whereby
people identify, represent, and enhance their community
through photography. In this research method, the researcher
provides cameras to individuals, enabling them to act as
recorders and potential catalysts for social action and change
in their own communities. Participants take pictures that help
tell their story regarding a particular concern. The individual's
story typically accompanies the pictures to promote an
effective, participatory means of sharing expertise.

   We have relied on our peers and indigenous leaders in the
School of Business to review the material and provide us with
feedback.

COMMUNICATING
INSIGHTS

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, students must be able to:
           be familiar with the different ways of
             presenting research results
           be able to apply different graphs to present
             results

     Presenting the results in a clear and logical format to the
  client is one of the most important tasks for the person
  managing the survey. When presenting results, the format of
  the presentation should be tailored to address the aims and
  objectives of the survey and to satisfy the potential users of the
  results. Consideration should be given to the level of statistical
  understanding of the clients and users, particularly in regard to
  statistical terminology. The presentation needs to be effective,
  easy to understand and convey the main features of the data.

 Written Reports

  When presenting the data, some form of a written report is
  essential. The report should convey the main features clearly
  and follow a logical progression, use as little jargon as possible,
  provide insight into the data and make the results as interesting
  as possible. As the author of the report, you should convey
  specific messages rather than generalised information. You
  should also put forward theories to explain the findings and

                                              COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS | 301

encourage the users to further explore the data. If appropriate,
you may need to include recommendations.

   The contents of the report and its balance of words, tables
and graphs will naturally depend on the topic, the results and
the likely readers. Graphs and tables convey complex
information clearly and can be used to add variety. At all times
it should be remembered that the report is written to be read,
and so needs to make sense and be understandable.

   A survey report generally covers:

Introduction

The introduction states the purpose and aims of the survey
and the aims of the report; gives the background to the
research; defines terms and concepts; and states whether the
survey is testing an hypothesis or is exploratory.

Methodology

The methodology describes the method of sampling and
information on the survey population, as well as how the data
was analysed and the statistical procedures which were used.

Findings and Analysis

The findings and analysis section is the main part of the report
302 | COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS

which deals with details of the sample numbers, response rates,
results and interpretation of tabulations etc. and discusses
possible courses of action.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The conclusions summarise the major findings of the report
and answers questions posed in the introduction. The
recommendations outline what actions are indicated on the
basis of the conclusions.

Appendices and References

The appendices consist of items which may be useful to the
reader (e.g. the questionnaire) but not essential to the report.
References list the books, journals and papers referred to in the
study.

   Remembering that the report is likely to serve as a basis for
discussion, some other important considerations are the title,
use of headings and sub-headings, the colour and design of
the cover and the overall appearance of the report - it should
stimulate the reader's interest.
                                             COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS | 303

Statistical Representation

The manner in which the results are presented will depend on
the data and the types of descriptive statistics required. Tables
and graphs are the most common form of presentation but
other types are available. In general, tables are more detailed
- showing the actual values, whereas graphs are more useful
in showing relationships - concentrating on the form, shape
and movement of the data. Graphs are particularly useful in
representing the change in the value of a data item over a
period of time. Usually, either a graph or a table will be
sufficient to represent a set of data.

Tables

Tables are the most common form of statistical presentation.
Tables present additional information which cannot be shown
in general text. A good table is one in which patterns and
exceptions stand out when looking at the table, followed by a
small paragraph commenting on the table. Tables are usually
only used to present a few values as they become difficult to
comprehend if they involve too many numbers.

   Tables should have clear headings. Some other useful
guidelines are:

   to round data to 4 or 5 significant figures which makes
      the data easier to see and manipulate;
304 | COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS

   reading down is easier than reading across a row,
      especially for a large number of items;

   row and column averages or percentages may help the
      reader interpret the data - widely spaced columns are
      difficult to compare and should be avoided, and

   totalling rows and/or columns is usually helpful

Graphs

We can also use a sequence of simple graphs to tell a story
about the data and to give insight into findings. This can be
supported by an explanatory paragraph.

   Graphs are a visually attractive way of presenting data. They
maintain the interest of the readers and encourage them to
think about the data. Although the amount of information
which can be presented is limited, graphs often reveal or
highlight "hidden" facts in complex data. Trends and
relationships are more clearly grasped from a graph rather than
a table or text and are therefore better remembered by the
reader. However, graphs are not always necessary and should
only be used where it is appropriate. Keep in mind that the
reader may not be familiar with the data and therefore you
need to include sufficient information on the graph to explain
the data.

Constructing Graphs

   Titles: A title is essential and is best placed at the top. It
                                             COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS | 305

      should indicate the "what, where and when" of the
      graph as concisely as possible and should be larger than
      the lettering on the graph itself
   Scales: the horizontal scale usually measures the time
      unit where a graph is over a period of time, and the
      vertical scale measures the variable under consideration.
      Where possible the vertical scale should begin at zero
   shading and colouring can be added to create visual
      emphasis;
   both axes should be marked and named with scales and
      units;
   all parameters and variables should be defined as
      concisely as possible;
   a legend may be necessary, particularly for detailed
      graphs with shading and/or colouring;
   labels should be used if more than one variable is plotted
      on the same graph; and
   footnotes may be used to explain unusual features such
      as breaks in the series.

Types of Graphs

The decision as to which type of graph to use depends on the
type of data being presented. The following are some of the
types of graphs that could be used:
306 | COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS

   Line or Curve Graphs

These graphs are used when emphasis on the movement rather
than the size of the data item or when several series are being
compared. These types of graphs show variations in the data
plotted over a period of time.

   Bar or Column Graph

This type of graph depicts numerical values over a given
variable. The value is represented by the height of the column.
This type of graph is especially effective for showing large
changes from one period to the next.

   Grouped Columns/Bars

These graphs compare different categories on the same graph.
Groups of columns, with each column in the group
representing a different category, are plotted on the same axis.

   Pie Chart

These charts are used for comparison (in percentage terms)
of components. The components can be compared with each
other and the contribution they make with the whole. These
graphs are best used when there is a small number of
categories.
                COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS | 307

 Map

A map is used to show the boundaries of areas. Various
shadings for different regions can show how the value of
variable changes between locations.

 Other Graphs

Some other graphs which are available include Index,
Pictogram, Surface Chart, Cumulative Curve, Deviation Line,
Sliding Bar Chart, Dot Chart, Population Pyramid, Map
Chart, Stacked Bar and Scatter Diagram.

Other Forms of Presentation

Oral Presentations

Depending on the circumstances (users, type of data, results),
a written report may be inadequate or may need to be
supplemented. Oral presentation of the results of a survey is
often neglected as an important means of conveying
information. Whereas a written report provides great detail
with a wide range of results, an oral session can only emphasise
a few major points. However, this can often be most suitable
depending on the audience. As with a written report, the poor
presentation may cause the survey results to be rejected. The
308 | COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS

spoken word and visual aids can have a great impact on an
audience. The presenter therefore should be aware of who the
presentation is aimed at and know what survey results may be
contrary to existing ideas.

Posters

A poster is one way to attract attention but only one direct
statement should be made. The message must be noticeable at
a glance and the poster itself must be attractive to encourage
possible users to inspect it.

Panel Exhibits

A panel exhibit is an extension of the poster presentation. This
type of presentation gives more details and expands several
main ideas. Again it is important that the panels be colourful
and attractive.
                                             COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS | 309

Charts (often referred to as an infographic)

A chart may be appropriate depending on
the data. A chart is an outline map that
can contain photographs, words, figures,
graphs, diagrams, maps, symbols,
illustrations, etc (eg. a weather chart).
  310 | COMMUNICATING INSIGHTS

       McCrindle 2021 is licensed under a Creative
    Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence 2

 Videos

  The use of videos and television can provide an additional
  means of communication of the survey results.

 Conclusion

  It is important to present data well. If we have gone to the
  effort, time and expense of undertaking a study, then we have
  to ensure that we present the data in a clear, logical way. We
  must consider the use of text, tables and diagrams to construct
  a document that is useful and understandable. The ultimate
  aim of any presentation is to inform the user of the results of
  the research in a way that can be used to promote informed
  decision making.

 What is an infographic?

  Infographics visually communicate complex data and
  information in a graphic format that is easy to read and
  understand. They often combine illustrations, icons, and data
  visualisations to engage the reader. They are used very
  effectively in online settings to convey information whilst
  using minimal text.

     Infographics are an important tool due to the reasons
  explained below:

       Processing Information

  According to the theory of the picture superiority effect,
humans are able to decipher visual information 60,000 times
faster than text. The human brain is wired in such a way that
handling visual information is easier for it. As a result, images

        are more likely to be remembered than words.
314 | INFOGRAPHICS

        Information Overload

       In today's era of information overload, a marketer's
 message needs to stand out in the competitive landscape. It
needs to be memorable. It is an information jungle out there,
   and coming across an easy-to-follow graphic is a relief (as

         narrated in a TedTalk by David McCandless)
                                                               INFOGRAPHICS | 315

Communicating with the Digital
                 Natives

   Millennials and similar age groups have grown up with
technology. They prefer communication that involves brief,

   instantaneous messages. They shift their focus to other
sources of information very quickly. Lengthy oral lectures or
huge written texts may not work well with a generation that

               has a low tolerance for boredom.
  316 | INFOGRAPHICS

             Easily Shareable

     Infographics are easier to share on social media and other
  platforms. It is far more likely that your key message in an
  infographic will reach a larger audience than in a lengthy
  article.

THE PROCESS: FROM
GENERATING TO USING
CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, the student must be able
     to:

           identify the steps in generating and using
             customer insights

           differentiate between traditional research
             findings and the concept of actionable
             insights

The traditional process of marketing research is based on the
initial step of `defining the problem' or clearly stating the
               THE PROCESS: FROM GENERATING TO USING CUSTOMER
                                                                            INSIGHTS | 321

  research question. In a few, rare cases scholars have also stressed
  carrying out a cost-benefit analysis to see if expensive
  marketing research is at all needed. In comparison, managers
  who believe in the concept of customer insights claim that
  exploring available data actually helps to trigger questions and
  related issues1. Further analysis and interpretation of multi-
  sourced data is required to clearly articulate the goal in mining
  data. It is only when meaningful actions are taken as a result of
  an emerging insight, that problems are solved.

     This chapter presents an 8-step process in developing a
  strategy around customer insights. This involves planning to
  generate and then using customer insights to meet
  organisational goals. These steps have been collated after going
  through practitioners' experiences and suggestions made by
  academics. Each step is discussed in detail below.

  insight-teaming-up-to-drive-better-business/>.
322 | THE PROCESS: FROM GENERATING TO USING CUSTOMER
INSIGHTS

Step 1: Recognition and
commitment to the `customer
insights' concept

As with many organisational strategies, the chance of a
successful customer insights program rests with the
management. If the top management recognises the value in
developing a customer insights program - and then commits
resources to it - the initiative can take off. Traditionally,
managers are more familiar with the concept of marketing
research. However, if business leaders can take the time (and
energy) in learning about the benefits of an insights approach,
and guide their organisation towards treating data - especially
the one which is already available - as a valuable asset, then
the first step in the launch of a customer insights program has
been taken. More importantly, the insights department is not a
stand-alone unit in the organisation. In fact, high-performing
companies would ensure that leaders from the insights team
are involved in all stages of strategic planning in the firm.

Step 2: Identify various `sources
of data' - internal and external
to the firm

An organisation generates data continuously - yet, managers

                                                                           INSIGHTS | 323

  may not always be aware of its utility. A record is created every
  time there is a transaction made or a customer query received.
  If a frontline manager wants to review the efficiency of her
  team's customer-service operations, it is quite possible to tap
  into various sources of data being generated and stored,
  internally. A 360o view could reveal that data from in-store
  cameras/sensors, online queries, telephone calls, and product
  returns is useful. Moreover, the company's frontline staff -
  who are interacting with customers directly - could
  supplement the data with their own experiences2.

video, and image formats. Such information is based on casual
conversations amongst account-holders and thus seen to be
more `reliable' than made-up responses to a formal survey.
Besides this, information from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, the Bureau of Metrology, and regular reports from
leading firms, such as the ANZ-Roy Morgan (e.g., the

  Consumer Confidence Index) may assist business managers in
  analysing a situation.

     A word of caution: managers could end up with piles of
  data on their desks which is not useful. It also does not help
  if a statistician runs dozens of hypothesis tests and churns out
  results for managers to `see'. The trick is to design a data
  collection-collation strategy in which critical information can
  be sifted - from tons of material - made available to
  employees, and eventually used to implement specific
  strategies.

 Step 3: Build an `Insights Team' with
 different skills and capabilities 3

  A customer insights team must include team members with
  different skills and capabilities. For example, a product
  manager, a business analyst, a statistician, an IT person, a data
  architect/scientist, and a graphic designer ould be a team for
  working on a particular project. Such an approach to carry
  out a `research' activity may require a cultural and a mindset

change. This could be new territory for many traditionalists.
Introducing employees to such an innovative technique could
be undertaken with a multifaceted approach - training, role
modeling by leaders, incentives, and metrics to reinforce
behaviour.

   Building the right team is a critical step in designing a
strategy for customer insights. Big data, information, and
technology are here to stay. Instead of going for a major
overhaul organisations are suggested to keep working on
creating a culture towards being flexible and nimble. As more
employees are trained and exposed to the benefits of using
existing data, organisations can build their superior capabilities
which will prove to be a decisive competitive asset.

Step 4: Use existing tools/
develop your own tools for
managing data

With the amount of digital information which is available
these days, companies need reliable tools to ensure that
relevant information is accessible to managers. There are some
tools that are free of cost or reasonably priced which can easily
be employed even by small businesses. These include YouTube
Analytics, Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights,
            THE PROCESS: FROM GENERATING TO USING CUSTOMER
                                                                        INSIGHTS | 327

Twitter Analytics, and other platforms to measure social media
activity. Of course, there are many other software and
platforms available for managers to choose from. The final
decision would depend on the firm's needs as well as the costs
involved in using any of these tools.

   Depending on the IT capabilities of the firm, it may be
feasible to design one's own data platform. The goal of such
a platform, designed and built in-house is to empower
individual employees to access data, analyse data themselves,
and then use this data to make decisions. Such a platform must
be easy to access and use. If there are many barriers (such as
digital access or high-level skill set required), then the usability
of such a platform reduces. A data management platform
should be user-friendly (for employees) as well as user-centric.

Step 5: Interpret data - data
analyst or ...?
328 | THE PROCESS: FROM GENERATING TO USING CUSTOMER
INSIGHTS

        Data analysis is too important to be left to one
        person - or one department  2022 Western

   While businesses regularly looked for skilled data analysts,
there is another concept that is proving to be a useful one.
Data analysis is too important to be left to only one person
- or a group of people with technical skills. Everyone on the
team must have enough training to be able to understand data.
Business executives agree that a lack of skills in data analysis
and analytics prevents them from making key decisions based
on data analytics. That is why it is important to carry out an
audit of the basic skill levels of current team members and
then provide them with training and resources so they can

                                                                           INSIGHTS | 329

  confidently analyse datasets, without relying on someone to
  churn out numbers for them4.

 Step 6: Identify meaningful
 insights

  While there are some people who still insist that findings and
  insights are the same things, a growing number of practitioners
  are highlighting the differences between the two concepts. The
  table below highlights the differences between research
  findings and insights.

So, what does it mean to have an actionable insight? Here is
an example: In 2018, Unilever launched its Digital Voice of
the Consumer (DVOC) program to understand better what
quality means to consumers. DVOC helps gather the reviews
and feedback people share with Unilever's Consumer
Engagement Centres as well as on other public platforms. The
DVOC dashboards consolidate and process data from social
media, news, forums, customer call centres, e-commerce sites,
and experts' inputs (via a dashboard app).

   The immense value from DVOC came into effect during
the coronavirus outbreak globally. Unilever needed to conduct
rapid market research globally to understand the new struggles
faced by its consumers. A traditional approach to market
research with surveys and focus groups would have taken a
long time, and perhaps not yielded accurate information. By
carefully analysing social media conversations, a hand sanitiser
brand team saw that consumers were confused by different

                                                                           INSIGHTS | 333

  descriptions of alcohol content on the product's labelling. The
  brand team was able to identify this piece of information as an
  `actionable insight'. They quickly issued instructions to their
  support teams and helped adapt messaging to better clarify
  the information to consumers, in a bid to help reduce any
  confusion about the brand.

 Step 7: Communicate via data
 visualisation67

  Data visualisation means drawing graphic displays to show
  data. Previously, this was a skill that was considered to be a
  `nice-to-know' skill. Now it has become a `must-have' skill as
  communicating with various audiences requires the use of
  easy-to-understand visuals.

     A visualisation, at best, is a visual explanation. It uses the
  brain's visual perception system to help us understand a large
  data set, a set of relationships, or spatial relationships.
  Visualising data allows us to:

   analyse and understand data better
   move past two-dimensional flatland lists
   encourage the exploration of data complexity in

      engaging, interesting, and compelling ways
   illustrate the stories behind the data

Better hardware has meant more precise reproduction, better
color (including alpha-blending), and faster drawing. Better
software has meant easier and more flexible drawing,
consistent themes, and higher standards. Computer scientists
have become much more involved, both on the technical side
and in introducing new approaches.

   Including data visualisations in your collections has the
potential to increase the reuse, discovery, and connectivity of
your research data. A good visualisation should:

   show the data
   induce the viewer to think about the substance rather

      than about the methodology
   avoid distorting what the data have to say
   present many numbers in a small space
   make large data sets coherent
   reveal the data at several levels of detail from a broad

      overview to the fine structure

Step 8: Incorporate `actionable'
insights into developing
strategies

Many proponents of `customer insights' discipline assert that
the process should lead to the emergence of `actionable'
insights. Actionable insights are conclusions drawn from
data that can be turned directly into an action or a
response. Actionable insights are an outcome of extensive
data and information-driven analysis that allows an
organisation and its employees to make informed decisions.
A bulk of the data could be non-insightful or general
information. This could be information that is well-
established and recognised. However, it is those valuable
nuggets hidden within datasets, which when mined, shared,
and understood across the organisation may reveal certain
`insights' which could drive action. Actionable insights
translate into concrete actions that lead to modification and
action.

 CASE STUDY: USING

 WESTERN SYDNEY
 UNIVERSITY

    Jacki Montgomery

 Introduction

  Western Sydney University is considered a `young' university,
  having been established in 1989. It is globally renowned for its
  excellence in teaching and research 1. However, only a decade
  ago, its local identity was proving a challenge. It was then called
  the `University of Western Sydney', and research showed that
  parents and prospective students could not really define what

          CASE STUDY: USING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS TO REPOSITION
                                        WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY | 339

the university stood for, nor did they consider it their first
choice. In 2015, the marketing team set out to challenge these
perceptions of the university and undertook a bold rebranding
campaign. It was an unprecedented success - deeply founded
on consumer insights.

Determining the scope of the
challenge

As Head of Marketing at the

University of Western

Sydney, one of Angelo

Kourtis'  main

responsibilities was to

increase student enrolments.

Although enrolments had

remained consistent, he

believed that there was a

significant opportunity to

increase numbers. He and

his colleagues were aware

that many students in the local region chose to travel past the

University of Western Sydney, to study at universities much

further away from home. Previous advertising campaigns for
340 | CASE STUDY: USING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS TO REPOSITION
WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY

the University of Western Sydney had promoted the quality
and location of the university in order to attract students.
Rather than continue with this approach, Kourtis believed
that the team needed to conduct in-depth research and explore
the reasons why local students were choosing to enrol at other
universities.

   Initially, Kourtis felt that the University's positioning was
ill-defined; that it really didn't stand for anything that
resonated with the region or more broadly in Sydney. He
engaged a Market Research Agency, and they conducted
qualitative research (which later informed the design of the
quantitative study to verify the initial findings). The team held
focus groups with participants who were considered to be
important stakeholders in the decision-making process, and/
or who had already been through the process of choosing a
university: prospective students, current students, members of
the community, employers, high school teachers and career
advisors. The research produced two key insights.
          CASE STUDY: USING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS TO REPOSITION
                                        WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY | 341

Insight 1: Perception of the
University of Western Sydney
(compared to other universities)

The researchers asked participants to group a number of
Sydney universities into segments, and then asked them to
describe those segments. The first segment was called the
`Aspirational Universities', and in this group, participants
placed longstanding, brownstone universities which often
required high marks to enrol, and described them as status
symbols. The second segment was called `Discipline Expert
Universities', which participants recognised as universities
known for their strength in particular disciplines - seen as
important if you wanted to secure a career in one of those
discipline areas. The third segment was labelled `Achievable
Universities' - meaning `safety-net universities', or the choice
that you make when the other universities don't accept your
application. The University of Western Sydney was most often
included in the third segment. Kourtis felt that this was
inaccurate, and that for too long, the university had allowed
itself to be defined by others. It strengthened his resolve to
change this consumer perception and move the university out
of the `Achievable' segment.
342 | CASE STUDY: USING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS TO REPOSITION
WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY

Insight 2: Perceptions of
Western Sydney, and the desire
to distance from the region

The other key insight that emerged from the research was the
impact of negative perceptions of Western Sydney on students'
choice of university. Whilst many of the research participants
lived in Western Sydney, they did not want to identify with
Western Sydney because of the stigma associated with the
region. Public and media discourse up until that point had
very much been about the deficit perspective of Western
Sydney, and young people in particular wanted to distance
themselves from it. So quite often, the choice they made about
             CASE STUDY: USING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS TO REPOSITION
                                           WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY | 343

  which university to attend was not about the university itself,
  but more a statement about the region. Whilst the region of
  Western Sydney does tend to suffer greater socio-economic
  disadvantage than other parts of Sydney2, the insight that these
  perceptions of the region significantly affected students' choice
  of university was unexpected.

 The campaign idea, informed
 by insights

  Rather than shy away from these insights, Angelo Kourtis and
  his team confronted the negativity head-on. The campaign

  <https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/2033.0.55.001>.
  344 | CASE STUDY: USING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS TO REPOSITION
  WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY

  idea, informed by the key insights, spoke to taking pride in the
  region and `owning' Western Sydney (including re-naming the
  university to Western Sydney University). It also challenged
  future students and other stakeholders to think differently
  about the University. Fortini-Campbell 3 describes making a
  connection between consumer insight and brand insight in
  advertising as `hitting the sweet spot'. That is, communicating
  an idea so powerful that the consumer feels that `they really
  understand me'.

     The message from Western Sydney University was that it
  doesn't matter where you've come from, it's where you're
  heading that is important. That is, your potential is not limited
  by your history, or how others may perceive or define you.
  And, importantly, that Western Sydney University will help
  you realise that potential.

 The campaign execution

  To demonstrate how Western Sydney University unlocks
  potential, Kourtis and the Creative Agency focused on
  individual journeys of alumni that encapsulated the sense of

being `unlimited'. One of those journeys was that of Sudanese
former child soldier, Deng Adut. Fleeing war-torn Sudan, the
teenager was taken in by a family in Western Sydney, and
despite having little English, he took on part-time jobs, studied
hard, and won a scholarship to study Law at Western Sydney
University. Adut is now a successful defence lawyer and
refugee advocate. His story illustrated the idea that you can
come from anywhere, and succeed on your own terms; that
you can be unlimited in your potential. The 90-second film,
which included re-enactments of war scenes and courtroom
drama, was launched on social media, and received 3 million
views within 7 days. The film was viewed in over 56 countries,
and was picked up by local and international broadcasters -
increasing views to over 5 million.

Post-campaign success

Not only did the campaign receive global accolades and
awards, it effectively changed negative perceptions. The
insights drawn from research played a crucial role in informing
a campaign that dramatically transformed how future students
viewed the university. It was a bold refusal to allow others
to define the region and the institution. Western Sydney
University saw an immediate uplift in student enrolments, and
attitude surveys reflected positive shifts in perceptions
amongst key stakeholders. The University now owns the
powerful positioning of `unlimited' in the education sector,
and continues to reinforce the idea that if you are willing to
work hard, be bold and ambitious, Western Sydney University
will empower you to reach your unlimited potential.

       Discussion questions

                    1. What does `unlimited potential'
                        mean to you? Does it resonate? Do
                        you find it inspirational? Why or
                        why not? Discuss as a group. You
                        may discover some insights about

               your peers, and the way they
               perceive the value of tertiary
               education.
          2. Think of a campaign that gives you
               that feeling: `they really understand
               me' (perhaps a skin care brand, a car
               brand or a tech brand). Why did it
               make you feel that way? Was it a
               combination of consumer insight
               and brand insight?
