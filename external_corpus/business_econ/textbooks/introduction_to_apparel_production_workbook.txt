UNIT 1 SEWING SUPPLIES AND PRESSING
EQUIPMENT

The sewing supplies and pressing equipment are defined and shown in this section. You will need to purchase
the needed supplies for the samples and projects. Becoming familiar with the pressing equipment will ensure
the safe operation of the equipment.

                                                                                                              Unit 1 Sewing Supplies and Pressing Equipment | 3

Sewing Supplies Needed

                                                   Shears are designed for sewing production and are
                                                   longer in length than typical scissors. They have
                                                   different size holes for the thumb and fingers. Shears
                                                   should not be used to cut anything but fabric as
                                                   cutting paper will dull the blades quickly.

                                                          Tape Measures are designed made of cloth or
                                                          plastic with the flexibility to accurately
                                                          measure the circumference of the body. The
                                                          tape measure has markings in both inches
                                                          and centimeters.

                                                                                                                                                              Sewing Supplies | 5
                                                   Roundhead quilting/dressmaking pins are best for
                                                   sewing with fabric as they are longer in length, have a
                                                   sharp point, and are easy to grasp by the round head.
                                                   Pincushions are used to hold the pins, whether cloth or
                                                   magnetic. The magnetic pincushion is pictured.

                                                   Marking pens/chalk pencils are used to transfer crucial
                                                   markings from the pattern to the fabric. The type and
                                                   color of the fabric determines the best method for
                                                   transferring markings.

                                                   Seam Rippers are used to remove seams and threads.
                                                   They typically have a longer sharp point to easily be
                                                   inserted into a stitch for cutting and a shorter point
                                                   with a protective balled cap to prevent ripping fabric.

Hand sewing needles come in a variety of sizes and
lengths as well as sharp or ballpoint. The most
common type of hand sewing needle is a sharp needle
in sizes 5-10. The smaller the needle number the larger
the needle. Jjneedles.com gives you a free
downloadable guide to types of hand sewing needles.
( jjneedles.com)

Seam Guide/Sewing Gauge will allow you to measure
accurately. It has a sliding bar that will stay in place
while you measure things like hems, buttonhole
markings, pleat depths, etc.

Snaps come in a variety of sizes. The size used depends
on the garment to which it will be sewn. They are made
from either chrome metal, black metal, or clear plastic.

                                                                                                          Sewing Supplies | 7
                                                   Hooks and Eyes are for closures. They range in sizes
                                                   that relate to the garment to which it will be sewn.
                                                   There are different types of eyes, flat or round that are
                                                   used with the same type of hook. There are also skirt/
                                                   pant hooks that are wide and flat for closures of
                                                   waistbands on skirts and pants.

                                                   Buttons are used as a type of closure. There are
                                                   numerous varieties of button shapes, sizes, and colors.
                                                   The two main types of buttons are flat and shanked
                                                   buttons. The buttons needed for the shirt project in this
                                                   course are flat buttons flat with four holes. There are
                                                   shirt buttons with two holes that will work also.

                                                   Thread Clippers are smaller than shears and are used
                                                   to clip threads quickly. They can be used to cut open
                                                   buttonholes and are a good tool to have when sewing.

Zippers are closures that come in different varieties,
from separating zippers found in coats to all-purpose
zippers and invisible zippers: You will need 2 all-purpose
zippers and 1 invisible zipper for your sample notebook.
You will need additional zippers for your skirt and pants
projects.

Needle threaders are used to help either thread a
machine or hand needle.

Bias tape is used in a variety of sewing techniques and
comes in a variety of widths and folds. It is general
used to cover a seam allowance or raw edge. You will
need 1 package of extra wide double fold bias tape. You
will use bias tape for a sample in your notebook called
the Hong Kong Seam Finish.

                                                   Fusible Fleece will be used in the tote bag to give the
                                                   bag more body and stability. You will need 1 yard.

                                                   Fusible Interfacing comes in various weight depending
                                                   on the weight of the fabric. You will need 2 yards of
                                                   midweight fusible interfacing to be used for the shirt,
                                                   skirt and pants.

Machine and hand sewing needles are designed with a
sharp or ballpoint and an eye for threading. Machine
needles are specific to types of machines. Check your
manual to determine the best machine need for your
machine. Sharp needles are used when sewing with
woven fabrics and ballpoint needles are used for knits.

Bobbins are used to hold the lower thread of the stitch.

Bobbin Case is used to hold the bobbin and is inserted
in the lower part of the machine. This picture is of the
lever side and the open of a bobbin case.

                                                                                                         Sewing Supplies | 11
                                                   The bobbin fits in the open side on the post and is
                                                   threaded through the tension bar.

                                                   Irons are used for pressing and forming fabric. The heat
                                                   and steam from an iron is also used to adhere fusible
                                                   interfacings to parts of fabrics that need stability.

2. Pressing Equipment

Irons are used for pressing and sometimes forming fabric. The heat and
steam from an iron is also used to adhere fusible interfacings to parts of
fabrics that need stability.

   Vacuum Ironing Board Tables use a vacuum system to hold fabric in place while ironing and also allow for fast
drying of damp items. There is an attached swing arm to get into smaller spaces such as sleeves, necklines, etc.

UNIT 2 FABRICS

A. FABRICS USED in SEWING SAMPLES
   Fabric for samples should be 100% cotton solid woven. If you are enrolled in AMPD 1023 Introduction to

Apparel Production, this fabric will be selected for you and can be purchased during the supplies trip. A safe
fabric is considered quilting fabric.

   B. FABRICS USED for SEWING PROJECTS
       1. Tote Bag Fabric - You will need 3 different fabrics for your tote bag. One for the body of the bag, one for
            the contrast at the top of the bag and one for the lining. The tote bag body and contrast fabric needs
            to be a heavier fabric suitable for holding the weight of the contents of the bag. This type of fabric
            needs to be 100% cotton and can be denim, twill, drapery, upholstery or outdoor fabric. Make sure the
            fabric is not too stiff or it will be hard to sew. The lining fabric also needs to be 100% cotton in a lighter
            weight fabric similar to the sample fabric. You can choose any pattern or colors in muslin, broadcloth
            or cotton. Have fun with combining prints and colors. In addition, you will need 1 yard of fusible fleece.

                                                                                                                                                                 Unit 2 Fabrics | 15
          2. Skirt Fabric--The skirt pattern Is a straight skirt with an invisible zipper and facing. If you are in
          AMPD 1023 the skirt pattern will be provided for you. If you are working independently you can use
          Simplicity Pattern #1559. You will need a 100% cotton fabric suitable for skirts/pants. This fabric can be
          light weight denim or twill. DO NOT PURCHASE FLANNEL, CORDUROY, VELVET, LEATHER.

             3. Shirt Fabric- The shirt pattern is a basic men's shirt (Simplicity #1544) with collar and collar band,
          long sleeves with sewn placket and cuffs. You will need 100% shirt fabric. It is best to choose a print
          fabric so you can determine the front and the back of the fabric.

16 | Unit 2 Fabrics
   4. Pants Fabric--The pants pattern (Simplicity #1520) is an elastic waist straight leg pants. You will need
a 100% woven cotton fabric suitable for lounge pants. This fabric can be light weight denim, broadcloth,
chambray, or poplin . DO NOT PURCHASE KNIT, FLANNEL, CORDUROY, VELVET, LEATHER.

                                                                                                                                                     Unit 2 Fabrics | 17

4. Knit Fabrics

Knit fabrics have an interlooping structure and stretch. We will not be using any types of knits during this class.

20 | Knit Fabrics
5. Interfacings

We will be using two types of interfacing during this class. The first interfacing is for your tote bag. It is called
fusible fleece. This will give structure and body to your bag. The second type is for apparel and is called fusible
interfacing (shirt weight). Make sure you get the shirt or mid weight interfacing to give you stability in the collar,
cuffs and placket areas of your shirt and for the waistband of your skirt.

                                                                                                                                                                   Interfacings | 21

UNIT 4 LEARNING THE PARTS OF THE
SEWING MACHINE AND SERGER SEWING
MACHINE

It is essential that you learn the parts of your sewing machine prior to sewing. The JUKI machines used in the
production lab for AMPD 1023 are industrial machines with many moving parts. Knowing the parts of your
machine and what each part does will ensure the safe operation of the machine.

   The serger will be used to finish seam edges. There are parts of the serger you will need to become familiar
with in order to safely operator the machine. There is a knife edge that will cut fabric and if you do not know
where it is located or how it works, you may cut fabric unintentionally or cut yourself.

                                                                Unit 4 Learning the Parts of the Sewing Machine and Serger Sewing Machine | 33

   5. Hand Stitches
   a. Catch Stitch -is used to hand sew hems and facings. It is a series of small X's. The needle direction is from
right to left, but you are stitching from left to right. See steps below. Label as "Catch Stitch" and place in Sample
Notebook.

   Step 1. Using a single thread with a knot in the end, begin the stitch on the hme side of the fabric taking just
a few threads.

78 | Samples
   Step 2. Pull thread through to the knot and begin the next stitch on the garment just above the folded hem
edge.

   Step 3. Pull thread to just taut and begin the next stitch on the hem about 1/2 from the first stitch.

    Step 4. Repeat to the garment and alternate back and forth from the garment to hem until you reach the
end. Secure the thread by stitching in the same place several times.

                                                                                                                                                                        Samples | 79
b. Blind Catch Stitch -The blind catch stitch is the same stitch as the catch stitch with one exception, the top
of the hem is folded down so the stitches occur between the garment and the hem . This allows for the catch
stitch to be hidden once the fold is pressed up.

   View after the fold in the top of the gem has been pressed up. You should only see the small stitches. Label
                                             "Blind Catch Stitch" and place in Sample Notebook.

   6. Closures: Zippers
   A. Invisible Zipper - an invisible zipper is used in a seam line to hide the zipper from being seen from the
outside of the fabric. Cut a set of 5" by 12" rectangles from the sample fabric on-grain. Serge the long edge
on both pieces with right sides of fabric facing up.

   Unzip the invisible zipper and turn over to wrong side. Using just the left sample piece, place the right zipper
tape on the seam line of the left sample.

   Uncoil the zipper teeth to the left, there will be a ditch (fold) seen. Using the invisible zipper foot, place the
uncoiled zipper teeth in the left groove of the zip per foot and stitch down to the head of the zipper and back
tack.

                                                                                                                                                                        Samples | 83
Turn the zipper to the right side by flipping to the right. You should be able to zip the zipper all the way to the
top. If you cannot zip to the top, you may have caught the zipper teeth in your stitching and will need to remove
and restitch. Next, flip the entire sample and zipper upside down.

   Place the zipper on the right serged edge of the sample piece. Uncoil the zipper teeth to the right and place
in the right groove of the zipper foot and stitch in the ditch.

   2. Layout Tote Bag Patterns on Fabric.
   You will need 3 fabrics for your tote bag, 1 for the body of the bag, 1 for the contrast trim and one for the
lining. For the body of the bag, the fabric should be a cotton fabric that is heavier than apparel fabric. It can be
upholstery fabric, but make sure it is not too heavy or it will be hard to sew. For contrast of the bag, the fabric
should be the same weight as the body of the bag. It can be a contrasting color or pattern. For the lining, you
will need a cotton shirting weight fabric. You will layout the tote bag patterns as shown.
