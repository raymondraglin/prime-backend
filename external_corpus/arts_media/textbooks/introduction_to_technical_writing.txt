We are surrounded by technical writing. Countless times throughout the day, we
rely on technical writing--and also its larger cousin, technical communication--to
help us achieve what we need to accomplish. Think about all the things you do
that were unfamiliar to you at one point in time but that you can now accomplish
easily, and you will find technical writing and technical communication played a
role in developing your skills. Think about what you've done since waking up this
morning: Whether it was making coffee in a brand new coffee maker you
programmed to have ready by 8:00 a.m., getting a new baked pancake recipe
together for breakfast, putting a new head on an electric toothbrush, or simply
following the road signs, traffic lights, and parking procedures while commuting
to university, technical writing and communication helped to make it all happen.

In fact, if technical writing didn't exist, it would be almost impossible for us to do
many of the activities we are used to doing in today's world. So many things we
take for granted such as paying bills through an app; navigating to see a friend
who just moved to a new town; and booking an airline ticket online, then getting

                                                                    9
to the airport and taking that flight home for the holidays would be significantly
more difficult if not nearly impossible to accomplish in a reasonable amount of
time, if at all. While the world would be a much less entertaining, understanding,
and empathetic place without creative writing, the world as we know it could still
function; without technical writing, by contrast, the world would devolve into
chaos, with the relative smoothness and efficiency we rely on during our daily
activities grinding to a halt. While that may sound dramatic, try this experiment.
Start cataloguing the number of technical writing documents and other pieces of
technical communication you encounter throughout the day: user manuals,
online FAQ, reports, instructions, road signs, parking permit signs, login pages,
recipes, business PowerPoints, and menus, just to name a few. Not only will the
number shock you, but you will also be able to reflect back on how the day would
have gone differently (and, perhaps, more inconveniently) if those pieces of
technical writing and technical communication were missing.

While many definitions of technical writing exist, the definition put forth by
Kristin R. Woolever (1999) in Writing for the Technical Professions best captures
the purpose and ubiquity of technical writing: "Technical writing is writing that
gets things done." Earlier visions of technical writing tended to have a tighter
focus on documents such as user manuals and technical reports; however, we
live in an age when technical writing is multiplying, and even the traditional
writing style within the field is evolving as entirely new forms of technical writing
are developing.

Before we examine those changes and the difference between technical writing
and technical communication, though, let's unpack Woolever's definition. In order
to "get something done," a piece of writing needs to connect with a group of
specific people to help them achieve a specific goal. In technical writing, those
people are referred to as "users" because they are going to use the technical
writing to accomplish a task. Whether it's using a manual to assemble a bike,
reading online FAQs from Apple to program a new iPhone, or even watching a
Tik-Tok video to bake a vanilla strawberry cake, technical writing has to keep the
needs of users foremost during its construction.

Many people's conceptions of technical writing are still shaped by traditional
notions such as user manuals or instructions, especially those rooted to technical
devices such as computer hardware and software. Other common types of
technical writing include how-to guides, quick references, informative
illustrations, job training documents, FAQ, product support, journal articles,
instructions, and reference materials. Most of the writing and communication in a
workplace setting would also fall under the umbrella of technical writing.

                                                                                                                                           10
Although the average person might still think of technical writing as words on
printed paper (i.e., a user manual that comes with a new laptop or cellphone),
those paper manuals can get lost or damaged. Additionally, the proliferation of
technical writing across all available digital technologies means people can often
find information from the same paper manual in a different form such as a short
or long YouTube video, a website, a podcast, a Reddit thread, or a Tik-Tok video.
The technical writing of the manual can exist across different forms and might be
more accurately characterized as technical communication.

1.2: What Is the Difference Between Technical
Writing and Technical Communication?

While this textbook's title indicates a focus on technical writing, it is important to
note all technical writing includes aspects of the larger genre it resides in, which
is technical communication. When you are first asked to picture technical writing,
you may picture a dense manual filled only with words. Yet, even such a manual
has many elements beyond words to help the manual connect with users and
allow them to accomplish what the manual sets out to achieve. For example,
visual elements such as the margins on the page, white space after paragraphs,
and bold headings are indispensable in making the information clear to users. In
academic settings, much of the writing you are often asked to do focuses solely
on the words, never asking student writers to change elements of design such as
typeface or font size and to integrate images or graphs that might help readers.

Becoming a strong technical writer often means breaking out of entrenched
writing habits from earlier classes that focused on genres such as essay writing.
Technical writing relies on other modes of communication beyond the written
word, and modern technical writers have to be excellent communicators who can
craft messages in words, sounds, charts, graphs, still images, moving images,
and mixtures of some--or all--of these modes. This book will cover aspects of
technical writing that some would characterize as technical communication, but
the fact is the two modes are closely integrated and almost impossible to
separate at this stage. For example, a United States student from Pennsylvania is
known as a Pennsylvanian and has an identity based on that reality. If that
student is meeting students from other states, the Pennsylvania origin would
come up when meeting new people at university, but the same student studying
abroad would share identify as an American first when meeting people and later
as a Pennsylvanian. In other words, the student is both Pennsylvanian and
American, but the claimed identity shifts based on other people's familiarity with
the United States. Technical writers are also technical communicators, and their

                                                                                                                                           11
identity shifts based on what kind of communication they need to meet the needs
of their users.

If you want your writing to "get things done," you will have to understand how
best to reach users. That may mean going beyond words on a page to create a
set of images, or a video with minimal words, or a warning sign instead.
Technical writing may not be creative writing, but technical writers must be
creative during the entire planning, drafting, and revising process. Technical
writers must be flexible and adaptive: There is no easy set of writing rules and
checklists that translates into a perfect finished product to meet all users' needs.

While this book embraces an expansive notion of technical writing, it does help to
look at ways others may see the relationship between technical writing and
technical communication.

To demonstrate how tricky it can be to distinguish technical writing from
technical communication, here's a definition of technical communication from the
Society for Technical Communication that can also apply to technical writing:
"Technical communication involves the delivery of clear, consistent, and factual
information--often stemming from complex concepts--for safe and efficient use
and effective comprehension by users. Technical communication is a user-
centered approach for providing the right information, in the right way, at the
right time so that the user's life is more productive." (Society For Technical
Communication, "Defining Technical Communication").

Note that the definition from the Society for Technical Communication never
mentions writing or words specifically, but all modes of communication would be
covered under what they say technical communication does: Somebody--
whether a technical writer or technical communicator--shapes information in a
clear, consistent, and factual way for users. Although information can now be
delivered in myriad ways thanks to the proliferation of digital genres enabled by
contemporary digital technologies, technical writing still has some unifying
characteristics that can help its practitioners to accomplish their ends.

1.3: What Are the 5 C's of Technical Writing?

Because technical writing consists of many genres and types of communication, it
helps to identify stylistic hallmarks that most technical writing strives to achieve.
Understanding these traditional qualities helps student writers to identify
technical writing and to deploy them in their own writing. Collectively, these

                                                                                                                                           12
stylistic qualities have been called the "5 C's" of technical writing: clear,
concise, complete, consistent, and correct.

1. Clear

The clearer a technical writer can convey information, the easier a document will
be to understand for its users. Readers shouldn't have to re-read sentences
multiple times and routinely go outside the text to look up the meaning of words.
Clarity is found not only in word choice and sentence structure, but also in the
choices made when delivering content in general. Instead of words, it may be
better to use a graph, image, diagram, or screenshot to explain it instead. Here
are some other aspects that help technical writing to become clear:

      · Writers should only use complex and technical terms when necessary and
         appropriate

      · Writers should try to select words that have one clear meaning

      · Writers should define terms, abbreviations, and acronyms that may be
         new or may be used in an unfamiliar sense for readers

      · Writers should include clear examples to help put unfamiliar words and
         concepts in context for readers

2. Concise

Technical writers strive to convey their information as succinctly as possible.
Overwhelming readers with too many words can get in the way of understanding
the main message. Making writing concise can be difficult for student writers who
are accustomed to writing for classes where they have to artificially inflate their
word counts to reach specific page requirements. On the other hand, cutting too
many words from a piece of technical writing can be just as detrimental as
including too many. Testing a piece of technical writing with intended users is key
to figuring out if you have achieved the perfect level of concision.

      · Writers should make sure every word is necessary

      · Writers need to employ strategies such as effective summary to shrink
         content

      · Writers need to understand when one image or chart or graph can replace
         a large section of text

                                                                                                                                           13
      · Writers need to distinguish between good repetition that can enhance
         understanding and bad repetition that bloats documents

      · Writers need to develop editing skills to make their technical writing as
         concise as possible

3. Consistent

A piece of technical writing that follows the principle of consistency helps users to
understand the information better and more quickly. A consistent piece of
technical writing also instills confidence about the author in the reader.

      · Writers should follow similar writing and design conventions throughout a
         document (e.g., heading style, typeface, comma placement in lists,
         alignment, paragraphing style, tone)

      · Writers should make sure internal citation style, if used, is consistent with
         the citation style of the end references

      · Writers should make sure elements such as charts and graphs follow
         consistent conventions in how they are introduced, presented, and
         discussed afterwards

      · Writers should make sure additional elements such as lists follow similar
         conventions and employ parallelism--making sure to list items with the
         same part of speech, such as a noun or verb

4. Complete

While making sure a document is complete may sometimes cause issues with
making sure it remains concise, a complete document seeks to include all
relevant information for users. A complete document is one that can stand alone.
Users shouldn't have to consult other documents to finish understanding your
piece of technical writing.

      · Writers should include all relevant information in sufficient detail

      · Writers can include additional resources and appendices to make sure
         users have additional information they need

      · Writers can only be sure their content is complete by getting feedback
         from their intended users and revising accordingly

                                                                                                                                           14
5. Correct

Technical writers need to make sure their writing is correct, which covers aspects
within their control such as grammar, mechanics, and spelling, as well as aspects
they may need to consult other people on, such as whether all information is
correct and all claims are truthful. Technical writers may need to consult other
colleagues and subject matter experts to make sure their content is correct.
Mistakes in content and form can lead to major problems on the user's end, and
technical writers who cut corners when it comes to correctness are guilty of
ethical lapses because mistakes and omissions can lead to actual physical harm
in some cases.

For example, Malm furniture from Ikea tipped over and killed multiple children
because the instructions did not state that wall anchoring was required to avoid
accidents. (For more information, see the recall notice Ikea put out in 2016)

      · Writers need to produce error-free writing that enhances understanding,
         trust, and credibility

      · Writers need to start early and revise often so they have enough time to
         address issues of correctness thoroughly before publishing

      · Writers need to consult others to get feedback and fresh perspectives on
         the correctness of their writing

      · Writers need to be proactive in consulting others who may be subject
         matter experts in order to weed out inaccuracies

      · Writers need to understand their users thoroughly in order to provide the
         right information in the right format

1.4: How Does Rhetoric Apply to Technical Writing?

Throughout this textbook, rhetorical terms and concepts will be applied to
technical writing. This section will provide a brief overview of rhetorical terms
and concepts; then, each chapter will expand on and apply the concepts to
various technical writing assignments.

Defining rhetoric is kind of like defining technical writing. Various types of
definitions abound, and some have a much more expansive notion of rhetoric
than traditional definitions.

                                                                                                                                           15
With that in mind, this definition from Gerard Hauser (1986) is most helpful:
"Rhetoric is the management of symbols in order to coordinate social action" (p.
3).

Note how Hauser's definition tracks with Kristen Woolever's definition of technical
writing.

By coordinating "social action," rhetoric can also be used to "get things done." In
Hauser's definition, somebody--an author, a creator--is managing symbols,
which can be methods of communication such as words, audio, images, and
gestures to help people do something.

In Hauser's definition, a key question arises: If a speaker or writer is "managing
symbols" to "coordinate social action," then who is performing the social action?
In rhetorical terms, that would be the audience, and in technical writing terms,
that would be end users. In rhetoric, the concept of audience has many layers
since different audiences may use a text or document in different ways. A
primary audience is the original intended audience who might use a document
for its original intended purpose, but a secondary audience may use a
document for a completely different purpose. In technical writing, a document
often has just one overarching goal that tends to be the focus. For example, if
you're creating an instruction manual to put a bicycle together, you need to
shape the necessary information so the primary audience can perform the action
of putting a bike together for its rider to use it safely and effectively. A secondary
audience might be end users who are trying to purchase a bike based on how
easy it looks to put together.

The tricky part is that whatever end users the technical writer has in mind, no
two people are exactly the same; therefore, no two people will read, digest, and
deploy the information in the manual in the exact same way. To make it more
difficult, the world we live in has so many digital technologies that audiences can
be broader than ever before because of how easy it is to share information
around the world. Today's manuals--or any other piece of technical writing--can
have a much larger audience of end users than originally intended. However,
many factors will affect whether that manual can connect with a wider audience:
How good would somebody's English skills need to be to follow the manual? Do
the manual's writers have the skills to produce the manual in multiple languages?
Can the manual writer rely on the audience to not only have access to the right
tools (i.e., screwdrivers and so forth), but also be able to use them use correctly?
Figuring out the interest level, skills, and aptitudes of the end user--and

                                                                                                                                           16
structuring the language in documents to meet their needs--is the key to
technical writing.

Companies can't afford to conduct exhaustive research on each customer and
tailor their user manuals to each one. Instead, technical writers have to access
data about their end users--if any exists--and otherwise try to factor in how
personal aspects such as age, language ability, skills, interests, occupation,
intelligence, class, values, and beliefs will affect how those end users interpret
what the technical writer wrote. Ideally, technical writers would be able to "test"
their documents first on some end users before releasing them to the wider
public, a process known as usability testing.

So, if you are tasked with writing a technical document for a class, you might
approach the assignment from your own point of view and think about the people
around you as end users because that's the audience you may be most familiar
with. However, you may be thinking of the needs of those fellow students when
writing your document and realize your final draft meets the needs of a broad
range of 19-25-year-olds who speak English as a first language, are curious, and
are reasonably well-educated. But would a 70-year-old person with a passing
knowledge of English and vision problems be able to fully access and digest the
same instructions?

Another key rhetorical term associated with audience is purpose, which is the
goal of a particular piece of communication, or what that piece tries to
accomplish relative to its intended audience. A couple of common purposes
include: to persuade, to entertain, and--like this textbook--to inform. If technical
writing aims to "get things done," what it hopes to have end users accomplish
would be the purpose. One common purpose covered in the rhetorical sense is to
entertain, and it's also one purpose not traditionally associated with technical
writing. However, end users are people, and people do not adhere to the same
style, habits, and tone forever. Culture has an impact on people, and while
technical writing often has a main goal of informing, how it accomplishes that
goal has shifted so that elements of entertainment are increasingly used to
engage users and help them understand concepts. For example, the TikTok star
Khaby Lame shows users how to make overcomplicated lifehacks simple in
humorous ways.

How culture affects a society and thus impacts how people respond to texts is
covered by another rhetorical term: context. Both audience and purpose are
inextricably affected by context. These are historical, cultural, emotional and
temporal factors that shape a composition relative to audience and purpose. In

                                                                                                                                           17
other words, context is outside of an author's control, but context will affect how
users perceive a piece of writing, whether it's technical writing or any other kind
of writing. For example, at this moment in the United States, most people--even
if they have the ability--don't have the time, bandwidth or patience to read a
200-page instruction manual in print form. A company that recognizes this reality
would decide to give end users instructions that were much shorter, perhaps
even just focusing on a few particular tasks instead of one comprehensive
manual, and they may choose to publish the manual on YouTube or Tik-Tok
instead.
Similarly, how we communicate in terms of style is shaped by the greater context
as well. Current instruction manuals don't use the same stiff, formal wording as
before, and they don't feature extremely long sentences and gigantic
paragraphs, either. There has been a shift toward informal communication in
public and private discourse, and that affects what people expect from--and how
people perceive--technical writing.
You can see this shift even if you look at pieces of technical writing that are as
deathly serious as airline safety cards. Below, Figure 1 shows one of the first
airline safety pamphlets, produced by KLM airlines for Amsterdam-London flights
in 1924:

                                                                                                                                           18

instructions--what the user needs to do in case of an emergency. The two
illustrations are helpful, but not strictly necessary for comprehension.

While airline safety pamphlets/cards such as the    Figure 3: Airline Safety Card
one from KLM in Figures 1 and 2 existed in                   for 1968 PSA 737
many forms and on many different airlines from
the early 1920s onward, they weren't mandated
to be on all United States aircraft until 1965. In
Figure 3, you can see one of these early
mandated airline safety cards from a Pacific
Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in 1968.

More than forty years removed from the KLM
example in Figures 1 and 2, the 1968 PSA
example in Figure 3 still relies on words to
comprise the bulk of its message. However,
there are more images that play an important
role in understanding the message and in
translating that message to the actions needed
to save lives in an emergency. The ratio of
word-image on the page in the 1924 example
has significantly lowered by the 1968 example
(the 1968 example is almost equal in word to
image, but the 1924 example is about 90%
words).

Later, safety cards evolved even further as

culture shifted--flying became cheaper, meaning

more people and more families were flying all

over the world. As a result, the airline safety

cards adopted the more universal language of        Airline safety card from Pacific

heavy safety cards is much broader than the earlier ones as exemplified in the
pamphlet of 1924 in Figures 1 and 2. However, as we discussed before, the
context for how documents are read and understood, as well as how end users
can translate them into accomplishing a meaningful action, are always changing.

To wit, the act of flying has gotten less like the casual experience of earlier eras,
in part because carriers have organized their business models around connecting
flights from particular hubs, not to mention the act of getting to the plane itself
has become more time-consuming since the security changes resulting from
post-9/11 measures to ratchet up airport safety. Though the same visual safety
card sits in the seat pocket before the passenger and the flight attendants stand
up and demonstrate how to fasten and unfasten a seat belt or oxygen bag, a
large portion of their audience is sitting there thinking: Am I going to make my
connecting flight? Did I turn the stove off? Did I take a picture of the section
number in the parking lot? Is my phone actually off and in "airplane mode"? Do I
have the right information to find the shuttle at my final destination? Airlines
noticed passengers weren't paying attention to the safety procedures, and they
reacted with a new type of airline safety card.

While airline safety videos emerged in the 1980s and were mainly low budget
affairs that went routinely through the same steps the flight attendants were
showing, subsequent airline safety videos became complex affairs that some
airlines put a good amount of time and money into. Because airlines noticed how
disengaged passengers were during these safety proceedings in the current
context of modern life with technology, they introduced other types of technical
communication aimed at engaging passengers while still conveying the same
important safety messages.

As you might expect or have experienced yourself, these newer versions shifted
from printed cards on the backs of seats and familiar in-person flight attendant
demonstrations to engaging--even entertaining--videos. The videos were crafted
to cut through the realities of current passengers and distinguish themselves
from earlier airline safety cards in order to attract users' attention. No matter
how easy the visual safety cards may be to comprehend, they can't be successful
if no user plucks it out of the seat pouch and actually reads it. The videos have a
tone and style not often associated with traditional notions of technical writing.
They include non-sequiturs, induce laughter in some cases, and entertain as they
inform. Some of them even serve multiple marketing purposes as they seek to
inform passengers how to protect themselves from serious airline incidents.

the means to attract attention and convey important safety messages, while also

helping to market Air New Zealand, New Zealand tourism, and a particular film
franchise about to debut another film at the time of this safety video's release:

                   watch on YouTube. (Note: The video transcript is included in the chapter appendix.)

While these and similar airline safety videos proliferated for a relatively long
time, no piece of technical writing can engage 100% of its audience effectively
for an unlimited amount of time. As a result, some airlines went back to more
basic videos once the budgets needed to creatively "one-up each other"
skyrocketed, Passengers acclimated to these entertaining videos as well, with
many going back to ignoring them or just preferring a more serious and sober
approach to the hazardous issue of airline safety. Regardless of which approach
is best, technical writers need to understand how context affects their audience
and to plan, adjust, and revise their documents accordingly. Changes in tone,
style, form, and delivery must be made in order to maximize the connection and
understanding of technical writing for their chosen audience.

                                                                                                                                           24
In addition to audience, purpose, and context, the other three rhetorical terms
that will come up often in this book are known as the "three classical strategies
of persuasion." While not every piece of technical writing seeks to persuade its
audience, many technical writing genres do seek to persuade, one of which--
recommendation reports--is covered in this book.

The first of these three classical strategies is ethos. In previous writing classes,
your instructor may have defined ethos as "the ethical appeal." In other words,
the author/speaker bases an argument on what is best for the greater good, or
what is more moral. Because the audience sees the author/speaker advocating
for the greater good and following beneficial ethics as a means to an end, the
author/speaker should be believed and the audience should be persuaded to
follow that path.

A more expansive view of ethos highlights credibility as rooted in credibility: We
should be persuaded based on the perceived character of the author/speaker. For
example, if we are reading a medical report advocating for a particular type of
treatment, readers would react differently if the text were written by a doctor
with 30 years of experience treating this exact condition versus someone on
Facebook who has never been a doctor and is advocating a treatment for the
same condition based on something they overheard standing in line at the
supermarket. In this sense, credentials and qualifications, as well as lived
experience, contribute to ethos as a persuasive appeal. Credentials and
qualifications tie back not only to the author of a piece of technical writing, but
also to any people or documents cited in the piece of technical writing itself.

Ethos is also found in attitudes and beliefs communicated directly by statements
within a text, as well as attitudes and beliefs communicated indirectly through
tone and style. For example, if a piece of technical writing is stiff and formal or
written in passive voice, it will come off much differently than one using informal
language or humorous examples to get points across. Compare Figure 1 (the
KLM airline safety card) to Figure 4 (the Air New Zealand Safety video) above in
terms of ethos. One takes a matter-of-fact approach and one takes a humorous
one, but both have the same end goals of helping users understand airline
safety.

While you may not think you are deploying a distinct ethos approach in your
technical writing (especially if you only think of ethos as "the ethical appeal"),
ethos is always going to be present in your technical writing: If your name is on
the document and if your perceived character as a technical writer is evident to
the readers, then they will form an opinion of you and your skills as they read.

                                                                                                                                           25
Are there three typos in the first sentence of your recommendation report? Did
you tell users to use the wrong kind of screwdriver in the first step of instructions
to put together a bike? Neither of these examples bodes well for establishing
trust with your audience as a helpful, clear, concise, trustworthy author of
technical writing.

The next classical strategy of persuasion is logos, which is the appeal based on
logic or reason. In rhetorical terms, the logos appeal means the audience should
believe the composer based on the logic found in their ideas, the cogent
relationships between ideas, and the overall logical arrangement of the piece. A
logos appeal is often easy to identify because readers will see a reliance on
statistics, quantitative data, and indisputable facts. However, logos can also rely
on crafting logical arguments and using structures such as cause and effect, and
it can also be found in the overall logical arrangement of a piece. Having a
natural order to the progression of ideas and logical, orderly transitions (or in
technical writing such as user documentation, the right steps in the right order)
can be seen as a type of logos, as well. Logos may also be present in technical
writing in the overall arrangement by ascertaining how and when to integrate
visuals and text in order to help readers understand information better.

The third and final classical strategy of persuasion is pathos, which is the appeal
based on the aroused emotions of the audience. A pathos appeal means the
audience should believe the writer/speaker based on the emotions provoked in
them by what the author has put before them. Traditionally, pathos is achieved
by using strong images and evocative words that arouse particular feelings in the
audience. It can also be achieved by tapping into ideas that have deep cultural
relevance or resonance, such as "freedom" or "the loving family." Creative writers
often evoke pathos by using descriptive language and tools like metaphor and
simile to paint a picture in their readers' minds that elicits emotions. Picture
almost any commercial asking you to donate money to an animal shelter, and
you will find a pathos appeal: The sad music and images of cute animals in need
of love and care are designed to stir your emotions, particularly those of
sympathy and compassion.

When considering pathos as an appeal, many people would say that pathos does
not belong in technical writing whatsoever, and traditionally, pathos certainly has
been lacking in technical writing. In the airline safety cards discussed above,
note how pathos was missing from the early examples of airline safety cards. In
this particular instance, you can see why the authors did not want to arouse
emotions, such as fear or apprehension. Flying on airplanes, especially in air
travel's relative infancy, was fraught with danger and the authors wanted to

                                                                                                                                           26
purposely avoid instigating any negative emotions of among passengers. Even
with the visual airline safety cards, they do not rely on scary images involving
plane crashes to arouse the emotions of the audience and make them pay
attention; they adhere to a more logos-based approach of informing the users
about each small step to take in order to achieve safety. Later, the Air New
Zealand injected pathos as a way to attract and hold passengers' attention,
primarily by using absurd images to generate humor and thus entertain the
audience enough to pay attention to the pertinent information.

However, relying almost entirely on logos has been the main identifying strategy
of technical writing since its inception, and that hasn't always worked out for end
users. Some instruction manuals for products like VCRs, word processors, and
cameras ran to hundreds of pages. Even in earlier eras with less competition for
attention and means of delivering messages, people weren't clamoring for more
technical writing pieces like those giant, logos-dominated user manuals.

Today, more and more technical writers are embracing aspects of pathos to
better engage the audience, even if logos is still the primary strategy for
delivering the information that needs to be delivered. Pathos can be deployed to
attract a user's attention and direct it to the most salient points of information
the piece of technical writing is trying to deliver, or simply to provide a break or
re-set, allowing users to re-focus on the logos-heavy parts. Pathos can also be
used in terms of design to help make things exciting and help users pay
attention.

If the goal of technical writing is to "get things done," a piece of technical writing
can't get anything done if people aren't paying attention to it. This doesn't mean
every piece of technical writing has to sound like a piece of advertising
engineered to recruit pathos to connect with viewers, but it does mean technical
writers need to acknowledge the real circumstances that their audiences inhabit.
In our current communication contexts, a tidal wave of content is trying to get
our attention across print, audio, websites, phone apps, tv streaming apps,
dozens of social media apps, etc., so technical writing has to be able to cut
through the same noise every other piece of communication faces as well.

Though we may not think our modern society has much in common with ancient
Greece, where these three classical strategies of persuasion were first identified
and explored, it seems that the best strategy for many pieces of technical writing
is similar to what Aristotle advocated so many centuries ago: An author/speaker
needs to use all three strategies of persuasion--ethos, logos and pathos--to

                                                                                                                                           27
create the kind of communication that's going to connect with the widest amount
of the intended audience.

Pathos still may not be present in a very strong and consistent way across most
pieces of technical writing, but it is found more and more in modern technical
writing. Even if it means embracing the turn to informality that seems to be a
growing shared cultural concept (which you can see in instruction materials for
current video games compared to things like earlier pieces of computer
software), technical writers must have the flexibility to appeal to the preferred
attitudes and predilections of their audience regarding communication techniques
to be successful.

1.5: How Do We Use This Textbook?

Rather than providing disembodied chapters focusing on lists of technical writing
do's and don'ts, this textbook includes chapters centered on one skill within
technical writing and addresses it through an actual writing assignment and
reviewing samples for that assignment. The goal is to produce a textbook that
introduces students to technical writing and provides a baseline of skills they can
use to enhance their skills in subsequent courses.

0:31 Welcome to Middle Earth my friend.

0:34  I'm here to guide you on your journey so cease your rabble rousing and
      listen very carefully

0:39 and obey all crewmember instructions and all illuminated signs.

0:43 If the seatbelt sign were to illuminate, return to your seat right away!

0:48  Make sure all valuables at your feet are pushed under the seat in front
      of you.

0:52 and fasten your seatbelt low across your hips.

0:54  Although we recommend you keep your seatbelt fastened through the
      flight, if you do need to get up,

0:58 release by lifting the lever, or pressing down on the button.

1:06  Oxygen is precious to you beyond measure so if an oxygen mask should
      drop down from above,

1:11  pull down on the mask, place over your nose and mouth and adjust the
      elastic on both sides for a secure fit.

1:18  There's no need to sound the alarm if the bag doesn't inflate, there's
      plenty of oxygen flowing through freely.

1:24  If you have halflings or young ones, secure your own mask before
      helping with theirs.

1:30  If there's a mishap during take off or landing, brace yourself on the seat
      in front of you.

1:35 I myself prefer the more compact method.

1:37  Put your hands on your head, your elbows on either side of your legs
      and your feet flat on the floor.

1:45  When seated in Business Premier, sit upright, rest your hands on your
      thighs and keep your feet firmly on the floor.

1:54  Lifejackets are easily put on while seated, just rip open the pouch, slip
      it over your head,

                                                                                 29

Chapter 2 | Summarizing: Patent Summary
Assignment

2.1: What Is Summary, and Why Is It Important?

One of the key skills writers must develop within technical writing is the ability to
summarize complex documents so that a broader audience can access the main
ideas from those documents. To recall the 5 C's presented in Chapter 1, technical
writing strives to be clear, concise, complete, consistent, and correct.
Summarizing information plays a part in being able to meet all those C's,
especially in creating technical writing that is clear and concise.

A key element of technical writing involves taking information from a specialized
audience to a more general audience who only needs--or wants--certain pieces
of an original document. Technical documents often need to be read by many
groups within a company or organization, and many of those workers are very
pressed for time and need to access the main points of those documents that
concern them or their departments very quickly. Most workers don't have the
luxury of unlimited time to read a 150-page report that may or not pertain to
them. Instead, that report will include elements of summary, such as an
executive summary or abstract, up front in the report to help readers decide if
the entire report is relevant for them.

Summaries such as these help people budget their time and direct their attention
where it is needed.

The goal of a summary is to deliver an overview of the essential facts and key
takeaways from a larger document. Summaries help to "get things done"
because they allow a wide variety of audiences to be more efficient in grasping
ideas and accomplishing tasks. Though summary may be most closely associated
with helping to achieve clarity and concision, there are other reasons why the
ability to summarize larger documents is so important to technical writing.
Summaries can accomplish all of the following:

1. Facilitate Efficiency

      · Summaries help readers understand large documents more quickly

      · Summaries direct users' limited attention to the most important and
         relevant parts of a document

                                                                                                                                           32
2. Increase Accessibility

      · Summaries allow a wider range of readers to access--and make informed
         decisions about--larger, more complex documents

      · Summaries increase accessibility, which can lead to better decision making
         and higher levels of organizational inclusivity

3. Improve Navigation

      · Summaries can help readers figure out what sections of a larger document
         they may need to focus on

4. Help Knowledge Retention

      · Summaries help readers remember important information because they
         deliver information in an accessible, easy-to-remember way

      · Summaries can act as an excellent reference point in the future when
         readers need to return to a document for some reason

5. Ensure Consistency and Clarity

      · Summaries help to maintain a consistent tone and message when
         condensing material from multiple sources

6. Preserve Important Details

      · Summaries allow many industries and businesses to maintain records that
         can help with compliance, safety, and legal issues

      · Summaries preserve essential details that can be important for future
         readers to access

2.2: What Are Some Techniques for Summarizing?

To summarize technical information, the first step is fighting the urge to do it
quickly because that often ends up taking more time in the long run or needing
to go back and revise significantly because of clarity and correctness issues.
Many students try to summarize a document the first time they read through it,
but the quality of the summary invariably suffers, and it will need heavy revision
before it can connect with an audience satisfactorily.

Instead, it is more beneficial to slow down and approach summary in stages:

                                                                                                                                           33
1. The Reading and Pre-Writing Stage

      · Read the document you are trying to summarize multiple times
      · Get as familiar with the source material as you can: Read it as many times

         as you need to until you know it better than you know your best friend
      · Take the time to look up unfamiliar words
      · Jot down notes along the way
      · Identify the main points, findings, and conclusions or even what might be

         called the thesis of what you are trying to summarize
      · Take the time to reach out to others who may understand the concepts

         more: Technical writing is a large and collaborative field--nobody can be
         expected to know the minutiae of every topic well enough to write about
         them accurately

2. The Writing Stage

      · Be sure to include attributions such as author(s), titles, or technologies
              Readers may want to consult the original text, so provide a means to
                access the original document being summarized when possible

      · Include the wider context of the document such as date written and for
         what original purpose (e.g., a memo or feasibility report)

      · Develop one sentence for each key point or main idea
      · Structure the main ideas and key points in order of importance, with the

         most important appearing first (except when you are summarizing
         something organized in steps or some other pattern)

             i. Identify the most important points and details
             ii. Purpose: Why do readers need the information?
             iii.Main Concept(s): What are the fundamental ideas?
             iv.Steps/Processes (if needed)
             v. Key Findings: What are the crucial stats/results/conclusions?

                                                                                                                                           34
             vi.Implications: How will this change things? How does this apply in
                 practice?

      · Focus on paraphrasing (putting the document into your own words) so that
         you can turn it into an accessible style the audience may require

              If the original is written in a way that is perfect for users already, then
                you may consider quoting directly from it in the summary

      · Avoid jargon and acronyms if possible, or define them if they are key parts
         of the account

             i. How much you need to do this will depend on your knowledge of the
                 audience: You won't have to do it much, if at all, if the audience is
                 comprised of experts

             ii. If the summary is designed for non-experts, it may end up longer
                 because key points and language terms may need to be defined

      · Use simple, direct sentence constructions such as subject-verb-object

      · Present the summary with visual elements that help the audience make
         sense of the information, such as headings, bullet points, and numbered
         lists

      · If the source material contains a lot of complex data, try using charts,
         tables, and diagrams to simplify that data for readers in a more visual way

      · The summary should be able to stand alone and make meaning: Readers
         shouldn't have to return to the original document to understand it

3. The Revision Stage

      · Review your draft and focus on the following questions:

             i. Are the ideas in the original complete?

             ii. Are the ideas concise?

      · Can you cut the draft down and still express the ideas adequately?

             i. If you can cut it down, is the summary still clear?

             ii. If you can cut it down, is the summary still correct and ethical in
                 explaining what the original set out to do?

                                                                                                                                           35
      · Focus on proofreading, as well as on actual grammar and mechanics issues
         that may cause confusion

      · Verify your summary is correct and true to the meaning of the original by
         consulting others who may be more knowledgeable about the subject
         being summarized

      · Test your summary on a few people in your target audience before
         releasing it to a wider audience

      · Is the summary comprehensive without being overwhelming? Can you cut
         the length by cutting out unnecessary information or phrases that are too
         wordy?

2.3: Assignment in Focus: Writing a Patent Summary

While many student writers are familiar with summarizing longer quotations to
be included as sources within research papers, or maybe even writing abstracts
and executive summaries for longer reports, the following assignment is a good
one to develop students' abilities to summarize complex ideas for a more general
audience. The assignment also helps students practice document design and
information hierarchy, which are important tools in making summaries connect
better with their audience.

The assignment asks students to select a patent from the United States
Government patent search site and summarize it for a wider, more general,
audience. Below, you will find the patent summary assignment sheet and rubric.
After both of those documents, you can read about the larger context of the
assignment and tips for putting it all together.

Patent Summary Assignment

Overview

For this assignment, we will practice core elements of technical communication--
summary, information architecture, clarity, and visual rhetoric--that will be
needed in future projects. It is worth 100 points of your overall grade.

Details

Select a patent from the US patent database and create a one-page, stand-alone
synopsis sheet that includes a visual representation, as well as other design
elements such as headings to help readers understand the patent. The goal is to

                                                                                                                                           36
explain the item to a wider, more general audience: Show what it is, why it is
needed, and why it is better than what already exists. You can pick any patent,
no matter how odd or funny the topic might be; however, I urge you to pick a
relatively modern one that readers could see a need for.

Places to Find Patents

      · Google Patents Search Engine
      · Advanced Google Patents Search
      · Google Resource for Searching Patents
      · United States Government Patent Page
      · Basic Patent Search Page by United States Government

Note: While the United States Government site is more comprehensive, the
Google Patents page is easier to navigate and includes patents from other
countries, too.

Grading

My evaluation will consider how thoughtfully your information is summarized,
selected, organized, designed, and presented (both textually and visually) with
regard to your audience and purpose. Visuals should adhere to the principles
discussed in class, and no typos should be present. See the Patent Summary
Rubric for more detailed information.

Starting the Assignment

To begin the assignment, the first step is to search for a patent that interests not
only you but also a larger audience because of its utility. Within the patent
summary search engine, you can easily find patents related to your interests and
hobbies. Whether you're interested in video games, sports, dogs, ice cream, or
inventions to help dogs eat ice cream, there's a patent for it. However, keep in
mind the United States issued its first patent in 1790, so it will be helpful to
choose a patent that's more modern for your audience to understand its
applicability to their everyday lives.

After locating the patent you'd like to focus on, review the rhetorical situation for
the assignment: You have one page to summarize the patent and to connect it
with a wider, more general audience with the goal of convincing people to
embrace the invention or possibly to invest in it. Think of the one-page summary
as being handed out at a conference of venture capitalists or to the board of a
local bank so that investors can help make the invention a reality for consumers.

For this to happen, your audience will need to understand the technology at the
heart of the invention and why the product represents something better than
what's currently available or, if a novel product, why it would be necessary in the
first place.

Below, you will find a patent, and after that, a student's sample summary of the
patent. In between, you will find additional context for student writers to
consider while doing the assignment, as well as tips and strategies for improving
the sample that you can apply to your work.

To begin, follow the process for summarizing that we outlined earlier in this
chapter and read the patent a few times while focusing on what the invention is,
what it does, how it works, and why it is needed.

                                                                  38

United States Patent Application Publication 20070052388 Kind Code A1
Publication Date March 08, 2007 Inventor(s) Wilson; John W. et al.

   Abstract

   A roller bag having integral thereto a battery and a small alternator geared
   to recharge the battery when the wheels of the roller bag are rotated (It
   might be me, but I do not understand this first sentence, particularly the
   phrase "integral thereto"). During times of commuting, such as within an
   airport terminal, between a terminal and a rental car facility, or in route to a
   hotel, the battery will remain charged and available to the mobile user to
   provide a reliable source of power. A power terminal is further integrated into
   the bag, providing external access to the battery, which power terminals (is
   "power terminals" needed here--sounds clunky) permit connection to
   portable electronic devices, and may include retractable cords and
   programming tips.

Background of the Invention

[0002] The traveling road warrior typically owns a host of accessories for
their portable electronic devices to make traveling easier and more
convenient. For instance, notebook computer bags, AC and DC input power
converters, extra batteries, retractable cords and so forth are just some
devices utilized to make operation of such devices possible when away from
the office and during travel.

[0003] Power converters are typically utilized to provide power to portable
electronic devices to facilitate the operation and/or recharging thereof. DC
power, such as the kind available from vehicles including cars and airplanes,
and AC power available from wall sources, are typically utilized by the power
converter to power the portable electronic devices to avoid the depletion of
battery and/or charge the batteries during use or when not in use.
Unfortunately, auxiliary power is not always available, and sometimes there
is no time to charge such devices in between travel, such as when traveling
through the airport terminal to terminal, from the terminal to a rental car
facility, and so forth. Hence, the traveling user often carries additional power
sources, including additional batteries, during these time periods.

[0004] There is desired an improved accessory adapted to provide power to
portable electronic devices in such situations, which accessory is convenient
and affordable.

Summary of the Invention

[0005] The present invention achieves technical advantages as a roller bag
having integral thereto a battery and a charger geared to recharge the
battery when the wheels of the roller bag are rotated. During times of
commuting, such as within an airport terminal, between a terminal and a
rental car facility, or in route to a hotel, the battery remains charged and
available to the mobile user to provide a reliable source of power. At least
one power terminal is further integrated into the bag providing external
access to the battery, which power terminals available to connect power
cords for portable electronic devices. A universal power solution is achieved
through utilization of a programming device, such as programming smart
tips.

Detailed Description of the Present Invention

[0009] Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a perspective view of a laptop
roller bag at 10 having an integral battery 12 chargeable by a battery
charger, shown as a generator 14, driven by wheels 16. Externally accessible
connectors 20 are seen to be electrically coupled to battery 12, which
provide access to power for charging and/or operating portable electronic
devices via one or more cables 22. At a distal end of each cable 22 may be a
detachable programming connector 24 adapted to mechanically interface to
a variety of portable electronic devices, and further which connecters power
24 program the output voltage and/or current to deliver energy suitable to
power a particular portable electronic device. Such interchangeable
programming tips 24 may comprise of iTips.TM. manufactured and marketed
by Mobility Electronics of Scottsdale, Ariz. Such programming connectors 24
program a power converter 26, which may be integral to battery 12 or
interposed between battery 12 and connector 20 as shown, to deliver the
appropriate power. Multiple connectors 20 are shown, each sourced with
power from battery 12 so as to provide power to multiple portable electronic
devices. Advantageously, the user has multiple power sources available via
connectors 20, each of which can be configured to provide a suitable voltage
to a different respective portable electronic device. Each of cables 22 may
further be individually retractable into the bag to provide further convenient
accessibility of cables 22 and convenient storage thereof when not in use.
The detachable tips 24 may be stored in a pocket or pouch integrated within
bag 10, or disposed within a pocket of bag 10. A retractable handle 40 is
also provided for convenient use thereof.

                                                                                                                                       43
[0010] Still referring to FIG. 1, there is shown alternator 14 electrically
coupled via cable 18 and connector 30 to battery 12. Alternator 14 may be a
DC alternator/mini-motor adapted to generate a suitable voltage and current
to charge battery 12, such as an internal lithium ion battery, although other
batteries are possible and limitation to a lithium ion battery is not to be
inferred.

[0011] Referring now to Table 1 and Table 2 below, there is shown some

[0013] As shown in Table 1, there is calculated the time to charge in minutes
to attain desired battery efficiency, based on the battery having 0 charge
prior to charging. Such time to charge is based upon the alternator/mini-
motor 14 providing a 4V voltage and a 2A current when rotated by wheels
16 having a 21/4'' diameter rotated at normal walking speed. As can be
appreciated, a 100% efficiency can be achieved in approximately 60
minutes. Of course, the size of the battery, the size of the alternator, and the
speed of rotation of same will determine the power generated available for
recharging the battery.

                                                                                                                                       44
[0014] In a further embodiment of the present invention, the notebook
computer (not shown) disposed within the laptop bag 10 can be adapted to
be directly charged from the alternator 14 if desired. Suitable wiring from
the alternator 14 to a voltage regulator, and ultimately provided to the
laptop computer, as shown in FIG. 3, provides for recharging of the notebook
computer without the need to remove the notebook computer and connect
same to the battery 12 via the cables 22.

[0015] Though the invention has been described with respect to a specific
preferred embodiment, many variations and modifications will become
apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the present application. It is
therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly
as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and
modifications.

   [End of patent.]

After you read the patent several times, a few points should stand out:

      · Patents are a distinct genre: A general audience would not be able to
         understand the patent in its original form very easily.

      · The patent itself is almost entirely an appeal to logos.

      · A lot of information can be removed, and a summary can still project the
         key points of the patent

To begin summarizing the rolling luggage cart patent, readers may tend to
gravitate toward the first section, the abstract, because that is, in effect, a
summary of the entire patent. However, when reading the entire patent, note
that the abstract is clearly meant as a summary for a specific audience--people

                                                                                                                                           46
who process United States patents--not a general audience who may be
interested in using or investing in the patent:

Abstract

A roller bag having integral thereto a battery and a small alternator geared to
recharge the battery when the wheels of the roller bag are rotated. During times
of commuting, such as within an airport terminal, between a terminal and a
rental car facility, or in route to a hotel, the battery will remain charged and
available to the mobile user to provide a reliable source of power. A power
terminal is further integrated into the bag providing external access to the
battery, which power terminals permit connection to portable electronic devices,
and may include retractable cords and programming tips.

Notes on Summarizing the Abstract and the Entire Patent

Overall, although the tone and style of the abstract within the patent summary is
not helpful to a general audience, certain sentences within the abstract do
describe the total invention. As mentioned in the strategies for summarizing
earlier in this chapter, those kinds of sentences would be much more effective if
paraphrased--that is, using language crafted by the technical writer--rather than
presented to the general audience in its original form as a direct citation.

That being said, technical writers must ensure that any paraphrases they make
maintain a professional-sounding style and tone. If your patent summary sounds
exaggerated/embellished because of excessive use of the pathos appeal, then it
will sound like pop-up advertising and provide a negative ethos for the audience
of technology investors. Instead, the patent summary will need to focus on a
strict logos appeal: Logically, why do we need this invention, and what are the
actual technological specifications that enable this invention to exist in the first
place? Focusing on logos will allow the summary to sound like actual technical
writing, which then allows the audience to focus on the heart of the invention,
not overly dramatic descriptions of its potential. It is not ethical to overpromise
and underdeliver on purpose, nor is it ethical to distort the abilities of a
technology just to entice investors. Paraphrases need to maintain the intent of
the original language, if not the same form.

                                                                                                                                           47
In addition to focusing on language, student writers will need to consider the
following questions as they draft their patent summary:

      · Why would this invention be granted a patent in the first place?

              Luggage and chargers already exist, so readers will need to
                understand why combining them is needed/necessary

      · How does this device function?

      · The author will need to be clear about its specifications and design so
         readers can understand how it functions.

      · How can readers picture the device?

              As the rubric states, there should be some type of visual that helps
                the audience understand the patent.

              Because many patents explore novel ideas without current iterations,
                student writers are left with the following choices when it comes to
                adding pictures: choose a representative image (or two) from the
                patent itself, include a publicly available image that helps readers
                understand how the patent might be used, or create an image to go
                with the patent

              Image selection is important because audiences rely on images to
                make meaning, but remember that some images from the patent may
                be too complex, and images included from other sources may feel like
                stock photos and give the summary an advertising feel that detracts
                from ethos

      · How can design be used to help the audience understand the patent?

              Because the patent summary consists of only a few paragraphs that
                must fit on one page, it is important that headings be used to guide
                the audience to important information

              White space--the blank area of the page without text or words--must
                also be used to provide balance and not overwhelm the reader with
                text

      · Can readers access the full patent?

                                                                                                                                           48
              Interested readers--and one of the goals in writing the patent
                summary is to create readers interested in the new invention--should
                be able to access the original patent in order to verify the summary's
                claims and find out more information that was not covered in the
                patent summary

              Readers will need at least the patent number, year, and authors to
                locate the patent on their own, but including a link to the original
                (either as a hyperlink or providing the entire URL if it's not too long)
                would be helpful

Sample Rough Draft of Patent Summary

Read the following student summary of the power luggage bag and determine
whether you think it answers all the preceding five questions adequately.

                           Luggage Bag with Internal Power Source

                                                       Abstract

   This patent is a novel idea most suited for travelers who must make frequent
transits in airports. This invention is a roller bag with a small alternator attached
 to the wheels of the bag, which provides a power source. The power source can

    be used to charge laptops or any other electronic device. The bag contains a
              lithiu -ion battery that stores electricity as it is being charged.

                                                        Details

   Most airlines allow hand luggage that can be stored by passengers inside the
   airplane during their travel. The average maximum weight of hand luggage is
around 25 pounds across different airlines. The current typical lithium-ion battery
  weighs 1 pound and thus has the capability of providing a power source for 5
   hours. This battery is capable of providing a power source for small electronic

         devices like smartphones and tablets for even longer periods of time.

                                                     Conclusion

  International travelers frequently face the dilemma of not being able to charge
their electronic devices during transits between countries or places. International
airports actually try to monetize on this basic need by not providing w fi or power
 sources to their travelers. Hotel rooms and lounges at these airports are usually

How Could the Sample Rough Draft Be Improved?

In terms of content and how well the rough draft summarizes the original patent
for a broader audience, let's begin by looking at the title because titles are very
important to the audience. In this case, the title that the rough draft uses,
"Luggage Bag with Internal Power Source," omits the fact that the power source
is rechargeable, and that information would be very important to the audience.

In terms of the rough draft's abstract, the heading for the abstract was taken
directly from the patent. For a general audience, "Abstract" may not be the best

                                                                                                                                           50
choice because it sounds overly formal, and a more direct heading such as
"Overview" would be more helpful.

In the paragraph that goes with the sample rough draft abstract, we find out the
bag is rechargeable, but that comes in the last sentence. It should be closer to
the beginning of the paragraph. The opening sentence is a little hard to follow,
and making it more simple would make it easier to help readers. One key piece
of technical information in this paragraph is that the device relies on an
alternator. While much of the audience may be familiar with that term from their
cars, some will still need to see a definition. However, the alternator is a key
piece of how the device functions, so it fits better in the paragraph detailing the
invention's function.

In the sample rough draft "Details" paragraph that explains how the invention
works, the logos contained in this paragraph is important. Readers will want to
know the rechargeable battery will not weigh too much, especially in a context
where every pound counts. Another key piece of information is how long the
power source might last, 45 hours. That number is very high and covers not only
domestic flights but even the longest international flights with modest layovers.
However, note how the specifics vary based on what devices need to be charged.
Readers were told the device can charge "laptops or any other electronic device"
in the first paragraph, but this paragraph says the 45 hour range can be even
longer for "small electronic devices like smartphones and tablets." Moreover, the
information itself was not inside the patent and came from a different source.
Sometimes technical writers may need to integrate something outside of the
source material to help a summary make sense, but the lack of specificity about
charging in this example raises questions for the readers even though the goal of
the summary should be to answer them. Since most passengers would only be
allowed to bring (and would most likely only want to bring) small personal
electronic devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets, what are the charging
differences among those devices? The original patent includes tables
demonstrating different charge times for small electronic devices, and the author
could include some of that information to help the audience understand the
invention's charging capabilities.

Out of the three images in the original patent, Figure 1 helps to illustrate the
overall concept best. Unless the writer can create a new image melding this
image with a rolling laptop bag to show a bag in use, freely available photos of
rolling bags wouldn't be able to show the functionality of the device as this cross-
section does.

For the last paragraph of the rough draft summary, "Conclusion" may not be the
best heading for such a short summary. Also, note how the focus shifts to
international travelers in this paragraph. Consistency is key to summarizing
information, so this paragraph should mirror the first one in terms of focus and
scope. The way the sentence about hotel rooms is phrased sounds like more of a
personal opinion that may not be shared by their audience. What is not arguable
is how the device provides flexibility for the traveler: If travelers have their own
rechargeable station, they don't have to worry whether ones provided by the
airports are full, and they don't have to walk all over the airport looking for
alternatives.

All told, some key information that needs to be included is how long the bags
need to be rolling to be able to provide a charge. Potential users will need to
know whether they have to walk a few hundred yards or wander aimlessly for
hours throughout an airport in order to generate power.

While the rough draft does include the patent number and the inventor, it would
be more helpful to the audience if a direct link to the patent was included as well.

Before we examine the summary rough draft deeper in terms of design and
layout, it is helpful to include some terms to apply to the design discussion. While
there are many schools of thought for understanding and applying design
principles, this textbook will focus on how to apply the C.R.A.P. principles from
Robin Williams's (2014) The Non-Designer's Design Book. These principles are a
foundational set of design guidelines that can help make any piece of technical
writing more effective and aesthetically pleasing. In each chapter, the sample
assignment will deepen the reader's understanding of how to apply the C.R.A.P.
principles.

The C.R.A.P. Design Principles Explained

C: Contrast

Definition: Contrast is what allows us to see. It draws attention and creates
visual interest. Contrast helps readers distinguish different elements on the page
and allows important information to grab readers' attention. (This is the only
definition of the four terms that does not begin with a verb in a present participle
form--I think that's what it's called)

      · Good uses of contrast in technical writing: Black text on white
         backgrounds allows for easy readability; using bold type and larger font
         size in headings helps distinguish them from body text

                                                                                                                                           52
      · Bad uses of contrast in technical writing: using the same font size,
         typeface, and color in a large user manual for body text and headings;
         using colors that don't contrast in body text and in visuals such as charts
         and graphs

R: Repetition

Definition: Repeating visual elements such as fonts, colors, and shapes
throughout a piece of technical writing to create consistency and unity.
Maintaining general consistency in layout and presentation for the readers.

      · Good uses of repetition in technical writing: Using the same style for
         headings, bullet points, body text, and font color for directions in a user
         manual while using a different but similar set for other elements such as
         tips and FAQ; using the same font sizes and colors for titles and body text
         on every slide of a presentation

      · Bad uses of repetition in technical writing: Switching fonts and styles
         so often that it makes a document seem random; switching visual styles
         such as representational photos to clipart and back again, causing visual
         chaos

A: Alignment

Definition: Aligning elements along a shared edge or line to help create order
and cohesive structure. Alignment helps guide readers around the page and
discern where their attention should focus while reading a document.

      · Good uses of alignment in technical writing: Left-aligning all
         headings, body text, and images to create one clean alignment; aligning
         all visuals such as screenshots on the left and centering captions
         underneath each one

      · Bad uses of alignment in technical writing: Having too many
         alignments in a document can make it seem unorganized and
         unprofessional; accidentally forgetting to make one paragraph or page
         share the same alignment as the rest of a document

P: Proximity

Definition: Placing related items together to show their relationship. This helps
organize information and reduces visual clutter.

                                                                                                                                           53
      · Good uses of proximity in technical writing: Placing headings next to
         the paragraphs they belong to; putting captions next to the images they
         describe

      · Bad uses of proximity in technical writing: Floating headings between
         paragraphs with equal spacing before and after; spacing related items far
         apart, which can confuse the viewer about which elements belong together

Applying the C.R.A.P. Principles to the Summary Rough Draft

To help understand the C.R.A.P. principles, let's apply them to the sample student
patent summary. In looking at just the first two paragraphs of the sample
summary, we can identify several issues that the C.R.A.P. principles would help
us address.

First, look at the headings. In terms of Contrast, the original headings were
bolded. However, they now use a larger font size than the body text to help
distinguish themselves from the regular text and grab readers' attention.

In terms of Proximity, the headings were floating with equal space before and
after; moving the header so it is next to the paragraph it goes with will help
readers.

For Alignment, everything was centered. Document design, just like all aspects
of art and design, goes through different eras, and documents with everything
centered often seem old-fashioned compared to the more modern style of
leaning on left-aligned text to help speed up readability and to make sure the
readers' eyes don't have to travel around the page and in and out of indents.

Repetition may not be seen to a huge degree in this summary rough draft, but
making sure the headings and paragraphs follow a consistent style in the final
draft would qualify. While the rough draft of the patent summary has a lot of
positives, the more revision a document undergoes, the better it can get it.

Here is the original draft with the initial summary revision suggestions and
C.R.A.P. design revision ideas applied:

                                                                                                                                           54
Luggage with Rechargeable Power Source

             Overview

 This patent provides a solution for travelers who cannot keep their electronic
  devices consistently charged on airplanes or at airports: a carry-on bag that
 charges an internal battery when the luggage is rolled. The bag includes both
internal and external charging ports and, based on the specifications of current
  lithium-ion batteries, could charge multiple small electronic devices such as

                laptops, cell phones, and tablets, for as long as 40 hours.

             How It Works

The roller bag has a small alternator attached
     to the wheels that provides power to a
     battery (see Figure 1 to the right). An
       alternator is a device that generates

   alternating current (AC) or direct current
(DC) electricity and can distribute that power
to another device. In this case, the alternator

  is powered by rolling at least one wheel of
    the bag, and it distributes power to the

rechargeable battery integrated into the bag.
   Walking at normal speeds, a traveler can

 charge the battery up to 100% efficiency in
  an hour. Figure 1 illustrates how the wheel

     connects to the alternator, which then
 connects to, and charges, the rechargeable

                             battery.

After applying the revisions to content and design, the patent summary has a
better chance of connecting with its targeted audience and, therefore, piquing
their interest in the rolling bag. Of course, the audience would want more
specifics before fully committing to investing in the technology, but the original
patent supplies the information that would be considered in any "next steps" and
is included in the document. The one-page patent summary can now stand alone
and answer questions about the patent for a general audience. Certain members
of the audience will always want more from a summary (in this case, more
detailed information on the charging efficiency of certain small electronic devices
was abundant in the patent), but being able to write a summary that connects
with as wide an audience as possible is a key skill in technical writing.

Chapter 3 | Visualizing: Warning Sign
Assignment

Being able to send a message visually is an important skill that all technical
writers should develop. As discussed in Chapter 1, we live in a society where we
rely on images to make meaning, and if we think of technical writing as primarily
words and technical communication as primarily images, the ability to visualize
messages has the potential to reach wider audiences than ever before via digital
media. Even in the real world, beyond the scope of digital environments,
technical communication relies on images to make meaning and connect with
audiences--navigation would be impossible without road signs, and reports and
presentations would be much harder to understand without charts and graphs to
make sense of data, just to name a few examples. Chapter 3 focuses on why and
how to visualize messages, culminating in you developing your own visualizing
skills by creating a warning sign.

3.1: Why Is the Ability To Visualize Information So
Important for Technical Writers?

Technical writers need to be able to visualize information because doing so
enables them to connect with end users in a more powerful way. Visualizing
information also provides many benefits for end users, allowing pieces of
technical communication to accomplish what they set out to do relative to their
intended audience.

1. Increased Clarity

Technical writing often deals with complex subjects, and using only text to make
meaning can be harder to process, especially for those who may be visual
learners. Moreover, audiences who see only giant blocks of text awaiting them on
the page may feel intimidated or less motivated to engage with the material on
hand. Visual elements such as diagrams, flowcharts, graphs, tables, and
annotated screenshots can help users understand technical writing more clearly

2. Increased Efficiency

Visuals can speed up both the reading and the learning process. Less text allows
users to read documents at a faster rate. Also, many users retain visual
information better than text alone, especially when it helps make texts more
concise because there is less material (i.e., fewer words/paragraphs) to
remember. When images help to shrink texts, they are easier to parse, especially

                                                                                                                                           57
when dealing with unfamiliar or relatively new topics. For example, think about
how much easier it is to diagnose an electrical issue for the first time by following
a visual wiring diagram than a long, text-only explanation of the same wiring
diagram.

3. Enhanced Adoption

Visuals help bridge language gaps end users might have, thereby increasing the
potential reach a piece of technical communication can have: Images can turn a
small, local audience into a global one. A well-labeled diagram or step-by-step
visual guide (such as the image-only directions IKEA provides for its furniture)
can be almost universally understood, which reduces the need for perfect
translation that was previously a hallmark for technical writing in different
languages to gain wider adoption.

4. Increased Engagement

Visual content can engage viewers and break up walls of text. Gone are the days
when users would willingly pick up an instruction manual that looks and reads
more like a 300-page novel. Well-chosen and well-placed visuals make pieces of
technical communication more inviting, which can help users get started on using
a piece of technical communication, as well as seeing the process through to the
end to accomplish what they need to do.

5. Enhanced Accuracy

Visuals can be used to help users cut down on errors while using technical
communication. For example, using a screenshot of a computer interface that
shows the user where to click with a red arrow is much clearer and less open to
interpretation than only using words to describe steps.

6. Efficient Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting areas of complex websites and instruction manuals (such as
frequently asked questions, aka FAQ) can expand into pages and pages of text
that users must sift through, therefore making it more tedious for users to find
what they need. Images can play a helpful role in troubleshooting docs because
visual cues like error screenshots, signal flow diagrams, parts/pieces visuals, or
device layouts allow readers to figure out what they're seeking more easily,
thereby speeding up diagnosis and solutions.

                                                                                                                                           58
3.2: Using Warning Signs To Understand How To
Visualize Information

Chapter 2 discusses why the ability to summarize is so important to technical
writers and why the ability to design information is also important for end users.
Chapter 2 introduced Robin Williams' C.R.A.P. design principles and demonstrated
how they can be applied to help written documents connect with their audiences
better. Chapter 3 focuses on discussing how to visualize information through the
lens of warning signs. To begin, the chapter will concentrate on analyzing the
specific genre of warning signs to determine the qualities that differentiate more
effective visualizations than others.

We are surrounded by warning signs, but we often don't stop to think why
they're effective and why they're even necessary in the first place. Warning signs
are an interesting genre to examine because they need to compress important
information into a visual-heavy format that conveys important information to a
broad audience. As such, warning signs offer technical communicators a good
way to think about the rhetorical situation of audience, purpose, and context, as
well as how to craft a credible ethos, how to harness logos to connect with an
audience, and how to use pathos to get attention.

First, the qualities of a successful warning sign need to be addressed. Note how
many of the qualities listed below are taken up during the conception phase. A
successful warning sign relies just as much on mechanical decisions (e.g., where
the sign itself should be placed, how large it should be, what material it should
be made of), if not more than the actual contents of the warning sign. Before a
successful warning sign can be deployed, the technical communicator needs a
thorough understanding of the audience to develop the conceptual properties of
the sign needed for it to connect with its audience:

1. Audience Awareness

A warning sign must consider who's reading it and adjust wording and images
accordingly. For example, what language(s) will be used? How much pathos can
be used to get the audience's attention without alienating them due to strong
images? Were too many words used to get the message across, possibly
confusing the intended audience?

2. Proper Placement

The warning sign needs to be located where people will see it before they
encounter the hazard. For example, signs about the hazards of diving need to be

                                                                                                                                           59
close to the areas of a pool kids or adults might consider diving in. The sign also
needs to consider placement in the sense of height. For example, putting
something aimed for adults at a toddler's height means many adults could walk
straight past the sign.

3. High Visibility

The warning sign should use bright colors (such as yellows, reds, and oranges)
with high contrast (usually black text or symbols on lighter backgrounds) so it
catches the audience's attention immediately. The message also needs to be
large enough to be seen from an appropriate distance relative to the danger.

4. Clear Symbolism

The warning sign should use clearly rendered, easily understandable images or
symbols that can communicate danger or caution (e.g., red for danger, yellow
bolts for electric shock). The images will need to make sense within the cultural
contexts of the intended audience, and creators should try to find images that
are direct and not metaphorical in nature.

5. Simple Wording

The warning sign should use direct language that's easy to understand, and it
should use as few words as possible to communicate its meaning. . It should
make sure the words can't be misinterpreted due to multiple meanings/readings
(e.g., "DANGER: High Voltage" or "WARNING: Wet Floor" are simple and clear
messages).

6. Urgent (but Appropriate) Tone

The warning sign should use language that corresponds to the potential danger
for the audience. In some instances, there are legal requirements for which
words should be used (a section below details how "Danger," "Warning," and
"Caution" are legally defined). The tone of the warning sign should also be
appropriate relative to the danger. An overwrought tone can be just as confusing
for the audience as an understated one. For example, posting a sign in an office
stating, "Beware of stapler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" would be as bad as posting a sign
near a campsite that says, "There might have been some grizzly bears seen
around here in the last few years or so."

                                                                                                                                           60
7. Consistent Format

The warning sign should exhibit repetition, the "R" in Williams' C.R.A.P.
principles. A warning sign that exhibits uniformity in its words, images, and
overall design is better able to amplify its message. For example, the audience
can process the sign faster if it's instantly clear the main message is in the same
font, the same color, and contained in a certain area within the sign.

3.3: Warning Sign Language

What are some of the most commonly used terms on warning signs, and what
are the differences in meaning among them? These differences in meaning go
beyond simple dictionary definitions--they have legal ramifications based on
whether they are accurately tied to the type of danger they are alerting their
audience about.

Anyone who has ever seen warning signs will notice that certain words are used
on almost every sign--"Danger," "Warning," and "Caution" probably come to
mind. These three words also have specific, standardized meanings in
government, legal, and industry regulations, especially in safety communications.
In the United States, the meanings of "Danger," "Warning," and "Caution" within
safety communications are defined by federal entities such as Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and public non-profits such as
American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

Using the correct terms on a warning sign isn't just a matter of good technical
communication--it is also a legal matter of compliance and liability. Here's how
OSHA and ANSI direct the words "Danger," "Warning," and "Caution" to be used:

DANGER

Danger is the most serious word that can be used on a warning sign. Danger
means that not abiding by what the sign tells you will cause death or serious
injury if not avoided. Think of danger as a red traffic light at a busy intersection
during rush hour: If you go through the red light, you will most likely be in a
serious accident that will cause death or serious injury. In the example below,
anybody who ignores the sign and touches the wires (or whatever else may lie
behind the sign) will be electrocuted, resulting in either death or serious bodily
harm that will probably require extensive hospitalization.

                                                                                                                                           61
                                                    Figure 1: Danger Sign

    Example of danger sign adhering to legal standards. "White and Red No Smoking Sign" by J Dean from
                                                                           Unsplash.

      · Summary: Danger indicates a hazardous situation that will cause death or
         serious injury if not avoided.

      · Severity: Highest level.
      · Audience Message: You must avoid an immediate and life-threatening

         risk nearby.
      · Design: Red background with white text, capital letters.

WARNING

Warning is the second most serious word to be found on a sign. Warning means
that not heeding what the sign tells you could cause death or serious injury. In
other words, there is a potentially hazardous situation that needs to be avoided.
Think of a warning sign as a blinking red traffic light: You need to follow traffic
rules and stop and look in all directions before proceeding or else you might end
up in a deadly accident if you just go right through the intersection. In the
example below, walking below a skyscraper while workers are repairing

                                                                                                                                           62
something on the 14th floor does not mean you will automatically get hit by
debris causing death or severe injury, but there is a chance that something could
fall at any point throughout the day, so pedestrians need to be watchful.

      · Summary: Warning indicates a hazardous situation that could cause
         death or serious injury (should this part be in bold?) if the message of the
         sign is not heeded.

      · Severity: Mid-level, but still very serious.
      · Audience Message: Pay close attention because a potentially lethal or

         extremely harmful situation could occur.
      · Color Code: Orange background with black text.

                                                                                                                                           63
CAUTION

Caution is another commonly used warning sign label. Caution means that if the
precautions on the sign are not taken, minor or moderate injury may result. It
can also refer to property damage (e.g., not heeding a sign could result in
damage to your car, such as driving through a parking garage gate without
paying attention). Caution may also be used to alert against unsafe practices
such as walking too close to a door that could open abruptly. In other words,
there is a potentially harmful situation that needs to be acknowledged and
avoided. Think of a caution sign as a yellow light: You need to pay attention to
your surroundings and look around before proceeding to make sure you avoid a
situation that could result in injury.

      · Summary: Indicates a hazardous situation that could cause minor or
         moderate injury if not avoided. It may be used for warnings pertaining to

         governing warning signs are particularly helpful.

      · In the United States, Occupational Safety and Health Administration
         (OSHA) also includes several helpful resources on warning signs. The

3.4: Case Study in Effective Warning Signs:
COVID-19 Examples

During the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, warning signs were an
important part of how local communities and various forms of government
communicated important messages to their constituents to help them stay safe.
The COVID-19 outbreak (hereafter referred to just as COVID) posed significant
challenges in technical communication messaging because nobody was sure how
COVID spread between people, and many people infected with COVID carried no
outward symptoms of having the disease. It was also unclear how deadly the
disease was or what factors made people more susceptible to severe outcomes
such as death or prolonged hospitalization. Therefore, it wasn't clear what type
of legal wording, such as "Danger" or "Warning," if any, should be included on
signs. In other words, developing an effective warning sign for COVID wasn't as
easy as requiring a high-voltage substation to use the word "Danger" on its
warning sign. As a result, it seemed almost every group, business, locale, and
country came up with their own messaging to warn others about COVID and
social distancing.

Before examining some sample COVID warning signs, it is helpful to take a quick
detour and look at what might be considered COVID's closest predecessor in
modern memory, the influenza outbreak of 1918. While the influenza outbreak
was also quite mysterious at first, people soon understood how it spread.
However, in looking at warning signs from that era, it's important to see how

                                                                                                                                           65
technical communication responded to the attitudes, abilities, and attentions of
its audience, as well as legal requirements, even back then. The signs hung in
1918 pre-date the legal definitions of danger, warning, and caution as set by
entities such as OSHA and ANSI. Additionally, society at the time was largely
dominated by print discourse (a time period well before the widespread visual
influence of television, film, the Internet, and social media). Given how these
conditions differ markedly from our current time period, you'll notice how wordy
the sign from 1918 is compared to what a modern audience in 2020 might
expect of a warning sign. Both pandemics were similar in that they killed tens of
millions of people around the world, but each sign differs because it is designed
to best meet the expectations of audience members walking past it in a certain
year.

                                                                                                                                           66
                                Figure 4: 1918 Influenza Warning Sign

                         the National Library of Medicine Digital Collections (Public Domain)

                                                                                                                                    67
(Note: The transcript of the 1918 Influenza poster is included in the chapter
appendix.) For the 1918 influenza sign above, much of the wording centers on
influencing the behavior of the audience. Seven distinct commands are given,
such as what to avoid and what to do if infected. Also, note the lack of images
and color for such an important sign. Nonetheless, like all good technical
communication consisting mostly of words, the sign still makes important/
sufficient use of some elements of Robin Williams's C.R.A.P. principles discussed
in Chapter 2. The sign employs good use of contrast both in the size and bolding
of the main heading and the all-caps used to emphasize actions the audience
should take. The double line that separates the heading information from the
body text is an example of enhancing proximity, which helps to underscore for
the audience how influenza is spread. It uses different alignments in a way we
probably wouldn't use today, calling unnecessary attention to the words
"kerchief," "towels," and "pneumonia" that follow the left-alignment of the
heading. In terms of repetition, the same font and color help to provide a sense
of uniformity.

As we move into the COVID warning sign examples in this section, note the
differences in overall execution. Today, there is a reliance on color and visuals to
create messages. As you look at the sample warning signs, think about putting
yourself in the shoes of the average person encountering these signs during the
initial, highly uncertain times when the pandemic began in spring 2020. At that
time, nobody was sure about the details of the disease. The average audience
member probably had some nervousness relating to the entire situation and may
have been looking for the signs to help restore a sense of normalcy, or at least
project an air of competence, calmness, and credibility.

As you encounter the sample signs below, pay attention to what grabs your eye
first, where your gaze falls on the sign, whether the message is clear
immediately, and what ethos the sign aims to impart to the viewer. Let's start
with one of the most general but most ubiquitous signs, one that informs users
about social distancing:

                                                                                                                                           68
COVID Sample Warning Sign 1: Street Sign

                                                Figure 5: Covid Street Sign

   Example of warning sign for COVID hanging on a street pole. "Red and White Stop Sign" by Phil Hearing
                                                                       from Unsplash.

Although the message is carried primarily by words, note how few words are
used compared to the influenza warning sign of 1918. In terms of some of the
hallmarks of effective warning sign design, this COVID example has a strong
placement--high up on a pole to engage pedestrians--and high contrast to be

                                                                                                                                           69
seen easily. But does it meet all the hallmarks of the best qualities of warning
signs?
In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign does meet those
principles quite well. As mentioned previously, the contrast is strong and helpful
for viewers. The alignment is centered, which ends up drawing your eye down to
the arrow meant to symbolize the larger-than-normal distance people should
stay away from each other in congested spaces. In terms of proximity, the sign
makes good use of the horizontal line to separate the heading and message,
much like the influenza warning sign. In terms of repetition (uniformity), the all
caps of the title is offset by the regular capitalization of the body, and the two
human figures are in the same style and balance each other out, allowing the
viewer to focus on the distance between them.
In terms of clarity, the lack of specific detail about how far to keep apart from
one another could be seen as a problem, especially in the early days of the
pandemic. While the sign has clear wording and a clear message to separate, it
isn't crystal clear how far apart the actual optimum distance is, and if the goal of
the sign is to stop the spread of COVID, that lack of clarity could be seen as a
significant shortcoming for those hoping the sign will achieve its purpose: To help
stop the disease from spreading.

Does the above street sign embody clarity, one of the most important aspects of
effective pieces of visual technical communication? (Note: Try to focus on how
clear it would have been to a pedestrian in the early stages of the pandemic.)

The message in COVID Warning Sign Sample 2 is carried only by words (and one
number), which is very similar to the influenza warning sign of 1918 from above.
In terms of some of the hallmarks of effective warning sign design, this COVID
example has a strong placement--mounted on a stake so hikers and bikers in the
park could see it easily--and a high contrast of white letters on green to enable it
to be seen easily. However, does it meet all the hallmarks of the best qualities of
warning signs?

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principals from Williams, the sign meets most of the
principles. As mentioned previously, the contrast of green and white is strong and
helpful for viewers. The alignment is centered, similar to Sample 1, but in this
case, the centered text makes it a little harder to read due to some of the other
design choices in the sign. For example, proximity is employed mainly by using
font size to keep like items together, but no part of the message stands out since
each sentence is given equal weight (and "Be Smart" is at the top and probably
gets seen first by most people). Repetition (uniformity) is employed in the
consistent font and color, but also by not punctuating the sentences, which
causes the text to run together a bit, thereby affecting clarity and the ability for
some of its audience to grasp it instantaneously. In addition, while it may be
inferred that all people know what six feet is, certainly some members of the
audience wouldn't have a great understanding of six feet without a metric
equivalent or even some visual element to help estimate what six feet looks like
on a horizontal plane between people. In some ways, the sign seems to rely on a
rhyme to help make it stick, but a warning sign would be better off relying on a
strong visual to help make it stick.

COVID Warning Sign Sample 2 Discussion Question

Does the above sign get its message across clearly and quickly enough? (Note:
Try to focus on how clear it would have been to park users in the early stages of
the pandemic.)

COVID Sample Warning Sign 3: Colorado Department of Public
Health & Environment

Many communities and locales tried to use images to appeal to a more
geographically concentrated user audience in the early stages of the pandemic.
The conceptual approach behind such warning signs appeared to center on
making the generic "six feet" of social distancing come alive with a hyperfocused
example their targeted users might be able to understand better. Many signs also
began to use more information to guide the end users, similar to the 1918

                                                                                                                                           72
influenza sign discussed above. More information is provided on such signs,
which helps to educate more people, even if it risks confusing viewers about the
main message of the warning sign. Here's an early example announced on social
media by the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment:

               Figure 7: COVID Warning from the Colorado Department of Public
                                                                 Health

                         A COVID warning Tweet from the Colorado Department of Public Health and
                                                                         Environment.

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign meets most of the
principles. The contrast of black and white for the text is strong and helpful for
viewers, and the colors of blue and red help to draw viewers into the visual
symbol for six feet. The alignment is more complex and cluttered given the
different regions of the sign, so this aspect is definitely not as clear in this
principle as some of the previous samples that only had one alignment in use.
Proximity is also strong because the light gray lines help to delineate the
different sections of text, as does the white space of the design. Repetition
(uniformity) is strong and also responsible for clarity: "6 feet" and "6'" are

                                                                                                                                           73
repeated a total of four times in the text. The color of the images helps to
provide uniformity as well. While this sign has more text and would take more
time for end users to go through and understand than the previous examples,
the repetition of six feet in four different places helps to make sure the main idea
is not missed and can be seen almost instantly no matter where the viewer starts
reading.
In terms of clarity, the attempt to have the audience comprehend six feet by
picturing a ski is different from previous examples and tries to increase
understanding by providing a different pathway to help visualize six feet of space
between people. While not all of Colorado's ~6 million people ski, the image still
gives some shape to six feet of space, even if the skis pictured are cross-country
skis, which has even fewer practitioners than downhill skiing. Overall, it would be
a fair criticism that a majority of Coloradoans would not be intimately familiar
with the visual symbol the sign is relying on to make meaning. Nonetheless,
using the image of skis and repeating "six feet" multiple times can still be seen
as more helpful than just using text (as in the New York Park example) or using
an arrow and the text "stay apart" (as in the Street Sign example).
Although COVID Warning Sign Sample 3 might be considered an outlier because
it first appeared on social media (even though it could have been downloaded
and printed out, as some people and organizations did), it still represents a
template of sorts that other states, cities, towns, municipalities, and
organizations were able to access and spread. For example, here is the University
of New Orleans using the same template as Sample 3:

COVID Warning Sign Sample 3 Discussion Questions

Do you think the warning sign produced by the Colorado Department of Public
Health & Environment is more or less effective than the previous two examples?
Also, do you think the use of skis as a marker of six feet is a choice that
translates to increased clarity for its ostensible audience of ~6 million
Coloradoans? (Note: Try to focus on how clear it would have been to park users
in the early stages of the pandemic.)
Is the University of New Orleans COVID warning sign a better use of the
template than the one from the Colorado Department of Public Health &
Information? Would its targeted audience of university students have a better
understanding of the visual symbol for six feet, a sideways Mardi Gras ladder,
than the average Coloradan would have from the image of cross-country skis?

                                                                                                                                           75
COVID Sample Warning Sign 4: Las Vegas Airport

                      Figure 9: COVID Warning Sign from the Las Vegas Airport

              A COVID warning sign from the Las Vegas Airport telling viewers "Don't roll the dice. Stay
                6 feet apart" and using six dice to represent the space between two people (July 2020).

                                                              Photo courtesy of Moe Folk.

COVID Warning Sign Sample 4 is another example of a warning sign meant for a
local audience, although this sign's placement in Las Vegas International Airport
meant that it was still used by a large amount of people who did not live locally.
Las Vegas, even during the pandemic, welcomed a lot of foreign visitors, so the
wording of gambling phrases with double meanings (e.g., all in, roll the dice),

                                                                                                                                           76
plus the lack of size context for visitors, could be barriers to understanding. After
all, even the wording and distance of six feet may only be intimately familiar to
citizens of the countries who use the United States customary system of
measurement--the U.S., Liberia, and Myanmar. Including the metric equivalent of
six feet on the Las Vegas sign (or in any of the other samples) could help
broaden understanding. When considering that this sign is in an airport and that
Las Vegas attracts visitors from all over the world, including "2m" with "6 ft"
would help get the message across to many more people. Although the use of
"Don't roll the dice" in the main heading can be seen as embodying the ethos of
Las Vegas as a fun, carefree city, it could be difficult to access for much of its
target audience coming through the airport because metaphors are very difficult
to translate across cultures. Just as not every Coloradan skis despite living in a
state with so many mountains, not every person coming to Las Vegas is a
hardcore gambler who knows every gambling figure of speech. The next line,
"Stay 6 ft. apart!" is more clear and more directive, which is helpful for general
audiences, and also helps to take some of the reliance off what might be
considered hard to follow both above it (the gambling metaphor) and below it:
the representation of six feet of space with six dice. In recalling Sample 3 from
Colorado, that sign included "six feet" four times, while the Las Vegas sample
does not offer as much repetition, which makes the audience rely on the visual
information of six dice even more.

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign meets many of the
principles quite well. The red and white provide contrast, and the red even
invokes the increased attention associated with "Danger" in warning signs. Just
like the street sign example in sample 1, the alignment is centered, which ends
up taking your eye down to the visual meant to symbolize the distance people
should keep between each other in congested spaces, which the streets and
casinos of Las Vegas definitely provide. In terms of proximity, the sign makes
good use of the top third to keep the heading together, and the bottom of the
sign keeps the promotional area and the hashtags together. In terms of
repetition (uniformity), the colors of the design help to keep the information clear
and help the viewer's eyes move around the sign to find pertinent information,
even if the main alignment takes readers down to focus on the dice.

In terms of clarity, the gap between the visual symbols used to signify six feet
and six actual feet is large, larger than the previous samples and perhaps only
slightly less nebulous than the first sample that did not provide any
measurement image beyond an arrow. While the sign has some clear wording to
help people separate, it still isn't clear what the optimum space should be. This is

                                                                                                                                           77
a problem because if the goal of the sign is to stop the spread of COVID to keep
people safe and keep the tourism industry of Las Vegas functioning, then
visualizing six feet for an audience of people from all over the globe is extremely
important.

COVID Warning Sign Sample 4 Discussion Questions

For a COVID warning sign, does it matter how real or representational the image
or symbol used to depict six feet is? Six dice together, for example, aren't even
one foot, let alone six. How else might you represent six feet of space for a sign
in the Las Vegas airport?

COVID Sample Warning Sign 5: Harrisburg Airport

                                                       Harrisburg Airport

                                          A COVID warning sign in the Harrisburg Airport telling
                                       viewers to stay 6 feet away, or 72 Kisses chocolate, from
                                      other passengers (June 2020). Photo courtesy of Moe Folk.

This example also comes from an airport--Harrisburg Airport in Pennsylvania. In
that way, it aims to engage a similar audience as the sample from Las Vegas
International Airport, although the Harrisburg airport is much smaller and does
not process thousands of global travelers every day. Sample Warning Sign 5 is

                                                                                                                                           78
very hyperlocal--the main attraction the sign refers to, Hersheypark, is not
named (though its local audience would recognize the connection immediately),
and the visual measuring mechanism, Hershey's Kisses, is tied to that main
attraction as well. This sign, much like the social media examples from Colorado
and the University of New Orleans in Sample 3, uses a different way of engaging
the audience: Rather than being elevated like the street sign to engage
pedestrians in Sample 1 or at eye level to engage airline passengers as in
Sample 4, the Harrisburg Airport sample was pasted on the ground.

The sign centers on products from the Hershey Company, and many people
traveling through the airport may be in the area to visit the company's
headquarters and its assorted attractions, including the Hersheypark Amusement
Park. While the sign would be understandable to most local people passing
through Harrisburg Airport who are familiar with Hersheypark and the namesake
Hershey's Kisses , it makes a rather large assumption that the majority of its
audience will easily understand the design and visual measurement reference.
Hersheypark may be known rather well regionally, but the park does not have
the international recognition of a similar park such as Disney World. However, the
chocolate the Hershey Corporation is known for producing has a much longer
history and wider cultural spread, and the small Hershey's Kisses the sign uses
as a measuring stick may benefit from that long exposure. However, it's doubtful
that even if 72 Hershey's Kisses does equal six feet exactly, most audience
members wouldn't have much of a conception of what 72 Hershey's Kisses looks
like end to end (although I would imagine this sign inspired some inquisitive
airline passengers to perform their own calculations once they returned home).

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign meets some of the
principles quite well. The silver and brown provide contrast, and the white and
yellow are used to help highlight important parts (not to mention how the colors
help to market Hershey bars and other Hershey products by mimicking their
design): Note how yellow is used to help draw focus to "72 KISSES
CHOCOLATES" (and a trademark notice, too). Just like many of the other
samples, the alignment is centered, which ends up taking your eye down to the
center of the warning sign to the kisses, framed with extra white and yellow that
stand out among the brown and silver. The bottom includes a slogan from the
airport at the time, "ALTOGETHER AGAIN." White space--perhaps more aptly
called brown space here--is used well and the color helps the audience to recall
Hershey's chocolate. In terms of proximity, the sign makes good use of color and

repetition (uniformity), all words are in caps, which can be hard for readers if too
many words are vying for a reader's attention, but the size of the words and
phrases are differentiated enough so that it doesn't muddy the message. All in
all, the warning sign is balanced and designed well, but the main unit of
information--how to visualize six feet of separation--could be replaced by
something much clearer.

Which example helps a general audience approximate a distance of six feet
better--six dice or 72 Hershey's kisses? Why? How else could the Harrisburg
Airport visualize six feet instead of using a product from the Hershey Company or
their nearby amusement park (Hersheypark) instead?

The above warning sign is from Mount Rainier National Park. Note how much text
is used, and how the important information is separated by other, less important
information about where to get a trail map. In terms of context, it might stand to
reason that a huge national park full of open spaces may not be as concerned
with communicating the social distancing message. Additionally, perhaps people
constantly approaching tour guides and employees for maps constituted an issue
where COVID could easily spread. However, even national parks experience
logjams at indoor places, outdoor vistas, and restrooms, so the sign still has the
same urgency to get its warning message across to a large audience of people,
many of whom travel from other countries to visit the parks.

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign meets some principles
well but could use more revision to meet all the principles well. The black text on
a white background provides contrast, but the size of the heading text is not
markedly larger than the body text, which does not provide enough contrast and
therefore makes the sign harder to read because the headings and body text
melt together, especially at a distance. The alignment on this sign is also
jumbled, especially when compared to previous samples that featured one main
alignment. The Mount Rainier warning sign includes a left alignment for the main
text; then the visual measurement is centered at the bottom of the sign; then
the badge on the upper right creates a right alignment that feels broken because
of the jagged right alignment of the paragraphs due to line breaks caused by
large words in the text. Proximity could be improved by keeping the social
distancing information together, and fixing the heading/text ratio could help
proximity by letting the reader see more quickly what information belongs
together. In terms of repetition (uniformity), one heading is on a single line while
another is on two lines, which adds to the sign's jumbled appearance. Uniformity
is also off because two sections start with questions, while the first one does not.
All in all, of the samples we've seen so far, this sign could benefit the most from
applying the C.R.A.P. principles to revise the design.

In terms of clarity, a black bear and its cub are used to visualize six feet. For
one, most people probably have not seen such a combination in real life before,
and this visualization is different because most people are well aware that if you
do see an adult bear and its cub, you should stay away and not examine them
closely. This might be the equivalent of using a great white shark or a bunch of
jellyfish to denote six feet of space on a beach sign about social distancing. While
the park may see nature lovers as its main audience, that main audience would
also know that a mother bear and cub are a dangerous sight to be avoided, so it

                                                                                                                                           82

at the time should not have been doing.

The above example is from the Portland (Oregon) Japanese Garden. In similar
fashion to the New York parks sign and the influenza sign, it relies solely on text;
however, in this case, the placement of the text provides a visual for the warning
sign to get its message across subtly. The white space between (and
surrounding) the two text blocks serves as the measurement visualization to help
show the space people should observe between each other to slow the spread of
COVID.

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign meets some principles
while purposefully violating others to make its meaning clear. The dark gray and
red text on white background provide clear contrast between the paragraphs,
contrast that is further aided by the space between them. The sign uses two
different left alignments, which some might consider cleaner if the sign shifted to
one, but the staggered left alignments further implies the meaning of staying
apart from one another (and the logo at the bottom ties them together literally
and figuratively in the sense they are sharing that actual space). Proximity is
violated in some ways, but it is violated creatively to help make the meaning of
the sign clear. In terms of repetition (uniformity), this warning sign relies on the
uniformity of the white space. The paragraphs exhibit more contrast than
uniformity--the font, font size, and color is different for each. Yet, if the white
space were collapsed, the sign would exhibit a chaotic ethos instead of a peaceful
one. Compare the calm ethos of the Japanese Garden sign to the ethos of the
Mount Rainier sign. Of the samples we've seen so far, this sign violates many of
the C.R.A.P. principles, but it features a strong concept that focuses on getting its
meaning across in a novel, artful way. While the sign does choose to forego a
clear visualization for six feet, it doesn't muddy the six-feet message by using an
overly specific example as some of the other sample warning signs did. This sign
may not be the most immediately understood of the sample warning signs in this
chapter, but it still possesses some of the major hallmarks of visual technical
communication, including clarity, concision, and efficiency.

The final COVID warning sign sample comes from the small city of Hood River,
Oregon. The sign was placed around communal outdoor spots in the town, such
as parks and docks. Many of the parks offered areas for people to sit and cook
food on grills. Note how this sign builds upon the plain signs from our earlier
examples, especially the samples from other outdoor spaces, such as the New
York parks example. This sign adds information the others didn't, and it presents
it using approaches nobody else used, as well. For example, the sign uses
Spanish to mirror all pertinent information presented in English (the exceptions
being the town and business logos). Including Spanish undoubtedly broadens its
potential to connect with a wider audience.
This sign was placed in parks, and it uses an image of something from the parks
to visualize the distance, an approach similar to that of Las Vegas airport (dice),
Harrisburg Airport (Hershey's Kisses), and Mount Rainier National Park (a bear
and cub). However, the Hood River sign chooses something that is not only found
in their parks, but something familiar enough that most people would know
anyway. Adding people around the item helps to give it scale, and the body
language of the people is noteworthy: They are relaxed and seemingly talking

                                                                                                                                           86
with each other, providing the sense of normalcy mentioned as a goal of early
COVID warning signs.

In terms of the C.R.A.P. principles from Williams, the sign meets most principles
well. Contrast is solid throughout. It does use a multitude of alignments, so
streamlining those could help the overall balance of the sign and allow readers to
focus more on the visualization. For example, right-aligning the paragraphs
would frame the image more. Proximity is strong overall, but the lines between
paragraphs indicate a difference in idea instead of a translation of the same
material. In terms of repetition (uniformity), this warning sign relies on color to
help its message get across: The color of the main paragraph of information
aligns with the arrows denoting six feet between people, and the main title in
white, "A Little Space," also corresponds with the white space between the
people, just like the Japanese Garden one. Of the samples we've seen so far, this
sign contains the most information and may feel a little cluttered at first, but it
uses design and conception to help it cast a wide net and provide important
information to its audience. While it may not be immediately clear due to its
wording (e.g., the omitted article "a" in "length of park table") and the multiple
logos, it nonetheless provides the information and design punch it needs to help
its audience withstand COVID.

3.5: Warning Sign Assignment

To develop your own warning sign, think of a situation on your campus,
hometown, or workplace that could be helped by making a warning sign. Be sure
to spend time thinking about your sign before making it. The more time spent on
the planning stages of the sign, the better the final product will be. Pay close
attention to the language choices, and make sure they correspond to the right
level of danger as discussed in the chapter. Finally, make sure your images can
help your audience visualize the right message so they can alter their behavior
accordingly.

Warning Sign Assignment

Overview
For this assignment, we will again practice some core elements of technical
communication--information architecture, clarity, and visual rhetoric--that will be
needed in future projects. It is worth 100 points of your overall grade.
Details
Create a warning sign for something that needs to be addressed at KU (if you
can't find anything at KU, you could also develop something for your hometown
or workplace). The sign should rely on visual elements to convey its meaning:
Ideally, you wouldn't need many (if any) words beyond legal terms such as
danger, warning, or caution in order to make your message clear to viewers.
Grading
My evaluation will consider how your message connects with your chosen
audience to achieve purpose. It will also focus on how the visuals convey
meaning to the audience. Your designs should adhere to the C.R.A.P. principles
discussed in class and no typos should be present. See the Warning Sign
Assignment Rubric for more detailed information.

Chapter 4 | Persuading: Recommendation
Report Assignment

While the majority of technical writing may exist to inform, there are also many
forms of technical writing that exist to persuade. When thinking about writing to
persuade, students will invariably think of the essay writing they have done,
most of which relies on using the author's thoughts and drawing on outside
sources to persuade readers about a topic or viewpoint. In technical writing,
persuasion centers less on the author's unique insights and more on how the
writer summarizes, describes, suggests, and connects technical information to a
given topic. Readers are often left to draw their own conclusions, and persuasion
occurs because they see the efficacy of the technologies being described. This
chapter focuses on how writers can develop persuasive skills through technical
writing by marshaling tone, summary, and thoroughness to help an
organization such as a business to address an issue. This chapter focuses on a
particular type of genre of persuasion--the recommendation report.

4.1: What Is a Recommendation Report, and Why Is
It Important for Technical Writers To Master?

A recommendation report is a type of formal technical writing that examines a
problem and provides evidence-based advice to guide decision-making.
Recommendation reports are used by businesses and organizations to inform and
guide stakeholders about the best course of action for moving forward when
faced with an important decision. The reports are also used in many other
professional contexts such as determining government policy and engineering
contexts.

Key Elements of a Recommendation Report

      · An objective analysis of a problem, situation, or issue

      · A comparison of possible solutions or options

      · A list of criteria to assess alternatives

      · A clear recommendation backed by data and logic

      · A professional structure that can meet the needs of various audience
         members based on their knowledge of--and proximity to--the problem
         being addressed

                                                                                                                                           90
Recommendation reports can be difficult to write because the author must
understand the past (how something became a problem that needs to be
addressed), the present (how current contexts such as financial realities affect
the problem) and the future (how well and for how long the proposed solution
will meet the needs of the business or organization moving forward). As such,
recommendation reports require technical writers who are motivated to solve the
issue, diligent in researching the problem, and adept at weighing the pros and
cons needed for decision-making. Authors also need to separate their own
feelings and emotions about the problem to focus on writing a technical report
that can persuade people through logos (facts, data, statistics) instead of pathos.

Why Being Able To Write Recommendation Reports Is a Valuable
Skill for Technical Writers

      · High Demand: Businesses and organizations are constantly facing
         important decisions about what they should do, and even what
         technologies they should adopt and streamline.

      · Cross-Functional Experience: Writers often need to collaborate with
         engineers, product managers, administrators, and executives to find
         information and then work through proposed solutions, thereby building
         effective communication skills across different teams and disciplines.

      · Career Growth: Successful recommendation reports, especially when the
         proposed solutions turn out to be extremely beneficial to the greater good
         of a business or organization, can have a huge impact on a worker's
         trajectory within a company or organization.

      · Analytical and Organizational Skills: Recommendation reports improve
         an author's ability to synthesize a lot of complex information and present it
         logically, rationally, and persuasively.

      · Communication Clarity: Recommendation reports develop skills in
         writing concisely and clearly for diverse audiences, including non-technical
         stakeholders who will be involved in decision-making and implementation
         moving forward.

4.2: Recommendation Report Assignment

Unlike previous chapters, I'll provide the assignment sheet up front because
writing a successful report depends on understanding all the pieces such a report
entails.

Assignment: Recommendation Report

Overview

For this sequence, you will continue honing technical communication skills such
as summary, visualizing information, and audience analysis. In addition, this
project will develop your research skills and your ability to use technical writing
for problem-solving and persuasion. You will begin with a proposal and problem
statement and then produce a recommendation report. You can work alone or in
groups for this project, depending on the complexity of the problem being
addressed. If you are stuck for ideas, just talk to me and I'll help you brainstorm.

Details

1. Recommendation Report

A longer document (~10 to 15 single-spaced pages, including images) that
attempts to "solve" a problem facing the university or the local community by
relying on technical communication and argumentation. The goal is to deliver
your final report to people who could actually act upon it and implement your
recommended solution(s). In addition to reasoning that hinges on solid research
and technological/logical arguments, each report must use at least three outside
sources (and can use primary research, as well). Reports will contain the
following sections: executive summary, problem statement, background,
evaluation criteria, option analysis, conclusions, final recommendation(s), and
references page. A budget and some visual aspects to the argument (e.g., charts
or graphs, in addition to the overall design of the report) should also be included.
Citations should follow APA format.

2. Rhetorical Reflection

An analysis/reflection of the choices made in your recommendation report.

4.3: Overview of Recommendation Report Sections

Recommendation reports use a variety of sections to convey their points to an
audience. The overview of sections below is not meant to be followed
dogmatically. Writers should add, remove, combine, and re-order sections as
necessary depending on what they think is best rhetorically for their targeted
organizations and audiences. However, I am providing a framework that helps
students manage the many pieces that go into a recommendation report, and I
have found that these sections can accommodate a wide variety of topics within
the recommendation report genre. In addition, I stipulate in my assignment that
you must identify at least three feasible solutions in the options section, and you
must incorporate three outside sources, including at least one academic source.
Although outside sources may not be strictly necessary in all recommendation
reports, I have found that requiring outside sources helps students go deeper in
their work and give their reports a better chance of being persuasive.

One aspect of recommendation reports that students will note is quite different
from their non-technical writing experiences (e.g., essay writing) is that these
reports have repetition purposely built into them. I'm sure many students have
had writing instructors scrawl "Repetition!" in red ink on their essays at some
point, but repetition plays an important rhetorical function within
recommendation reports. For example, the actual recommendation may be
repeated in multiple areas of the report. Such repetition may not be necessary if,
say, the report is meant for only one person (e.g., a hands-on boss of a very tiny
company), but for larger organizations, the number of people who may be tasked
with reading and discussing the recommendation report could stretch into the
hundreds or even thousands. Some people may be relatively tangential to the
process and invited late, so they may only have time to read the executive
summary before a meeting. In other cases, some reports become long, and
some of the most important information, such as the final recommendation, can
get obscured by other sections; therefore, the final recommendation will need to
pop up in various sections for clarity. Just as with any other piece of technical

                                                                                                                                           93
writing, the writer can't assume that everyone reading a recommendation report
brings the same interest, technical knowledge, passion, and goodwill to reviewing
it, so it needs to be able to connect with a wide audience. Also, the
recommendation report can serve as a de facto record: If, for example, a
business were looking at the best way to fix a crumbling entryway and that
entryway collapsed and resulted in injured customers, a recommendation report
that was commissioned to fix it but never adopted could play a role in any legal
struggle that may play out over the injuries.

4.4: Starting the Report

Although the cover page and abstract are the first parts the audience will see
when reading the report, those sections are best to create when close to finishing

the assignment. For example, the executive summary is a brief encapsulation of

the entire report, and it includes the final recommendation, so writers won't be
able to do the executive summary unless they have done the research necessary
to know possible options and select one that is the final recommendation. While
some people may find it helpful to try and sketch out an executive summary first
to provide shape to the report, others may find that doing so restricts their
openness to approaching the topic and it may steer them toward a pre-destined

                                                                                                                                           96
final recommendation before doing research. Most students will find it more
helpful to begin the heart of the report by identifying the topic and articulating
the problem first. This approach helps students understand the problem
thoroughly and identify the audience who can help implement solutions. With
that advice in mind, we start writing the recommendation report by writing the
problem statement.

4.5: Writing the Problem Statement

This section may be the most important part of the recommendation report. The
problem statement identifies the issue that needs to be addressed, with what
urgency it needs to be addressed, and it answers the question: What is the
problem, and why does it need to be solved? In short, time and attention are at
a premium for each person and each organization. This section needs to quickly
define what the problem is and persuade the readers it is worth their time and
attention to address the problem because doing so will have a great impact on
their business/organization. The problem statement is the first major section the
audience might read, and it sets the stakes and establishes the author's ethos
right away. In many ways, the problem statement functions like the introduction
in a piece of personal writing such as an essay: it engages the audience, sets the
topic, and encourages the audience to read further. In the case of a
recommendation report, though, the readers need to focus on something
negative, so the author needs to rely on the important, positive benefits of
addressing the problem for the organization.

The problem statement includes the final recommendation as a way of
foreshadowing the rest of the report. However, anyone who only reads the
problem statement won't be persuaded to adopt the recommendation and may
stop reading the rest of the report to go and work on implementing the proposed
recommendation. This section does not contain enough technical information or
insight to explain why the final recommendation is the best way forward; instead,
it lays the seeds for what comes next. Readers can then pay closer attention to
how the final recommendation emerges more completely throughout the report.
Including the final recommendation in the problem statement (as well as other
places in the report) is a way of making sure the reader can't miss--or isn't
surprised by--only one mention late in the report. Including only one mention of
the recommendation at the conclusion of the report would mean readers would
have to go back and try to connect the recommendation back to large amounts
of information that has already been presented, which would lessen the reports'
chances of persuading the audience.

                                                                                                                                           97
Overview of Problem Statement

      · Introduces the overall topic identifies the problem at the heart of the
         report

      · Answers the question, "What exactly is the problem, and why does it need
         to be solved?"

      · Explains methods, scope, and adds recommendation(s) upfront

In terms of format, when this chapter discusses approximate lengths for each
section, it assumes the form of single-spaced paragraphs with no indents but
with spaces between each paragraph. A problem statement should be less than a
single-spaced page (unless the problem is so complex that it requires more space
to cover), but the author needs to be as succinct as possible in addressing the
problem. The reports can be relatively short when addressing something physical
such as computer hardware (e.g., "Which computer monitor should we purchase
to replace our current monitors?"), but this chapter focuses on crafting
recommendation reports tied to more open-ended problems that may take a lot
of work to resolve.

Problem statements are important in establishing ethos because the tone and
approach the author will take are on full display. A measured, professional tone is
a necessary component of recommendation reports. Depending on a student's
connection to the chosen topic, it can be hard to approach the subject rationally
and objectively. Oftentimes, students will address a topic that is tied to them in
some way, so it is difficult to stay objective. Nonetheless, providing too much
pathos is a hallmark of rough drafts, as is tarring an organization's leadership,
and these approaches must be avoided at all costs in the final drafts because
they have little chance at succeeding in persuading the audience.

The following example centers on a topic that many students select, and it
exemplifies the approaches of blaming the organization involved and using an
unprofessional tone.

Problem Statement Rough Draft: Improving Student Parking

The parking situation at our university is, in a word, ridiculous. It is a travesty
that many students need to park way out in in the middle of nowhere in an
unpaved lot where cars routinely get damaged and is unsafe in many other ways.
Worse yet, by the time we finally trudge to class from way out there, we see
acres and acres of empty faculty parking lot spaces. We pay way too much

                                                                                                                                           98
money to attend this university and to buy parking permits, so this situation
needs to be remedied. We need to build two brand new parking garages, now.

While the rough draft of a problem statement above might be exactly what the
author wants to say regarding parking, it certainly does not use a tone that has
any chance of establishing a professional ethos that can end up persuading its
audience. For one, the tone creates a "student vs. faculty and administration"
dynamic when it would be more effective to show how parking problems relate to
elements of student life that the administration cares about, such as issues with
student safety and parking issues that cause students to be continually late to
class, which can translate into missing exams and ultimately impact student
retention.

To help authors avoid falling into the pit of pathos and blaming people higher up
in the organization, it can be helpful to start writing the problem statement with
established building blocks. A traditional structure for problem statements
includes the following elements to help provide scaffolding for writers as they
flesh out the problem:

1. Vision (the ultimate goal that, if achieved, would solve the issue)

2. Specific Issue Statement (overall problem definition and context/facts that
    identify problems)

3. Relevance (why is it important to solve the issue?)

4. Proposed Method and Recommendation (how you will go about
    determining how to fix the problem, what options you will investigate, and
    what your final recommendation is)

Problem Statement Example: Improving Student Parking (Revised)

Vision: All students at Kutztown University should have access to affordable,
safe, and convenient parking.

Specific Issue Statement: Right now, student parking choices are lacking
because more than half of the student population does not have access to paved
lots, and these unpaved lots are far away from classroom buildings and fill up
regularly. Because the lots are far away and there is no way for students to check
whether a lot is full before arriving, many students are routinely late to class.
Additionally, the unpaved lots do not have security guards, and many students'
cars have been damaged by people speeding and driving recklessly in the lots.
The lots also do not have adequate lighting, and there have been several

                                                                                                                                           99
robberies in the lots, which has resulted in many students avoiding required
classes that end in darkness. This issue has caused some students to take longer
to graduate, which in turn increases their student debt.

Relevance: Because so many students are late for class, this has resulted in
some students missing important quizzes and tests that have impacted their
ability to pass classes. Some students (as evidenced in a survey conducted for
this report and presented in its entirety in the background section) have
transferred, or know others who have transferred, because of the parking
situation.

Proposed Method and Recommendation: In this report, I examine ways to
improve the parking situation at the university. I surveyed 200 students about
their parking experiences and interviewed the head of public safety to ascertain
the number of permits issued relative to the number of spaces available. I
investigated multiple options to address the issue, including altering the rules for
those who live on campus to use parking lots by academic buildings, paving the
current dirt lots, adding security, and adding a new parking garage. Ultimately, I
recommend paving the current dirt lots and adding security due to affordability
issues.

Here's another example to see how the traditional structure can help to give
structure to the problem statement.

Problem Statement Example: University Dining Halls

Vision: All students at Kutztown University should have access to healthy,
affordable, and convenient food choices.

Specific Issue Statement: Right now, student food choices are lacking because
most do not have access to enough healthy options, the cost and payment
systems are too limited and confusing, and many food places are inaccessible
during peak lunch times between classes.

Relevance: Studies show that a healthy body impacts the mind, and students
who eat well are more likely to do better in school (Smith, 2015, p.10).
Currently, students often find themselves skipping meals to attend classes or
skipping classes to get food, all of which affects the ability of students to achieve
the best education they can, and which sometimes even results in students
failing classes.

                                                                                                                                         100
Proposed Method and Recommendation: In this report, I examine ways to
improve the food situation at Kutztown. I surveyed 200 students about their
dining preferences, interviewed the head of dining services, and conducted
research into the importance of the mind-body connection on student outcomes.
I investigated multiple options to address the issue, including altering hours,
altering payment systems, and adding new dining options. Ultimately, I
recommend adopting facets of each, with a focus on altering hours.

As noted before, the problem statement is not the end of persuasion, but the
beginning. Some claims within the problem statement will need more verification
and support to connect with audience members, and the next section, the
background, provides the space to illustrate the problem in greater depth.

4.6: Writing the Background Section

The background section allows the author to expand on the problem and show
the reader more fully what the problem is and why it needs to be addressed. It
also shows the audience how the problem got to this point by examining the
issue's genesis and other approaches that might have already been taken to
mitigate the problem. As such, this will be one of the longer sections of the
report because it may end up looking at years or even decades of past practices.
Moreover, this section can be one of the most time-intensive because it will
require significant research to uncover how the problem was handled by the
organization in the past or even how similar organizations have handled
the problem before. In other words, students may need to conduct primary
research, such as interviews with people who know the history of the problem
within the organization and surveys to gauge the extent of the problem facing
people across the organization. In addition, it is important to find high-quality
published research that helps to corroborate points about why the problem needs
to be addressed urgently.

For the recommendation report assignment shared in this chapter, students often
conduct at least one interview for the historical context of the problem and one
survey to gain insights on how other students are affected by the problem.
Overall, the background provides authors an opportunity to achieve persuasion
by developing logos Setting the stage with facts, data, and statistics to
understand the problem more deeply in this section allows subsequent sections
to build on the logic established in the background and home in on how to fix the
problem. For example, the criteria for success and which options should be
considered are all rooted in the takeaways from this section.

                                                                                                                                         101
Why the Background Section Is Included

It elaborates on the problem by showing its history, and it lays the groundwork
for how the problem should be approached in order to fix it.

Questions To Consider in the Background Section

      · How (and when) did the problem start? When did the organization realize
         there was a problem? (* addressing the past)

      · How did the organization get to the current situation? What attempts have
         been made to address the problem before, and why didn't they work? (*
         addressing the more recent past)

      · What general financial, social, political, legal, and/or ethical implications
         exist that affect the organization's ability to respond to the problem? (*
         addressing the present)

      · How will the current trajectory the organization is on affect its ability to
         address the problem in the future (e.g., funding, demographics,
         enrollment, budgets)? (* addressing the future)

      · What technical hurdles/realities exist that could impact the ability to
         address the problem in the most beneficial way moving forward? (*
         addressing the future)

Other Aspects To Consider

Persuasion is a key aspect of the background section. You have a chance to
reiterate the scope and impact of the problem in a much deeper way, so if people
are not convinced by your problem statement, then the background section gives
you the space to go deeper to convince them.

This section will require a significant amount of work. Not only does it provide a
basis for the rest of the report, but it also establishes your ethos by showing
readers how invested you are in solving the problem. Thus, your commitment to
this section will be evident based on the amount of work readers perceive you
devoted to developing this section.

The success of this section often relies on outside information that you uncover
during the research process. Devise a plan before starting this section, and
identify which people in your organization are the ones with the best institutional
memory or proper administrative oversight to get the right information about it.

                                                                                                                                         102
That also means reaching out to potential interview subjects early, especially if
their knowledge will be difficult, if not impossible, to find elsewhere. A report that
has huge information gaps in the background section does not have a great
chance of success.

If you need help starting this section, begin a rough draft with three headings
and start adding notes and information to each: The History of the Problem;
Current Realities Affecting the Problem; Future Issues That Could Affect the
Problem.

4.7: Writing the Criteria Section

The criteria section (sometimes known as the requirements or evaluative criteria
section) is used to define standards or benchmarks to evaluate possible solutions
for the problem. This section is critical to the success of a recommendation
report because if an author can't develop feasible criteria to successfully address
it, then it may not be possible to recommend a successful solution. Criteria are
used to compare and contrast the options in the next report section, and that
evaluation is essential for making sure the options are evaluated fairly,
consistently, and objectively. Well-written criteria can provide the audience with
easy-to-follow qualities (and sometimes quantities) that allow the audience to
understand how the success of various solutions can be measured.

Before look at how to write criteria, it's important to take a step back and
acknowledge how the different parts of the report connect and why the criteria
section has a special function. At this point, you may think your writing is
disjointed because you have three different sections that don't flow together the
same way paragraphs in a personal essay do. However, it's important to note
that each section of a recommendation report has an important connection to
other sections, and each section fulfills a distinct purpose for the various
audience members. For example, some readers may be well aware of the
problem and have no need to read the background section, while others may not
be aware of the problem and be unconvinced by the general nature of the
problem statement. Therefore, the background section is paramount in
persuading them that the problem exists and needs to be remedied. Similarly,
the criteria section only resonates with readers if the problem statement and
background section are clear, thorough, and specific. It helps to think of the
criteria section as the bridge between explaining the problem and solving the
problem. You will use the criteria in this section as a lens to evaluate the options
presented in the next section, which allows you to select the most feasible option
for the audience. The problems facing organizations can be so complex that a

                                                                                                                                         103
perfect solution rarely exists, so think of the criteria section as setting the
parameters for what constitutes the most suitable option for addressing the
problem at this juncture in time.

Key Elements of Good Criteria

1. Good Criteria Are Clear

      · Each criterion should be written in a way that is understandable to the
         wide variety of audience members who may use the document.

      · Each criterion should try to be as short as possible (just a sentence is
         fine).

      · If it's not clear from other sections where the criterion came from, you
         may need to flesh it out more in this section.

              For example, in a recommendation report that examines how to
                increase computer security for a company, how much the current
                budget is discussed in the background--and how much the primary
                audience may be familiar with the budget--would explain whether the
                author writes the following criterion as "The cost of the security
                software must be less than $10,000" versus "The cost of the security
                software must be less than $10,000, which is the budget amount
                allotted to computer security in fiscal year 2030."

2. Good Criteria Are Relevant

      · Criteria should align with the report's purpose(s) identified in the previous
         sections (problem statement and background).

      · Criteria should align with the audience's (and the organization's) priorities.
         Note that this means they should identify pertinent factors relative to
         achieving a common purpose in an ethical way. They should not be bent to
         appeal to what stakeholders want to hear or used by authors to push their
         favored options and agendas through.

      · Do not write overly broad criteria that can easily be dismissed as
         irrelevant.

3. Good Criteria Are Measurable

      · Criteria must be as specific as possible so they can be measured and
         assessed.

                                                                                                                                         104
      · Criteria should be quantifiable (e.g., cost, savings, time to implement,
         percent of adoption by users).

      · If no quantifiable criteria can be developed, include other important factors
         that can be measured or assessed (e.g., user-friendliness, compatibility,
         customer satisfaction).

4. Good Criteria Are Balanced

      · Avoid having criteria focus on one factor--develop criteria that can address
         a mix of factors instead.

              For example, if a recommendation report on software adoption only
                focuses on economic factors such as software cost and training cost,
                other important factors can be disregarded (e.g., user-friendliness,
                ease of multi-system integration, security, customer service
                reputation).

5. Good Clarity Are Prioritized

      · Put the most important criterion first.

      · Organize the criteria in a way that make sense (e.g., keep cost-related
         criteria together).

      · Separate the criteria by importance level if necessary.

              If you have a lot of criteria, it can be helpful to include levels of
                importance to help guide the audience. For example, the criteria listed
                under "Primary Criteria" can be the essential qualities a successful
                option must meet, while "Secondary Criteria" could denote the "nice
                to have" qualities an option might meet but would not be
                disqualifying.

For many student writers, this will be your first time writing criteria. Overall, the
key is making sure each criterion satisfies the questions below, because doing so
can ensure you have created worthwhile criteria.

Is It Necessary?

What would happen if the requirement were not met? Why is it needed? (If the
answer is unimportant, then it's not needed.)

                                                                                                                                         105
Is It Verifiable?

How will you know when you achieved the requirement? Will you be able to
assess the requirement? (If you can't verify that it has been achieved, then you
won't be able to tell if you're fixing the problem.)

Is It Attainable?

Is the requirement technically and financially feasible given the background and
current context of the organization? If it's not feasible now but might be in the
future, be clear that it is a goal more benefitting the status of a primary
requirement instead.

Tips for Writing the Criteria Section

      · Number each criterion (or at least bullet point them and start with the
         most important aspects first).

      · Include only one requirement for each number/bullet point.

      · Provide at most two sentences per requirement: Paragraphs trying to
         explain criteria invite ambiguity and confusion.

      · Separate requirements by priority when necessary (e.g., if you have more
         than five criteria and they seem similar, it would be best to help the
         readers prioritize their importance).

              Primary criteria are "the must haves" a recommendation must meet,
                while the secondary criteria are "the nice to have" features a
                recommendation might meet.

      · Avoid vague language. Try to make the criteria as specific as possible using
         the following techniques:

              Numerical values. Numbers, especially those that can outline ranges
                such as minimums and maximums, are helpful tools. For example,
                "The new monitors should not cost more than $250 each."

              Yes/No values. A criterion that can be assessed through a simple
                yes or no answer relative to the potential options can be very helpful.
                This is often used to help establish what features potential options
                should have. For example, "The new computers must have HDMI
                ports."

                                                                                                                                         106
              Ratings values. In cases where key factors cannot be expressed with
                clear numerical or yes/no values, ratings can be used to anchor
                qualitative opinions. For example, rather than relying on the author's
                opinion in the criteria and options sections, you could rely on ratings
                from a nationally known ratings group for something like usability or
                security features. If ratings can't be accessed from a reliable group,
                then it may prove useful to generate ratings from actual user tests on
                things like usability, accessibility, and satisfaction.

Students who experience trouble getting started with writing criteria might find it
helpful to follow the traditional format for writing criteria. This traditional format
is easy to follow because it consists of one sentence that is very specific and uses
this formula where writers can fill in the blanks:

    The [thing] shall provide [something] to achieve [this].

As you can tell from the use of "shall" in the sentence, this traditional formula is
a more formal style that can be perceived as rather stiff in tone. Nonetheless, the
format can be helpful for student writers who need help getting started because
they only need to add a few items to create a measurable criterion that also
adheres to the one-sentence length most criteria should have. Once student
writers create criteria using this formula, they can always edit them to be less
rigid and more rhetorically flexible to ensure they produce criteria that will
connect with their intended audience. Here's an example of how a student might
write a criterion on the first pass without the formula versus using the formula:

Unclear without the criteria formula: The new laptops must include sufficient
storage.

More clear with the criteria formula: The new laptops shall provide 1TB of
storage to achieve the goal of having all employees archive all company video
content.

Note that the first example is so general it is neither measurable nor assessable,
while the second example provides a parameter (1 TB) that can be used to
assess possible options, as well as a number of employees (all, or 100%) that
can measured later to indicate whether the chosen option was successful or not.
Following the traditional formula doesn't mean that student writers will
automatically produce perfect criteria, but doing so does provide guardrails to
help students write more specific criteria that could be used successfully in
subsequent sections.

                                                                                                                                         107
Examples of Criteria for Discussion

Read the following criteria sections from recommendation reports and discuss
whether each criterion meets the requirements for successful criteria outlined in
this section. Also, discuss whether the criteria should be broken up into primary
and secondary criteria, whether they are in the best order for readers, and
whether each criterion is accessible or not.

8. The laptop must last at least six hours on a charge.

9. The laptop vendor must have exceptional customer service review.

10. The laptop must be touchscreen.

4.8: Writing the Options Section

The options section relies heavily on the criteria section that immediately
precedes it. The goal of this section is to analyze options through the lens of the
criteria to uncover which option would make the best recommendation to address
the problem moving forward. In the options section, the author identifies possible
solutions to the problem by analyzing a manageable number of options in depth.
In the recommendation report writing assignment for this chapter, I ask students
to identify and analyze three feasible options. Each option should get the same
amount of attention and analytical emphasis from the author, or else the author
risks making it look as if they are biased towards one solution or they didn't put
enough effort into identifying feasible options, both of which negatively affect
ethos.

While the criteria section is likely the shortest section of the recommendation
report, the options section will be one of the largest sections, if not the largest
section depending on how much time the background section needs to cover.
Because there is a lot of information to manage in the options section, it is
important to devise a plan that allows you to present this section in an organized
way and then allows your audience to not only understand it but also to engage
with it. As a result, this section may need some visual elements to help readers
such as charts, graphs, and tables. To decide what kind of visual elements your
options section needs, it may help to picture your audience discussing this
section at a meeting. What references would help them focus on comparing the
positives and negatives of each option included in this section?

Tips for Writing the Options Section

      · To begin, provide a brief rationale about how and why you limited the
         upcoming discussion to these particular options (~a paragraph). In some
         instances, there may be 20 possible options to consider that might meet
         the criteria very well, but that could stretch out to hundreds of pages, so it
         is best to decide on a feasible number of best options that readers can
         digest.

                                                                                                                                         109
       If you can't identify any feasible options, then you will have to revisit
         the criteria and maybe even re-examine the problem statement.

· Decide on a format to present the options to the audience. For example,
   you may choose to use a whole-by-whole or point-by-point approach (see
   the next page for a more detailed description of these approaches).

       In general, a well-designed whole-by-whole approach will be best for
         reports relying on criteria that don't break down into specific points
         easily, while a report with very specific criteria would benefit from the
         point-by-point approach.

· No matter the approach you use, the traditional method presents the
   strongest option first because it is easier for the audience to remember
   that one as more and more information is revealed about the other
   options.

· Provide a general description of each option first for readers who may be
   unfamiliar with it.

· Go in depth about what the option does best relative to the criteria (pros).

· Go in depth about what the option does not do well relative to the criteria
   (cons).

· Costs are almost always a factor, so be sure to include a discussion about
   them (and if you didn't include costs, you will have to explain why costs
   did not merit consideration).

· Be sure to give each option sufficient consideration and similar coverage.

       If, for example, you dedicate two pages to Option 1 and only a small
         paragraph to Options 2 and 3, it can diminish your ethos by making it
         look as if you are biased toward Option 1 or that you didn't do
         adequate research to come up with more than one viable option.

· Provide some sort of visual summary (e.g., table or chart) towards the end
   so there is a stand-alone option comparison for audience members.

       This can help involve audience members more than just reading many
         pages about the optionswho did not read every page about the
         options. It can also facilitate discussion during meetings by providing
         a focal point for the group.

                                                                                                                                 110
· Provide your recommendation as to which option to adopt (or maybe even
   a mixture of options) at the end of this section.
       A recommendation report is not mystery fiction, so there's no need for
         the audience to guess the best option by reading subsequent sections
         to find it. Adding the final recommendation at the end of the options
         section provides a "hook" for the readers to keep in mind as they read
         the next sections.

· In some cases, it may turn out that not adopting any of the options is the
   best course of action at the current time. If this is the case, you will need
   to briefly explain why (time, money constraints, awaiting a developing
   technology, etc.).

                                                                                                                                 111
Formats for Providing Option Analysis

Begin with the paragraph explaining how you found options and narrowed your
selections down to the ones you will be covering. This format works best with
more open-ended qualitative criteria, such as criteria related to elements like
security, satisfaction, and accessibility.
Whole-by-Whole Approach
i. Option 1 Explained in Whole

  i.i.Criterion A
  i.ii.Criterion B
  i.iii.Criterion C
  i.iv.Etc.
ii. Option 2 Explained in Whole
  ii.i.Criterion A
  ii.ii.Criterion B
  ii.iii.Criterion C
  ii.iv.Etc.
iii.Option 3 Explained in Whole
  iii.i.Criterion A
  iii.ii.Criterion B
  iii.iii.Criterion C
  iii.iv.Etc.
Final Recommendation Given to Readers
In the whole-by-whole format, each option is examined in its entirety through
the lens of each criterion and presented to readers one at a time. Because this
may take several pages, the writer really needs to make sense of that preceding
analysis for readers because readers may forget important elements by the end

                                                                                                                                         112
of it, which is why a visual comparison such as a table will often be necessary
before providing the final recommendation.
Part-by-Part Approach
Begin with a paragraph explaining how you found options and narrowed your
selections down to the ones you will be covering. The overview of options should
be clear about the ones on which you will focus because each criterion may take
up several pages and readers may lose focus of the overall options. In this
format, the criteria take center stage, so be sure to start with the most important
criterion first. This format works best for reports where very specific quantitative
criteria have been developed (such as cost, size, weight, etc.).
Part-by-Part Approach

  · Successful Criterion 1
      · Option 1 and how it related to that criterion
      · Option 2 and how it related to that criterion
      · Option 3 and how it related to that criterion

  · Successful Criterion 2
      · Option 1 and how it related to that criterion
      · Option 2 and how it related to that criterion
      · Option 3 and how it related to that criterion

  · Successful Criterion 3
      · Option 1 and how it related to that criterion
      · Option 2 and how it related to that criterion
      · Option 3 and how it related to that criterion

Final Recommendation
In this part-by-part approach, the criteria are foregrounded and therefore
readers may have trouble remembering certain aspects of the options. A visual
comparison, such as a table, will often be necessary before moving on to the

                                                                                                                                         113
final recommendation so readers can see more clearly how each option stacks up
to the criteria.

Building Visual Comparisons for Options

To help you and your readers compare options, a decision matrix can be very
beneficial. A decision matrix is a type of table where readers can compare and
contrast the most salient features of the option, and by doing so, they can also
see what the recommendation might be. The following example shows how a
decision matrix can be used to summarize an options section about which new
van a moving company should consider to replace its current fleet. (Note: a score
of 5/5 is the highest mark for meeting a certain criterion.)

               Example of a Decision Matrix

  Criteria     Option 1: Van Option 2: Van   Option 3: Van
                                                       C
Affordability  A   B
  Durability                                             2
    Mileage    3   5                                     5
   Storage                                               4
 Drivability   5   2                                     2
    TOTALS                                               4
               2   3                                    17

               3   5

               2   3

               15  18

In the example above, the decision matrix uses criteria that are important to the
moving company and to its customers. In this case, the moving company would
like to purchase something that is affordable but will last a long time. The
moving company also wishes to appeal to its customers by offering a vehicle that
is easy to drive, has adequate storage, and gets good gas mileage. All of the
criteria are equal in that each one is worth a maximum of five points, so it seems
clear that Van B scored the most points and would thus be considered the top
recommendation. However, some of the audience members of the moving
company who read the report will note that it might be the most cost-effective to
buy up front, scoring a 5/5 on affordability, but it scored the lowest (2/5) on
durability. In other words, it might be more affordable to implement now, but it
could cost the company more than the other options down the road in terms of
repairs and addressing refunds due to customer breakdowns. In such a case, the
written portion of that section should help to make sense of those differences,
but if you know your audience considers some criteria more important than
others, then the author should provide a weighted decision matrix.

                                             114
               Example of a Weighted Decision Matrix

  Criteria     Weighting  Option 1:  Option 2:        Option 3:
                            Van A      Van B             Van C
Affordability
  Durability   5          15         25                      10
    Mileage
   Storage     4          20         8                       20
 Drivability
    TOTALS     2          4          6                       10
                                                              6
               3          9          15                      16
                                                             62
               4          8          12

                          56         66

In the weighted decision matrix, Van B still comes out on top (but the choice is
clearer than in the simple decision matrix above), primarily because affordability
is weighed as the most important criterion. However, if mileage and durability
were afforded more points in the weighting, another option would have come out
on top because those criteria represent Van B's poorest aspect.

While visuals such as a decision matrix and a weighted decision matrix can help
the audience by providing a quick summary, they won't be able to persuade an
audience on their own. If, for example, someone is a supporter of Van C, they
would most likely want to see how the values were decided, and that would
involve the written portion of the options section that can demonstrate the depth
behind evaluating the vans through the selected criteria. The next section also
helps to underscore the depth in the options section, further helping the audience
understand why a certain option was chosen.

4.9 Writing the Conclusions Section

The conclusions section provides the key findings and takeaways from the
options section. In essence, this section is a summary of the conclusions reached
by comparing the possible solutions to the established criteria in the options
section. Because the options section is long and can sometimes obscure the
details of the options, this section is short and helps the audience focus on the
pertinent details from the options section. It often mirrors the criteria section
because it may consist of only a few numbered sentences, and it may divide
conclusions into primary and secondary conclusions. The conclusions section also
ends with the final recommendation. By doing so, it sets up the transition into
the final section, the final recommendation.

                                                      115
For example, conclusions drawn from the weighted decision matrix above might
look something like this.

Conclusions

1. Van A should not be considered.

2. Van B is the most affordable option.

3. Van C is the most durable, but Van B is the least durable.

4. Van B has the best storage capability and is of average drivability.

5. Van C has poor storage capability.

6. The current budget situation indicates that the company needs to keep costs
      as low as possible next year, but the financial picture over the next 5 to10
      year horizon is much more optimistic.

7. Van B is the best choice because it has the lowest initial costs and offers
      features customers require.

4.10: Writing the Final Recommendation Section

This section, the last section of the recommendation report, allows the writer to
focus solely on the final recommendation, including some ideas about how to
move forward with implementing that recommendation. This section states your
final recommendation by reiterating (and sometimes even expanding on) the
reasoning from previous sections. More importantly, it provides a pathway for
moving forward so the stakeholders can begin the process of working to
implement the new idea. This process does not need to be a meticulous working
plan for moving forward, but it might suggest the next steps that should be
taken to keep the momentum going behind the final recommendation, such as a
meeting of stakeholders whose department might house the solution put forth in
the recommendation.

Because the final recommendation has been provided to readers elsewhere in the
report, this section does not have to be overly long. It often mirrors the problem
statement in length (less than a page). The author should anticipate that some
readers may skip right to this section to see the reasoning behind the choice, so
think of this section as one that could stand alone if needed.

                                                                                                                                         116
If no option (or mixture of options) emerged as a clear decision, then the author
will need to explain why and discuss what should happen next with regard to
moving forward to address the problem. If, indeed, the problem outlined in the
problem statement demands urgent attention, then this section should lay out
what to do next to begin addressing it. For example, if the options that were
evaluated were abandoned due to high costs, then the company may need to
take time to re-allocate resources over the next few months, and the report
authors will then have time to research more options and perhaps consider a
more fitting option that was not previously considered due to high costs.

4.11: Writing the Executive Summary

Now that the recommendation report is finished, and you have worked through
the problem, its history, and the criteria that allowed you to evaluate and
advocate for a particular recommendation, it's time to write the executive
summary. An executive summary is a brief encapsulation of the entire report.
(Note: If you are more familiar with abstracts in academic articles, it helps to
think of the executive summary functioning in the same way abstracts work for
academic writing.)

The length of an executive summary is determined by the complexity of the
entire report, but the goal is to keep it as short as possible and still provide the
key takeaways from the entire report. It's good to think of it as one long
paragraph, and for an estimate, try to keep it less than 250 words total.
Sometimes, the executive summary includes keywords at the end, which is
another way of denoting what the report focuses on. The keywords can be used
by the stakeholders to help classify which areas or divisions within a company or
organization should be responsible for acting on the recommendation and putting
it into place. It helps them route the report to where it needs to go for action to
occur.

Overall, the executive summary should help readers understand the issue in a
global sense, as well as the approach you took in addressing it and your overall
conclusions. It helps people determine the relevance of the greater work that
follows relative to their skills, interests, position, and expertise. Even if they only
read the executive summary, they would have a general idea of the entire report
and be able to talk in a general sense with others about it.

After the cover page and table of contents, the executive summary is the first
thing readers will encounter. In terms of tone and style, then, the executive
summary might sound a little different from the rest of the report depending on

                                                                                                                                         117
its audience. It may be a little more informal/user-friendly if it is written for a
large organization where it might be passed on (sometimes even by itself) to a
wider audience who are asked to weigh in on whether they could contribute to
addressing the problem or attend a meeting about it. On the other hand, for a
smaller organization whose few workers may possess similar expertise, especially
on technical matters, you will be writing to a small, specific audience who may be
expecting a certain level of formality and specificity in order to save time.

Sections of an Executive Summary

1. Problem Statement Overview:

           What problem are you trying to solve? (Be careful not to use too much
             jargon or go too deep. Try for 1-3 (should you just say 1 to 3, because
             below you write 5 to 10 keywords) solid sentences that can explain it
             clearly and leave an impression.)

2. Motivation

           Why should the readers care about the problem and address it? (This
             section may come first depending on how "solvable" or general the
             problem is.)

3. Approach

           How did you go about addressing the problem? What options were
             considered? How did they meet some of the most important criteria?

4. Recommendation

           Which option(s) do you recommend and why?

5. Conclusions

           What are the implications of your results? What should happen now with
             regard to addressing the topic?

6. Keywords

           It can help to provide 5 to10 keywords for your report. If people only
             read your keywords, they should get a good sense of the scope of the
             project.

           Keywords can be used to assign reports to particular departments/
             people, so pay close attention to the words being used. Some keywords

                                                                                                                                         118
             may not be used often in the report itself, but they may be important in
             showing who needs to pay attention to the report and why. For example,
             the name of a certain area or department might show up in keywords
             even though it may not be explicitly stated in the report itself.

Here's an example of an executive summary with the five areas and keywords
outlined:

Example Executive Summary for a Recommendation Report on
Improving Worker Safety

Over the past two years, accidents requiring hospitalization at the Widget
Factory, LLC have increased 78% over the preceding two-year period. In 2020,
the preventive maintenance program at the Widget Factory was scaled back due
to budget issues stemming from COVID. Accordingly, several plant activities,
including production line repair, testing, and calibration, have not been routinely
carried out as in previous factory eras. [The first three sentences are an
overview of the problem statement and background.] The company needs
to address the number of accidents due to the high costs of workers'
compensation paid out ($6 million) and the bad press the accidents have
generated (sales down 19% last year). [This sentence provides the
motivation to fix the problem.] This report explores ways to fix these
problems, including video-based monitoring to identify problems before they
start, embedding preventative maintenance workers in each production line, and
resurrecting the maintenance program that was scrapped due to COVID. [The
approach is covered here.] The final recommendation is to embed
maintenance workers on each line on a six-month trial basis because they will be
able to identify issues immediately and mitigate safety hazards. In addition,
embedding the maintenance workers does not add additional costs since they are
already on payroll, and it also demonstrates to customers and shareholders that
we have taken the injuries seriously and added a new way to address it. [The
recommendation is given.] If the trial proves successful, the program can be
implemented for a longer period and applied to other factories in the Widget
Factory, LLC ecosystem. [The conclusions are given with an eye to the
future.]

Keywords: preventive maintenance; system maintenance; operations; human
resources; media relations

The executive summary is an important step in demonstrating your entire
approach to the problem and the results of your report; it plays an enormous
role in establishing your ethos as a writer because it covers a lot of ground and is

                                                                                                                                         119
often the first section readers will experience. When you are finished with the
body of the recommendation report, be sure to devote enough time to draft and
revise a strong executive summary. A poor executive summary could risk your
audience disregarding or even abandoning your work before they read the actual
report.

4.12: Designing the Cover Page and Front Matter

The final step for the recommendation report is designing the cover page and
front matter. The cover page should include the title, the authors, and the
primary audience. Adding design elements tied to the content of the report that
work to connect the authors and audience of the report or that hint at the
company's shared mission can be helpful. In addition to the cover page, a table
of contents is very useful for readers, especially for reports of more than ten
pages. For the title, it helps to include the genre somewhere on the cover page
and explicitly state that it is a recommendation report. The title then implies a
recommendation will be given--that this is not just an informational report full of
summary, but a report with a persuasive element. For example, a title might be
"Addressing Ways to Increase Student Library Usage; A Recommendation
Report."

The table of contents can be hard to format correctly, so rather than trying to
space everything out yourself, use resources tied to whatever word processing
program you are using. For example, Microsoft provides examples of how to
format the table of contents in Word.

In terms of design, let your audience be your guide as to which elements to use.
For example, using a company logo or identifying image can help show that
everybody is connected to a company with a shared identity and vision relative
to the business goals.

4.13: Final Thoughts on Recommendation Reports

Persuasion happens in recommendation reports thanks to the skill and diligence
of the technical writers who produce them. A haphazardly written
recommendation report, or one that foregrounds pathos at the expense of logos,
does more harm than good. Instead, the technical writer who provides a clear,
thorough look at a problem, its background, and its possible remedies has the
ability to change businesses and organizations, and therefore many other
people's lives, in beneficial ways.

                                                                                                                                         120

4.15: Student Sample Recommendation Report

Accessibility on the Kutztown University Campus:
Recommendations for Improving Access in Old Main

Beau deForest

Executive Summary

Although Kutztown University is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities
Act and meets the criteria for legal accessibility, much of campus is difficult for
disabled students to navigate without assistance. Old Main, the oldest and most
iconic building on campus, is especially difficult to navigate due to its complex
floor plan and many interior doors that are left closed during active hours. Adding
powered door openers to any doors that must remain closed for privacy, safety,
or energy efficiency reasons, while leaving any remaining doors open, would
allow wheelchair users to navigate Old Main much more easily without relying on
daily assistance from faculty or staff, using less than 0.1% of KU's average yearly
operations and maintenance budget.

Keywords: disability, access and inclusion, higher education, student support,
facilities and maintenance.

Problem Statement

In the Accessibility Statement available on its website, Kutztown University
expresses its commitment to "ensuring that [its] campus is inclusive and
accessible to all students, staff, faculty, and visitors," and that the University and
its Disability Services Office "strive to eliminate barriers and provide equal
access" to campus life (Accessibility Statement--Disability Services Office, 2025).
While the KU campus meets the legal definition of accessibility as defined in the
Americans with Disabilities Act, many buildings on campus are difficult for people
with physical disabilities to navigate without assistance. By focusing on practical
accessibility and inclusion, above and beyond legal ADA compliance, KU can
support the needs of disabled community members, which will allow for
increased performance, retention, and persistence for disabled students.

While accessibility needs vary widely between types and levels of ability, this
report will focus on students with limited mobility, especially manual wheelchair
users. A persistent barrier to access on campus is interior doors in many
buildings on campus which, while meeting ADA standards for accessible routes,
are difficult for wheelchair users to navigate unassisted. Recommendations in this

                                                                                                                                         124
report focus on Old Main, which has been chosen because it is the most visible
and iconic building on campus; because its age and history pose unique
accessibility challenges that likely make it the most difficult building to update;
and because, as other buildings on campus close for renovations or are
permanently decommissioned, classroom space and faculty offices have become
increasingly concentrated in Old Main, which increases the impact of any
accessibility challenges.

Currently, many of the ADA-compliant accessible routes in Old Main are
interrupted by doors that remain shut during peak traffic hours. Although these
doors do not represent "architectural barriers," as defined by the ADA, they do
require wheelchair users to take longer, more circuitous routes to their classes
than their non-disabled peers, or to wait to be let through doorways that non-
disabled students can enter unassisted. As a personal example, in Fall 2024, in
order to reach one of my classes on the second floor of Old Main in my
wheelchair, I relied on another student to open one of the always-closed doors
between B- and D-Wing. On days when he was out sick, I entered through the
accessible entrance, took the B-Wing elevator to the first floor, wheeled through
D-Wing on the first floor, and took a second elevator up to the second floor to my
class in E-Wing. Since I had so much farther to go, I had to arrive at Old Main
much earlier than my classmates, who could come in whatever door they wanted
and take the stairs.

Throughout KU's history, care has been taken and resources spent to ensure
compliance with legal standards for accessibility, at both the state and federal
level. While legal accessibility is important, investment of additional resources
into accessibility and inclusion on campus benefits not only disabled students,
faculty, staff, and visitors--both current and future--but the campus community
as a whole. Mobility aids like wheelchairs have overwhelmingly positive effects on
the physical health of students who need them, but stigma surrounding the use
of mobility aids can leave disabled students feeling isolated and vulnerable
(Fishleigh et al., 2024). The removal of physical barriers to access and
accompanying support from community stakeholders are incredibly important in
allowing mobility aids to be seen by both users and their non-disabled peers as
sources of empowerment and independence rather than shame and isolation
(McNicholl et al., 2023).

                                                                                                                                         125
Background

Standards for Legal Accessibility

As part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, KU is subject to
Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states, "newly designed and
constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public
accommodations, and commercial facilities [must] be readily accessible to and
usable by individuals with disabilities" (Americans with Disabilities Act Title II
Regulations, 2024).

Chapter 4 of the 2010 Standards for Title II and Title II Facilities details the
requirements for "accessible routes," which public facilities must provide between
accessible entrances and areas where programs take place. In order to be
considered accessible, doors along an accessible route must meet these
requirements:

      · Door hardware: doors must be openable with one hand, and handles,
         crash bars, and other moving parts "shall not require tight grasping,
         pinching, or twisting of the wrist."

      · Clear width: doorways must be at least 32 inches wide, and no hardware
         or fixtures can protrude into the doorway.

      · Opening force: doors must require no more than 5 pounds of continuous
         force to open.

As mentioned, Kutztown University is already compliant with these guidelines, as
they represent the minimum accessibility required by federal law. It is worth
noting that the ADA guidelines focus on broadly applicable and enforceable
policies, rather than the maximum accessibility that can be achieved in a given
facility. For example, in the case of door-opening force, the 2010 Standards
specifically state that the five-pound limit applies only to "the continuous
application of force necessary to fully open a door," and not to the initial force
needed to begin the motion of opening the door, or to the amount of force
needed to undo bolts or other devices holding the door closed. Even though they
are not regulated by the ADA, these forces may still make doors difficult for
disabled users to open without assistance.

History of Old Main

According to the University's Campus Architect (personal communication, March
24, 2025), Old Main has undergone three major renovations since the 1990s:

                                                                                                                                         126
      · A "multi-phased" update from 1995-1998

      · The early-2000s conversion of the building's A-Wing from residence halls
         to faculty offices. This included the addition of an elevator in A-Wing, as
         well as a Campus Security office in B-Wing, which remained a residence
         hall. Access between A-Wing and the rest of the business was limited to
         certain halls to avoid the locked and secured residence hall in B-Wing.

      · Conversion of B-Wing from residence halls to faculty offices between 2016
         and 2020. This renovation also included the addition of accessible single-
         user restrooms on the upper floors.

The relatively recent use of Old Main as student housing has resulted in a
complex floor plan, including doors between each wing. These doors are artifacts
of the security needs of a building containing both classroom/office space and
student residences, and the majority remain unlocked during the day since they
are no longer needed for security. However, doors between wings are typically
left closed during the day, including those located directly beside elevators.

Criteria

The feasibility of the options is evaluated based on three primary criteria: access,
cost, and reliability.

Criterion 1: Access

As mentioned above, Old Main already meets the legal definition of accessibility
and is in compliance with the ADA. The goal of each option is to increase the
ease with which wheelchair users can navigate Old Main to bring it closer to the
"inclusive, equal access" described by KU's Accessibility Statement. Therefore,
options will be judged on a sliding scale, where one end of the scale is the
current level of accessibility, without improvement, and the other end is full,
equal, inclusive access.

Multiple factors will be considered when evaluating the improved access delivered
by each option. Since the goal is equal access, each factor will be judged based
on how much a wheelchair user's experience differs from that of a non-disabled
student. These factors include:

      · Autonomy: Can a wheelchair user access this area with the same level of
         assistance as a non-disabled person? Does a wheelchair user have to ask
         for assistance when a non-disabled student does not?

                                                                                                                                         127
      · Privacy: Is a wheelchair user more visible while performing this action
         than a non-disabled student would be? Can a non-disabled student be in
         this area alone, but a wheelchair user cannot?

      · Flexibility: Are there times of day in which a non-disabled person can
         access this area, but a wheelchair user cannot? Do architectural barriers
         cause a wheelchair user to need much more time to navigate this space or
         perform this action than a non-disabled student needs? Does a wheelchair
         user need to build their schedule around architectural barriers and the
         systems available to navigate them?

Based on these factors, each option will receive an accessibility rating from 1 to
5, with 1 representing no increase in accessibility and 5 representing full equal
access.

Criterion 2: Cost

The financial cost of each option is evaluated based on the budgets of similar
renovations in the past. These include the addition of an updated HVAC system
to Lytle Hall in 2017, costing about $2 million, and a system of updates
throughout campus in 2018, totaling about $2.5 million (Hawkinson, message
published in The Reading Eagle, 2018). The average total budget for operations
and maintenance at KU between 2018 and 2024 was $27,748,070 (Department
of Institutional Research, 2024), so these renovations and maintenance projects
each represent between 7% and 9% of KU's total maintenance budget. When
evaluating the cost of each option, the up-front materials and installation costs,
as well as the estimated ongoing maintenance costs, will be considered.

In addition to financial costs, time costs (in the case of significant construction
restricting access to high traffic areas), and personnel costs (including hiring new
employees or training current staff to use new accessibility features) will also be
considered as part of this criteria.

Because these proposed accessibility features are quality-of-life additions, above
and beyond legal requirements, priority will be given to affordable options with a
budget of $1.5 million or less, about 5% of the average operations and
maintenance budget for one year.

Each option will receive a cost rating from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the highest
cost (and therefore least favorable outcome) and 5 representing the lowest cost.

                                                                                                                                         128
Criterion 3: Reliability

A major flaw in numerous accessibility systems currently in place at KU is the
lack of clear steps to take in the event of those systems failing. The responsibility
for identifying the correct department, or even the individual staff person, who
has the ability to fix a given problem falls disproportionately on the student who
needs the accessibility feature. Therefore, reliability will be measured based on
three factors:

      · Predicted frequency of failure, based on both mechanical and personnel
         components. How easily is this feature broken or forgotten? How many
         people are involved in the day-to-day usability of this feature? If one of
         those people is away, is the feature still usable?

      · Predicted repair speed. If this feature fails or breaks down, how long will it
         take to be back up and running? How much specialized knowledge is
         required to fix it? How many people on campus have that knowledge?

      · Friction. How much effort is required from faculty/staff/peers in daily
         operation of this accessibility feature? Mechanical features require
         maintenance and upkeep, but don't depend on daily effort and attention
         from staff. More personnel-dependent options must rely more heavily on
         ongoing commitment from multiple levels of administration and staff to
         function, which can make them less reliable in the long term.

Metrics for Success

Following the implementation of any of these options, new data will be needed in
order to measure their success. Currently, while KU's Office of Institutional
Research tracks the diversity of KU's staff, faculty, and student population by
several metrics, the KU Factbook contains no data on physical disability. This
makes it difficult to track metrics like retention and persistence for disabled
students. The impact of any added accessibility systems could be tracked
through collaboration between the Office of Institutional Research and the KU
Disability Services Office, which could provide anonymized statistics on
enrollment and performance, as well as administering surveys to disabled
students.

Options

Many options were considered and evaluated. The options listed here are those
that could feasibly be completed in a reasonable time frame while preserving the
floorplan and structure of Old Main. Each of these options focuses on interior

                                                                                                                                         129
doors that currently pose accessibility challenges, including doors between wings
and doors to otherwise accessible restrooms, and excluding doors to individual
classrooms and faculty offices, for an estimated total of 50 doors.

Option 1: Doorbells

Add battery powered doorbells on either side of all doors along accessible routes.

Access

      · Minimal improvements to accessibility. Improves ease of asking for
         assistance but does not allow unassisted access.

      · Limits access hours, as doorbells are only useful when someone is in the
         area to respond and open the door.

      · Limits privacy, making them unsuitable for bathrooms.

      · Accessibility score: 2/5

Cost

      · Based on prices for battery-powered doorbells on Amazon, a simple
         doorbell and receiver (without additional features such as intercom,
         camera, or smartphone integration) costs between $12 and $50 dollars. A
         reliable mid-range model costing $20 per set could be added to 50 doors
         for $1,000. (Higher-quality, more expensive models may decrease future
         expenses by needing to be replaced less often.)

      · Installation is simple enough to be performed by existing maintenance and
         facilities staff without hiring contractors and would require little or no
         downtime.

      · Small personnel cost, as someone needs to recognize the sound of the
         doorbell and respond to it. Little to no training would be needed, but any
         room intended to be accessible would need an attendant during open
         hours.

      · Cost score: 4/5

Reliability

      · Doorbells introduce multiple points of failure. Each doorbell is a separate
         system with its own battery, which communicates wirelessly with a specific

                                                                                                                                         130
         receiver. Problems could arise from the battery, within any individual
         doorbell or receiver, or from the communication between doorbell and
         receiver.

      · A wheelchair user on one side of a closed door has no way of knowing
         whether the doorbell has worked and would be unable to identify any
         problems that arrive, making it difficult to report, explain, or solve
         problems.

      · This system depends on participation of staff, volunteers, or passersby in
         order to function. Would rely either on luck/high traffic (and only function
         when people happen to be passing and recognize the doorbell sign) or
         require specifically assigned staff, in which case schedule changes or staff
         absences would render the system nonfunctional.

      · Reliability score: 2/5

Doorbells are attractive due to their low cost, and might improve accessibility in
some areas, but quickly become impractical at scale due to their low reliability.
Additionally, while they increase physical access, they do nothing to break down
barriers between wheelchair users and their peers, and leave disabled students
dependent on assistance to navigate Old Main.

Option 1: Doorbells Total: 8/15

Option 2: Open Hour

Prop doors open during specific hours on specific days.

Access

      · Greatly increase access during open hours, allowing wheelchair-users to
         navigate much of Old Main unassisted. Does not improve access at all
         outside of open hours, however.

      · Possible problems with any doors that, while open, block walkways or
         other doorways.

      · Some doors, especially bathroom doors, may not be appropriate to prop
         open due to privacy concerns.

      · Accessibility score: 3/5

                                                                                                                                         131
Cost

      · No material or construction costs.

      · Limited personnel costs, as existing staff would need to open doors at
         beginning of open hours and close them again at the end.

      · Cost score: 5/5

Reliability

      · In addition to staff tasked with opening and closing doors, students would
         need to be made aware of open hours in order to schedule around them.
         Depending on the number of wheelchair users on campus, open hours
         could be adjusted based on students' course schedules, but this would add
         additional points of failure as it would require coordination among
         students, the Disability Services Office, and the facilities/maintenance staff
         responsible for opening doors.

      · For students to rely on doors being open, they would need to be provided
         with clear, reliable instructions for reporting problems. This could be
         accomplished by posting a phone number on doors with open hours, which
         students could call or text to report a door that is not open when it should
         be. In order for open hours to successfully increase access, that number
         would need to be reliable, and a staff member would need to be available
         to respond throughout open hours.

      · Reliability score: 3/5

This solution is attractive as a way of greatly increasing access and inclusion with
minimal expense. However, this option is only feasible with continued attention
and effort from administration and staff and will be greatly affected by factors
such as overwhelmed facilities staff, which makes it less reliable than solutions
that are more costly but don't depend on ongoing effort.

Option 2: Open Hour Total: 11/15

Option 3: Targeted Power Doors

Addition of powered door-openers to specific doors and using Option 1 or Option
2 for other doors. This would involve an information-gathering period, ideally in
collaboration with disabled students, to identify doors that are barriers to access
but must remain closed when not in use. This would likely include bathroom

                                                                                                                                         132
doors, as well as any doors that are left closed for heating, cooling, or fire safety
reasons. Other doors could then be left propped open without needing to be
closed again at the end of each day.

Access

      · Powered openers on bathrooms doors would allow wheelchair users to use
         restrooms easily, without assistance, at any time that Old Main is open and
         the power is on, without decreased privacy.

      · Powered openers on fire doors, as well as doors identified by facilities staff
         as important for heating or cooling costs, would allow wheelchair users to
         easily pass through without the additional heating or cooling costs
         associated with leaving those doors open.

      · Many doors in Old Main are left closed by default without a reason
         specified by either the Campus Architect or KU Public Safety. These could
         presumably be left open or even removed from their frames, allowing full
         access without cost.

      · Accessibility Score: 5/5

Cost

      · The most affordable type of powered opener is generally a swing opener
         with a push-button sensor. The weight, material, and size of doors on
         which the opener is being installed will affect the price, as a heavier door
         will need a more powerful opener. Since the doors discussed here are
         along the ADA-accessible route and meet its weight restrictions, a mid-
         range opener, costing between $715 and $1000 per door, should provide
         enough power (C&I Hardware, 2024). Openers costing $1000 installed on
         20 doors would cost approximately $20,000.

      · Installation typically takes 1 to 3 hours per door and may require hiring
         outside contractors. Outside labor is estimated at between $400 and
         $1000 per door (Auto Door and Hardware, 2024). At $700, installation on
         20 doors would cost $14,000 and take approximately 40 total hours.

      · These door openers are wired, and do not require batteries, but do require
         maintenance and upkeep. Because these are interior doors, they would
         likely require less frequent maintenance than the exterior power-assisted
         doors already present on campus.

                                                                                                                                         133
      · As a rough estimate, the cost of materials and installation for 20 doors
         would be approximately $34,000, which is just under 0.1% of the total
         operations and maintenance budget for KU.

      · Cost Score: 3/5

Reliability

      · Powered doors require regular maintenance and upkeep, in line with the
         other power-assisted doors on campus. Failures can be reported like any
         other maintenance issue on campus.

      · Power-assisted doors do not depend on additional ongoing efforts to
         maintain accessibility, as staff will not have to monitor them on a daily
         basis. If the unmodified doors are opened and closed regularly, they will be
         subject to the same reliability issues as outlined in Option 2, but doors left
         permanently open will remain reliably accessible regardless of staff or
         scheduling changes.

      · Reliability Score: 5/5

While costlier than Options 1 and 2, this option is still significantly less expensive
than other recent campus renovations, taking up a tiny fraction of the operations
and management budget. In addition, once powered openers have been added,
this option does not rely on daily staff participation, so its reliability is not as
variable as that of previous options.

Option 3: Targeted Door Replacement Total: 13/15

Option 4: Comprehensive Door Replacement

Add powered door openers to all doors along accessible routes through Old Main.

Access

      · Powered openers would virtually eliminate architectural barriers
         throughout Old Main, making its accessible routes as easy to navigate for
         wheelchair users as for their non-disabled peers.

      · Access Score: 5/5

Cost

· Using the same estimates for materials and installation costs as laid out in
   Option 3, adding powered openers to 50 doors in Old Main would cost
   roughly $85,000, and take about 100 total hours.

· Although this is the most expensive option listed in this report, it still
   represents less than 0.5% of KU's average yearly operations and
   management budget.

· Cost Score: 1/5

Reliability

· With regular maintenance on a similar schedule as the power-assisted
   doors already present throughout campus, this option would be extremely
   reliable for the foreseeable future, and would not be significantly affected
   by future staff or administration changes.

· Because it would involve more wiring and mechanical systems, additional
   powered doors would introduce more points of failure than Option 3.

· Reliability Score: 4/5

This option would allow full, equal, autonomous accessibility throughout Old
Main, without ongoing daily effort from staff, and it would allow doors to continue
to remain closed by default and only open when in use. However, because of its
high up-front costs, it is a bigger investment than the previous options.

Conclusions

The Kutztown University campus presents many accessibility challenges. Some,
caused by the geography of the landscape and the layout of historically
significant buildings, would be difficult to solve even with unlimited resources.
The options listed here would have an enormous effect on accessibility on
campus, and could be implemented with only a tiny fraction of the resources KU
spends on regular maintenance every year. The same criteria used in this report
could be used to find similarly cost-effective, relatively low-effort accessibility
updates to many other buildings on campus.

Studies suggest that the number of disabled students in higher education is
increasing, slowly but steadily (McNicholl, et al., 2023). Even on accessible
campuses, disabled students face physical, medical, architectural, and social
barriers that their non-disabled students do not. Tangible evidence of intentional
support and investment, beyond what is required by law, communicates to
disabled students and to those in the wider community shows that the university
and its administration believe they are worth investing in and supporting.

Final Recommendation

Of the options evaluated, Option 3, the targeted addition of power-assisted
doors, is the best balance of increased access, reasonable cost, and
ongoing reliability. Some interior doors in Old Main, such as the doors to its
accessible restrooms and some computer labs, are left closed for privacy, safety,
or security reasons. The addition of powered openers to these doors will allow
wheelchair users to access basic necessities with comfort and privacy, as well as
to participate in programs and use services with the same ease as their non-
disabled peers, without compromising anyone's safety, security, or privacy.

Many other doors were originally placed to meet security needs that no longer
exist from Old Main's history as a mixed residence hall and classroom space.
They remain closed by default, but no longer serve a practical purpose. By
leaving these doors open, KU has the opportunity to remove multiple barriers to
access with no significant cost.

A re-evaluation of the accessible routes through Old Main would allow facilities
staff to identify which doors along that path are closed for a current, practical
reason, and which no longer have a reason to remain closed, to ensure that the
use of resources is efficient and responsible.

                                                                                                                                         136
          Any accessibility update on campus would benefit from input from disabled
          students. Surveys or listening sessions, in collaboration with the Disability
          Services Office, would provide opportunities for students to identify the greatest
          barriers to full inclusion and participation in campus life.

4.16: Discussion Questions for the Sample Student
Recommendation Report

      · How does the problem statement make a compelling case for why this
         issue is important and needs to be addressed?

      · What parts of the background section help to provide more context for the
         problem?

      · The criteria section in this report is quite long. Based on the discussion of
         the criteria section provided in this chapter, is there anything you would
         change about how the report shares its criteria? For example, are there
         areas where trimming or adding visuals would help the audience?

      · Does the options section persuade you that the selected recommendation
         is best? Why or why not?

      · Overall, if you were the target audience for this recommendation report,
         what sections and what information would be most powerful in persuading
         you?

                                                                                                                                         138
