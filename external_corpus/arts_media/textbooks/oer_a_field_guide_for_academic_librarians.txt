OER: A Field Guide for Academic Librarians

Description
We intend this book to act as a guide writ large for would-be champions of OER, that anyone--called to
action by the example set by our chapter authors--might serve as guides themselves. The following chapters
tap into the deep experience of practitioners who represent a meaningful cross section of higher education
institutions in North America. It is our hope that the examples and discussions presented by our authors will
facilitate connections among practitioners, foster the development of best practices for OER adoption and
creation, and more importantly, lay a foundation for novel, educational excellence.

      OER: A Mechanism for Educational Change

                       Jonathan Lashley, Andrew Wesolek, & Anne Langley

I n t r o d u c t i o n

For many of us, the drive to effect positive change--however vague or
idiosyncratic our sense of this might be--has guided our work in higher
education. We champion the pursuit of a college degree because few en-
deavors can match it in terms of advancing a person's economic mobility
(Chetty, Friedman, Saez, Turner, & Yagan, 2017). Despite recent debates
about the value of a college degree (Pew Research Center, 2017), the op-
portunities and financial stability awarded to those with college degrees
remain apparent when they are compared to peers who have only grad-
uated high school (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017). And
while more Americans have a college degree than ever before (Ryan &
Bauman, 2016), access to a formal, post-secondary education continues
to be elusive for some.

    Indeed, over the last 10 years, analysts have projected that the cost
of attending college would keep 2.4 million low-to-moderate income,
college-qualified high school graduates from completing a college degree
(Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, 2006). During
that same period, college students in the United States saw expenses re-
lated to tuition and fees increase by 63 percent, school housing costs
(excluding board) increase by 51 percent, and textbook prices increase
by 88 percent (Bureau of Labor, 2016). Because few students can afford
a college education through salary alone, 44.2 million Americans have
sought financial aid via student loans. As a result, total student loan debt
is now topping $1.45 trillion in the United States (Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, 2017), and student loan delinquency rates
are averaging 11.2 percent (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2017).
The burden of a student's financial decisions extends beyond the mere
2  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

individual: society will inevitably carry the weight of this debt for years
to come.

    As a means of making college more affordable and promoting access
to educational content, many of us look to open educational resources
(OER) as a catalyst for positive, tangible change. Residing in the public
domain or licensed in such a way that they are made free for use and
repurposing by others (Hewlett Foundation, n.d.), these open teaching,
learning, and research resources not only serve as alternatives to commer-
cial educational products, they promote new relationships between acad-
emic communities and educational content. Take, for instance, the Project
Management for Instructional Designers (PM4ID) (2016) project that David
Wiley undertook with instructional design students at Brigham Young
University. Though open project management textbooks existed, none
addressed the work of instructional designers in particular. Rather than
make do with a general textbook, the affordances of openly licensed con-
tent engendered Wiley's students to work as co-authors and -editors on
the content of a new, specialized open textbook that is still widely distrib-
uted and updated regularly. Thanks to OER, students became consumers
and producers of increasingly valuable content while Wiley's assignments
and course materials became only more relevant to the context of his class.

The Basics of OER
Open textbooks like PM4ID may arguably be the best-known form of
OER, but the potential implementation of OER extends well beyond the
textbook format. Definitions of OER account for a plethora of education-
related assets including "full courses, materials, modules, textbooks,
streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or tech-
niques used to support access to knowledge" (Hewlett Foundation, n.d.).
While any such content that exists in the public domain is free to (re)use
and may play a valuable role in the development of OER, because copy-
right protection does or will not apply to such authored work (United
States Copyright Office, n.d.), it is the affordances to retain, reuse, revise,
remix, and redistribute (the 5 Rs) of open licensing that promote OER
adoption as worthwhile. Coined by Wiley (Open Content, n.d.), the 5 Rs
describe the ways in which openly licensed content may be transformed
while still celebrating the work of the original author. Under open per-
Introduction  3

missions, anyone might responsibly copy, keep, combine, edit, and share
the original author's IP:

1. Retain: the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g.,
    download, duplicate, store, and manage)

2. Reuse: the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a

    class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
3. Revise: the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself

    (e.g., translate the content into another language)
4. Remix: the right to combine the original or revised content with

    other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content
    into a mashup)
5. Redistribute: the right to share copies of the original content, your re-
    visions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content
    to a friend) (Open Content, n.d.).

Thus, by way of the 5R permissions, users may transform openly licensed
content under new, more fitting applications across myriad creative and
educational contexts.

    Organizations like Creative Commons (CC) exist to provide standard-
ized, alternative means of licensing content so as to support original con-
tent creators and the 5R permissions alike. CC--a nonprofit organization
that is the perhaps the most prominent platform for open licens-
ing--maintains six licenses (BY, BY-ShareAlike, BY-NoDerivative, BY-
NonCommercial, BY-NonCommercial-ShareAlike, BY-NonCommercial-
NoDerivative). Through these licenses, authors may easily redefine the
terms of copyright that are otherwise automatically applied to creative
work, allowing materials to be shared broadly, reused flexibly, and modified
legally (Creative Commons, n.d.). While any of the CC licenses may ac-
company OER, the least restrictive, CC-BY, is the one that we, the authors
of this book, most heartily endorse (note that this book is licensed CC-BY).
This particular license ensures that any resulting application of a work will
provide attribution to its original authors without discouraging the trans-
formative activities of others. A license that fully protects ownership and
guides the open improvement of materials by all original and potential au-
thors thus becomes a mechanism for great change in the development and
distribution of resources to aid teaching, learning, and research.
4  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

This Book: A Guide
The production of new scholarly material is not without costs. While
the end product may be free to read and free of most copyright restric-
tions, the production of OER requires substantial institutional invest-
ment--primarily in labor--for services such as peer review management,
copy editing, typesetting, and the like. These up-front costs, combined
with the lack of a clear revenue stream for OER, pose a challenge. Further
complicating things, the possible implementations of OER may vary sig-
nificantly as OER initiatives span departments, institutions, and systems.
As is the case with other initiatives in higher education, research, assess-
ment, and evaluation activities become necessary to support and sustain
OER. Whether it is identifying milestones and stakeholders, surveying
technical infrastructure and support, designing success criteria and eval-
uation, or shepherding training and curriculum changes, OER initiatives
beg for collaboration among the various departments of our institutions.
Some, including the editors of this book, look to academic librarians as
uniquely qualified to lead such efforts (Bell & Salem, 2017). Simply, acad-
emic librarians are already well versed in managing content and working
with others across disciplinary, professional, and geographic lines.

    While faculty members and academic departments ultimately deter-
mine which educational materials are most appropriate for their courses,
faculty, educators and academic leaders are not always aware of affordable
or open alternatives to publisher content. Librarians, on the other hand,
have a rich history of discovering educational materials broadly defined,
ensuring access to such resources, and educating others about their use.
This professional perspective encourages librarians to take a comprehen-
sive view of educational resources. The greater the complexity of OER
in form, the more we see a need for such wide gaze in coordinating the
community-driven approaches modeled by cases covered in the following
chapters. It takes a village to adopt, modify, create, and share content well.

Structure of this Book
We intend this book to act as a guide writ large for would-be champions
of OER, that anyone--called to action by the example set by our chapter
authors--might serve as guides themselves. The following chapters tap
into the deep experience of practitioners who represent a meaningful
Introduction  5

cross section of higher education institutions in North America. It is our
hope that the examples and discussions presented by our authors will fa-
cilitate connections among practitioners, foster the development of best
practices for OER adoption and creation, and more importantly, lay a
foundation for novel, educational excellence.

    The openly licensed content of this book is organized into four sec-
tions: (1) an introduction to OER, (2) discussions of how OER transforms
teaching and learning, (3) examples of how librarians advocate for OER
across campus, and (4) models of library-supported adoption and creation
of OER. We encourage readers who are new to OER to read through
this volume linearly, beginning with the introductory material. Seasoned
practitioners may wish to pick and choose among the case studies that
most closely relate to the contexts of their particular institutions. The
open education movement is made up of passionate professionals who are
willing to share their experience with others (as evidenced by this open
access collection of case studies). Readers will find brief biographies for all
of our contributing authors, and we suggest that you reach out to those
figures who seem most compelling or whose work most closely aligns
with your own.

Section 1: The Case for OER
In Section 1, our authors describe the interdepartmental and transdis-
ciplinary stakes, strategies, and opportunities that exist as the academic
community endeavors to support OER in higher education.

    Throughout "Stakes and Stakeholders: Open Educational Re-
sources--Framing the Issues," Yano and Myers offer a broad survey of

the ways in which OER is uniquely equipped to address the political, eco-
nomic, and cultural conditions at play in modern education contexts. The
authors further elaborate on how the escalating price tag for a college
education relates to changes in the commercial publishing market, and
identify the ways in which publishers' "digital direct" and "inclusive access"
models are attempting to confound and cannibalize non-commercial tech-
nology like OER. As Yano and Myers explain, however, government
entities, nonprofit organizations, and grassroots organizing have proven
helpful in launching OER initiatives and keeping them open. Finally, this
chapter puts forward a shared discourse for OER by highlighting the
6  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

terms, actions, and responsibilities that we might share when working
with others.

    Hilton, in "What Does the Research Say About OER?," reviews

the empirical research proving the efficacy of OER as an intervention.
He situates the rise of OER as a means of combating the otherwise
unchecked rise in textbook prices that has negatively affected students,
taxpayers, and institutions financially. Perhaps even more important
than securing financial equity, however, are the ways in which OER fa-
cilitates effective teaching and learning. By tracing how studies about
cost savings, student outcomes, OER use, and user perception have pro-
liferated over the last decade, Hilton paints a lucid picture of the mean-
ingful relationships that exists between student success and open access
to educational materials.

Section 2: The Pedagogical Implications of OER
In Section 2, our authors dive deeper into how OER-based interventions
transform educational experiences for students and instructors alike.

    Drilling down into the specific opportunities that OER initiatives
might provide for academic librarians, Amaral's chapter, "From Text-
book Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy: Growing an OER
Community," situates support of OER as inherently complementary to

the mission, resources, and priorities found at many libraries. Celebrating
the top-down leadership of the City University of New York (CUNY)
subsidizing library leadership in promoting low- and no-cost course ma-
terials, Amaral accounts for the hurdles, milestones, and opportunities
that have helped position CUNY OER initiatives as some of the most
compelling, scalable, and library-centric in the nation. At Borough of
Manhattan Community College (BMCC), Amaral's home institution, suc-
cess with OER has come through a variety of approaches that are mea-
surable for impact and, in turn, reveal a clear picture of positive outcomes
around OER. As a result, the chapter highlights the ways in which an ac-
tive and engaged culture may emerge from librarians setting clear goals
and working with others in the greater pursuit of reclaiming knowledge
as public good.

    When it comes to supporting OER, Reed recognizes a need for in-
creased collaboration between information literacy and scholarly com-
Introduction  7

munication librarians. In her chapter, "An Exploration of the Inter-
sections of Information Literacy and Scholarly Communication,"

Reed reflects on recommendations put forward by the Association of Col-

lege & Research Libraries (ACRL) white paper for how these two areas
of librarianship might intersect in significant ways. For librarians who are
serving in one of these two contexts, or for non-librarian readers who
seek to better connect with their library counterparts, this chapter un-
derscores the importance of not neglecting one's own department when
forming OER partnerships. Further, under the diversity of roles that oc-
cupy modern librarianship, Reed makes a case for why academic libraries
are so perfectly positioned to initiate, innovate and support OER.

    Reed and Turner, both of University of Texas at Arlington, in their
chapter, "Experiential Learning and Open Education: Partnering
with Students to Evaluate OER Accessibility," provide us with a de-

scription of their work with a student intern on evaluating OER for
accessibility with disabled students. This chapter describes how they cre-
ated a student internship program that designed guidelines, criteria, and
standards for accessibility evaluation. The chapter includes the methods
they used, the key resources they used to design their evaluation, and de-
scribes in detail how to evaluate OER for accessibility. They looked at
content organization, how images are presented, tables, hyperlinks and
multimedia, formulas, fonts, and color contrast. They also describe how
the internship worked.

    In her chapter, "Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpack-
ing the Opaque Box," Walz helps us consider the many factors that ac-

company course material selection and adoption. Though powerful forces
like academic culture, tradition, and training might stymie the work of
librarians, instructional designers, and others in cultivating a more pur-
poseful relationship between instructors and the course materials they
use, Walz observes an opportunity for open education advocates to break
through these barriers and create more transparent, deliberate practices
when evaluating and selecting required materials. Emphasizing how
openness may inspire an ethic of understanding in those of us who work
closely with faculty, this chapter offers insight as to how an individual li-
brarian or other academic staff member might spark new and powerful
8  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

conversations about course content by establishing shared values through
a culture of trust and understanding.

    In the final chapter of this section, Jhangiani and Green propose
unity between librarians and others under the imperative of openly shar-
ing practices and resources to support pedagogical innovation. "An Open
Athenaeum: Creating an Institutional Home for Open Pedagogy"

promotes contemporary conversations about how OER empower peda-
gogy in transformative ways, and illuminates the ways in which academic
librarians and library resources might support these innovations.
Jhangiani and Green provide multiple, tangible examples of open peda-
gogical practice across several disciplines and offer suggestions for how
pedagogy, not tools or texts, is at the heart of our efforts when we advo-
cate for OER. For the authors of this chapter, there is no better locale in
which to cultivate the pedagogical efforts of an individual than among the
resources and staff of an academic library.

Section 3: OER Advocacy, Partnerships, Sustainability,
and Student Engagement
Section 3 provides a series of case studies about the practical, collabo-
rative, and renewable aspects of supporting OER. Many strategies thus
emerge for engaging instructors/students, finding and evaluating existing
OER, and partnering with other units to support adoption/modification/
creation initiatives.

    In "Open Partnerships: Identifying and Recruiting Allies for
Open Educational Resources Initiatives," Cummings-Sauls, Ruen,

Beaubien, and Smith extend conversations about OER-enabled part-
nerships by exhaustively describing the roles and responsibilities har-
bored by potential stakeholders in OER initiatives and highlighting the
ways in which librarians might instigate partnerships between these
groups. By clearly identifying the stakes of library, faculty, student, ad-
ministrative, instructional design, information technology, and book-
store partnerships, the authors promote a sort of inventory for how and
why we might meaningfully engage these local audiences in support of
OER. Looking beyond our institutions to the broader external commu-
nities, legislation, and services related to OER, this chapter introduces
the importance of considering how conversations might (and ultimately
Introduction  9

should) scale to include metrics that are worth sharing outside of our re-
spective institutions.

    "Getting to Know You: How We Turned Community Knowl-
edge into Open Advocacy," by Lillian Rigling and William Cross is

about how North Carolina State University (NCSU) Libraries assessed
their OER work and outreach strategies with students. NCSU imple-
mented an Alt-Textbook program to fund the creation of free or low-cost
learning materials in 2014. While the program had success in the specific
areas where it was adopted, the library wanted to work through their stu-
dents to support wider advocacy for the program. This chapter describes
how they designed and conducted targeted outreach to students and how
they assessed their outreach work.

    DeeAnn Ivie and Carolyn Ellis's chapter, "Advancing Access for
First-Generation College Students: OER Advocacy at UT San Anto-
nio," describes in detail how they worked through campus partnerships and

multiple student groups for OER advocacy with major campus stakeholders.
This university with a large population of Hispanic first-generation students
had strong economic drivers for OER, and the library took advantage of this
unique population to lead the way. This chapter discusses integration with
the registrar, the campus bookstore, and partnering with the Provost and
the teaching and learning center; describes how they worked with the stu-
dent government and various student organizations to not only market but
assess progress; describes the metrics they used to measure the program's
strengths and weaknesses; and finally talks about their future directions and
how they will use strategic indicators to assess outcomes.

    Alesha Baker and Cinthya Ippoliti, in their case study, "Student-
Driven OER: Championing the Student Voice in Campus-Wide Ef-
forts," focus on the adoption of OER through working closely with stu-

dents in multiple ways. These authors describe how they engaged students
at Oklahoma State University to become advocates for OER adoption,
how they worked closely with student groups, student government, and
through the creation of a committee that included students. They talk
about how they obtained a development grant to get the work started, and
how they provided supporting grants to faculty to design resources; and
finally, they describe how students designed OER.
10  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Dean's chapter, "From Conversation to Cultural Change: Strate-
gies for Connecting with Students and Faculty to Promote OER
Adoption," describes how Clemson University supported OER adoption

through a multi-pronged effort. Because they wanted to change their cul-
ture, they used a variety of outreach and advocacy efforts. The library led
the process through in-depth analysis of the environment, and extensive
assessment of the existing culture in order to implement a variety of com-
munication strategies. The process is described in detail, as well as the
relationship building that is needed for successful implementation. Dean
addresses the sustainability of the program and talks about future planning.

    In the case study "Making the Connections: The Role of Pro-
fessional Development in Advocating for Open Educational Re-
sources," Michael LaMagna describes and presents a novel approach that

uses training in professional development as a pathway to supporting fu-
ture OER design and implementation. At Delaware County Community
College, faculty librarians led the way serving as advocates and trainers to
offer faculty in-service presentations about various aspects of OER. LaM-
agna describes the various sessions: OER writ large, an open discussion
about campus adoption of OER, how to build alternative course content,
and copyright and OER. Particulars about how they created the program,
the funding sources, and the design of the curriculum are included in the
case study.

    "Advocacy in OER: A Statewide Strategy for Building a Sustain-
able Library Effort," by Emily Frank and Teri Gallaway, outlines how

Lousiana's state library consortium, LOUIS, advanced OER initiatives
across an entire state. Frank and Gallaway include discussion about OER
for cost savings at the state level, how they used grants to subsidize library
faculty work, and how state legislation supported their work to reach
statewide adoption. In particular, they describe their train-the-trainer ap-
proach, how they used training efforts to increase outreach, and how the
libraries served as leaders throughout the process. They talk about how
their advocacy changed the culture in the state.

    Five authors, Sarah Hare, Andrea Wright, Christy Allen, Geneen E.
Clinkscales, and Julie Reed, in the chapter, "Interinstitutional Collabo-
rations to Forge Intracampus Connections: A Case Study From the
Introduction  11

Duke Endowment Libraries," provide a study on how different insti-

tutions can work together to implement open education programs in a
variety of different settings and campus cultures. This chapter talks about
endowment support, assessment and analysis of their work together, ad-
vocacy, implementation and training, program customization, and using
a train-the-trainer approach, and discusses how they engaged faculty. The
institutions involved include: Duke University, Davidson College, Fur-
man University, and Johnson C. Smith University.

Section 4: Library-Supported Adoption and Creation
Programs
The final section of this book offers case studies in which library staff
and operations successfully lead the development, sharing, and adoption
of OER at a variety of institutions.

    In "Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks," Smith out-

lines the growth OER initiatives at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst. With a focus on improvisation, developing partnerships and
transitioning from textbook affordability to true open education, Smith
details grant funding opportunities offered through U. Mass. Amherst
while wrestling with the questions of what exactly libraries support when
they support "open education" and how can that support be provided sus-
tainably.

    Waller, Taylor, and Zemke, writing about the University of Okla-
homa, present a chapter all about the multiple aspects of implementing
their open education program. "From Start-Up to Adolescence: Uni-
versity of Oklahoma's OER Efforts," maps out their route to deep

OER implementation. This chapter describes a top-down approach that
included faculty support grants, creation of an OER Librarian position,
the program design, how they put together an OER planning committee,
an assessment of OER technologies, and OER course assessment design.
They include a thorough description of their outreach strategies, and an
assessment of those strategies.

    Ross and Francis describe a unique bottom-up approach to adopting
OER in "A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption: The University
of Saskatchewan Experience." They talk about how outreach builds

awareness, and describe their multiple projects and partnerships across
the university. Ross and Francis describe how individual champions can
be terrific instruments for change, and how even a single faculty adoption
can start changing campus opinions. They tell how they used their institu-
tional repository to support their adoption efforts and describe the library
as the leader for OER.

    In "Bringing OER to the Liberal Arts: An Innovative Grant Pro-
gram," Miller discusses at length the work at Rollins College, a small

liberal arts college in Florida, to use faculty grants to inspire and initiate
the creation of OER. Their program focused on full-time, tenure-track
faculty, and designed an iterative grant process with clearly defined crite-
ria that mapped to their program goals. Miller describes their experience
with an art and art history professor, a political science professor, and
a physics professor. The unique challenges each professor faced are dis-
cussed, as well as some of the lessons they learned throughout the process.

    Finally, In "Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From
our Friends," Batchelor offers a case study in OER textbook publishing

through the University of Washington and the Rebus Foundation. Specif-
ically, she offers an example of what the Reebus Foundation could look
like in the future, while calling on librarians to serve as catalysts and con-
nectors in a broader faculty-driven OER publishing community.

A Call to Action
Though this book cannot fully account for all of the considerations that
are necessary for supporting the OER movement, we have volunteered
a common understanding for you to consult and reuse regarding the
stakes, stakeholders, strategies, and opportunities worth anticipating in
your work. Whether institutional or individual in scope, participation in
the OER movement sponsors meaningful change for education. Those
of us who work as academic librarians, however, are fortunate to harbor
many of the relevant resources and skill sets that have proven invaluable
to shaping the open education movement for broadest, most sustainable
impact. Librarians have a long and rich history of connecting researchers
with relevant information, preserving material, and facilitating access to
that material. There are themes that run through many of the case studies,
including the library and librarians as both catalysts and community lead-

ers in awareness building, adoption oversight, and implementation pro-

ject management. In short, we are certain you will be able to find potential

solutions and a new network of colleagues to help you address the role of

OER at your institution.

                                           The Case for OER

S e c t i o n 1 : T h e C a s e f o r O E R

Readers of this brief introductory section will find a broad overview of
current political and economic contexts affecting higher education afford-
ability, and a survey of literature proposing OER as one potential solution.
Those readers new to OER will benefit from succinct explanations of
what OER are, the problems they are meant to solve, and some docu-
mented solutions.

    First, Yano and Myers introduce us to a shared discourse surrounding
OER, highlighting the terms, actions, and responsibilities of OER prac-
tice. Learning this shared language is significant in the OER space when
one considers that government entities, nonprofit organizations, and
grassroots efforts have all contributed to the advancement of OER, in
comparison to the language established publishers employ in related ven-
tures, i.e. "digital direct" and "inclusive access" models. In order to move
toward truly open resources, it is imperative that practitioners agree on
the terminology surrounding the movement.

    In the following chapter John Hilton then offers compelling evidence
of the efficacy of OER in the classroom. Through his thorough review
of studies about cost savings, student outcomes, OER use, and user per-
ceptions have proliferated over the last decade, Hilton makes clear the
strength of the relationships between student success and open access to
educational materials.

College is still valuable, but more students are enrolling than graduating.
According to a 2014 study by Complete College America that investigated
the length of time for college graduation, the four-year degree is simply no
longer the reality for most undergraduate students (Complete College Amer-
ica, 2014). The vast majority of students at U.S. public universities are com-
pleting their bachelor's degree in six years, and for students completing two-
year associate's degrees at community colleges the average graduation rate is
three years. On-time graduation rates account for only 36 percent of students
completing four-year bachelor's degrees at flagship institutions.1 This num-
ber drops to 19 percent for students completing four-year bachelor's degrees
at non-flagship institutions, and drops as low as 5 percent for students com-
pleting a two-year associate's degree at non-flagship institutions. The same
report also found that only 50 of the more than 580 public four-year institu-
tions have graduation rates above 50 percent. This has resulted in more than
31 million students in the past two decades having attended a U.S. college but
never earning a degree. The reality is that higher education costs too much,
takes too long, and graduates far too few.

    The rising cost of higher education poses a significant challenge to
those who are interested in pursuing a degree, as students cannot access
what they cannot afford. There has been a consistent increase in the cost

1 The phrase flagship institution may be applied to an individual school or
campus within each state system. A flagship institution is the best-known
institution in the state, often the first to be established, and frequently the
largest and most selective, as well as the most research-intensive public uni-
versities.

of tuition in both the U.S.2 and Canada,3 and textbook costs have sur-
passed that rate of growth. According to a report conducted by the U.S.
Government Accountability Office (2013), from 2002 to 2012, textbook
prices rose on average 6 percent per year. The same report revealed that
new textbook prices increased by a total of 82 percent during that same
time period. This increase is significant, especially when compared to the
28 percent increase in overall consumer prices during the same time pe-
riod.

    When it comes to recommended student budgets versus actual stu-
dent spending, a large discrepancy exists. The College Board
(www.collegeboard.org) releases an annual report detailing a breakdown
of student budgets for the academic year based on information received
by their member institutions. According to their 2016 report, the U.S. av-
erage annual undergraduate student budget for books and supplies falls
between $1,200 and $1,400.4 The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada
(n.d.) recommends that students should budget between $800 and $1,000
per year for textbooks and other course materials. However, according to
the National Association of College Stores (NACS) (2016), average stu-
dent spending on course materials is $602, which represents a 14 percent
decrease since 2007. This discrepancy is problematic as it indicates stu-
dents are not purchasing the materials they are expected to. While one
could conclude that students are finding cheaper ways to access their re-
quired materials, studies lead us to believe otherwise. A survey of 22,000
Florida students conducted by Florida Virtual Campus (2016) found that
high textbook prices have a negative impact on academic behavior. Two
thirds of students did not purchase the required textbook, more than one

third earned a poor grade as a result of not purchasing the textbook, and
nearly one fifth failed a course as a result of not having access to the
textbook. The same survey also showed that nearly half of students took
fewer courses due to textbook costs while over one-in-four had dropped a
course because of the associated textbook costs. The results of this survey
are alarming, as they indicate that cost barriers are forcing students into
making decisions that have negative impacts on their academic success.

Textbook Affordability--Issues and Solutions

Market Changes
It is important to understand how the textbook market operates to gain an
understanding of why textbook costs have spiraled out of control. Unlike
other markets where a product is desired and consumers may select which
option they prefer, the textbook market is similar to the prescription drug
market. Much like the relationship between a doctor and their patient,
students are obliged to purchase the specific textbook(s) assigned by their
instructor; regardless of how widespread the alternatives may be, students
are expected to use a certain edition of the material. The burden on con-
sumers is compounded by the fact that there are five major publishers
that hold nearly 90 percent of the market; together they have the ability
to regulate the price point at which textbooks are sold (Koch, 2013). Data
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has shown that textbook
prices rose at over three times the rate of inflation from January 1977 to
June 2015--a 1,041 percent increase (Popken, 2015). Publishers are effec-
tively abusing the market and as a result, students are being priced out.

    Another reason for escalating costs is the periodic release of new edi-
tions. Publishers have relied on producing newer editions to reduce the
reuse of a specific text and effectively eliminate the resale market. With pub-
lisher representatives leading with the newest versions of materials when
approaching faculty, these revised editions are typically the ones sought. In
a discipline like mathematics where the content does not change frequently,
it begs the question of how different the content between the two editions
really is, as updated images and tables should not be justification for signif-
icantly increasing the cost of a resource. Additionally, for a faculty member
faced with both time and resource constraints, a publisher's offer of a text-
book coupled with lecture slides and test banks is incredibly compelling.
20  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    The bundling of learning resources is yet another tactic used by pub-
lishers to increase costs. New textbooks are often accompanied with an
assortment of additional digital resources including study guides, home-
work assignments, and quizzes. These resources can be "unlocked" by
students using an access code included in their textbook bundle. Instruc-
tors may recommend that students use these resources as supplemental
learning materials, or assign their students online homework assign-
ments and quizzes that contribute to their final grades. The inclusion of
these online resources is used as justification for inflating prices, regard-
less of whether they are used by the student or not. Like many software
licenses, these codes are tied to a single user and therefore have no resale
value. Students purchasing used textbooks are obligated to purchase a
new access code from the publisher to access the digital content, thereby
negating much of the cost savings normally associated with purchasing
used copies.

Going Digital
As student spending on textbooks has decreased, publishers have felt the
hit directly. In 2014, Brian Kibb, president of McGraw-Hill stunned many
when he said, "Textbooks are dead. They're dinosaurs" (Smith, 2014). In
2016 the world's largest education publisher, Pearson, garnered a pre-
tax loss of £2.6 billion (US$3.3 billion), primarily due to the collapse of
their U.S. higher education business (Sweney, 2017). With a decline in
print textbook sales--which is consistent with the NACS finding--there
has been a major push from publishers to expand their digital offerings.
Electronic versions of textbooks (eTextbooks) can be sold at a cheaper
price point as this online delivery model allows publishers to save signif-
icant amounts of money on printing and distribution. The rental market
for eTextbooks is another option put forward by publishers in an attempt
to increase sales to students. Students are offered access to materials at a
recognizably lower price; however, the catch is that students only have ac-
cess to that resource for a limited period of time--usually the duration of
the semester--eliminating any opportunity for retention while simultane-
ously eliminating contributions to the used textbook market.

    Another popular approach has been through automatic purchasing
programs that publishers are marketing as "Digital Direct" or "Inclusive
Stakes and Stakeholders  21

Access" (Straumsheim, 2017).5 In these automatic purchasing programs,
every student pays a mandatory course materials fee lower than the cost
of a new hardbound version of the same text. While publishers collect
less revenue per student, a consistent revenue stream is guaranteed for
the duration of time outlined in the contract signed between the publisher
and institution. The fee is charged directly to a student's account, and
an electronic version of the textbook and any supplementary materials is
made available on a digital delivery platform. Depending on the contract,
students may have the option to opt out, but the terms often used are re-
strictive and aimed at minimizing these numbers.6 In other cases, students
are charged directly regardless of their consent. This model holds numer-
ous similarities to the access codes mentioned previously and hold the
same concerns from both a 5Rs,7 and a copyright and usage data perspec-
tive. Under these models, students are restricted from exercising the 5R
permissions and it is also unclear who owns the copyright to the content
created within the platform. While the student should retain ownership
over the works they create, copyright may ultimately fall to the publisher.
Further concerns surround publishers' unfettered access to tracking stu-
dent usage data on their platforms. While publishers may argue that this
data will help build stronger platforms, this data could also be used to jus-
tify changes to the offerings that may hurt students.

    The promise of more affordable textbooks and greater access may
appeal to a higher education audience concerned about students lacking
access to the resources necessary for academic success. But while digital
content is currently being offered at a lower price point than print ver-

6 In the United States, federal law stipulates that students must have the
ability to opt out of such programs, however no such stipulations exist in
Canada. Algonquin College, the first Canadian institution to pilot the
eTexts model, does not allow students to opt out:

sions, publishers have been clear in their intent to transition towards
digital;8 and without the print textbook market helping with price reg-
ulation, the digital market would only be in competition with itself. As
academic librarians have experienced the escalation of prices in the sub-
scription journal market,9 it could be assumed the same would happen in
a textbook market dominated by a few major publishers.

    While automatic purchasing programs may be one solution toward
textbook affordability, open educational resources (OER) are freely avail-
able learning materials that have proven to be effective in serving stu-
dents. Hilton (2016) explored the results of nine studies that examined the
impact of OER on student learning outcomes in higher education settings.
Across the studies, only one showed that the use of OER was connected
with lower learning outcomes in more instances than it was with positive
outcomes, and another showed that the majority of the classes analyzed
had non-significant differences. Though these freely available materials
that can be used, adapted, and shared to better serve all students exist in
the marketplace, their use and adoption are not guaranteed. The interven-
tion of larger government and civil society organizations may be necessary
to shape market trends in favor of students.

The Role of Government
Affordability issues in higher education have not gone unnoticed by the
federal and state governments in the U.S. A growing number of gov-
ernment initiatives have encouraged and promoted the growth of OER
as a means to curb textbook prices while also ensuring access to high-
quality educational content. The 113th (2013-2014) and 114th Congress
(2015-2016) introduced the Affordable College Textbook Act in an effort

8 Pearson's chief executive, John Fallon, was quoted saying "Education
like every other sector and sphere of life is going through this digital
transformation. There is going to be a big winner in the transformation
in education. We are absolutely determined to make Pearson that win-
ner." https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/24/education-
publisher-pearson-loss-us-penguin-random-house
9 The prices for many journal and database subscriptions has also been
rising beyond the rate of inflation. Library Journal
(http://www.libraryjournal.com/) publishes an annual Periodicals Price
Survey that explores how the rising costs of periodicals impacts library
budgets.

"to expand the use of open textbooks in order to achieve savings for stu-
dents" (H.R.3721, 2015-2016). Language in the Act calls for new grant
funding to support the creation of OER, especially for use in large-en-
rollment courses that have high textbook costs. It would also require
that textbook publishers unbundle educational materials students are re-
quired to purchase (e.g. textbooks, lab manuals, online access codes) to
help facilitate cost savings. The bill did not advance in the 113th and
114th Congress, but was reintroduced in the 115th Congress (H.R. 3840,
2017-2019) with hopes that it could reinvigorate discussion on these im-
portant issues.10

    State legislation and initiatives addressing similar issues have been
passed, including:

· Oregon House Bills 2871 (2015) and 2729 (2017), which provided
    "legislative investment" in addressing textbook affordability by creat-
    ing a grant program for OER development, standardizing interinstitu-
    tional evaluation of student savings that resulted from OER, and for-
    malizing collaborations between the stakeholders (e.g., faculty, staff,
    librarians, etc.) across Oregon (Oregon.gov, n.d.).

· Executive Order 2015-01K, signed by Ohio Governor John Kasich
    in 2015, established the Ohio Task Force on Affordability and Effi-
    ciency in Higher Education, which was charged with making recom-
    mendations on the ways that "state-sponsored institutions of higher
    education ... can be more efficient, offering an education of equal or
    higher quality while at the same time decreasing their costs" (Ohio-
    HigherEd.org, n.d.).

· SHB 6117, passed by the Connecticut Legislature in 2015, which
    charged the Board of Regents for Higher Education and the University
    of Connecticut to develop a pilot program for the development and
    promotion of open-source textbooks. It also established a task force
    charged with identifying ways to incentivize the creation and adoption
    of OER "that will significantly reduce the cost to students of course
    materials, including, but not limited to, offering financial or academic

    or professional credit to faculty to create open educational resources"
    (SHB 6117, 2015).

These Bills have been seen by many campus stakeholders as a step in the
right direction to address textbook affordability issues. Because these gov-
ernment initiatives may not provide all of the funding needed to successfully
pursue these goals, support has also been sought from the private sector.

Foundational Support
Foundations have played a key role in supporting the creation, adoption
and adaptation of OER. Since 2001, the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation has donated over $170 million to support the development
and expansion of the open movement (Jhangiani & Biswas-Diener,
2017). With a specific emphasis on OER, the Hewlett Foundation has
played a crucial role in backing early initiatives such as MIT Open-
CourseWare, the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management
in Education (ISKME) (http://www.iskme.org/), OER Commons
(https://www.oercommons.org/), and supported the development of
Creative Commons (CC). Other foundations that have provided financial
support for the development and promotion of OER include (but are
not limited to) the Laura and John Arnold Foundation
(http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/), the Shuttleworth Foundation
(https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/), and the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (https://www.gatesfoundation.org/).

    Funding provided by these organizations has gone beyond supporting
the creation of OER to include financial support for organizations and
their projects such as the Open Textbook Network
(http://research.cehd.umn.edu/otn/), Achieving the Dream's OER De-
gree Initiative (http://achievingthedream.org/resources/initiatives/
open-educational-resources-oer-degree-initiative), and the Scholarly
Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition's (SPARC) Open Education
program (https://sparcopen.org/open-education/). Collectively, these or-
ganizations provide a variety of valuable services to the community, in-
cluding education, leadership development, community-building, policy
work, and large-scale OER adoption.

Grassroots Action by Users

On campuses across the U.S. and Canada, student groups have been in-
spired to take action and advocate for OER. The U.S.-based Student Public
Interest Research Groups (PIRG) (http://www.studentpirgs.org/)
sparked the textbook affordability conversation back in 2003 and started
advocating for open textbooks in 2008. Through the utilization of their
grassroots organizing network and campus chapters, the Student PIRG
has coordinated a number of successful education and advocacy campaigns
surrounding open textbooks. At U.S. universities, student groups have
organized educational events on OER and have been the driving force
behind the creation of multiple OER grant programs.11 Students at Cana-

dian universities have played key roles in influencing institutional OER
commitments, including the creation of an OER grant program,12 the es-
tablishment of a university-wide OER network,13 and the recognition of
OER contributions in faculty tenure and promotion.14 Student leaders

have recognized that their peers cannot learn from textbooks that they
cannot afford, and have therefore been advocating for greater adoption of
OER that are high quality, well aligned with the content they are evalu-
ated on, and are accessible at low or no cost.

    Other members of the higher educational community, including fac-
ulty, librarians, and administrators, have also worked to raise awareness
on textbook affordability issues and the use of OER.15 Faculty and early

career academics have been critical in producing OER research through

their involvement in OER fellowship programs.16, 17 Their research has
ranged from assessing OER perception and efficacy to sustainability and
student success. Librarians often provide guidance and support to faculty
looking to learn about, find, and integrate OER into their classrooms.18
Administrators have provided financial support to develop grant pro-
grams that support faculty in replacing their commercial textbooks with
OER and in championing OER degree programs at their institutions.19

    While many steps still need to be taken in raising OER awareness,
grassroots action led by students, librarians, faculty, and campus adminis-
trators have laid a strong foundation to build upon.

OER Repositories and Open Textbook Libraries
OER are only useful if they can be found by those looking to use them.
Over the years, various repositories that boast diverse collections of learn-
ing materials have been developed to allow for the collection and curation
of OER and to help facilitate their ease of discovery by faculty. One of the
largest of these OER repositories is the Multimedia Educational Resource
for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) (https://www.merlot.org/
merlot/index.htm), a California State University program dating back to
1997. The MERLOT collection comprises over 40,000 OER spanning
over 22 different material types.20 Ranging in both size and scope, MER-
LOT includes everything from entire online courses to a single animation.
OER Commons--a project of ISKME--is another large repository that
consists of a digital public library and collaboration platform. Built with
the intent to assist knowledge management and educational innovation,

academics to produce research on OER. More information on the pro-

one-on-one consultations, and informational websites.

OER Commons offers a comprehensive infrastructure for curriculum ex-
perts and instructors at all educational levels, though especially those
teaching K-12, to identify high-quality OER and collaborate around their
adaptation, evaluation, and use.

    Open textbook libraries, on the other hand, host an array of ready-
to-adopt resources that can be seamlessly used in place of a traditional
textbook. There are multiple OER repositories and open textbook li-
braries that boast diverse collections of learning materials. Arguably the
most recognized materials come from OpenStax (https://openstax.org/),
a nonprofit open textbook publisher based out of Rice University. Open-
Stax began as Connexions--a platform that provides authors and scholars
with an open space where they can share and freely adapt educational ma-
terials such as courses, books, and reports. Now known as OpenStax CNX,
this platform has developed into a dynamic nonprofit digital ecosystem,
serving millions of users per month in the delivery of educational con-
tent to improve learning outcomes. The platform hosts tens of thousands
of learning objects in a host of disciplines. Meanwhile, OpenStax has de-
veloped 27 peer-reviewed open textbooks for the most-attended college
courses and several AP courses. Since 2012, OpenStax has saved nearly
3.5 million students an estimated $340 million and is on track to meet or
beat its goal of saving students $500 million by 2020 (OpenStax, 2017).
They've also started developing their own research-based learning tech-
nology, OpenStax Tutor.

    The University of Minnesota Open Textbook Library
(https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/), the BCcampus Open Textbook
Project (https://open.bccampus.ca/find-open-textbooks/), Lumen
Learning's Catalog (https://courses.lumenlearning.com/catalog/lumen),
and eCampus Ontario's Open Textbook Project
(https://openlibrary.ecampusontario.ca/find-open-textbooks/) are other
well-known open textbook libraries hosting hundreds of open textbooks
that can be integrated into instruction. The majority of materials from
these collections have been peer-reviewed and are already in use at nu-
merous higher education institutions.

Perspectives on the Current State of OER
The OER movement has been shaped by the evolving higher education
28  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

landscape, including textbook market changes, governmental directives,
foundational support, and grassroots advocacy efforts. These factors also
influence the current state of the movement, which can be interpreted
from the perspective of various users, including librarians, faculty, stu-
dents, and administrators.

Librarian Perspectives on OER
Key action areas identified by the American Library Association (ALA)
(American Library Association, n.d.) include (but are not limited to):

· Education and lifelong learning;
· Equitable access to information;
· Intellectual freedom; and
· Literacy.

It should therefore come as no surprise that librarians have emerged as
key leaders in the OER movement, as many of the defining characteristics
of OER directly address these action areas. The retention of OER allows
a user the ability to utilize the material in the present, but also reference
it in the future, making OER a tool to support lifelong learning. Because
OER are made freely available to the public, they help promote equitable
access to information: cost no longer acts as a barrier. Being able to revise
and customize an OER resource to address specific learning needs helps
support intellectual freedom and literacy.

    Academic librarians have taken on a large role in promoting OER to
faculty and students on their campuses. Examples of these efforts include
but are not limited to:

· Providing workshops and other educational activities that help raise
    awareness of OER.

· Creating and maintaining websites that include information about
    OER and links to OER repositories and libraries.

· Helping to coordinate and administer grant programs that promote
    the integration of OER into class instruction.

· Providing faculty and students with assistance in finding quality re-
    sources such as magazine and newspaper articles, scholarly publica-
    tions, and video recordings that supplement OER.
Stakes and Stakeholders  29

Some academic libraries have created OER Librarian positions that focus
on promoting the creation, use, and adoption of OER on their campuses.
However, these responsibilities often fall on librarians who are also teach-
ing, providing reference services, or working in other library depart-
ments, who need to balance these new responsibilities with their current
job duties. At some small institutions with few librarians on staff, this
can be especially challenging. However, this challenge provides an oppor-
tunity for librarians to partner with other groups on campus to provide
information about OER to faculty and students. Libraries often house
writing and tutoring centers or liaise with other academic departments,
providing research guidance and support to faculty and bibliographic in-
struction sessions for students. Librarians can utilize their relationships
with these groups to help promote OER to their campus community, and
are also well situated on campus to coordinate group efforts aimed at sup-
porting teaching and learning.

Faculty Perspectives on OER
When it comes to OER adoption, faculty awareness is critical. According
to a 2016 study conducted by the members of the Babson Survey Research
Group, when faculty members were asked to self-report their level of
awareness of OER, a majority (58%) said that they were generally unaware
of OER, while only a quarter (26%) of respondents identified themselves
as being aware or very aware (Allen et al. 2016). This is comparable to
the 2015 results, where the number of faculty reporting no awareness
was two thirds (66%) of respondents, while those who identified as being
aware or very aware sat at one fifth (20%) (Allen et al. 2014). Therefore,
there has been an increase in awareness. The 2016 study also asked about
faculty members' awareness of open textbooks. The results showed that
34 percent of faculty claimed some level of awareness of open textbooks,
while 15 percent of faculty reported that they were only somewhat aware,
and nearly two thirds of faculty (66%) reported that they were generally
unaware of open textbooks (Allen et al. 2016). Increased discoverability
may prove useful as people become more aware of OER, but some positive
developments have already been found in high-impact courses. Open text-
book publishers like OpenStax and BCcampus have built collections aimed
at achieving the highest return on investment and as such, these ready-
30  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

to-adopt resources continue to gain traction across high-enrollment first-
and second-year courses.

    In a 2013 study in which researchers examined student and instructor
perceptions of open textbook adoption at eight post-secondary institu-
tions in the U.S., Bliss et al. found that 90 percent of instructors indicated
that their students were equally (60%) or more prepared (30%), compared
to students taught in previous semesters. This may be due to the fact
that OER are available at no cost to the student and can be accessed im-
mediately. Another possible reason is that the material has been better
curated to meet their learning needs. The same study also found that of
the 490 students surveyed, 90 percent indicated that the open textbooks
used in their courses were of the same quality as traditional materials
(50%) or better (40%). Interested in observing whether or not student per-
ception, use, and impact of open textbooks was similar in the Canadian
context, Jhangiani and Jhangiani (2017) surveyed 320 post-secondary stu-
dents enrolled in courses that used an open textbook. Their study found
that 63 percent of students judged the open textbook to be above average
(36%) or excellent (27%), while an additional 33 percent of students found
it average. Less than 4 percent of students surveyed indicated that the
open textbook was below average. In recognition of the fact that the over-
whelming majority of students were satisfied with the quality of their
open textbooks, and that each of these students were able to save money
that would have otherwise been spent on course materials, it should come
as no surprise that students are increasingly drawn to the promise of OER.

    One area of interest for faculty exploring the teaching and learning
opportunities associated with OER is open pedagogy. Conversation sur-
rounding open pedagogy (as understood in this context) began with a blog
post21 written by David Wiley in 2013. In this post he wrote about open
pedagogy and his distaste for the "disposable assignment".22 Looking for

21 This post covers the basic concepts of the open pedagogy movement:
https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975
22 A "disposable assignment" can be understood as a closed homework
process in which the content created is only viewed by a student author
and faculty grader. Wiley argues that these types of assignments "suck
value out of the world". More information is available here:
https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975
Stakes and Stakeholders  31

an alternative approach to assigning coursework which incorporated his
desire to have students' assignments add value to the world, Wiley pro-
posed examples of open pedagogy. While open pedagogy lacks a universal
definition, DeRosa et al. (2017) understand the term as "a site of praxis,
a place where theories about learning, teaching, technology and social
justice enter into a conversation with each other and inform the develop-
ment of educational practices and structures". The application of the term
`open' as understood in `open licenses' has given way to a dynamic and in-
novative approach to teaching and learning. Leaders in this space such as
DeRosa and Robinson (2015) stress the value of having students interact-
ing with OER as part of course instruction:

    If we think of OER as just free digital stuff, as product, we can surely
lower costs for students; we might even help them pass more courses be-
cause they will have reliable, free access to their learning materials. But we
largely miss out on the opportunity to empower our students, to help them
see content as something they can curate and create, and to help them see
themselves as contributing members to the public marketplace of ideas. Es-
sentially, this is a move from thinking about [OER] as finished products to
thinking about them as dynamic components of our pedagogical processes.
When we think about OER as something we do rather than something we
find/adopt/acquire, we begin to tap its full potential for learning.

    With new programming23 and resources24 to explore digital pedagogy
being developed and a greater number of educators understanding the
broad ranging benefits of open pedagogy, including the learning benefits
for students, knowledge reception and creation is venturing down an ex-
citing path.

Student Perspectives on OER
Students may find cost savings and immediate access to be obvious benefits
of OER. According to Jhangiani and Jhangiani (2017), when students were
asked to rate the importance of the features of their open textbook, 68 per-

23 The Digital Pedagogy Lab hosted two Digital Pedagogy Labs in 2017.

24 The Rebus Community has produced a new resource exploring how to
make open textbooks with students available here:
https://press.rebus.community/makingopentextbookswithstudents/
32  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

cent rated cost savings as being very important (30%) or absolutely essential
(38%), while nearly 70 percent indicated that immediate access was very
important (36%) or absolutely essential (34%). Students face a number of
barriers to accessing a quality education and with OER, textbook costs are
not one of them. The prospect of textbook costs no longer contributing
to rising student debt is incredibly compelling, especially considering that
the average U.S. class of 2016 graduate finished their degree with a debt
of $37,172 (U.S. Student Loan Debt Statistics for 2017, 2017). Beyond cost
savings, students are also able to retain these materials forever. Whether
students can benefit from using a specific text for multiple courses
throughout their education or are interested in referring to a text far into
the future, OER grant students this flexibility.

Administrator Perspectives on OER
Recognizing that many colleges and universities are under immense pres-
sure to maintain their enrollment numbers amidst declining state funding,
rising criticism, and stiff competition, administrators at a handful of in-
stitutions have begun to recognize OER as a means to their desired ends.
When it comes to the learning materials being used in the classroom,
all stakeholders, especially institutional administrators, want the resources
used by teachers and students to meet their needs. A 2015 study conducted
by Fischer, Hilton, Robinson, and Wiley analyzed whether the adoption
of digital open textbooks significantly predicted students' completion of
courses, class achievement, and enrollment intensity during and after se-
mesters in which OER were used. When analyzing course grades, the study
found that students using OER did the same or better when compared to
those using traditional materials. The same study also found that students
in courses using OER enrolled in a significantly higher number of credits in
the next semester, meaning that OER propelled students closer to gradua-
tion. From the perspective of an administrator concerned with enrollment
and graduation rates, the value of greater OER adoption is clear.

Challenges and Opportunities

Challenges
While the challenge of the publishing industry has already been addressed,
there are other practical barriers limiting the widespread adoption of OER
Stakes and Stakeholders  33

including their creation, adaptation, and adoption. These challenges span
both those within and beyond the institution.

    OER Development and Maintenance. Creating an OER is a time-

intensive undertaking. Knowledgeable and reputable authors must be
identified, and be available to commit to the development of an OER.
Some OER are developed by groups, including classes, programs, and pro-
fessional organizations. This option may help facilitate the speed with
which an OER is created, but requires greater oversight in quality control.
While OER are marketed as being free of cost to the consumer, it is im-
portant to recognize that there are costs associated with their creation.
These costs can include but are not limited to honoraria for authors, "buy-
outs" of faculty time for writing and compiling OER, and accessing plat-
forms. To date, OER creation has primarily been funded by private foun-
dations and government agencies. However, there is no guarantee that
this funding will continue in perpetuity. Like any textbook or learning re-
source, OER must be updated on a regular basis to ensure its relevance. If
sustainability is not considered during the creation of the resource, it may
become outdated. Fortunately, because of the open license applied to the
work, the work's revision and therefore future relevance is not solely re-
liant on the initial creator.

    Adoption of OER Resources. In addition to the faculty awareness

issues covered previously, the actual adoption of OER can also pose chal-
lenges. Bliss, Hilton, Wiley, and Thanos (2013) found that the time spent
by an instructor using the material for the first time is one cost often
not calculated into the use of open textbooks. Their report indicated that
82 percent of surveyed faculty spent somewhat more or much more time
preparing to teach in that semester compared to others. This is a finding
worth noting, as adopting an OER may not be as easy as selecting a tra-
ditional textbook bundled with ancillary materials. While open textbook
publishers are working to proactively address this issue, not all open text-
books have easily identifiable ancillaries.

    Access to Digital OER. As most OER are digital, a device and a stable

internet connection are required to access them. However, there is a dis-
parity in North America among those who have access to the technology
and infrastructure needed to access the internet and those who do not.
Often referred to as the "digital divide," many factors can impact who is
34  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

able to access the internet in the U.S., including income,25 race,26 and
geographical location.27 Challenges associated with the digital divide are
not unique to the United States. According to a 2016 report published
by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
(CRTC), there is a disparity in the speed of service offered in rural and ur-
ban environments, and "urban households generally [pay] lower Internet
service prices and [have] a greater number of Internet service providers
to choose from than rural households" (Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission, 2016). OER that are highly functional
in print format, such as OpenStax materials, provide a solution, but not a
fix, to these digital divide issues. However, providing access to OER mate-
rials could be used as an argument to help advocate for the resolutions of
the digital divide in North America.

    Accessibility Considerations. According to the World Bank (2017)

"one billion people, or 15% of the world's population, experience some
form of disability, and one-fifth of the estimated global total, or between
110 million and 190 million people, experience significant disabilities."
Those with visual, hearing, mobility, and learning disabilities can have
trouble accessing the internet in general. Even with tools and technology
that help facilitate internet access, if the resources they find online, includ-
ing OER, do not have accessible design components they may be unable
to use them. "Accessible design is a design process in which the needs of
people with disabilities are specifically considered" (Center for Universal

25 Those living in poverty often finding it difficult to pay for internet
services and the technology needed to access the internet. "Americans
with family incomes between $75,000 and $99,999 per year adopted the
Internet at an 83 percent rate, compared to 80 percent of those reporting
income between $50,000 and $74,999, and 70 percent of those in the
$25,000 to $49,999 range" (Carlson, 2016).
26 Carlson (2016), citing U.S. National Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration (NTIA) research, reports that "78 percent of
Whites nationally used the Internet in 2015, compared to 68 percent of
African Americans and 66 percent of Hispanics. In rural areas, 70 percent
of White Americans had adopted the Internet, compared to 59 percent of
African Americans and 61 percent of Hispanics."
27 According to research performed by NTIA, "in 2015, 69 percent of
rural residents [reported] using the Internet, versus 75 percent of urban
residents" (Carlson, 2016).
Stakes and Stakeholders  35

Design in Education, 2015). Common examples of accessible design in-
clude captioning videos and formatting text documents so that they can
be read by screen readers. Some creators have considered accessible design
practices when developing OER and, as a result, their works can be read-
ily utilized by those with visual, hearing, and learning disabilities. While
OER do not universally possess accessible design components, the open
license applied to the work allows for them to be revised to better serve all
students.

    Openwashing. With the increase in popularity of OER, openwash-
ing is a problem that is on the rise.28 Similar to the rise of greenwashing
as a response to the environmental movement,29 publishers and other ed-
ucation companies are moving forward with practices that appear or are
marketed as "open" or "OER" but fail to adhere to the free plus 5R permis-
sions we expect. These practices confuse people's understanding of open
and OER, and reinforce the need for the OER community to better com-
municate open.

Opportunities
While challenges persist, the OER community has done a terrific job
building the foundation necessary to support emerging projects and ini-
tiatives. Recognizing the massive success of the "Z-Degree" program at
Tidewater Community College, in 2016 Achieving the Dream announced
their OER Degree Initiative, which seeks to establish zero textbook cost
degree programs at 38 community colleges across 13 U.S. states over the
next three years. In the same year, the California Governor's office also
announced $5 million in funding to support Z-degrees within the state
and in 2017 BCcampus opened their call for proposals for Canada's first
"Zed Cred". With community colleges serving student populations from
lower income backgrounds, we can see firsthand how OER is being used
as a tool to address important issues of equity in education.

28 The term openwashing originates from a blog post written by Audrey
Watters. The post is available here: http://hackeducation.com/2015/01/

36  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Advances in the OER movement have not been restricted to the com-
munity college level. In 2017, New York Governor Cuomo announced
a commitment of $8 million to expand OER use at the City University
of New York and State University of New York systems.30 Supported
by organizations across the OER community, the impacts of New York's
leadership on OER will not be confined to state borders. Another 2017
announcement came from Lumen Learning and Follett, who announced
a partnership aimed at increasing faculty access to OER at over 1,200 U.S.
institutions.31

    Noticing the pace at which the OER community has grown, key
organizations have been collaboratively developing programming to re-
spond to the needs of the community. Creative Commons is developing
a professional development opportunity aimed at providing a thorough
CC education through their Certificate program
(https://certificates.creativecommons.org/). Offering four learning path-
ways including a specialized track for academic librarians, these open
courses are being built to be adaptable to any delivery mode. In an effort
to share and discover information about OER activities at campuses across
North America, SPARC has developed Connect OER
(https://connect.sparcopen.org). Through Connect OER, academic li-
braries can sign up to maintain a profile page about their institution's
efforts on OER, with the data used to populate a searchable directory and
annual report identifying best practices and highlight collective impact be-
ing achieved. Connect OER is aimed at supporting campus action, regard-
less of an institution's familiarity with OER. Yet another notable initiative
is the Peer Review Working Group (https://about.rebus.community/cat-
egory/working-groups/) led by the Rebus Community. Identifying the
need to establish a standardized process for reviewing open textbooks, Re-

bus has brought together stakeholders across the OER community to help
develop a collaborative and clear approach for open textbook review.

    Other opportunities for promoting and expanding the use of OER can
be found in increased education and advocacy efforts on campus. Provid-
ing forums for librarians, faculty, students, and administrators to discuss
textbook affordability issues can help in formulating individual and col-
lective action. Providing learning opportunities, including where to find
OER, and how they can enable innovative pedagogy, can also help in-
crease awareness and adoption of OER. Librarians, faculty, students, and
campus administrators should continue to work with members of state
and federal government to help pass legislation that promotes and funds
the creation of OER. Foundational partnerships can also continue to pro-
vide opportunities to advance OER issues and initiatives. The current
relationships the educational community has with funding organizations
like the Hewlett Foundation will hopefully serve as an inspiration to oth-
ers to help support the OER movement.

Conclusion
OER improves teaching and learning through practices enabled by con-
tent that is freely available to download, edit, and share. Stakeholders
ranging from the individual to institutional level have recognized the
tremendous potential of OER and have committed to a series of robust
policies and practices to increase their adoption, adaptation, and creation.
Although it is difficult to predict the future of the OER movement, there
are plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Much will depend on how the
OER community--including stakeholders from within higher education
institutions, government, and civil society organizations--respond to the
challenges and opportunities that present themselves. While stakeholders
from a range of different backgrounds have stepped up to the plate, aca-
demic librarians perhaps have the greatest potential to emerge as leaders
in this space. Supported by organizations like SPARC and the Open Text-
book Network, and informed by their experiences interacting with pub-
lishers, faculty, teaching and learning centers, and students, librarians are
in a strong position to help grow this movement. Combined with their
knowledge of digital rights management and copyright, the potential for
librarians to both lead and work alongside fellow impassioned stakehold-
38  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ers is undeniable. As OER are on a trend towards mainstream adoption
levels across first- and second-year courses in higher education,32 we are

beginning to see the degree to which OER can improve higher educa-

tion. With an expansive network of libraries, institutions, and civil society

organizations championing OER across the continent, together we can

ensure that the future of OER remains bright.

What Does the Research Say About OER?

John  Hilton  III

              W h a t D o e s t h e R e s e a r c h S a y A b o u t O E R ?

The high cost of textbooks is a substantial challenge in America's higher
education. A survey of 22,906 post-secondary students in Florida reported
that 67 percent of students went without a required textbook because of
high prices. Severe academic consequences are often a direct result of
limited access to the necessary resources; this same study noted that defi-
ciency of learning materials caused 37.6 percent of students to earn a poor
grade, and 19.8 percent to fail a course. High textbook prices also lengthen
the time to graduation. Approximately half the students surveyed stated
that they take fewer courses because of the high cost of materials; more-
over, textbook prices cause one quarter of students to drop classes (Florida
Virtual Campus, 2016).

    While college students may be thought to be the only audience af-
fected by these high costs, expensive educational materials also affect
taxpayers. Some student loans costs, as well as money used to purchase
textbooks for public elementary and secondary schools, pull from the
pockets of taxpayers. Furthermore, high textbook costs can keep
schools from purchasing new materials, leaving many students learn-
ing from outdated books, and classrooms lacking a sufficient number
of textbooks.

    Open educational resources (OER) are one solution to the problem
of high textbook costs. The term "open educational resources" was devel-
oped in the 2002 UNESCO Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware
for Higher Education in Developing Countries. OER are educational re-
sources that are (1) freely available to all people, and (2) openly licensed in
such a way that authorize reuse, and in many instances, remix and redis-
tribution.
42  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Over the past 15 years, there has been extensive growth and de-
velopment of OER (Wiley, Bliss, & McEwen, 2014). A large variety of
OER have been generated, many of which are high quality and contain
sufficiently robust content to replace traditional textbooks. Creative Com-
mons licenses provide the required legal clearances to freely share, modify,
and reuse OER (Bissell, 2009; D'Antoni, 2009; Hewlett, 2013). Several
sources, such as the Minnesota Open Textbook Library (open.umn.edu/
opentextbooks/) provide links to and insightful reviews of open materials.
The utilization of OER is becoming more widespread. These resources
have been used in hundreds of colleges and universities internationally,
including Harvard University, Ohio State University, University of Illi-
nois (Urbana-Champaign), Purdue University, University of British Co-
lumbia, and the University of Calgary.1

    Despite the widespread belief that freely available educational mate-
rials must be less effective or of lower quality than expensive, published
materials, research demonstrates otherwise. Between 2002 and 2015 there
were only 16 efficacy and perceptions studies related to OER. Hilton
(2016) synthesized these 16 reports to investigate the usefulness and/or
perceptions of OER. Since that time, as of August 2017, 17 additional
peer-reviewed studies have been published regarding higher education
OER efficacy and/or perceptions. This illustrates a rapid rise in research
related to OER efficacy and perceptions, with more published studies in
the past two years than the previous 15. I next summarize the research
that has been done to date.

Research Between 2002 and 2015
Of the studies reviewed in Hilton (2016), nine investigated OER efficacy
and the relation of OER influence to learning outcomes, providing a
collective 46,149 student participants. Only one of these nine studies con-
veyed that the OER use was associated with lower learning outcomes at
a higher rate than with positive outcomes; however, even this study il-
lustrated that in general, OER use resulted in non-significant differences.

1 A list of colleges that have adopted open textbooks published by Rice
University is provided at https://openstax.org/adopters. Note that these
textbooks are only a small fraction of the total number of open textbooks
that are currently available.
What Does the Research Say About OER?  43

Three of the nine studies had results that significantly favored OER over
traditional textbooks, another three revealed no significant difference and
two did not discuss the statistical significance of their findings.

    Hilton (2016) investigates the opinions of 4,510 students and faculty
members surveyed across nine studies regarding perceptions of OER. Not
once did students or faculty state that OER were less likely than commercial
textbooks to aid student learning. Overall, roughly half of students and faculty
noted OER to be analogous to traditional resources, a sizeable minority con-
sidered them to be superior, and a smaller minority found them to be inferior.

Efficacy Research Between 2015 and 2017
In addition to the research just summarized, there were eight OER efficacy
studies published between late 2015 and August 2017, containing a total
of 108,809 students. The number of participants, in some respects, is de-
ceptively large, as some of the studies (e.g., Hilton, Fischer, Wiley, and
Williams, 2016; Wiley, Williams, DeMarte, and Hilton, 2016) contained
large student populations but only a small portion of students in these
studies used OER. Regardless, the overall results across these eight studies
imply that students do as well, or better, when utilizing OER.

    Wiley et al. (2016) observed that students at Tidewater Community
College (n=23,985) were less likely to drop courses when utilizing OER.
Although the difference was small (0.8%), it was statistically significant.
Similarly, Hilton et al. (2016), who reviewed two later semesters of OER
adoption at Tidewater Community College (n=45,237) found that when
considering drop, withdrawal, and passing rates, students who used OER
were 6 percent more likely to complete the class with credit than their
peers who did not use OER.

    Ozdemir and Hendricks (2017) examined 51 e-portfolios written by
faculty in the state of California about their use of open textbooks. For
the 55 percent of the 51 faculty who assessed the impact of adopting an
open textbook on student learning outcomes, all reported that the out-
comes remained the same or were enriched. Chiorescu (2017) studied
606 students at a university in Georgia across four semesters and noted
that students were either as or more likely to pass the class when OER
was used; furthermore, significantly fewer students withdrew when OER
were implemented.
44  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Croteau (2017) surveyed 24 separate data sets involving 3,847 college
students in Georgia and found no significant differences in student pass
rates, completion rates, or final exam scores before and after implement-
ing OER. Hendricks, Reinsberg, and Rieger (2017) found that students
in a physics course at the University of British Columbia (n=811) per-
formed equivalently well in terms of final exams scores and grade distribu-
tions whether they used OER or commercial textbooks. Grewe and Davis
(2017) studied 146 students who attended Northern Virginia Community
College. They found a moderate correlation between OER use and stu-
dent achievement. Winitzky-Stephens and Pickavance (2017) assessed a
large-scale OER adoption across 37 different courses in several different
general education subjects at Salt Lake Community College (n=34,126).
The multilevel models used by the authors revealed no significant differ-
ence between courses using OER and traditional textbooks for continuing
students, and a small benefit for new students.

Perceptions Research Between 2015 and 2017
There were 12 OER perceptions studies published between late 2015 and
August 2017, involving 2,160 students and faculty. Two of these studies
also included efficacy data, and thus were also included as efficacy studies
in the previous section.

    Five studies investigated faculty perceptions of OER. Ozdemir and
Hendricks' (2017) study of 51 e-portfolios written by faculty in the state
of California who used open textbooks found that a strong majority re-
ported that the quality of the open textbooks was as good or better than
that of traditional textbooks. Moreover, 40 of the 51 portfolios contained
data about students' attitudes towards the open textbooks; only 15 percent
of these e-portfolios reported any negative student comments. Pitt (2015)
surveyed 126 educators who utilized OER. Roughly two thirds reported
that using OER facilitated meeting diverse learners' needs and perceived
greater pupil satisfaction using OER. Jung, Bauer, and Heaps (2017) sur-
veyed faculty members who used OpenStax textbooks and found that
81 percent believed OpenStax textbooks are of the same or higher quality
as commercial textbooks. Fischer, Ernst, and Mason (2017) examined 416
online reviews of 121 open textbooks and observed that reviewers com-
monly gave open textbooks high ratings (a median of 4.5/5 overall rating).
What Does the Research Say About OER?  45

Delimont, Turtle, Bennett, Adhikari, and Lindshield (2016) surveyed 524
learners in 13 different courses at Kansas State University concerning
their use of OER, as well as 13 teachers. Students regarded the OER as
high quality and favored OER over purchasing textbooks. Of the 13 fac-
ulty members interviewed, 12 preferred teaching with OER.

    Furthermore, several studies directly questioned students how their
experience with OER compared with commercial textbooks. Hendricks,
Reinsberg, and Rieger (2017) considered survey answers from 143 students
who used OER in a physics course at the University of British Columbia
and noted that 93 percent of respondents reported their open textbook was
the same or better than textbooks in other courses. Similarly, Illowsky,
Hilton, Whiting, and Ackerman (2016) surveyed 325 students in California
who used two versions of an open statistics textbook. They found that
90 percent of students rated the OER as good or better than the textbooks
in their other courses. Jhangiani and Jhangiani (2017) surveyed 320 college
students in British Columbia registered in courses with an open textbook.
These students positively rated open textbooks, with 96 percent of survey
participants stating that they were at or above average. Cooney (2017)
studied 67 individuals enrolled in health courses at New York City College
of Technology. She found that over 80 percent of 67 students surveyed
rated the OER as being better than a traditional textbook, with an ad-
ditional 16 percent saying it was similar quality. Coleman-Prisco (2017)
surveyed 16 students, five of whom were later interviewed regarding their
experiences with OER. She found that 25 percent of participants felt OER
were worse than traditional learning materials; 37.5 percent stated they
were equal, and 37.5 percent said they were better.

    Vojtech and Grissett (2017) explored a novel approach to student per-
ceptions by examining how students perceive hypothetical faculty mem-
bers who use open textbooks. They find that students rated faculty who
assign an open textbook to be kinder, as well as more encouraging and
creative. Although the study was intended to have open textbooks be the
only difference between the hypothetical professors that students rated,
only 14 percent students attributed their belief that the professor who
used OER was kinder, more creative, etc. to the prices of textbooks.

    Watson, Domizi, and Clouser (2017) surveyed 1,299 students at the
University of Georgia who used the OpenStax biology textbook (an open
46  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

textbook). These students were directly asked to "rate the quality of the
OpenStax textbook as compared to other textbooks they had used." The
majority of students (64%) reported that the OpenStax book had approx-
imately the same quality as traditional books and 22 percent said it had
higher quality. Only 14 percent of students who used the OpenStax book
deemed it to have a lower quality than traditional textbooks.

Research Between 2002 and 2017: A Summary
To date, a total of 17 peer-reviewed studies that examine the efficacy of
OER have been published; these studies involve 154,958 students. While
there certainly are limitations in individual studies, collectively, there is a
robust finding that utilizing OER in the classroom does not appear to de-
crease learning outcomes and saves considerable funds.

    In terms of perceptions, at the time of this writing, 21 peer-reviewed
studies of student and faculty perceptions of OER have been published.
These studies involve 7,969 students or faculty members. While people
may debate whether students are biased towards free books, or the extent
to which they are good judges of what constitutes quality, it is clear that
a strong majority of both faculty and students who have used OER prefer
them to commercial textbooks.

    Based on the increasingly extensive research on the efficacy and per-
ceptions of OER, policy makers and faculty may need to judiciously exam-
ine the rationale for obliging students to purchase commercial textbook
when excellent, free, openly licensed textbooks are an option. But signif-
icant questions remain. How can OER be more extensively utilized on
college campuses? To what extent should administrators encourage the
use of OER? What are the roles of libraries in increasing faculty aware-
ness of OER? Are there additional pedagogies that become available when
OER are the primary learning resources? As will be described in the fol-
lowing pages, these are important questions, and this book provides the
beginnings of some very meaningful answers.

               The Pedagogical Implications of OER

S e c t i o n 2 : T h e P e d a g o g i c a l I m p l i c a t i o n s o f O E R

Selection of course materials is one of the few ways in which faculty have
complete control over one of the costs of higher education. The role of
OER in reducing these costs cannot be understated. However, OER also
have the power to enable new forms of open pedagogy. Course materi-
als that are free from most copyright restrictions allow faculty to design
and implement innovative teaching methods which can engage students
in new and exciting ways. This section showcases the potential of open
pedagogy, and describes the role of the academic librarian within it.

    First, Amaral explores the complementary alignment of the OER
community and academic libraries. Through the lens of OER initiatives
supported by the City University of New York (CUNY) and implemented
at Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), Amaral describes
how an active and engaged culture can emerge when librarians set clear
goals and work collaboratively for the public good.

    In a similar vein, Reed talks about collaboration between scholarly
communication librarians and information literacy librarians in support
of OER initiatives, and underscores the importance of partnering with
colleges and departments in the development and use of OER and open
pedagogy.

    Reed and Turner share that there are experiential learning oppor-
tunities inherent in OER initiatives. Specifically, the authors describe a
student internship program focused on designing guidelines, criteria, and
standards for evaluating OER for accessibility for disabled students and
their use in the classroom.

    Decisions on the adoption of course materials into open resources can
be based on more than cost and accessibility. These decisions are often
50  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

complex and influenced by existing cultures, policies, and other consid-
erations. Walz explains an opportunity for open education advocates to
overcome these obstacles to create more transparent, deliberate practices
when evaluating and selecting required materials.

    Finally, through multiple examples of open pedagogical practice
across several disciplines, Jhangiani and Green explore how pedagogy, not
tools or texts, is at the heart of OER advocacy efforts. For these authors,
the resources and staff of an academic library provide the optimal locale to
cultivate an individual's pedagogical efforts.
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative
         Pedagogy: Growing an OER Community

Librarians as Community Leaders in Open Knowledge
Similar to the potential for open access initiatives to position librarians
as campus leaders, the open educational resources (OER) movement pro-
vides an ideal opportunity for librarians to lead in their communities.
OER and libraries reside at the convergence of academic affairs and stu-
dent affairs, faculty development and student learning. Leading OER
initiatives taps librarians' unique expertise in instructional design, copy-
right and licensing, collection development and management, and needs
assessment. As one of the few institutional entities serving both students
and faculty, libraries are perfectly positioned to lead our institutions'
OER programs, with the potential to establish or cement the library as
integral to student success initiatives and as an important partner in fac-
ulty and curriculum development.

    There are many high-visibility library-led programs at R1 universi-
ties and prestigious colleges (Salem, 2017) and a growing cadre of com-
munity college librarians doing this work (Community College Consor-
tium for Open Educational Resources, n.d.). At Borough of Manhattan
Community College (BMCC), our Open/Alternative Textbook Program
has received the attention of our president, as well as favorable press
within and without the college. Similar to OER initiatives at colleges na-
tionwide (Yano, 2017), the BMCC library is leading our community in
this effort.

The BMCC Community
The community that the BMCC library serves is both large and diverse.
BMCC is one of 24 colleges in the City University of New York (CUNY)
52  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

system and the largest of the system's seven community colleges, with
over 26,000 undergraduate students enrolled in fall 2016. We are a ma-
jority minority college, with students self-identifying as Asian (15%),
Black (31%), Hispanic (41%), and White (13%). As well, 54 percent self-
identify as first-generation college students; many are immigrants, and
some are undocumented (CUNY Office of Institutional Research and As-
sessment, 2017).

    The college is located in lower Manhattan, three blocks from the
World Trade Center and not far from Wall Street. While BMCC is part
of Tribeca, one of the most affluent Manhattan neighborhoods minutes
away from the seat of unimaginable wealth, in contrast our students
mainly come from low socioeconomic status households throughout all
five New York City boroughs: 65 percent have an annual household
income of less than $25,000, and 83 percent less than $40,000; approx-
imately 65 percent are eligible for Pell grants, a federal income-based
student aid, and just under 90 percent are eligible for Tuition Assistance
Program (TAP), New York's income-based aid (BMCC Office of Insti-
tutional Effectiveness and Analytics, 2017; CUNY Office of Institutional
Research and Assessment, 2017).

    But our students are not numbers. Each is a person facing their own
challenges, often making difficult decisions and balancing tough choices,
including sometimes, "If I buy my textbooks, will I have enough money
for groceries?" As might be expected, the BMCC community, along with
the larger CUNY community, is very concerned about and committed to
addressing textbook affordability. BMCC faculty make accommodations
in classrooms where many students have not purchased the textbook; ad-
ministrators create programs to address the effects of high-priced course
materials on retention and persistence among other barriers, and BMCC
librarians maintain textbook reserve programs. None of which gets to
the heart of the issue: high-priced textbooks, whether purchased by stu-
dents, the library, or the institution. Led by the library, the BMCC
community has come together, across academic affairs and student af-
fairs, across departments and disciplines, to pursue what we consider a
sounder, more sustainable solution with OER. At BMCC this solution
involves growing a strong, vibrant OER initiative focused on transfor-
mative pedagogy, equity, and student success.

Growing an OER Community

From the Top Down
Several events in the CUNY system contributed to a growing open culture
prior to BMCC launching an OER initiative. In 2013, CUNY established
a Textbook Savings Committee to explore avenues for lowering textbook
costs for students. In these initial discussions, OER was not the focus but
one of many options for reducing costs, as described by CUNY's Associ-
ate Vice Chancellor and Chief Information Officer in testimony before a
hearing of the New York City Council's Committee on Higher Education
in fall 2014 (New York City Council, 2014). The University had for sev-
eral years provided students with information through a textbook savings
flyer and website, which listed various options for reducing costs. The
Textbook Savings Committee also investigated and made recommenda-
tions for moving from brick and mortar bookstores to online bookstores
that offered reduced pricing models; four CUNY colleges have imple-
mented this since, with several others to follow even though students
have expressed dissatisfaction with the online option (Inderjeit, 2016) and
preference for a physical bookstore ("York reacts," 2017).

    While replacing one bookstore with another and more expensive
textbooks with less can reduce costs for students in the short term, more
helpful solutions seek zero cost to students; any cost for materials, even
low cost, can be a barrier to learning as evidenced by recent research on
food and housing insecurity for students across the country (Goldrick-
Rab, 2017). At the committee hearing, the Vice Chancellor for Budget and
Finance described CUNY's efforts to mitigate the impact of textbook costs
through financial assistance programs, including funding for library text-
book reserves through CUNY's Student Financial Assistance Initiative,
and student retention and success programs, such as Accelerated Stud-
ies in Associate Programs (ASAP), which provide students with textbook
vouchers (New York City Council, 2014).

    Also at the Committee on Higher Education hearing, CUNY's Dean
for Libraries and Information Services testified about the efforts by CUNY
Libraries which, similar to the financial assistance programs, focused on
eliminating textbook costs for students rather than merely reducing them.
CUNY Libraries oversaw the funding to procure textbooks for reserve,
54  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

purchasing over 30,000 textbooks in 2013-14 which were borrowed more
than 380,000 times (New York City Council, 2014). During the 2014-15
academic year, the CUNY Office of Library Services also offered an online
OER 101 course to faculty and librarians across the system.1 The first fac-
ulty cohort to participate received a $500 stipend, and the second $250;
librarians were not remunerated due to contractual constraints. Thirty
faculty, two of whom were from BMCC, and 13 librarians completed the
course.

    The administration's emphasis has been on reducing textbook costs,
while the libraries are committed to ensuring the primary option is to
provide no-cost materials. This focus on no-cost specifically includes text-
book reserves and OER, but we envision that within the next five to
ten years textbook reserves will be eliminated, or at least significantly re-
duced, as the use of OER for course materials continues to grow. More
generally, another important source of no-cost materials is the library's
digital collection, from articles to ebooks to streaming videos. No-cost
materials are better understood as no additional cost to students beyond
existing tuition and fees. To achieve no cost, BMCC has reallocated funds,
such as those used on reserve textbooks, investing them in resources and
materials that are available beyond an individual course to the community
as a whole (library subscriptions) and globally (OER).

From the Ground Up
While BMCC faculty were for the most part unaware of these CUNY-
wide efforts, there were concurrent activities shining light on textbook
affordability and open culture on our campus, including a textbook afford-
ability event co-sponsored and co-facilitated by the library and the New
York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) in fall 2014 and a fac-
ulty development day on OER and open access in spring 2015. The fall
event, entitled "Campus Conversation: Addressing Textbook Affordabil-
ity," drew about 40 students, faculty, and staff, providing participants the
space for a lively discussion exploring perspectives, frustrations, and pos-
sible solutions.

duction
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  55

    At this event, students quickly framed textbook affordability as a
social justice issue relating to access to education generally, not just to
textbooks. They also described the catch-22 of not being able to afford
books, doing poorly or perhaps failing courses, then having to repeat
courses at additional cost. Students wanted faculty to consider their strug-
gles when they were selecting course materials, avoiding options such as
bundled books and media or choosing every new edition that comes out.
Many students were concerned about the impact on their grades. And the
students told poignant stories about worrying that their instructors would
think they were less invested in their education when they weren't able
to purchase the textbooks, as well as the difficulty of admitting that they
didn't have the money to buy books.

    BMCC Public Affairs highlighted this event in its reporting of campus
activities, which provided a visible statement in support of students and
faculty looking to address textbook affordability and its impact on learn-
ing. It was clear from this event that there was fertile ground for continu-
ing the conversation within the community, especially among faculty who
hold the key to transitioning from expensive commercial textbooks to no-
cost options.

    The faculty development event the following spring, entitled "The
Power of Open: Unlocking Your Research and Course Materials for Max-
imum Impact," included presentations by librarians and faculty highlight-
ing the benefits and acknowledging the challenges of open, elucidated
through their own personal experiences. The presentations were followed
by robust group discussions and a Q&A which surfaced faculty concerns,
as well as enthusiasm for growing an open culture on campus. The library
built on this momentum with an OER presentation at BMCC's spring
2015 Technology Day. These efforts and events at both CUNY and BMCC
were the foundation on which we built our Open/Alternative Textbook
Program, beginning with a proposal for a pilot presented to the Provost
and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs that was approved in fall
2014.

    Initiated and developed by the library, BMCC's Open/Alternative
Textbook pilot was launched with funding from the library's textbook
reserves budget, the use of which had been encouraged and supported
by CUNY's Dean for Libraries and Information Services. The pilot was
56  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

led by BMCC's open knowledge librarian in collaboration with the direc-
tor for the Center for Excellence in Teaching, Learning and Scholarship
(CETLS). Faculty were recruited through an application process in fall
2014, participated in training workshops in spring 2015, and piloted their
zero textbook cost courses the following semester. While the emphasis of
the program was on OER, the goal for the program was zero cost to stu-
dents, which faculty achieved using OER and alternative no-cost materials
available through the library and on the Web, or what is often called zero
textbook cost (ZTC).

    Faculty responded overwhelmingly positively to the pilot in an eval-
uation, with all of the respondents indicating they would recommend the
workshops to colleagues and most indicating they would redesign addi-
tional courses using OER. Given this evidence of the pilot's success with
faculty, BMCC's Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs
established the Open/Alternative Textbook Program with the continued
leadership of the library and CETLS. The program now receives $30,000/
academic year, which funds faculty stipends.

    At the end of spring 2017, 75 faculty from 15 of BMCC's 17 de-
partments had completed training workshops and redesigned at least one
section of one course (but often more sections and more courses) replac-
ing commercial textbooks with OER or alternative no-cost materials. As
of fall 2017, we estimate that students have saved approximately $1 mil-
lion. In questionnaire responses, faculty who completed the training de-
scribed feeling "happier," "excited," "energized," "confident," and "liber-
ated," among other positive characterizations, which they shared with
colleagues. Enthusiastic word-of-mouth promotion generated much in-
terest in the program, and faculty have been turned away each semester
as there are more applications than can be accommodated. As the com-
munity continues to grow, we know that we will eventually need to
successfully recruit faculty who are significantly skeptical of OER. When
we do, we have some confidence that the growing research evidence in
support of positive outcomes combined with their colleagues' often trans-
formative experiences will be convincing and compelling.

    The growth of OER at BMCC and CUNY is due in large part to these
simultaneous efforts occurring from the ground up and top down. At both
the city and state levels, Student PIRGs have been advocating for text-
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  57

book affordability (New York City Council, 2014; Senack & Donoghue,
2016; Senack, Donoghue, Grant, & Steen, 2016), and their efforts have
kept the issue in the forefront. At the same time as this grassroots advo-
cacy, CUNY's administration continued to be concerned with and address
unsustainable textbook costs through cost-reduction tactics. Similarly, at
BMCC from the ground up, faculty enthusiastically embraced OER, with
crucial program support from the administration and CUNY Office of Li-
brary Services. Local funding has since been complemented and exceeded
by the investment of foundations and New York State. These myriad
stakeholders working on the issue from both the ground up and top down
contribute significantly to our continuing success at BMCC, which has led
to the inclusion of the OER initiative as one of the strategies in BMCC's
college-wide retention and completion agenda under the category of im-
proving teaching and learning.

Key Community Partnerships
As BMCC's OER community grows, several key partnerships have been
and continue to be fostered. Foremost is the collaboration between the
library and CETLS. This synergistic partnership leverages the strengths
of each unit. At BMCC prior to the OER program, the library was not
well known for faculty development programs, while this is the main fo-
cus of CETLS. The OER program has been strengthened by the different
perspectives and expertise brought to the planning, implementation, and
ongoing improvement by the CETLS director and open knowledge librar-
ian. There is also a natural complement between OER and e-learning, and
we are exploring ways to cross-pollinate the training for each of these
programs. While other logical partners include instructional design and
user experience staff, BMCC does not currently have personnel in these
areas.

    We also believe there is fruitful potential in partnerships with cohort
programs aimed at student retention and success. We've begun conversa-
tions with ASAP, which provides students with substantial and targeted
academic, financial, and personal support. Currently, ASAP provides text-
book vouchers that do not always cover the entire cost of required mate-
rials; the vouchers are also costly and complicated to manage. OER has the
potential to provide a more sustainable and pedagogically innovative al-
58  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ternative. A second cohort program, the BMCC Learning Academy, does
not provide vouchers and needs incentives to attract students to the pro-
gram. If all of their cohort courses were ZTC, this could be used to recruit
and retain students.

    Partnerships with Student Affairs and Student Government Associa-
tion are also in their infancy. We know that advisors are instrumental in
educating students about ZTC courses, and at BMCC they fully support
the program, given that they are the front line for counseling students
who are considering dropping out of courses or who are doing poorly
because they haven't been able to access expensive course materials. Con-
tinually educating and updating staff and faculty about important initia-
tives is always a challenge at an institution the size of BMCC, so efforts
are ongoing and new strategies are always being considered. Every fall, we
also reach out to the incoming members of our Student Government As-
sociation encouraging their voice and advocacy for OER, especially with
faculty who have not yet embraced ZTC courses. Finally, we are partner-
ing with our Office of Institutional Effectiveness and Analytics (IEA) to
assess the impact of ZTC courses and the effectiveness of the Open/Al-
ternative Textbook Program. IEA will examine a number of indicators,
including drop-fail-withdraw (DFW) rates, persistence, and time to grad-
uation, among others. All of these partnerships are crucial to the success
of the program and to the success of our students.

Moving from Opportunistic to Systematic Growth
When we launched the Open/Alternative Textbook Program at BMCC,
we made a strategic decision to focus on zero textbook cost with an em-
phasis on OER. With 27,000 students, our community needs the largest
number of courses possible that do not require purchase of course materi-
als. We found that the most effective way to achieve this goal in terms of
recruiting faculty and redesigning courses was through using OER along
with other no-cost materials. While growing our OER community from
spring 2015 through spring 2017, we welcomed any faculty members who
expressed interest in redesigning their courses to achieve zero cost to stu-
dents. We chose not to focus on specific departments or courses in order
to promote as widespread adoption as possible and a campus culture of
open. Because of this opportunistic approach and because the number
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy           59

of ZTC courses is currently less than 20 percent of the total number of
courses, students may not be able to find a ZTC course that fulfills needed
requirements and fits their schedule. With our current program, it would
take 15 years to convert 75 percent of the approximately 450 courses of-
fered at BMCC.

    Beginning in summer 2016, two additional funding sources have fa-
cilitated a concurrent effort that moves us from course by course develop-
ment to a more systematic approach. The first opportunity to make this
shift came with BMCC's participation in Achieving the Dream's Open Ed-
ucational Resources (OER) Degree Initiative,2 which launched in summer
2016. This initiative has the ambitious and laudable goal of boosting "col-
lege access and completion, particularly for underserved students, by en-
gaging faculty in the redesign of courses and degree programs through the
replacement of proprietary textbooks with open educational resources.
Over the next three years, the Open Educational Resources Degree Initia-
tive will lay the groundwork for nationwide adoption of OER Degrees"
(Achieving the Dream, n.d.). Through spring 2019, Achieving the Dream
is working with 38 community colleges nationwide to create OER degrees
that can be adopted and adapted by other colleges across the country. The
initiative includes a research component that will assess the program's
goals to reduce student textbook costs and positively impact student suc-
cess.

    CUNY Office of Library Services took the lead on the proposal for
the Achieving the Dream grant, which includes two other CUNY cam-
puses, Hostos Community College and Bronx Community College, and is
coordinating efforts across the three campuses. BMCC is converting its
Criminal Justice Associate in Arts degree, Hostos its Early Childhood Ed-
ucation, and Bronx its General Education with a concentration in history.
The criminal justice degree program is BMCC's second largest after lib-
eral arts, with 2,865 students enrolled in fall 2016. There are 20 courses
required for the degree, six within the major. As of fall 2017, all six crim-
inal justice courses will include at least one OER section, with 24 sections
being offered across the six courses. The department plans to increase the

2 See: http://achievingthedream.org/resources/initiatives/open-
educational-resources-oer-degree-initiative
60  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

number of OER sections in each course in the following semesters. The
remaining 14 courses across several departments are in the works and
will all have OER sections offered by fall 2018. While we expect that the
majority of criminal justice course sections will be ZTC by 2020, giving
students the possibility of finding sections that fit their schedules, the goal
of adequate course sections for meaningful schedule choices will be much
more challenging to achieve with general education requirements, given
the large number of courses that fulfill these.

    Achieving the Dream has taken a holistic approach in working with
participants focusing on developing the capacity of the institution to im-
plement and sustain OER degrees. The participating colleges received a
framework for working across college units, including student affairs and
academic affairs, and with advisors and administrators, as well as faculty.
As an example, BMCC worked with our registrar and CUNY Office of Li-
brary Services to implement a zero textbook cost course designation that
allows students to search for these courses when registering.

    To ensure that the degrees created under this initiative can be adopted
seamlessly at other institutions, the participating colleges are required to
use only materials that carry a Creative Commons or other open license.
While similar degrees have been called zero textbook cost or Z-degrees in
the past, this is an important distinction as OER degrees do not use library
resources, which differ college to college, nor other no-cost materials on
the Web, such as YouTube videos, which usually do not adhere to the 5
Rs (retain, reuse, revise, remix and redistribute). Without being able to
retain a copy of this material, it may disappear at any time, as faculty are
well aware, rendering its use unstable.

    Given that our Open/Alternative Textbook Program provided a
foundation off which to build, we have experienced one unanticipated
challenge as we develop our OER degree. Because BMCC's efforts to
achieve zero textbook cost embraced OER and alternative no-cost mate-
rials, some BMCC faculty have been stretched by the requirement to use
solely OER. Our faculty have found that often there are texts and films
accessed through the library that achieve learning outcomes in ways not
matched by available OER. There are also quality, no-cost options on the
Web that are not OER, such as Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and
The Marshall Project, that faculty value and struggle to find adequate OER
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  61

replacements for. The faculty participating in the grant have embraced
this challenge and are creating OER courses, but some faculty have chosen
not to participate in the OER degree even though they are offering zero
textbook cost courses.

    As mentioned earlier, another challenge that has become clear as we
work to create the Criminal Justice OER degree is having enough sections
of OER courses to make it possible for most students to find sections that
fit into their schedules. Achieving the Dream's preliminary report on the
OER Degree Initiative identified a concern with this "thin line" pathway
of just a few sections of OER courses, which many participating colleges
are encountering (Griffiths et al., 2017). The key moving forward will be
to combine programs that develop Z-degrees with initiatives that support
the redesign with OER of all or the majority of sections for general educa-
tion courses.

    The Achieving the Dream OER Degree grant received by CUNY has
been the catalyst for additional funding from New York State, which is
making it possible for us to address this challenge of thin lines for OER
offerings within the degree and the need for more sections of general ed-
ucation courses. After strong advocacy by Student PIRGs for the past few
years and coverage of CUNY's involvement in the OER Degree Initiative,
the New York State Education Department contacted CUNY's Office of
Academic Affairs in spring 2017 to express interest in supporting OER
efforts on CUNY campuses. CUNY Academic Affairs together with the
Office of Library Services submitted a funding proposal in response to the
Education Department's enquiry. This led to New York State including
$4 million in funding for CUNY and another $4 million for the State Uni-
versity of New York (SUNY) in its budget for 2017-18. Before the State's
funding, about eight of the CUNY colleges had active OER programs; now
all 24 campuses have applied to CUNY Office of Library Services, who is
administering the funds, to begin or grow OER programs.

    As part of this initiative, approximately 100 BMCC faculty will re-
design 45 courses, 25 of which are in the top 30 in enrollment, using
OER and alternative materials. This funding begins to address the need
for more sections of general education courses in order to make OER de-
grees viable for most students. Some of the funds will also be used for
assessment, conducting similar studies to those that have examined stu-
62  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

dent success indicators in relation to OER (Feldstein et al., 2012; Fischer,
Hilton, Robinson, & Wiley, 2015; Hilton, Fischer, Wiley, & William,
2016; Ozdemir & Hendricks, 2017). While cost savings is a compelling ar-
gument for redesigning courses, for faculty who are hesitant the research
indicating positive impacts can be persuasive, as well as for administrators
who often focus on student success and retention as strategic priorities.

Moving from Cost Savings to Transformative Pedagogy
Most OER programs estimate what they have saved their students in ag-
gregate; at BMCC, we estimate that in the first four semesters of running
the Open/Alternative Textbook Program we saved students $1 million,
that a student who takes all 20 OER courses as part of the Criminal Justice
OER degree will save $2,500, and that the ZTC courses created under the
state funding will save students over $1.5 million each year. For individ-
ual students, savings vary depending on availability of zero textbook cost
courses that fit their schedule. When an Achieving the Dream represen-
tative visited our campus recently, we recruited a group of five students to
talk about their experiences with textbooks. They candidly responded to
a question about how textbook cost impacts their choice of classes, indi-
cating that it was minimal. For this group of students, the first criteria for
choosing a class was whether it fit their schedule, and the second was the
professor's rating on various websites. Sometimes, after considering those
two criteria, they might consider the cost of the textbook.

    These students were resourceful, and one reason they gave for cost
being a lower priority was the ability to take advantage of "free" sources,
some legal and some not, such as library textbook reserves, a friend's or
classmate's copy, and torrent or other document sharing sites. Of course,
there are no similar options when access codes for online publisher sites
are required. We also know that students may enroll in a class regardless
of textbook cost but end up dropping out because of those costs if they
cannot get consistent and reliable access to the text, among other negative
impacts (Florida Virtual Campus, 2016). In questionnaire responses,
BMCC students recognize the positive impact of OER on their learning.
Beyond cost savings, they note that immediate and 24/7 access through-
out the semester means they don't have an excuse not to do their work and
they are able to keep pace with coursework and complete assignments and
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  63

reading on time. While cost savings are important, it is the affordances of
OER and their positive impact on learning that we focus on in our Open/
Alternative Textbook Program.

    For participating in the program, faculty receive $1,000 stipends and
complete four two-and-a-half-hour workshops which provide the foun-
dation for redesigning their courses around open and alternative materi-
als. As might be expected, this redesign takes hours well beyond the train-
ing time allotted. Workshops are run seminar style, encouraging con-
versation and building a community of practice. They are also designed
with active learning, including group discussion of scenarios, think-pair-
share activities, and reflective exercises. In program evaluations, faculty
expressed appreciation for this cross-disciplinary, collegial model, as the
discussion-based format promotes connections across the departments.
With over 1,500 faculty at BMCC, participants often meet for the first
time, and conversations have sparked cross-department collaborations.
For example, during one of the workshops, a faculty member in English
and another in Speech, Communications and Theatre Arts discovered that
they had a shared interest in conflict resolution and non-violent activism
with both incorporating related material and lessons in their courses. The
two are planning to teach connected courses in a learning community, al-
lowing them to collaborate on resources and assignments. With few, but
increasing, opportunities to discuss pedagogy on campus, faculty relish
these conversations.

    The curriculum for the four workshops was designed to give faculty
a foundation for completing their course redesigns. In the first workshop,
faculty are introduced to learner-centered teaching through two articles,
one on creating a learner-centered syllabus (Fulmer, 2017) and the other
on backward design (Wiggins & McTighe, 2006). The syllabus article sit-
uates the conversation in learner-centered design, providing examples of
syllabus items before and after being rewritten with the learner in mind
and modeling learner-centered language that can be used when explaining
why the faculty chose to create a ZTC course. For backward design, par-
ticipants read an article describing and assessing the process applied to a
class session (Reynolds & Kearns, 2017). The authors provide a worksheet
that guides faculty through key backward design steps, including identi-
fying learning outcomes that will be addressed and the assessments of the
64  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

learning outcomes, then considering content and activities that will help
the students achieve the learning outcomes and be successful on the as-
sessments. This model provides participants with a process and structure
for thinking about, searching for, and finding appropriate OER for their
courses.

    Building on this learner-centered focus, the faculty also read articles
on culturally relevant and culturally sustaining pedagogy (Milner, 2011;
Paris, 2012). With the readings as prompts, faculty discuss how they cur-
rently enact culturally relevant and culturally sustaining pedagogy in their
classes, as well as brainstorming ideas for activities and assignments that
would frame the course from the first day or first week within this ped-
agogical space. The last pedagogical framework faculty explore is open
pedagogy; in groups, the faculty create assignments that engage students
as knowledge producers rather than just knowledge consumers, often
having the students adapt or create OER. It is during this initial session
that faculty first begin to see the pedagogical opportunities afforded by us-
ing open and other no-cost materials.

    The second workshop covers OER context and definitions, situating
faculty in the global open movement, and familiarizing them with the 5
Rs. Faculty are also given hands-on time to explore OER repositories and
sites. Because the program also includes using alternative no-cost materi-
als available through the library and on the Web, copyright and fair use
are also covered, with an emphasis on "reclaiming fair use" (Aufderheide
& Jaszi, 2011) which has the potential for broad application in higher ed-
ucation. Faculty are introduced to Columbia's fair use checklist, as well as
three questions recommended by Aufderheide and Jaszi focusing on trans-
formative purpose, appropriate amount, and reasonableness within field
or discipline. This second session also presents Creative Commons licens-
ing to participants.

    The third workshop addresses course and materials delivery, looking
at examples in the learning management system (LMS) and alternatives
including WordPress, Facebook, and LibGuides. Many BMCC faculty are
satisfied with the LMS, while recognizing and to some extent making
peace with its issues, while others find they are ready to move to a more
user-friendly online space, such as WordPress. After considering delivery
options, this session looks at creating OER, with examples from faculty
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  65

colleagues. Participants are encouraged to start small, thinking of mate-
rials they have already created, including assignments, lecture slides, and
handouts. Lastly, the participants discuss assessment. In the first semester
that faculty teach with OER, they are asked to administer a questionnaire
addressing students' experiences in the course and with OER. Participants
are encouraged to think about what they would like to explore and learn
about the experience of teaching OER, and to use the questionnaire or
other assessment to write an article within the scholarship of teaching and
learning.

    The last workshop focuses on the importance of community, both the
OER community of practice at BMCC, as well as the larger communities
within faculty disciplines and higher education in general. Listservs such as
that hosted by CCCOER (the Community College Consortium for Open
Educational Resources) and SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Acade-
mic Resources Coalition) are recommended to extend and expand the com-
munity of practice beyond BMCC and CUNY. On the listservs, faculty can
connect with others in their discipline as well as across disciplines, solicit
assistance, and contribute to the growing national community of practice.
Faculty also complete an assignment in which they upload an OER they
have created to CUNY's institutional repository, Academic Works, as well
as review OER in one of the repositories, such as MERLOT (the Multime-
dia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching). Concluding
the workshop series, faculty present whatever portion of the course rede-
sign they have completed, sharing the resources they found and how they
were using them in their courses. This sharing reinforces the community
of practice and provides the opportunity for participants to receive feed-
back and suggestions on their redesigned course.

    The focus on pedagogy in the BMCC Open/Alternative Textbook
Program has been an important contributing factor to its success. While
BMCC faculty are committed to the social justice issue of textbook af-
fordability, the opportunity to redesign their courses in innovative ways
made possible by OER and other no-cost materials energized faculty going
through the workshops and attracted others to join them, as was made
clear in the faculty questionnaire responses mentioned earlier. Some fac-
ulty were able to ditch the textbook altogether, while others who used
open textbooks often supplemented with videos and other sources that
66  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

transformed their courses. The costs savings are undeniably important to
our students and part of this program's success, but even more so is the
pedagogical transformation that we see taking place.

Sustaining and Scaling OER
At BMCC there are several issues that need to be addressed to sustain
OER initiatives at meaningful scale. Increasing general education OER
course offerings requires us to work within, around, or through depart-
mental constraints, which vary by discipline. For example, some depart-
ments encourage and support adjunct participation while others actively
discourage it, which is problematic given that two thirds of our faculty are
part-time. In our science department, the faculty in each discipline (biol-
ogy, chemistry, physics, and astronomy) vote on the textbook that will be
adopted for all sections of their courses. For OER to be used by our sci-
ence faculty there needs to be consensus, which we are working toward.
Science faculty who have gone through the Open/Alternative Textbook
Program are able to act as OER champions, and this can be particularly ef-
fective if the OER champion is the course coordinator.

    On the other hand, in the humanities and social sciences, there is
more independence in course material selection, and often faculty use dif-
ferent frames or lenses for the same course. This most often requires us
to work course section by course section with individual faculty members.
Within the OER Degree and New York State funding initiatives, we are
beginning to use communities of practice to encourage more sharing of
resources between these independent faculty members, which would help
with scaling beyond one or two sections. Within the humanities, after we
announced the zero textbook cost attribute in our registration system, we
heard from some English instructors who were using zero cost resources
before the launch of the Open/Alternative Textbook Program, with more
taking up the option after participating. Contemporary literature courses
understandably remain out of reach due to the appropriate materials re-
maining under copyright, though many faculty seek out the lowest cost
options and the library purchases ebooks whenever possible to support
faculty efforts.

    Another discipline-specific barrier is the loss of publisher ancillaries
when courses are redesigned with OER. This is a barrier in STEM dis-
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  67

ciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math) as well as social
sciences, even though faculty in the latter are more likely to individually
choose their textbooks. Most faculty have neither the time nor the exper-
tise to develop valid and reliable test questions. To address this, BMCC
will be exploring various options available for personalized learning sys-
tems, also known as adaptive learning, that use OER (e.g., Carnegie Mel-
lon OLI). Most personalized learning systems are produced by commercial
publishers, and their use of OER for the content on which the ancillary
material is based may reduce the cost, at least initially. As stated earlier
though, even low-cost materials may prove a barrier to many students. At
BMCC, there is an effort to incorporate any costs for personalized learn-
ing systems into already existing programs and fees to avoid passing the
cost along to students in new fees thus maintaining courses as zero text-
book cost.

    CUNY Office of Library Services also received a grant from the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation to test one system, Lumen Learning's
Waymaker platform, which combines OER with adaptive or personalized
learning. Several CUNY schools are participating, and BMCC's psychol-
ogy faculty will be using the platform for several sections of Introduction
to Psychology. This project is part of a larger three-year research study
that will evaluate impact on student success, persistence, and retention.
BMCC math faculty, who are probably the furthest along in moving their
courses to OER, are also exploring open source alternatives, including My
Open Math and WeBWorK, as possible solutions for developing home-
work assignments and practice tests, rather than using publishers' online
sites. These homework systems and personalized learning platforms ad-
dress the reservation raised by many faculty who hesitate to move to OER
because they lose publisher test banks and other ancillaries.

    Along with these department and disciplinary challenges, faculty are
on the whole concerned with how OER will count toward tenure and
promotion. At BMCC, while participating in OER initiatives is generally
viewed favorably by most departments in tenure and promotion reviews,
the adoption, adaptation, and creation of OER in redesigning courses is
not officially included in the evaluation of teaching, service, or scholar-
ship. This is one reason that in the Open/Alternative Textbook Program
we spend time discussing assessment and encourage faculty to publish
68  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

about OER within the scholarship of teaching and learning, as currently
any peer-reviewed publications would count toward tenure and promo-
tion in our current tenure system. BMCC's Associate Dean of Faculty has
suggested that OER could fall under Boyer's "scholarship of integration,"
and we'll be exploring this avenue going forward (Boggs, 2017). Tenure
and promotion is a particularly complex issue to address as policies and
procedures can have many layers, including disciplinary, departmental,
college, and system, but without valuing this work in tenure and promo-
tion, it will be extremely difficult to sustain and scale our efforts.

    Another important challenge both locally and beyond is developing a
viable funding model that values faculty expertise and the labor required
in redesigning courses with OER. At BMCC, the $1,000 stipend we offer
faculty is the equivalent of approximately 22 hours at a non-adjunct teach-
ing rate. The faculty are in workshops for 10 hours, leaving 12 hours to
significantly redesign their courses around these new materials and within
this new pedagogical framework. To date none of our faculty have cho-
sen to adopt available OER courses as a whole from third party providers.
Although this type of adoption is often touted as the answer to issues
of sustainability and scalability, even this takes some labor, with faculty
needing to become familiar with the materials and flow of the course.
But the potential for pedagogical transformation we have demonstrated
in BMCC's Open/Alternative Textbook Program comes from faculty re-
thinking and redesigning their courses, which takes substantially more
time. Ideally, to adequately value this creative and innovative work, we
would provide our faculty, who labor under 5/4 teaching loads (5 courses
in fall, 4 in spring), with a course release. Counting toward tenure as
scholarship of integration would also allow faculty to choose how they
spend their time in fulfilling the scholarship requirement. Both of these
changes would help in recruiting faculty who have stated that the under-
valuing of this work is a barrier to their embracing OER.

The Importance of the Commons
For the library, we want to take our success with OER and solidify our
role in leading campus-wide initiatives that contribute significantly to our
university's strategic goals, as the Open/Alternative Textbook Program
has on our campus. Librarians also have the opportunity to lead a public
From Textbook Affordability to Transformative Pedagogy  69

dialog about OER, as we have with open access (OA), which often focuses
on economics and monetary costs in particular: high prices for journals,
high prices for textbooks, large profits for the companies producing them.
Librarians are well positioned to expand this discussion to include the
knowledge commons (Hess & Ostrom, 2011), which speaks to social jus-
tice issues often inherent in the work at community colleges specifically
and higher education generally. At BMCC, some faculty and librarians be-
lieve in fighting against what Bollier terms "enclosures of commons--in
which corporate interests appropriate our shared wealth [or information
and knowledge] and turn it into expensive private commodities" (Bollier,
2014, p. 3). This should sound familiar, as it's what we've seen happen in
both scholarly publishing and textbook publishing, and just as scholarly
publishing behemoths have entered the OA sphere, publishers and ven-
dors are moving into OER. Recently, librarians have authored important
critiques (Almeida, 2017), and Crissinger (2015) urges us "to be cognizant
of our position within increasingly corporatized institutions and consider
how we might be furthering the goals of those institutions, to think seri-
ously about how we can be actively dismantling power structures instead
of perpetuating them, and to remind ourselves why we think open is
worth fighting for in the first place." With librarians leading OER initia-
tives, we have the opportunity to reclaim knowledge as a public good, if
we choose to heed the call.

Introduction

In many academic libraries, scholarly communication and information lit-
eracy are considered distinct areas of librarianship that are typically man-
aged by separate units within an organization. Those who practice in the
realm of scholarly communication tend to emphasize support for faculty
and sometimes graduate students, focusing on the topics of copyright,
access, visibility, and data management as they relate to research and schol-
arly publishing. Information literacy librarians, on the other hand, prior-
itize undergraduate students and focus on information-seeking behavior,
information evaluation, and ethical use of information. The practice of
information literacy librarians has been deeply impacted by educational
theory, instructional design, and the scholarship of teaching and learning,
resulting in a growing emphasis on learning outcomes and assessment,
while that of scholarly communication librarians shifts in confluence with
case law, public policy, and commercial publishing practices.

    In 2013, the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL)
published Intersections of Scholarly Communication and Information Literacy:
Creating Strategic Collaborations for a Changing Academic Environment, a
white paper that defined three important connections between these two
critical areas of librarianship and proposed a variety of strategic actions
that librarians can take to capitalize on the potential of the Intersections.
Recommendations included developing integrated educational programs
for librarians, redesigning information literacy curricula for all audiences
to include topics of scholarly communication, discussing organizational
models that break down silos, and advocating for the value of libraries in
disseminating scholarship and contributing to student learning.
74  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Since then, a number of books, articles, and presentations have been
published on topics central to the Intersections. A bibliography of relevant
readings is available on ACRL's website (ACRL, n.d.-a), and the organi-
zation has since developed a licensed workshop, "Two Paths Converge:
Designing Educational Opportunities on the Intersections of Scholarly
Communication and Information Literacy," to continue outreach and ad-
vocacy around the Intersections (ACRL, n.d.-b). Though librarians have
produced scholarship related to open education for over a decade, little has
been written about the connection between open education (frequently
housed within scholarly communication units) and information literacy.
This chapter expands the Intersections discussion to include open educa-
tional resources (OER) and open pedagogy. It presents a case for the
intersectional nature of open education and provides examples of how
practitioners and advocates can leverage the common ground between
scholarly communication and information literacy to create meaningful
learning opportunities for a variety of audiences.

Background
ACRL's 2013 Intersections white paper grew from the recognition that
our information ecosystem, and library roles within it, is changing at a
rapid pace and that such dynamic change requires agility and strategic
realignment of our traditional roles and responsibilities. It emphasized
collaboration, both within and outside of libraries, as a mechanism for
responding to the three intersections highlighted in the paper. Those in-
tersections are the economics of the distribution of scholarship, digital
literacies, and changing roles for librarians (p. 1). The paper's authors
noted the publication was intended to spark further conversation and the
recommendations they put forth were only a small selection of possibili-
ties for capitalizing on the interconnectedness of our work.

    Another ACRL publication, Common Ground at the Nexus of Informa-
tion Literacy and Scholarly Communication, edited by Stephanie Davis-Kahl
and Merinda Kaye Hensley (2013), followed the white paper's release
and presented early examples of librarianship at the intersections. In the
foreword, Joyce Ogborn wrote that information literacy and scholarly
communication developed quite naturally without intersecting, though
our changing landscape now requires that we think critically about the
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education  75

connections (p. v). Some of these connections are explored in the book's
16 chapters. Though many chapters focus on including an undergraduate
audience in scholarly communication education and outreach, audiences
comprised of graduate students, faculty, and librarians are also discussed.
In "Teaching Our Faculty: Developing Copyright and Scholarly Commu-
nication Outreach Programs," for example, the chapter's authors discuss
the formation of a campus-wide copyright committee and its approach
to developing an outreach program on the topic (Duncan, Clement, &
Rozum, 2013). Similarly, a chapter about ACRL's Scholarly Communica-
tion Roadshow describes how the group's approach to professional de-
velopment evolved over time to support the changing needs of librarians
(Kirchner & Malenfant, 2013).

    ACRL's adoption of the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education in 2016 bolstered the connection between scholarly communi-

cation and information literacy by directly referencing topics central to
scholarly communication when defining information literacy. The Frame-
work was born out of recognition that information literacy is complex and

nuanced, and it offers a set of interconnected core concepts to guide our
conversations with students, faculty, and other stakeholders. It presents
six frames, each with a set of example knowledge practices and dispo-
sitions that are intended to be integrated into academic programs at a
variety of levels. Though the Framework uses student-centric language

to discuss information literacy, much of the document can also apply to
teachable moments with faculty and administrators; this is particularly
true through the example knowledge practices and dispositions that bleed
into topics of scholarly communication. Areas of overlap include the pro-
duction and commodification of information ("Information Creation as
a Process" and "Information Has Value"), the value of collaboration in
advancing knowledge ("Research as Inquiry"), the importance of access
to information ("Searching as Strategic Exploration"), the significance of
how authority is established and realized in different contexts ("Authority
Is Constructed and Contextual"), and the recognition that systems of com-
munication can enforce or dismantle information privilege ("Scholarship
as Conversation").

    The growing body of literature around the Intersections and the Frame-
work aren't the only movements within libraries that advocate for ex-
76  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ploring a deeper and more thoughtful connection between information
literacy and scholarly communication. Practitioners of "critical informa-
tion literacy" and, more broadly, "critical librarianship" aim to interrogate
the role libraries play in reinforcing systems of oppression and to address
how librarians can proactively shift practices to challenge existing power
structures, inequities, and biases related to information seeking and con-
struction in our work. Examples range from examining Library of Con-
gress subject headings and identifying problematic patterns of classifi-
cation (Drabinski, 2008) to reframing our approach to the "reference
interview" as a dialog, as opposed to a transaction, that enables "student-
generated transformative action" (Adler, 2013, p. 4). Critical information
literacy is at its heart about social justice.

    A popular example of critical information literacy and the Intersections
comes from Scott Warren and Kim Duckett, who present strategies for
introducing undergraduate students to complex issues of information ac-
cess and commodification by deconstructing subscription and public re-
sources and leading a conversation about the economics of information
(2010). The authors describe how they experimented over time with
integrating topics central to scholarly communication into information
literacy instruction. Many of their instructional strategies were tested, re-
vised, and improved within the context of an elective English course that
typically attracts junior and senior science majors. The library session for
the course is divided into two parts--the first focusing on active discus-
sion of the scholarly communication cycle and issues inherent in it, and
the second focusing on hands-on discovery of peer-reviewed informa-
tion. Each instructional strategy is presented with discussion questions
and learning resources. Together, the two build on these strategies in
a later publication that more fully defines two intertwined but distinct
frames of reference that inform their praxis (2013). The sociocultural
frame of reference is useful for guiding conversations related to social
constructs and norms within academic communities (e.g., peer review),
and the economic frame of reference allows us to explore the business side
of information exchange as we bridge discovery and access (e.g., toll ac-
cess journals).

    The Warren and Duckett example is an excellent illustration of how
information literacy can prod the politics of knowledge production. This
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education  77

interrogation of knowledge production, and associated issues of informa-
tion ownership and commodification, is also an area of emphasis for practi-
tioners and advocates of open education, which is why incorporating infor-
mation literacy and collaborating with those who work in this realm is cru-
cial when designing outreach around OER and open pedagogy. Librarians
are increasingly involved with coordinating and leading open education
efforts on college and university campuses, as evidenced by contributions
to the chapters in this field guide. This expansion of our roles warrants a
deeper exploration of open education's connection to information literacy
and librarians' long history of teaching within higher education.

Librarians as Teachers
A foundational principle presented in Intersections is that all academic li-
brarians are teachers. Beyond that, the authors assert, "All roles in an
academic library are impacted and altered by the changing nature of schol-
arly communication and the evolution of the dissemination of knowledge.
Therefore, every librarian has a role in teaching, whether formally or in-
formally, about scholarly communication issues" (p.4). Teaching in the
context of academic libraries can take many forms, from providing in-
person and online reference services to introducing patrons to archives
and special collections. Librarians frequently hold consultations with fac-
ulty and students, offer workshops and seminars, and share expertise with
other campus units. However, teaching is most closely associated with for-
mal, course-integrated instruction targeting a student audience.

    Evidence collected during ACRL's Assessment in Action project, a
three-year program that investigated how libraries impact student learn-
ing at over 200 post-secondary institutions from across North America,
shows that libraries contribute to student success in four key ways
(Brown, 2016). The group's research suggests students benefit from (1)
using the library and (2) collaborative partnerships between the library
and other academic programs and services. The other key findings are re-
lated to library instruction. Specifically, students benefit from (3) library
instruction during the early stages of their academic careers and (4) library
integration into general education.

    When we consider how library-led learning happens on college and
university campuses, our focus tends to revolve around instruction occur-
78  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ring in a traditional classroom. Librarians have a long history of delivering
formal instruction to groups of students, as noted by Barbara Fister in a
collection of essays on new roles for librarians (2015). Instruction most
frequently takes the form of the "one-shot" (that is, a single session de-
livered to students enrolled in a course offered by another department),
though librarians may also be embedded in courses, providing an op-
portunity for interacting with students for the duration of a course, and
sometimes teach credit-bearing classes. This focus on teaching and learn-
ing through instructional design and information literacy is not a new
trend, nor does it appear to be reversing course anytime soon.

    The 2016 Ithaka S+R survey of library deans and directors shows that
positions and resource allocations that support teaching and research are
expected to grow in the coming years, as was the case in the 2013 survey
(Wolff-Eisenberg, 2017). It may not be surprising, then, that many of the
early examples of librarianship at the intersections of scholarly commu-
nication and information literacy focused on integrating scholarly com-
munication concepts into formal undergraduate instruction. Intersections
literature provides examples of plagiarism and copyright curriculum im-
plemented in a first-year-seminar program (Clement & Brenenson, 2013),
development of a credit-bearing course on scholarly publishing (Gilman,
2013), and library integration into courses offered by an undergraduate
research program (Hensley, 2013), among others. Such approaches pro-
vide valuable opportunities to engage students in higher-order thinking
about information authorship, ownership, and privilege.

    Still, the types of learning opportunities created by librarians are not
limited to the classroom. Librarians commonly develop guides and tuto-
rials in order to extend learning outside the walls of a classroom, though
such resources are frequently connected to course-integrated instruction.
Likewise, stand-alone workshops, such as those on copyright offered to
faculty and graduate students by scholarly communication librarians, tend
to mimic classroom settings. Although these types of learning opportuni-
ties are important, a growing number of librarians have written and pre-
sented on less formal strategies for approaching learning. Amy Buckland,
for example, offers an elegant description of opportunities for engaging
with students as creators of information by making student work available
through institutional repositories and supporting student-run scholarly
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education  79

publishing (2015). This demonstrates a change in approach that positions
the library as a partner rather than a resource and is an important distinc-
tion in our interactions with all members of our university communities.

    Later in this chapter we'll explore the intersectional nature of open
education and related partnerships in more detail. First, we must briefly
address the mechanics of learning. In How Learning Works, seven dis-
tinct yet interconnected principles of learning are presented, along with
strategies for integrating each principle into teaching practices (Ambrose,
Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, & Norman, 2010). The principles, listed below,
are based on the premise that learning is a process undertaken by the
learner that results in lasting change and is influenced by prior experiences
and knowledge:

1. Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and ap-

    ply what they know.
3. Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to

    learn.
4. To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice

    integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.
5. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the

    quality of students' learning.
6. Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emo-

    tional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and

    adjust their approaches to learning. (pp. 4-6).

Though the book presents a variety of evidence-based strategies for fa-
cilitating learning, a recurring theme is the importance of collecting data
to better understand learners' needs and progress. It is worth noting
that, like in the Framework, the language used in How Learning Works is
student-centric; however, the authors do the important work of apply-
ing the principles to instructors in the book's conclusion, recognizing that
teaching is a complex and dynamic activity. The principles are applied
specifically to self-directed reflection and learning about teaching, which
is often voluntary and, particularly at research institutions, underempha-
sized. However, they are just as relevant to more formal situations in
80  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

which faculty assume the role of students, such as in copyright, visibility,
and publishing workshops led by librarians. As such, the seven principles
provide a helpful frame for librarians to evaluate these types of learning
opportunities.

Learning at the Intersections
Librarians most frequently emphasize students as the beneficiaries of our
teaching and learning initiatives. However, the intersections present sig-
nificant learning opportunities for faculty and administrators as well. To
better understand this potential, it is useful to think critically about how
our profession defines both information literacy and scholarly communi-
cation. In the Framework, ACRL defines information literacy as "the set of
integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information,
the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the
use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically
in communities of learning." Writing in Common Ground at the Nexus, Ju-
lia Gelfand and Catherine Palmer offer a helpful way of defining scholarly
communication:

      Information-literate members of the academy should under-
      stand how knowledge is created, evaluated, shared, and pre-
      served. If we define scholarly communication as the ways in
      which subject knowledge is created (research methodology),
      evaluated (peer review), shared (through scholarly journal ar-
      ticles, monographs, conference proceedings, and research re-
      ports), and preserved (repositories writ large), then it is clear
      that an information-literate individual is one who understands
      both the issues and processes of scholarly communication.
      (2013, pp. 9-10).

Sarah Crissinger, reflecting on her work at the intersections on ACRL's
blog, takes this connection one step further and captures the essence of li-
brarianship from an intersectional perspective:

      I find the ways that scholarly communication is being infused
      with information literacy even more interesting and exciting,
      partly because I believe that IL can make scholarly commu-
      nication outreach more holistic and approachable. One of the
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education  81

      best examples of this is librarians' outreach on altmetrics and
      impact factor. Asking faculty and graduate students to think
      critically about how we evaluate scholarship and what impact
      really means to them as scholars and information consumers is
      information literacy. (2015, italics in original)

The importance of such a holistic approach is emphasized by Shan Sutton
in his review of the Intersections white paper, in which he advised libraries
to "approach the integration process as an opportunity to rethink their
faculty, as well as student, engagement across the entire spectrum of
scholarly communications activities" (2013, p. 2). This focus on faculty en-
gagement through an information literacy lens is an area of scholarship
that deserves further exploration.

    Numerous studies reveal gaps in faculty understanding of the issues
and processes related to scholarly communication. A 2007 report from
the University of California Office of Scholarly Communication and the
California Digital Library eScholarship Program suggests that faculty are
"under-informed" and disengaged with a range of topics central to schol-
arly communication (p. 3). A report on scholarly communication by the
Center for Studies in Higher Education noted low recognition by faculty
of the economic impact of scholarly publishing practices on libraries (i.e.,
the "serials crisis"), and by extension the communities they serve; beyond
that, the report documented "quite a few" outright rejections of this im-
pact (Harley, Acord, Earl-Novell, Lawrence, & King, 2010, p. 11), despite
compelling evidence to the contrary (Suber, 2012; SQW Limited, 2003).
Low awareness of institutional repositories has been reported by librari-
ans investigating scholarly communication perceptions in their local con-
texts (Mischo & Schlembach, 2011; Odell, Dill, & Palmer, 2014; Yang &
Li, 2015). Similarly, a survey of faculty members from 17 universities
across the United States found that the majority of faculty were unaware
of their institution's repository (Kim, 2011, p. 249). Copyright, too, re-
mains a challenge. Both anecdotal (Duncan et al., 2013) and empirical
(Smith et al., 2006) evidence suggest faculty have limited familiarity with
the complexities of copyright law and how it applies to their research and
teaching practices. Such low awareness among faculty could cause con-
cern for librarians interested in broaching similar topics with students.
82  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

However, teachable moments frequently arise, particularly in course-in-
tegrated instruction, for deepening the understanding of both audiences
simultaneously.

Opportunities in Open Education
Open education, with its emphasis on intellectual property rights and
sharing, is fertile ground for exploring the competencies of the commu-
nities we serve through an information literacy lens. Low awareness of
OER among faculty, as reported by the Babson Survey Research Group,
shows there is much room for growth in this area (Allen & Seaman, 2016,
p. 12). At the same time, library leaders continue to seek meaningful ways
to demonstrate the value of the library and its impact on the organiza-
tional mission. It is becoming increasingly important for librarians at all
levels to consider how our work aligns with these strategic priorities.

    In some cases, the task of connecting learning opportunities to strate-
gic priorities is straightforward and relatively effortless. In others, the task
can be more problematic, often the result of outdated or nonexistent doc-
umentation. Still, our ability to clearly demonstrate connections between
our efforts and the university's priorities is essential, especially for new
initiatives like those surrounding OER outreach and education. Natural
connections between open education and institutional goals frequently
include increasing affordability, supporting student success, fostering in-
novation, and producing impactful scholarship. Finally, though outreach
about open education frequently occurs in one-on-one conversations and
group discussions, the practice of drafting learning outcomes and assess-
ment strategies can prove useful in guiding and focusing conversation in
these and other informal teaching scenarios.

    When designing learning experiences around open education, it is
critical to consider the purpose of the learning experience alongside the
audience for whom it is intended, as well as a method for assessing the
success of the learning experience. Deb Gilchrist offers a popular formula
for learning outcomes that sandwiches "in order to" between an action
and an intention. Gilchrist recommends beginning each outcome with a
strong, measurable action verb, such as those listed in Bloom's Taxon-
omy. The way in which each verb is connected to a cognitive process
should be considered, and verbs that are not measurable (e.g., understand-
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education  83

ing and knowing) should be avoided. The clause following "in order to"
should describe the intention of the learning experience. That is, what
should the learner be able to do as a result of the learning? Assessment of
learning outcomes can take myriad forms--formal or informal and sum-
mative or formative--and should always be approached with the learner
(not the teacher) at the forefront of the experience. In ACRL's Inter-
sections Workshop, which presents strategies for crafting outcomes for
learning experiences, librarians are encouraged to ask themselves a se-
ries of simple questions to form the foundation for learning: Who is your
audience? What is your purpose? How will you know if the learning hap-
pened? With these basic components defined, we can begin connecting
learning opportunities for specific audiences to the strategic priorities of
our libraries and institutions.

    For example, most open education advocates have firsthand experi-
ence with faculty and administrators who have a fundamentally flawed
understanding of how open licensing integrates with traditional copyright
protections. Such misunderstandings of information ownership and
transfer can derail conversations and pose significant challenges for ad-
vancing open initiatives, even when those initiatives are firmly connected
to institutional priorities. It can be helpful to spend time in advance of
important meetings and discussions brainstorming specific learning out-
comes to guide these informal learning experiences. An outcome such as
"evaluate information ownership and transfer in open vs. proprietary con-
texts" can increase agility in responding to questions and comments that
demonstrate low understanding of information ownership, a concept es-
sential to information literacy. Considering the specific action expected
following the intervention can inform the second half of the outcome.
For example, learning in this context may be planned in order to increase
adoption of OER, increase the creation of open scholarship, or develop
stronger communication channels about OER between university admin-
istrators and instructors.

    Outreach within libraries is as crucial to the success of open education
initiatives as it is with stakeholders outside of libraries. As new open ed-
ucation initiatives emerge within academic libraries, we need to guard
against the tendency to develop programming within silos. Cheryl Mid-
dleton, ACRL president, suggested that all academic librarians must be
84  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

competent in scholarly communication and warned against the trend of
developing scholarly communication services in isolation from the work
of subject librarians, many of whom are responsible for delivering infor-
mation literacy instruction and working with faculty in their designated
departments (2017). This is particularly important considering that open
education efforts are most frequently oriented in scholarly communica-
tion units (Walz, Jensen, & Salem, 2016; Yano, 2017), though librarians
responsible for information literacy have significant expertise in working
with faculty to improve their courses and design better learning experi-
ences.

    The potential here is nicely illustrated in a Twitter thread by Zoe
Fisher, a librarian who specializes in information literacy instruction
(2017). Fisher described a dialog with first-year students in a one-shot ses-
sion that demonstrates how naturally OER integrates into instructional
scenarios with undergraduate students. Fisher reports that she received
the question, "How does the library help students with textbooks?" The
question, along with multiple follow-up questions from the students, pro-
vided an opportunity to introduce the freshmen to course reserves, the
limited purchasing power of libraries and related shift to open resources,
and existing options, such as buy-back and rental programs, intended to
lower costs for students. The posts are an important reminder that oppor-
tunities to engage with students about OER will arise in our information
literacy work whether we plan them or not. Advance, collaborative plan-
ning by open education advocates and information literacy and subject
librarians to identify talking points and connections between open edu-
cation and information literacy will allow us to reframe extemporaneous
responses into teachable moments that deepen our students' understand-
ing of how information production and consumption impact our daily
lives, both in academia and beyond.

    Open education leaders can, of course, face numerous challenges get-
ting librarians on board. Time constraints are a common barrier. Quill
West, Amy Hofer, and Dale Coleman explore this and other findings in
their report on the grant-funded Librarians as Open Education Leaders
project (2017). The project website includes instructional videos and tem-
plates that can be used to ready subject librarians for supporting faculty
interested in transitioning to OER. The resources serve as an important
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education  85

reminder that OER support is strikingly similar to any other reference
consultation librarians provide. Focusing on these similarities--and em-
phasizing that OER consultations are guided by identifying and respond-
ing to an instructor's information need--can help time-strapped librarians
understand that supporting OER isn't as foreign as it may otherwise seem
and can be a very natural extension of services they already provide. Em-
powering our communities to understand and meet information needs is
information literacy.

    Numerous scholars both within and outside of libraries have argued
that librarians cannot and should not fully own responsibility for informa-
tion literacy, and the same is true when applying information literacy to
open education. An exciting example of the convergence of open education
and information literacy was presented by Billy Meinke, OER technologist
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, at the Open Education 2017 con-
ference. Meinke presented on a workflow and support system intended to
empower faculty by demystifying the OER design process. In planning the
training to support the adaptation and creation of OER, Meinke mapped
learning outcomes for faculty creators to the six frames described in the
ACRL Framework. Foundational principles of OER, such as the significance
of intellectual property rights, found natural homes in the "Authority Is
Constructed and Contextual" and "Information Has Value" frames, while
abilities related to OER creation and adaptation were better reflected in
the "Information Creation as Process" frame. Technical skills, such as eval-
uating the technical adaptability of an OER and downloading a resource
from a repository, were not mapped to a frame. In a paper submitted for
the Open Education Global Conference in 2018, Meinke joined Reed in
exploring the connections between each frame and topics related to open
education, including the frames omitted from the original mapping. The
paper merges technologist and librarian perspectives and probes issues of
OER quality, collaboration, and student privacy.

    Writing on the Open Oregon blog, Silvia Lin Hanick and Hofer argue
that librarians should incorporate open practices into information literacy
instruction rather than approaching them as distinct areas of focus (2017).
They recommend opening our own teaching practices in order to model
pedagogy for faculty. Additionally, they present connections between open
education and the Framework that can guide scaffolding information liter-
86  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

acy competencies into open assignments. For example, in exploring open
education through the "Information Has Value" frame, the authors note
that textbook costs make the commodification of information a "real-life
problem" for students. OER is an excellent solution; however, oversimpli-
fying OER by focusing on cost at the exclusion of effort and labor, which
are not always compensated, does little to deepen students' understanding
of how information functions in a networked society.

    There is, of course, potential for student involvement beyond class-
room settings, which serves as an important reminder to think broadly
about collaborative opportunities within our institutional contexts. Part-
ners who can assist in developing, distributing, or otherwise augmenting
learning experiences can be found within our library, across campus,
and at external organizations, such as professional societies, nonprofits,
advocacy groups, and government agencies. It is in the development
of these partnerships that the greatest advances in open education are
achieved. Take, for example, the success of BCcampus, a government-
funded organization that supports teaching and learning in British Co-
lumbia's public post-secondary education system. Since beginning an
open textbook project in 2012, BCcampus has created over 160 text-
books, facilitated OER adoption in over 700 courses, and saved students
over CA$2 million. Executive Director Mary Burgess attributes this suc-
cess to multi-institutional collaboration, financial support from govern-
ment agencies, student advocacy, an engaged staff, supportive campus
partners, and strong relationships with international leaders in open ed-
ucation (2017).

    In the United States, a growing number of state legislatures are draft-
ing legislation that elevates open education in the public discourse and
presents open education advocates with additional opportunities for part-
nerships that drive culture change and advance the values of open educa-
tion. For example, in 2017 the Texas State Legislature signed into a law a
bill that added OER to an existing textbook disclosure law and established
a statewide grant program to support the adoption and creation of OER.
The law requires that institutions of higher education provide search-
able information allowing students to filter by courses that use only OER.
Similar policies were implemented in Washington, Oregon, and Califor-
nia; these and other state-level activities impacting open education are
Creating Learning Opportunities in Open Education                  87

tracked and curated by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources
Coalition (SPARC) on the OER State Policy Tracker.1 Such top-down
initiatives, such as OER disclosure mandates, present a need for open
education advocates to carefully consider strategic options for creating
learning experiences that educate faculty and administrators about OER.
Proactive and thoughtful outreach in this area can reduce the backlash of
"unfunded mandates" that could otherwise pollute growth and result in
concerns over academic freedom.

    The heightened attention on OER can also catalyze pedagogical
change, particularly at institutions that have adopted experiential learn-
ing (learning by doing) or collaboration as a strategic priority. Though
the definition of "open pedagogy" is contested, it is broadly conceived
as a practice that empowers students as content creators by giving them
the opportunity to demonstrate mastery through the act of creation. In
the introduction to Critical Library Instruction, the editors describe their
praxis as one that "respects what each student brings to the classroom"
(Accardi, Drabinski, & Kumbier, 2010, p. x), which is how practition-
ers of open pedagogy often describe their work. Open pedagogy hinges
on student agency within an authentic and collaborative learning envi-
ronment. It challenges traditional roles of teacher and student and has
the potential to transform the educational experience. However, there
are significant concerns that demand sensitivity when transitioning to
open practices. Robin DeRosa explores some of these considerations in
writing about her experiences collaborating with students in the open
(2016); she touches on concerns related to access (considering students
without or new to technology), production (considering privilege and
the hidden costs of labor), and privacy and safety (considering trolling
and digital identities). When thoughtfully approached, however, this
style of pedagogy offers an excellent opportunity for faculty to work col-
laboratively with both scholarly communication librarians, leveraging
their expertise in copyright and visibility, and information literacy li-
brarians, leveraging their expertise in assignment design and classroom
management. The result is often elevated levels of student engagement

policy-tracking/

and motivation, deeper connections with content and collaborators, and
higher levels of satisfaction with outputs of the learning experience.

Conclusion
Libraries are experiencing a number of pressures that require innovative
thinking, flexibility, and critical reflection. Responding to this pressure,
ACRL's publication of the Intersections white paper has resulted in a grow-
ing interest and energy around the common ground between information
literacy and scholarly communication. Librarians writing on the intersec-
tions have introduced multiple ways that topics of scholarly communica-
tion can be integrated into undergraduate outreach and education.

    Less has been written about applying the lessons learned from infor-
mation literacy initiatives to outreach with faculty or connecting libraries'
extensive experience with information literacy to our work in open ed-
ucation. The strategy presented in this chapter-- of focusing on learning
experiences and tailoring each to a specific audience and purpose-- is one
method for approaching those connections. The examples included in
this chapter, such as mapping open education learning outcomes to the
Framework, leveraging undergraduate instruction to introduce students to
course resource options, and collaborating with other librarians to scale
support for OER, are only a starting point for developing meaningful out-
reach and education about open educational practices. There is significant
room for further exploration.

    As libraries are faced with dwindling budgets and increasing demand
to demonstrate the value of our contributions to the university commu-
nity, it is important to consider the ways in which we can collaborate
with partners both within and outside our libraries to advance work in
support of institutional priorities. Framing our work within open educa-
tion in the context of information literacy can be a useful anchor and a
persistent reminder that we are almost always acting in a teaching capac-
ity, even when we are not working directly with students in a classroom.
Such an approach fosters greater intentionality, improved outcomes, and
stronger partnerships.

Introduction
Providing internship opportunities to students is a high-impact practice
that can positively impact student retention and engagement (Kuh, 2008).
In Spring 2017, the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) Libraries
partnered with administrators of the university's Minor in Disabilities
Studies to initiate a series of experiential learning opportunities for under-
graduate students pursuing the minor. The partnership established UTA
Libraries as an internship site for Disabilities Studies students who express
interest in education and/or publishing.

    This form of experiential learning, which is defined as learning by
doing, also supports the Maverick Advantage, a campus-wide initiative
that encourages students to participate in experiential learning via five
"distinguishing activities." The activities focus on career development,
community engagement, global connections, leadership, and undergrad-
uate research. The internship described in this chapter advances career
development goals defined in the Maverick Advantage by providing real-
world opportunities for disability studies students to apply knowledge
gained during their coursework.

    Our chapter focuses on an open textbook evaluation project com-
pleted by the first intern to work with the Libraries on open education ini-
tiatives. The results highlight accessibility strengths, expose problematic
exclusion of students with disabilities in higher education, and demon-
strate the ways in which some open textbooks, intended to be "open" for
all, fall short of that promise. We will outline best practices for designing
accessible, open textbooks and describe the process used to evaluate the
accessibility of existing resources. We will also discuss the engagement of
94  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

the student intern with open education on our campus and the potential
for future projects.

Background
UTA is a four-year public research university located in northeast Texas.
Total global enrollment for the 2016-17 academic year was 58,664, mak-
ing it the largest institution in the University of Texas System. Estab-
lished in 1895 as Arlington College, UTA was designated a Hispanic-
Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education in 2014. The
university is frequently recognized for its diverse student population and
for its affordability. U.S. News & World Report ranked UTA as fifth in the
nation for undergraduate diversity, third largest destination for transfer
students, and second for lowest average student debt among U.S. univer-
sities. Additionally, the university is frequently ranked as a top school for
veterans.

    The Minor in Disability Studies, started by Dr. Sarah Rose in Fall
2013, is offered through the university's Department of History. Since the
1980s, UTA has been an exemplary university for accessibility, the disabil-
ity community, and equal educational opportunities. Since the creation of
the minor, the disability presence at UTA has increased. Disability aware-
ness has spread as the minor has attracted over 85 students from nearly
every discipline represented at UTA. Students on campus also have the
opportunity to explore disability history and learn about the disability ex-
perience through events on campus, such as panel speakers, film viewings,
and lectures on disability history and culture.

    Students wishing to complete the Minor in Disability Studies must
take several disability studies courses and ultimately undertake a 117-hour
internship. In these courses, students learn about important disability
studies concepts, such as the social and medical model of disability, dis-
ability identity and culture, and the intersection of disability with race,
gender, and ethnicity. In these courses, students form a better understand-
ing of the role of disability in history and in their current culture. The
minor leaves students with a new perspective on the human body and
ability, and the final internship and capstone assignments allow students
to practice applying the concepts in a real-world professional setting. Stu-
dents partner with nonprofit organizations or related business sites and
Experiential Learning and Open Education  95

use the insight gleaned during their coursework to complete projects with
these organizations.1

    In early 2017, UTA Libraries' Open Education Librarian partnered
with Dr. Rose to provide such an opportunity to an undergraduate stu-
dent enrolled in the minor. The Libraries began developing outreach and
educational programming focused on open education with the hire of an
Open Education Librarian, a new position, in Fall 2016. The position was
created as the result of a library reorganization initiated in 2015. As the
Libraries reassigned over one third of its staff to work within its Schol-
arly Communication Division, it also began seeking new opportunities to
promote and support open systems for sharing information. The Open
Education Librarian was tasked with developing programming to support
the university's strategic goal of increasing affordability while advocating
for open practices. To this end, the Libraries joined the Open Textbook
Network (OTN) and hosted an Open Textbook Workshop in February
2017. Approximately 25 teaching faculty and staff were recruited to attend
the workshop, where they were introduced to open educational resources
(OER) and encouraged to review an open textbook indexed in the Open
Textbook Library (OTL). Attendees who completed a review of an open
textbook received a $200 stipend. During the signup process, workshop
attendees were encouraged to identify at least one open textbook relevant
to their discipline that they might be interested in reviewing.

    The resulting list of resources was given to the disability studies in-
tern for the textbook evaluation project. In addition to providing a hands-
on learning experience for the student, the evaluation project identified
the strengths and weaknesses of existing open textbooks being consid-
ered for adoption by teachers at UTA and informed the Libraries' long-
term goal of creating high-quality, accessible OER. The Open Education
Librarian, who served as internship supervisor, drafted the following ob-
jectives to guide the intern's work on the project over the course of the
Spring 2017 semester:

· Investigate accessibility standards for electronic books (ebooks); this
    may involve communicating via email or in person with local experts.

1 For more information, see: https://utadisabilitystudies.wordpress.com/
96  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

· Investigate accessibility guidelines and best practices used by estab-
    lished OER publishers (e.g., OpenStax, BCcampus, University of Min-
    nesota Libraries Publishing, Open SUNY Textbooks).

· Identify or create an assessment rubric based on common accessibility
    standards.

· Evaluate a prioritized list of OTL resources using the rubric, draft a
    statement about each resource to accompany rubric evaluation, and
    identify areas for improvement.

· Maintain formal notes in Google project folder about the process of
    identifying and applying evaluation criteria.

· Draft accessibility guidelines and best practices for OER creation at
    UTA.

Methods

Researching Best Practices
The primary goal of the project was to evaluate the accessibility of open
textbooks being considered for adoption by UTA faculty and staff and
to determine whether these texts aligned with critical accessibility stan-
dards. To accomplish this goal, the project team conducted research on
online publishing, accessibility, universal design, and OER. Additionally,
the intern interviewed students on campus about the struggles they faced
when reading textbooks online. Through the semester, the team experi-
enced firsthand the issues students with disabilities face when using open
textbooks and discovered the pressing need for a focus on accessibility in
discussions about OER.

    The student intern made efficient and educated contributions to the
project by building on foundational knowledge derived from her course-
work (specifically from courses on universal design and the history of
disability). However, the intern's previous exposure to OER and publish-
ing was limited. Therefore, readings and training around the purpose,
goals, and role of OER in higher education were integrated into the re-
search process. The intern learned about OER and Creative Commons
licensing using resources such as "Models of OER" (Margulies, Sinou, &
Thille, 2005) and "7 Things you should know about OER" (EDUCAUSE
Learning Initiative, 2010). Although resources about OER tend to note
the importance of achieving openness by proactively communicating "5R"
Experiential Learning and Open Education  97

permissions to users (i.e., revise, remix, reuse, redistribute, and retain),
many do not mention accessibility or accommodation of OER. This com-
mon omission highlighted the importance of the project team's work in
raising awareness of accessibility problems in open textbooks.

    Research on the application of universal design principles to create
inclusive OER also informed our work. Universal design is a disability
studies and design concept that advocates for the conscious design of
products that have equitable use for all people. Seven basic principles of
universal design guide the creation of products and spaces to ensure they
are universally usable (Burgstahler, 2012):

· Equitable use
· Flexibility in use
· Simple and intuitive use
· Perceptible information
· Tolerance for error
· Low physical effort
· Size and space for approach and use

When creating OER one goal should be usability by all students, and
these seven principles help ensure that resources created benefit a wide
range of students with varying mental and physical abilities. We used the
principles to guide our approach to the evaluation process, as they go
hand-in-hand with best practices in accessible design. OER created with
these principles in mind tend to be the most accessible to all students.

Key Resources
Numerous resources provide useful overviews about designing with a fo-
cus on accessibility. The following resources were particularly helpful in
guiding our work:

    BCcampus Open Education Accessibility Toolkit: Originally
published as BC Open Textbook Accessibility Toolkit, this is a valuable
resource for those learning about accessibility and its role in OER. The
Toolkit walks readers through BCcampus' best practices for accessibility
and explains why various accessibility standards are important. The
Toolkit identifies several ebook elements that demand special consider-
ation (e.g., images, color contrast, and multimedia) and teaches readers
98  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

how to design these elements so they are accessible to all students. It
also suggests different methods of testing for accessibility in these areas.
The Toolkit can be accessed at https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/
(Coolidge, Doner, & Robertson, 2015).

    Flexible Learning for Open Education (Floe): Floe is a grant-

funded project managed by the Inclusive Design Research Centre at
OCAD University. The website lists recommended practices for online
publishing and offers tools for developers that show what accessible and
inaccessible publications and sites look like. The resource is available at
https://floeproject.org/ (Treviranus, Mitchell, & Clark, n.d).

    WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool: WAVE is an online

accessibility checker that helps complete accurate accessibility evaluations
by analyzing webpages for inaccessible content. The tool came in handy
when evaluating HTML versions of texts and can scan for missing head-
ers, missing alternative text on pictures, and inaccessible buttons on the
webpage that can be easily overlooked during manual evaluations. We
used the accessibility checker to perform an initial scan of each OER for
formatting and textual errors. The WAVE accessibility checker can be
found at http://wave.webaim.org (Web Accessibility In Mind, n.d.).

    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG): WCAG served

as a master list of requirements and accessibility references during the
evaluations. These guidelines outline the current accessibility standards in
online publications and informed the creation of our evaluation rubric.
WCAG should be considered when conducting accessibility evaluation
on HTML versions of ebooks. It can be accessed at https://www.w3.org/
WAI/intro/wcag (Henry, 2017).

Developing a Rubric
To assess the accessibility of the open textbooks in our sample, we created
an evaluation rubric with eight accessibility standards. We evaluated each
of the textbooks based on the eight standards listed below and gave them
a passing or failing score based on their adherence to each accessibility
standard. We found that most failed to meet the accessibility standards for
images and tables whereas other standards, such as color contrast and con-
tent organization, almost universally passed. Below is a discussion of the
eight standards we evaluated and an explanation of how we tested them.
Experiential Learning and Open Education  99

1. Content organization: Evaluating the open textbooks for clear or-

    ganization and structure ensures the text is usable by a variety of stu-
    dents. When checking the books for content organization, evaluate
    headings and titles, the table of contents, chapter and page numbers,
    and general reading layout and order.
    A. Heading and titles: Open textbooks are generally organized

         into sections and chapters. These should be created with spe-
         cific markup (header 1, header 2, title 1, title 2) and should
         always be distinct from body and footnote text. Chapter titles
         and section headers that are in bold or in larger font are not
         distinguishable by VoiceOver and other assistive technology
         (AT). All chapter headers and titles should remain in their cor-
         rect location during text reflow, which is when a document's
         contents change shape and shift position on a screen (e.g., fol-
         lowing magnification).
    B. Table of contents with navigation: A table of contents should be
         present and functioning in the ebook. Students using open text-
         books should be able to "flip" to certain chapters and specific page
         numbers as they would if reading a traditional book. The table of
         contents should be compatible with screen readers. It is necessary
         to check each table of contents with a screen reader to ensure that
         students requiring use of a screen reader have complete access to
         the table of contents. It is also important that the table of contents
         is created as an ordered list so that students using a screen reader
         or keyboard-only navigation can easily navigate through the table
         of content list and into the text.
    C. Working page numbers: Ebook page numbers should correspond
         to the print version of the book. It is important for the digital ver-
         sion to have working page numbers so students opting to use it
         are able to follow along with those in the course using the print
         version. HTML versions often omit page numbers and show each
         chapter's content on a single web page. This numbering style is
         more accessible for students reading the text online as they do
         not have to refresh each page and can scroll through the chapter.
         PDF and epub version of ebooks, however, should have tradi-
         tional page numbers.
100  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    D. Reading layout and order: All chapters and chapter subsections
         of the ebook should be logically ordered and easily followed by
         users and screen readers. All content should be displayed left to
         right as well as up and down the page. It is vital for ebooks to
         follow the same structure and organization as traditional texts.
         When checking reading layout, use various screen readers to read
         through portions of the text to verify that content can be accu-
         rately read to students. Also, check to ensure that non-textual
         elements of the ebooks, such as images and graphs, are read in the
         correct order and in line with the text.

2. Images: Many textbooks include images that are informative and

    provide vital information that supplements the text on the page. Im-
    ages are a common accessibility problem area and are often inaccessi-
    ble to students using screen readers or screen modifications. Students
    with low vision or auditory preference use screen readers to "read"
    texts. Without proper markup, images are not detected by screen
    readers. Students with dyslexia, colorblindness, and other learning
    disabilities may use a colored display or other screen modification
    when using ebooks. As with screen readers, many images are ren-
    dered inaccessible when used with these types of AT. To assess images
    in an ebook, choose a minimum of 20 non-decorative and decorative
    images from random chapters and analyze each one individually be-
    fore passing or failing the standard.
    A. Non-decorative image alternative text: Images of examples,

         charts, and graphs or images that contain other vital information
         should have written alternative text in the form of an alt tag or
         image description. These images are essential elements of the text
         and should be created to be accessible for all students. A text tag
         accompanying the image allows students with low vision using
         screen readers to access images by providing a written description
         of the image that can be read by screen readers. Alternative tags
         also allow students using color overlays or monochrome displays
         to view the image.
    B. Decorative images are marked with null text: Images that do not
         contribute any new educational information, or decorative im-
         ages, should be marked with "null" alternative text. These images
Experiential Learning and Open Education  101

         are not vital elements of the text and do not have to be accompa-
         nied by a text tag.
    C. Complex images have descriptions: Images such as graphs, tables,
         or equations that require interpretation should have a caption
         that includes a description of the image and the data it presents.
         This helps students using screen readers to fully understand
         graphs, equations, etc., but also ensures that all data are presented
         in two ways. Students who do not perceive color or choose to lis-
         ten to their ebook also benefit from image descriptions.
    D. Compatibility with magnification and color contrast AT: All im-
         ages should be compatible with magnification software. Test se-
         lected images with browser plug-ins, such as Zoom for Chrome,
         to determine whether images are compatible with this type of
         software. Images should be able to reflow when magnified. Ad-
         ditionally, all images should be viewable when magnified up to
         200 percent. It is also important to test images with various
         screen modifications to determine whether content is viewable
         in alternate color schemes and display options. Images should be
         viewable in grayscale, with monochrome displays, and on high-
         and low-contrast screens.
3. Tables: Similar to images, tables require captions and textual descrip-

    tions, and they should be created to be compatible with assistive and
    non-assistive technologies. To test tables in ebooks, select a minimum
    of 20 tables throughout the text and check them for simplicity and
    viewability. Although tables are generally accessible to all, there are two
    main accessibility standards to consider when evaluating this element.
    A. Simple tables that are compatible with AT: Tables should be simple

         in the sense that they are clean, single-celled, and clearly labeled.
         Tables should be created with a specific markup, and all infor-
         mation should be entered as ordered lists. All tables need to have
         titles and labeled rows and columns. Split cells are discouraged.
         When tables are not created in a simple, ordered way they are in-
         decipherable to screen readers. Use screen readers, such as NVDA
         and Kurzweil, to test tables in PDF versions of open textbooks
         and browser plug-ins, such as Reader for Chrome, to test those in
         HTML versions.
102  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    B. Tables compatible with magnification AT: all tables should be com-
         patible with magnification software and should maintain structure
         during text reflow. Students with low vision and certain learning
         disabilities need to manipulate the text size and font. Ensure tables
         maintain their structure and viewability when the surrounding text
         is reflowed. Magnify tables with plug-ins, such as Zoom for
         Chrome, and other magnification AT to ensure all information in
         the tables can be magnified to 200 percent.

4. Hyperlinks: Though specific only to the digital version of a text, hy-

    perlinks are a vital part of the textbook and need to be accessible to
    all students. Students using screen readers or altered displays are of-
    ten unable to distinguish hyperlinks from the rest of the body text. To
    evaluate accessibility, check up to 40 different hyperlinks throughout
    each text with screen readers and high- and low-contrast screens to
    test their universal usability.
    A. In-book links function: In-book links are hyperlinks that connect

         to another location in the text, such as links in a table of contents
         that connect to specific images or locations in a chapter. These
         links should be a distinct color from the body text and should
         connect to their correct location when clicked. Test at least 20
         in-book links from different locations in the chapter by clicking
         to check functionality and by reading them with a screen reader.
         Links should be created with specific markup so the link title,
         rather than the URL, is read by the screen reader. Often, hyper-
         links are inconsistently marked, so it is important to test links
         from throughout the text.
    B. Live hyperlinks function: Live hyperlinks are links that connect
         to outside webpages, usually for additional information, exam-
         ples, or videos. Any content linked in an ebook should be assessed
         for accessibility standards. When testing links that connect to
         external videos and webpages, check videos for captions and web-
         pages for compatibility with different AT. As with in-book links,
         live hyperlinks should be a distinct color from the text, even when
         underlined or italicized. All links should have a descriptive title
         that is not the URL. Links should be created with specific markup
         that allows screen readers to recognize them as links.
Experiential Learning and Open Education  103

    C. All links are descriptive: Links should be obvious and distinct from
         the rest of the text. Links should be descriptively titled, as noted
         above (e.g., "Examples of UD" vs. www.universaldesign.com/
         7principles/example/110). They should be underlined and in a dif-
         ferent color than that of the body text. Evaluate the contrast of
         links with a color contrast analyzer to ensure they are visible for
         students using screen modifications or high/low-contrast screens.

5. Multimedia: Some ebooks include videos, interactive diagrams, or

    links to websites with interactive elements, videos, and other multi-
    media content. This content must be accessible by all students.
    A. Open or closed captions: Any video included or linked in the text

         should be fully captioned, complete with action captions when
         necessary. Check all videos in the text for proper captioning to
         ensure all content is accessible to students with low vision and
         low hearing or to English as a Second Language (ESL) students
         requiring translation.
    B. Transcript: Transcripts should be easily accessible for all videos
         linked in the text. Additionally, transcripts should be compatible
         with screen readers and provide a complete transcription of all
         multimedia content. This is helpful both for students with dis-
         abilities and those wishing to access the video without using
         headphones or watching a screen.
    C. Audio/video media player is compatible with AT: The platform
         and player presenting videos and other multimedia content should
         be compatible with all screen readers, magnification software, and
         color contrast modifications.
    D. Flickering: There should be no flickering content in the text. Any
         content that flashes more than three times per second is dangerous
         and inaccessible to some users. Check all parts of the text including
         videos, animations, and all interactive content for flickering.
6. Formulas: Math and engineering textbooks use formulas through-

    out the text. It is important that these formulas are created with a
    specific equation editor to ensure they are compatible with screen
    readers and "select and speak" functions. Test formulas from various
    chapter locations in the text to check for consistent markup and
    viewability for all students.
104  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    A. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) formulas
         and equations are created with a compatible equation editor such
         as LaTeX or MathML: Formulas should be created and inserted
         in the text with an equation editor. Formulas typed directly into
         text along with other body text are not distinguishable by screen
         readers. To test for accessibility, choose a number of formulas
         from different chapters and read them with a screen reader. Each
         should be recognizable by the reader as a formula and read in a
         way that makes sense to student only able to hear the formula.

    B. Images of equations with alternative tags: Alternatively, equa-
         tions can be inserted into the text as images with accompanying
         text descriptions.

7. Font: All body and header fonts should be compatible with assistive

    and non- assistive technology. It is important to check the reflowabil-
    ity of fonts to ensure students may adjust fonts and visibility settings
    to their own preferences when using open textbooks.
    A. Font is adjustable and compatible with screen readers: In all

         ebook formats, font size and style should be adjustable. If font,
         color, or page background color are not adjustable with non-
         assistive technology, check that they are compatible with other
         AT. All textual information should be visible in grayscale and on
         high/low-contrast screens and should be compatible with screen
         readers and "select and speak" functions.
    B. Zoom capabilities (up to 200%): Fonts should be compatible with
         magnification AT and capable of zoom to 200 percent. Text
         should be compatible with reflow. Test several locations of text
         to ensure when text, images, or pages are resized the text restruc-
         tures and holds its original shape.
    C. Standard font (12 pt. body, 9pt. footnote): Check that all body and
         footnote text adheres to WCAG AA size guidelines. Traditional
         body text should be no larger than 12 pt., and footnotes should be
         no larger than 9pt.
8. Color contrast: Color is an important element of ebooks that is often

    overlooked. All information presented in color should also have a text
    or shape alternative. For example, a graph with information repre-
    sented in color should also mark data points with circles, diamonds, or
Experiential Learning and Open Education  105

    squares. Use a color contrast analyzer to test contrast ratios in the text
    and confirm all components of the text (e.g., images, chapter headers,
    section titles, interactive elements, links) are accessible to students
    viewing the textbook with various screen modifications. All color el-
    ements should adhere to WCAG standards.
    A. All information presented with color is also conveyed in a way

         understood by those who do not perceive color: Any information
         in images or graphs presented in color must also have a textual
         description in order to be accessible to students with low vision
         or students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia.
     B. Contrast for headers passes WCAG AA standards: Headers
         should meet WCAG AA contrast ratio requirement of 4:4:1. Use
         a color contrast analyzer to check this requirement.
     C. Contrast for body and footnote text passes WCAG AA standards:
         Contrast for text must also meet required standards.

Results
We completed 20 open textbook evaluations using the eight criteria and
gained valuable insight to the usability of open textbooks and their biggest
accessibility problem areas. With few exceptions, most of the open text-
books we evaluated were not universally accessible to all students. Some
of the open textbooks were generally accessible, with only a few problem
areas, while others managed to pass only one or two of the eight acces-
sibility standards. The evaluations were telling, and the project team was
able to identify accessibility problem areas common to most of the open
textbooks in our sample.

    Standard 1: Content organization. Eighteen out of the 20 open

textbooks evaluated passed this standard. Many of the books were miss-
ing specific elements of this standard, such as clear headings and titles
or a table of contents with navigation, but on the whole, many open
textbooks were accessible in terms of organization and navigation. This
standard is important as it gauges how easily a student will be able
to navigate a textbook. Well-designed organizational elements benefit
all students wishing to navigate through the text via keyboard-only or
through an assistive technology such as VoiceOver or NVDA. Open
textbooks that do not pass this standard are likely unusable for such stu-
106  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

dents. Proper header and title markup are essential for easy navigation
through the text.

    Standard 2: Images. Eight out of 20 open textbooks evaluated passed

this standard. Our project revealed images to be a huge accessibility prob-
lem area for OER. In many texts, images are central to the information
and should be viewable by all students, regardless of ability. Most open
textbooks that failed this standard had non-decorative images throughout
the text with no alternative text. When images are not accompanied by
alternative text, students with low vision are not able to access them. Ad-
ditionally, students with learning disabilities that require them to listen
to the text are also unable to easily "view" the image. Many of the images
throughout the text were inconsistently marked with alternative tags.
Such a practice suggests that the creators had some knowledge of ac-
cessibility and the need for accommodation but approached the task of
integrating alternative text with carelessness.

    Standard 3: Tables. Ten out of 20 open textbooks evaluated passed

this standard. Tables are another accessibility problem area in the texts
we analyzed. Like images, tables are often a central element of textbooks.
Especially with STEM books, it is critical that tables are compatible with
assistive technology and readable by all students. Many of the open text-
books we tested had complex tables, with multiple sets of information per
cell. This makes it impossible for a screen reader or browser extension
to decipher the table and read it to the student. Tables were also disor-
ganized, lacked titles, and did not have clearly labeled rows and columns.
Some disorganized tables are difficult to follow by able-bodied students
and are impossible to navigate when reading with assistive technology.
Many tables are also not adaptive to reflow, so they lose structure and
viewability when the page or font is resized. Students with low vision and
students requiring screen modifications are unable to properly view tables
when they are not formatted correctly and inserted into the text without
proper markup.

    Standard 4: Hyperlinks. Seventeen of 20 open textbooks evaluated

passed this standard. In general, most of the open textbooks we looked at
had accessible hyperlinks that were usable by students with a wide range
of abilities. Most of the texts had both in-book and live hyperlinks that
functioned, connected to the correct location, and were distinct from the
Experiential Learning and Open Education  107

rest of the text. The open textbooks that did not meet this standard failed
to distinguish hyperlinks from the informational body text through color
or italicizing. This makes it impossible for students of all abilities to distin-
guish links from text. Others that failed this standard used colors that did
not meet contrast requirements to distinguish links. Students who do not
perceive color or who use screen modifications for other learning disabili-
ties are not able to access the links that do not meet contrast requirements
as they are not visible on their screens.

    Standard 5: Multimedia. Nineteen of 20 open textbooks evaluated

passed this standard. Almost all of the open textbooks we evaluated had
little to no multimedia content and none had any flickering content. Like
hyperlinks, as most multimedia is web-based, videos and other online
content are generally compatible with different assistive technologies and
usable by many students.

    Standard 6: Formulas. Fourteen of 20 open textbooks evaluated

passed this standard. Most of the STEM books analyzed that failed these
standards are completely unusable by low vision students, despite passing
other accessibility standards. In STEM books, elements like equations and
formulas are central to the book and must be usable by all students if in-
corporated in the classroom. Many of the books tested inserted equations
and formulas as text lines that are only accessible to an able-bodied stu-
dent reading the ebook as a traditional book. Any student wishing to use
any accommodation, or students with specific learning and physical dis-
abilities, would be unable to access equations. Screen readers are unable
to read equations correctly unless created with MathML or LaTeX. Many
equations are also images without alternative text and cannot be magni-
fied or adapted in any way to fit high- and low-contrast screens.

    Standard 7: Font. Nineteen of 20 open textbooks tested passed this

standard. Most versions of the open textbooks passed this standard. Font
in most of the open textbooks was compatible with screen readers, high-
and low-contrast screens, and magnification AT. Many books allowed for
adjusting font size and style, background color, lighting, and page size with
no issues. Open textbooks that do not pass this standard are difficult to use
for students with specific reading preferences when using open textbooks.

    Standard 8: Color contrast. Nineteen of 20 open textbooks analyzed

passed this standard. Most of the open textbooks easily passed this stan-
108  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

dard, as most creators seemed to abide by WCAG AA contrast standards.
Although some books failed certain requirements of this standard, color
use as a whole was found to be accessible by a wide range of students and
compatible with various AT.

Discussion
The results of our evaluations not only revealed common accessibility
problems but also highlighted harmful assumptions about disability and
higher education. As we completed the reviews, it became clear that many
of the open textbooks were created with a specific student in mind: a
fully able-bodied student with no physical or learning disabilities. Though
often overlooked, the design of products, such as public spaces and text-
books, perpetuate common social biases against people with disabilities.
In many of the open textbooks, images were inserted without captions,
assuming the reader would be able to view the image with no issue. Equa-
tions were inserted as text, assuming a traditional reading of the textbook
rather than one requiring a screen reader. Headers and links were created
in colors and fonts that do not adhere to accessibility standards, assum-
ing all readers fully perceive color and do not use modifications. These
problem areas show the widespread and deep-reaching exclusion of peo-
ple with disabilities from higher education.

    These accessibility problem areas in open textbooks represent a larger
problem in colleges and universities across the nation. When OER are
created with faulty assumptions of students' mental and physical abilities,
OER become part of a larger social problem that systematically excludes
students with disabilities from equal education. Though licensed openly,
many of the OER we reviewed were completely closed to students with
disabilities and students wishing to access texts through nontraditional ac-
commodations.

    In order to gain a better understanding of the issues these students
face when using ebooks for university courses, the disability studies intern
met with students to discuss the problem areas identified in our eval-
uations. The practice of treating accessibility and accommodation as an
ongoing conversation revealed additional aspects of ebook accessibility
that should be considered. By the end of the semester we reworked the
evaluation rubric to include two additional standards, Interactive Ele-
Experiential Learning and Open Education  109

ments and Accessibility Documentation. Interactive elements in ebooks
(e.g., animations, quizzes and knowledge checks, calculators) should also
be checked for accessibility. Like photos and tables, interactive functions
should be compatible with adaptive and nonadaptive technologies. The
revised rubric is included in the Appendix. It is now used at UTA to guide,
evaluate, and revise (if necessary) OER creation projects that are currently
underway. Future projects could refine rubrics further to evaluate OER
for accessibility for a specific set of students or for compatibility with a
specific AT.

    Finally, the intern expressed gratitude for the experiential learning
opportunity and noted the value of speaking with students on campus
about their struggles in confirming the importance of this project. Her
summative reflection also demonstrated an increased understanding of
issues surrounding access to information and of student behaviors in re-
sponse to access barriers. Additionally, our work revealed that students
use accommodations and AT for a multitude of reasons and that universal
accessibility benefits all students and not just those with physical and
learning disabilities. The experience shed light on student frustrations and
invisible barriers that hinder students' education and provided a useful
perspective to the intern as a prospective teacher. It also provided her the
opportunity to share her expertise and scholarship publicly through co-
authorship of this chapter.

Conclusion
The partnership between the two UTA units was a win for all stakehold-
ers. The Libraries benefited by being able to contribute to experiential
learning at UTA and by growing expertise on accessibility and universal
design; the student benefited from the opportunity to apply coursework in
a real-world setting and reference the experience in résumés, portfolios,
and future applications; and the program administrators benefited from
having a reliable site to recommend to students with an interest in pub-
lishing, education, or other relevant fields.

    The results of the evaluation project, however, demonstrated that
there is significant room for growth in OER and in how we as a com-
munity discuss and prioritize accessibility. Future interns matched with
the UTA Libraries will be asked to contribute to this growth by con-
110  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ducting similar evaluations of both existing resources and OER currently

under development by UTA faculty and staff, by providing remediation

assistance as necessary to improve the accessibility of OER, and by investi-

gating strategies for sharing findings and best practices in order to benefit

the greater OER community and the students we serve. Open education

coordinators and project managers at other institutions are encouraged to

explore similar partnership opportunities with students and staff with ex-

pertise in disability studies in order to expand their own knowledge of the

subject, provide meaningful learning experiences for students, and ensure

that the open resources we create are truly open to all.

                Unpacking the Opaque Box

Introduction
Course material adoption within higher education is a complex, pedagog-
ically driven, but relatively opaque process. To students, librarians, and
those not teaching semester-length courses or involved in curriculum de-
sign, course material evaluation and selection in higher education can feel
like a black box: opaque, proprietary, and mysterious, minimally transpar-
ent with only a few clues available through institutional policy require-
ments or instructor disclosures. Few instructors seem to openly discuss
course materials among themselves or others. For open education ad-
vocates this opacity poses a problem. How can one provide relevant,
customized information regarding open options when scant information
is available regarding instructor motivations, criteria, processes, and ulti-
mately curriculum or pedagogy decisions?

    Several reasons exist for this opacity: a lack of training during instruc-
tors' college and graduate programs, and cultural factors which perpetuate
limited discussion of course material selection processes. Authors in both
K-12 and higher education indicated that there are few training opportu-
nities (Stein, Steuen, Carnine, & Long, 2001, p. 8; Allen & Seaman, 2014,
p. 5) or that they have "little formal knowledge" (Smith & DeRidder, 1997,
p. 367) of criteria used to evaluate textbooks or of protocols used by other
institutions for textbook selection. A humanities faculty member reflects
the limited, but changing culture of sharing within higher education:

      There is a strangely idiosyncratic culture around course re-
      sources that is perhaps the consequence of academic freedom
      traditions in the US. There is little centralized sharing of best
116  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

      practices [regarding learning resource evaluation], although
      social media has changed this somewhat--I have witnessed
      substantial Facebook threads on textbook selection and ap-
      proaches to teaching specific topics. Resource awareness and
      selection should be part of teacher training, which graduate
      students at Research I institutions do not receive. (Full-time
      humanities faculty in Allen & Seaman, 2014, p. 5)

There are likely other reasons including limited time, few perceived re-
wards for sharing, political factors, or a perception that course material
selection falls outside of one's area of research and expertise.

    To education advocates, this lack of transparency may be viewed a
missed learning opportunity for instructors and graduate students bound
for teaching, as well as students themselves who might miss out on the
benefits of their instructors' knowledge and skill. For open education ad-
vocates, especially those based within libraries, the lack of transparency
also poses some practical problems. The least of these problems is the bar-
rier to joining and contributing to existing conversations and processes.
At worst, lack of transparency regarding course material selection nega-
tively affects the abilities of open advocates and librarians to carefully de-
sign appropriate, insightful, scalable, and effective programs and services
for a range of open education applications. Open education advocates and
librarians have a great deal to gain in better understanding course material
evaluation processes and selection decisions. Better understanding these
processes means a greater ability to join existing conversations, better
understanding of the particulars of how their specific institution works,
opportunities to expand one's area of expertise, and the opportunity to
add value regardless of the processes found.

Why it Matters
In 2007, the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance issued
a report stating "faculty have been faulted for largely ignoring price, rou-
tinely assigning textbooks only partially relevant to the course, switching
from textbook to textbook on a whim, selecting lower-priced alternatives
very rarely and failing to use all the material in the bundles students are
required to buy" (p. 1). Students groan under the cost of course materi-
als, many choosing to download illegal in-copyright copies, share, borrow,
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box  117

or go without. Students may express frustration when very little of the
course material they purchased is actually used, or when they are re-
quired to spend extra money to rent homework software in order to
submit homework (Walz, 2015). Students are increasingly deciding to not
to acquire access to required textbooks, believing that lecture material
is a substitute for textbooks. Many feel overwhelmed by the expanding
amount and variety of resources (Berry, Cook, Hill, & Stevens, 2011).

    Applying the dialectic concept of "open" as sharing, give-and-take,
contributing, and giving credit, open practices are quite possibly the an-
tithesis of the current idiosyncratic culture around course resources.
However, as applied to many other aspects of higher education, the ethic
or concept of "openness" is highly valued and directly relevant to the
purpose and practices valued in higher education teaching and learning,
research, and service activities, not to mention professional ethics and
responsible use of resources. A lack of transparency and exchange of
learning and expertise regarding course material selection appears to be a
missed opportunity that affects instructors as well as students.

    Conceptions of open education vary. Open education does not just in-
clude OER (open educational resources) or just open pedagogy or open
source infrastructure. Open practices described in Librarians as Open Edu-
cation Advocates describe a foundation which I believe has potential appli-
cations for teaching, research and scholarship, publishing, system design,
outreach, service, and nearly any other function championed in higher ed-
ucation (McKernan, Skirko, & West, 2015). The authors describe these
open practices as: sharing, giving (and receiving) [constructive] feedback,
sharing and integrating new ideas about teaching and learning, under-
standing and using open licenses whenever possible, giving credit to oth-
ers for their work, and "considering students and their needs as central to
the activity of teaching and learning" (McKernan, Skirko, & West, 2015).

    As practitioner-scholars, many academic librarians and instructional
designers are already involved in open educational practices and engaged
in modeling, championing, critiquing, improving, inventing, and/or sup-
porting various open educational practices. Many instructors also within
higher education adhere to and implement these values by sharing, valu-
ing student learning, and providing service to their community, insti-
tution, and disciplinary associations. Sharing potentially messy processes
118  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

regarding teaching and learning is perhaps not easy. My intent is to iden-
tify what we can know about this seemingly hidden process.

    This chapter is intended to provide an introduction to the myriad ways
that course materials are or could be evaluated, selected, and incorporated
into curricular design with an emphasis on the contributions that could
be made regarding course material selection by open education librarians.
It reviews the literature in which instructors in higher education describe
their learning material selection processes, the very few large studies cov-
ering course material selection evaluations in multiple disciplines, and the
prescriptive literature describing how course material can--or should--be
selected. This chapter touches on traditional course materials and those that
have emerged as educational theory, technology, and instructor readiness
have changed over time, making this one snapshot in a quickly changing
environment.1 And it asks the question: Where can an open education ad-
vocate, or simply someone that cares about teaching and learning, start to
make a contribution if they are not the course material decision-maker?

    My hope in writing this chapter is that librarians and others involved
in the open education movement who are also interested in applying open
principles as a way to add value to teaching and learning processes will
benefit from additional information regarding course material produc-
tion, evaluation, and selection practices. I also hope that readers will be
motivated to become increasingly savvy and valuable consultants and ex-
perts regarding course material selection in general and openly licensed
course material use, production, or publishing, in particular, and that they
will leverage open practices to solve problems in higher education.

What is in that Box? Course Material Evaluation and
Selection
Several groups of literature predominate this area of study: Descriptive ar-
ticles document rigorous processes of course material selection for particu-

1 While written for the US higher education sphere, some characteristics
will be applicable to countries beyond the United States and/or to the K-12
environment, though both these groups differ enough in regulatory con-
text, procedures (especially regarding state or local control or alignment to
standards), and pedagogical practices that the reader will need to carefully
consider their particular context.
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box  119

lar college-level disciplines (accounting, foreign language, psychology, and
history). Prescriptive documents, such as the dated but otherwise excel-
lent Handbook for Evaluating and Selecting Curriculum Materials (Gall, 1981),
and various shorter guides and rubrics provide recommended approaches.
Thoughtful analyses of how course materials, philosophies of education,
pedagogical approaches, and differing levels of teaching expertise interact
with one another are relevant in this area. Last are the very few recent large
quantitative studies, which explore instructors' values in course materials
and activities undertaken by instructors in selecting materials for courses.

Aspects of Course Materials Instructors Value Most
Recent large-scale studies on this topic in the U.S. or Canada reported
that teachers in higher education most highly value comprehensiveness,
effectiveness, cost, and writing quality in their evaluation of textbooks
or course materials. A number of large-scale studies identify the top re-
ported values. Individual articles supplement these with additional values
not listed in the large-scale studies. And finally, the rubric used in the
Open Textbook Library adds several.

(Are College Textbooks Priced Fairly?, 2004; U.S. Government Accountabil-
ity Office, 2005; Popken, 2015) and the orientation of many institutions
and some open education advocates toward cost, readers may have a
particular interest in how instructors value cost. While cost appeared pe-
riodically in the top three most important factors, suggesting that cost is
a factor, it was rarely reported as the most important factor. Hsu and Lin
(1999) affirmed cost "as a relatively important conversation in textbook
adoption ... but [not] important enough to dictate the textbook selec-
tion decision" (p. 25). In reviewing Allen and Seaman's 2014 survey,2 cost

ranked as the lowest factor of all of the factors listed, but jumped to the top
of the list in 2016 (Allen & Seaman, 2014, 2016). The 2016 report clarified
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box          121

this: it appears that faculty consider cost ceteris paribus: all other things be-
ing equal. "Faculty reinforce the idea that cost to the student is important,
but only after content, relevance, quality, and presentation have been con-
sidered. Cost alone is not sufficient to drive the resource selection" (Allen
& Seaman, 2016, p. 10). Factors which could be described as reflecting ac-
curacy, effectiveness, and appropriateness of "fit" to subject and the given
context seem to summarize the values well.

Course Material Selection Activities
We turn now to the literature on course material selection activities.
The research literature on systematic course material selection processes
abounds in K-12 literature. The literature, however within higher ed-
ucation is limited in quantity and tends to be highly discipline-specific.
Further, higher education literature on systematic course material evalu-
ation and selection leans toward novel high-effort approaches rather than
repeatable, manageable, sustainable, and likely less flashy practices.

    A few examples of these novel and wide-ranging approaches however
may be helpful: One article examined five leading American Government
texts, comparing their structure, guiding perspectives, in-text and elec-
tronic features for students and faculty, and notable strengths and weak-
nesses "with the goal of identifying appealing textbooks for instructors
who value different approaches" (Knutson, 2017, p. 536). In the field of
foreign languages, a study summarized an admittedly "time consuming"
two-year collaborative textbook selection process for Spanish language
instruction, which included the development of a 19-item evaluation
rubric suitable for application to foreign language texts, collaborative and
reflective review of results, and satisfaction rankings one year later (Cz-
erwionka & Gorokhovsky, 2015, p. 4). A student, medical resident, and
faculty textbook review process for pharmacy students aims to understand
a learner-centric approach to textbook evaluation and selection, and to de-
scribe differences in textbook selection preferences between students and
faculty (Peeters, Churchwell, Maura, Cappelletty, & Stone, 2010, p. 31).
To complete an apparent gap in the literature, a dissertation by Tate

2 Reports from this series are informally referenced as "the Babson re-
port."
122  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

reported on the determinants for selecting a successful principles of eco-
nomics textbook based on an analysis of six adoptive criteria: textbook-in-
tegrated learning aids, organization format or layout, content, readability
and rigor, and ancillaries for students and ancillaries for instructors (Tate,
1991, p. 66).

    These are likely some of the exemplars illustrating new and novel
practices. But how do all of the other time-strapped instructors in higher
education select course materials? What are their roles? And what do they
actually do?

    The policies, strategies, and cultures of an institution and department
determine how decisions regarding how to teach and what course materi-
als to use are resolved. In general, and consistent with academic freedom
in universities, decisions are made by an individual instructor or staff
member, by teams of instructors, or by departmental curriculum commit-
tees. While often championed as an individual right, a department may
choose not to extend the freedom to select course materials to individuals,
seating this authority in committees. Given the importance of academic
freedom in higher education, course material decisions are rarely made at
the administrative level, but it does happen (Jhangiani, 2017).

    Every educational institution is different from the next. At the large
Research 1 Polytechnic University where I am employed, I have not found
a consistent pattern of course material decision processes based on dis-
cipline type or level of course. For example: learning materials for some
introductory courses in the sciences are decided by a committee which
identifies core knowledge and skills students must master as a foundation
for more advanced courses. Other large introductory courses on the more
analytic side of social sciences are taught in sections by three or four
different instructors, each using different textbooks and/or homework
software, presumably equally able to prepare students to build on the sub-
ject material, but taking a different approach. Some departments choose a
common text for fall and spring semesters but allow for experiments and
other types of course material during summer or online sessions. Other
departments in which large introductory courses are team-taught appoint
a course coordinator who either builds consensus or decides about course
materials. These committees and individuals may have formal or informal
processes for course material selection.
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box         123

    Two patterns that seem to be prevalent pertain to textbook authors
and tenure-track faculty. These observations vary widely from one insti-
tution or institutional type to the next, where different structures, tra-
ditions, and culture prevail. This implies value in knowing one's own
institution and interpretation of academic freedom. For textbook authors,
the decision at my institution is simple: current policy allows authors to
require the book they authored in their course.3 For tenure-track faculty
teaching upper division and graduate levels, decisions about course de-
sign, teaching methods, and course content are solely their prerogative.
This practice opens the door to a growing number of faculty that in-
creasingly teach from their notes and/or select course readings from a
variety of sources, an approach suggested by several authors (Novotny,
2011; Landrum, 2012) and anecdotally more common. When a tenure-
track instructor suddenly inherits a course and the instructor's predeces-
sor is accessible, the inheriting instructor is likely to seriously consider
the previous instructor's recommendation regarding course material and
teaching methods. In contrast, and common to most institutions grap-
pling with an increase in temporary, adjunct, graduate teaching assistant,
or non-tenure line instructors, is the assignment of course materials by
someone other than the course instructor. External choice often leaves
few happy with the selection of text or the proscribed role of the text in
the course. The divide between teaching-focused and tenure faculty con-
tinues and is an important characteristic to know about.

Prescriptive Perspectives and Processes for Review of
Course Materials
Process matters and many scholars have opinions and suggestions re-
garding how learning materials should be selected. Again, this literature is
weighted toward analysis of traditional print textbooks, though some con-
cepts may be transferable to interactive electronic resources. By far, the
most insightful one-volume handbook I located is Meredith Gall's 1981
Handbook for Evaluating and Selecting Curriculum Materials. While out of

Instructional Materials http://provost.vt.edu/faculty_affairs/fac-
ulty_handbook/chapter09/chapter09.html
124  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

print and far out of date for electronic, internet-hosted, or interactive
content, the handbook, I believe, accurately and succinctly describes issues
related to any era of course material selection. Especially helpful for those
wanting an introduction to curriculum studies, Gall mentions the time-
less issues of: curriculum quality and commercialization, roles for various
actors in higher education, the wide range of types of curriculum objects,
the propensity of instructors to limit their searches to what's easily avail-
able, the lack of instructor time and expertise in selecting course materials,
relationships between instruction and course materials, and differences
in learning resources even when options appear to be equivalent. Several
helpful tools are included in the book, including an inventory and descrip-
tion of dimensions for analyzing curriculum materials (Chapters 4-6), a
high-level course material process relevant for any topic and level of ed-
ucation, even higher education, and an appendix of featured curriculum
materials that may facilitate learning. While updates would be needed,
this source is very helpful and takes seriously the importance of selection
of instructional materials in light of the fact that students spend far more
time using instructional material than anyone else (Gall, 1981). (See the
note below for guidance on accessing this out-of-print resource.)4

    Several other authors report on prescriptive course materials selec-
tion processes or report on processes they have created or use. Prosser
offers a summary of text readability analysis processes, prominent in
the literature in the 1970s and 80s, namely using SMOG (Simple Mea-
sure of Gobbledygook) readability and the cloze test (Prosser, 1978).
Heye offers a tool and process for evaluation of textbooks for nursing
that enabled her school to include input from faculty members not
initially involved in course material selection. Implementation of this
process eliminated the need for supplementation of a main outdated
text, reduced costs to students, and resulted in the use of materials
that included updated health care developments (Heye, Jordan, Taylor
Harden, & Edwards, 1987). Novotny provided a checklist for selection

of nursing textbooks and provided guidance in assigning textbooks and
journal reading assignments (Novotny, 2011).

    Several scholars suggest value in having different levels of review.
Lawrence summarized suggestions that the best of textbook evaluation
schemes adopt a "leveled" approach: an initial overview of the strengths
and weaknesses of the book with regard to design and structure, sequence,
visual attractiveness, and availability of ancillary materials, and a further
evaluation which is more detailed and determines whether text, skills and
activities meet syllabus and learner needs (Lawrence, 2011). Kato affirms
multipart approaches, indicating that textbook evaluation conversations
should consist of pre-use evaluation, in-use evaluation, and post-use eval-
uation (Kato, 2014). Arnold's research adds the insight that faculty valued
being part of (textbook) pre-publication review (Arnold, 1989). Multiple
authors cited a need for more instructor training and knowledge regarding
course material selection (Gall, 1981; Stein, Steuen, Carnine & Long, 2001).

Course Materials, Pedagogy, and Levels of Instructor
Expertise
Open education advocates and librarians can benefit from understanding
the intended role or purpose of a text within a course. Texts may be
adopted as a course reference, because textbook adoption is expected even
though the textbook is not well integrated into the course, to aid stu-
dents in building a resource collection, for ease in scaffolding the course
or countering an instructor's self-perceived deficiencies (Lawrence, 2011,
p. 7, Confrey & Stohl, 2004, p. 43-46), or a combination of these reasons.
In theory, course material selection should support course objectives,
instructor pedagogies, and efficacious student learning habits. New in-
structors or instructors with new courses are more likely to adopt "book in
a box" course materials but as they become comfortable with the course or
less risk averse to changing the course away from parts that are not work-
ing, they may become more open to alternate pedagogies and curricular
materials. It is into this dynamic environment that the open education ad-
vocate steps. The open education advocate or librarian may encounter a
wide range of instructor comfort or discomfort with teaching and learn-
ing processes. Some instructors may be experimenting with incremental
or major course design changes. Others may be content with limited in-
126  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

vestment in teaching or feel obligated to focus most of their energies on
research endeavors. The librarian may also observe the impact of the in-
stitution or department's politics and practices, governance and budgeting
constraints, relative importance of career advancement via tenure and
promotion, and individual instructors' tolerance of risk, comfort, and per-
ceived available support; each of these factors can and do influence student
learning outcomes, selection of pedagogical processes, course materials,
an instructor's decision to go without traditional or emerging course ma-
terials, or an instructor's openness to experiment with open pedagogical
approaches. Beyond pressures related to an instructor's career advance-
ment, the relationship between instructor risk tolerance, comfort, and
support, pedagogical understanding and openness to pedagogical and as-
sessment methods, and beliefs regarding the purpose of course materials
should not be understated.

    Usage and types of course materials have changed over time due to ed-
ucational philosophies, legal environments, cultural expectations, availabil-
ity of trained educators, and commercial and technological changes. The
earliest and most traditional course materials were printed textbooks and
readers for children, designed to lead to literacy using catechism (question
and answer) as their instructional mode. In the late 19th century, chang-
ing educational philosophies, the increased availability of trained teachers,
and orientation toward deductive approaches and generalized morals in re-
sponse to high immigration resulted in changes in curriculum resources
(Wakefield, 1998).5 One hundred years later, and in the scope of higher ed-
ucation we see continued evolution of educational philosophies, develop-
ment of cultures of tenure-track and adjunct faculty, an increased propor-
tion of the population expected to engage in higher education, and impacts
of technological change on course materials and instructional practices.
Print resources are supplemented or replaced by digital course materials
and systems. Not dismissing persistent digital divide issues, course materi-
als and learning processes are now embedded in closed learning manage-

ment systems, blogs and wikis, ebooks, online discussion boards, online
homework systems, adaptive learning and intelligent tutors, student-dri-
ven platforms for authoring, game-based learning, and all manner of tools,
clickers, and software systems. All bring pedagogical assumptions, some
evidence-based. Regardless, many are adopted for classroom use.

    Technology-enhanced learning resources represent some of the most
creative, interesting, useful, and potentially responsive but constantly
changing options within learning spaces. Many provide student metrics,
allowing instructors a view of student time on task, theoretical opportu-
nities for early interventions, and a research platform in which to start
to learn what works and what does not work. Some offer freemium ser-
vices, with more advanced premium services available at a fee. Open source
projects are also present in the mix, some with an open business model
(where content costs nothing) and in which services are rented on a sub-
scription basis. The options are constantly changing. Current and new
instructors with limited prior exposure to digital instructional methods or
constantly changing digital learning environments are likely to be over-
whelmed and feel disrupted when changes are foisted on them--such as
the change of an enterprise-wide learning management system or techno-
pedagogical changes such as flipping a classroom or converting a course to
a blended or online format, which are willingly undertaken to improve a
course which is otherwise not working, or for department, institutional, or
financial reasons. Instructors at research institutions may lack adequate in-
centives--or support--to envision or achieve these types of changes in their
classrooms (Gregory & Lodge, 2015). While there are many reasons to ex-
periment with emerging technologies, some choose not to but regularly
update their course notes and are perhaps less engaged by new technolo-
gies. For those who embrace new technologies, there are several potential
downsides: needing time to teach a new tool, neglect of student privacy,6
and setting students up to game a system rather than engage in deep learn-
ing and authentic reflection.

    While this chapter does not cover in depth selection methods for ed-
ucational technologies including software programs, audience response
clickers, homework software access codes, or other electronic ancillary
tools, sometimes thought of as instructor conveniences and sometimes
thought of as student aids,7 I do want to note that implementation of edu-
cational technology tools seems to be growing. I have observed two main
responses: instructors who select materials based on research evidence are
often slow to adopt such tools when their effectiveness is insufficiently
documented, and instructors attempting to manage very large courses
tend to adopt them quickly out of convenience if not survival; sometimes
they are abandoned just as quickly.

Incentives Influencing Design and Selection of Course
Materials
To the innocent bystander, the presumed aim of course materials in medi-
ated instruction within higher education is student learning. As discussed
above, this goal can be muddled by various incentives. Several influential
factors still remain:

· Perceived quality (sometimes signaled by a trusted brand name)
· Author authority/accuracy and currency of content
· Reliable scope, sequence, or structure for instructors and students to

    follow
· Perceived fit for the student's level of expertise
· Perceived fit with instructor's methods of teaching
· Use of emerging technology (this factor can encourage or discourage,

    depending on instructor comfort)
· Time savings for faculty (including pre-made lecture slides and assess-

    ments)
· The selector's valuation of meaningful promised student analytics8

· Authoritative resource for student reference now and in the future
    (Arnold, 1989)

· Departmental/institutional expectations or requirements regarding
    always assigning a text even if the text is not heavily used

For novice instructors, part-time adjuncts without preparation time,
graduate teaching assistants, and faculty teaching a course for the first
time, course resources fit best as a support structure for the instructor. Ex-
perienced instructors and those with a more comfortable grasp of teach-
ing the content area are likely to not need to rely as heavily on course
resources, may be more likely to teach with learning resources they de-
veloped themselves, might not require student acquisition of learning
resources, but may still assign course materials for student benefit, because
students expect it, or because assigning a text is just what you do.9 Some-
times, an instructor's long-time habits dictate assigning a required text-
book as a "resource" even when it will not be used very much in the
course.

    Of course, disciplinary differences in pedagogy and student needs
come into play. Course materials in different disciplines may have quite
different functions. For example: student learning activities in literature,
foreign language, and biology differ quite a bit and affect the types of
course materials selected. Students studying literature may focus primarily
on reading and writing activities; students in foreign language experience
a much greater emphasis on listening, speaking, and, at the lower levels,
grammar and basic sentence construction. Students studying biology are
involved in learning the scientific method, maintaining a lab notebook,
experiments, and hands-on activities in a laboratory.

have a new type of audience: statisticians, researchers, administrators,
and sometimes commercial actors who analyze data to better gauge stu-
dent engagement (often without institutional permission) and to
understand how systems are or aren't being used. Vendors of this sort of-
ten aim to sell this data back to institutions if ownership and access to
this data by the individuals or institution was not contractually negoti-
ated.
9 Due to course changes and faculty not always complying with require-
ments to submit information about course material adoptions, it is
difficult to quantify what percentage of faculty assign don't assign course
materials which students must acquire themselves.
130  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Since purposeful learning materials were developed, they have helped
instructors solve complex teaching problems (Wakefield, 1998). A gen-
erous example is the instructor who selects course materials that fit the
course learning outcomes and offer students helpful problem sets, real-
life applications, case studies, or other examples that help students transfer
knowledge to other domains. A more cynical example is the likely over-
worked or unsupported instructor, perhaps with too many students, who
assigns course materials primarily for the instructor's own benefit. Course
materials, especially commercial ones "have been written, edited and mar-
keted as teaching and learning aids" (Wakefield, 1998, p. 23) and are often
interpreted by instructors as such. Required homework software access
codes and classroom response tools or clickers primarily for instructor
time savings in grading or as an expensive experiment in innovative
teaching are a prime example. In my experience, I've seen these decisions
justified by having to teach a very heavy course load, large classes, or the
promise that the tools will make students who don't complete their read-
ing assignments engage with the materials. These tools unfortunately pass
on the burdens of an instructor struggling with getting students to engage
in course material and/or trying to manage interaction and assessment
of a very large class directly to students, often in the form of multiple
required learning resources such as clickers, quizzing or classroom inter-
action tools, print or electronic texts, and/or homework software access
codes.

    This conflict between instructor and student needs is not condemna-
tion of instructors who make these decisions, but a reflection a common
problem cited in economics and political science literature, called a princi-
pal-agent problem. A principal-agent problem features a decision-maker
(the agent), in this case the instructor, who to varying degrees reflects
(or doesn't reflect) the values and interests of the person or people she
represents (the principal), in this case the students. When the agent or in-
structor is motivated to act in his or her own interest to the detriment of
the interests of the principal or students, economists identify "moral haz-
ard" as an outcome (Eisenhardt, 1989). One may argue that the instructor
is indeed in a difficult situation, often teaching as a non-tenure-track pro-
fessor, without leverage, and in a somewhat impossible situation where
implementing all sorts of tools is the only solution. Whether intended
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box  131

or not by the department which created such large courses or by the in-
structor, moral hazard, or "harm," is likely to occur when an agent puts
their own needs above those of their principal--or when instructors as-
sign course materials too expensive for students to access. Students may
be harmed by losing the freedom to take a class or a major because it is too
expensive, by taking on additional debt, additional work hours, or at min-
imum by additional financial stress. Further, students may lose consistent
and reliable access by sharing course materials, or by participating in peer-
to-peer copyright infringement in the forms of digitizing, sharing, and/or
downloading illegal copies of learning materials. Again, this is not a con-
demnation that instructors or departments in these types of situations are
malicious actors, but an observation that care needs to be taken to proac-
tively identify and remediate situations in which incentives encourage an
agent to act in a way that may be harmful to the principal.

Introducing a Paradigm Shift
What can an open education advocate do? For starters, engaging faculty
in conversation regarding their particular contexts, what they like or do
not like about their course materials. What kind of content do they wish
existed? What kind of content (including questions and other artifacts for
assessment) could they or students create? What freedoms do they have to
pilot or repeatedly create small quantities of content or assessments over
long periods of time? What do they wish was happening in their class that
isn't? These can be tender topics, so trust and diplomacy is called for. Six
open educational practices or values may scaffold instructors in their early
and late attempts in openness: sharing, early drafting, supportive feedback,
studying licenses, giving credit, and putting students at the center (West,
2017). Understanding open practices and values as a paradigm shift, and
introducing, discussing the relative merits, supporting, and implementing
each of these values can provide a clear focus for one's activities and assist
in navigating where to spend scarce time and resources.

    Ideally, instructors will develop courses around course learning out-
comes, mapping content, activities, and assessments to course learning
outcomes. Instructors exhibiting this type of teaching tend to have a suf-
ficient if not high level of mastery over their subject and a high level of
comfort with regard to teaching. A deep interest in one's discipline and
132  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

care for one's students, relevant and reflective professional development
opportunities, practicing teaching improvements, and valuing instruc-
tional practices are paths to developing efficacious instruction. Instruction
which increasingly prioritizes these types of practices strikes a different
balance between instructor expertise, teaching methods, and critical selec-
tion and use of course materials.

    Learning and working to understand the realities of one's campus or
campuses, campus cultures, policies, practices, values, pressures, motiva-
tors and incentives are the probably the hardest part of this work and
take the most time, but are well worth the investment. Understanding
course material evaluation and selection process will likely require a brief
review of institutional policy regarding textbook or learning resource se-
lection. Conversations with each of the departments on your campuses
can be helpful. A call to each departmental administrative assistant or ad-
visor with the following questions is a good place to start:

· Do the majority of your instructors assign required books?
· Are course materials selected by committee or individual instructors?
· Who are the point people regarding committee-selected course mate-

    rials?
· What is the course material adoption schedule look like in your de-

    partment?
· How does reporting of textbook adoptions (to the bookstore or other)

    work?
· I'm interested in learning more about how course materials are se-

    lected. Who else do you suggest I contact?

The registrar of your institution will be able to direct you to someone who
can explain how your institution handles approvals for new or updated
courses and whether there are requirements to list learning resources used
in the course.

    Liaison librarians may be aware of department-wide curriculum ini-
tiatives and needs. If your campus has a Center for Excellence in Teaching
and Learning or instructional design support embedded in another unit,
you may also be able to glean useful information about course design/re-
design assistance and helpful insight regarding learning resource selection
processes and motivations.
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box  133

    Your bookstore, if cooperative, may also be a useful source of infor-
mation regarding textbook and other learning resource adoptions. Some
helpful ideas for building a relationship with your bookstore can be found
in Bell's 2018 article.

    As you gather information and build trust, think about what open
resources and open practices might contribute to resolving stated prob-
lems in current departmental resource selection processes. Some academic
librarians have gone as far as to contribute to and coordinate year-long
textbook evaluation processes for selected high-enrollment courses
within willing campus departments. For those instructors overwhelmed
with large-scale changes toward open educational resources, piloting an
open resource as an alternative text is an option, as are incremental
changes to incorporate open pedagogical practices which replace one
reading or assignment over a period of time. The Open Pedagogy Notebook
is one place to look for or share examples of open pedagogical practices
(DeRosa & Jhangiani, 2018). The text A Guide to Making Open Textbooks
with Students (Mays, 2017) may also be a helpful resource.

Novel and Purpose-made Course Materials
Course materials include any discrete media, format, or system deployed
in support of the learning process. Cost and copyright concerns notwith-
standing, course materials can now be almost anything. Some materials
and processes used in courses today were not designed to be used in
courses: news and academic journal articles, movie clips, equipment de-
signed for industry, household items, 3D printers, beach balls, Twitter,
Wikipedia authoring, and so on. These items and processes are used
outside of classrooms and have made their way into courses. This is a
refreshing trend, as the application of these materials on teaching and
learning may enrich students' lives and help them to see the world around
them as having potential for learning and exploration.

    Purpose-built course materials are different than materials not specif-
ically designed for learning. Textbooks, educational videos, workbooks,
digital flashcards, lab environments, problem sets, online modules, inter-
active quizzes, clickers, educational apps, learning management systems,
and various assessment and engagement tools are created specifically for
learning and are most often purpose-built for educational contexts. They
134  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

are intended to be consumed or acted upon by students in specific ways
with specific outcomes in mind. Purpose-built learning resources always
have embedded assumptions about what constitutes learning, how people
learn, what learning is for, and how the system supports or facilitates that
learning. Because educational technology is built by a wide variety of peo-
ple, some systems may reflect sophisticated and well-conceived pedagogical
philosophies; others might not. Rather than engaging with learning as a
process, some may envision students primarily as containers for content
provided by instructors as seen in this public domain illustration.

Interactive systems designed by those with expertise in various pedagogical
philosophies may rely heavily on pedagogical philosophies of behaviorism,
constructivism, cognitivism, and any number of other pedagogical ap-
proaches.10 Learning resources and approaches are not pedagogically neutral.

    Even as learning resources have changed with the times, they con-
tinue to be marketed as "teaching and learning aids" to solve problems
(Wakefield, 1998). For the most part in the United States, development
of course materials and educational technologies is a for-profit endeavor.
This raises some ethical issues. For-profit ed tech companies serve two
or more masters: student learning, generating a profit for shareholders,
developing their research base, capturing market share and so on. Com-
petition between these factors may challenge the most ethically minded ed
tech company to deviate from valuing student learning above other fac-
tors. It is certainly possible to imagine the existence of a company that sells
learning resources of value without being overly swayed by a profit mo-
tive. However, this is very difficult to do without powerful and built-in
accountability structures. Like any business, commercial publishers are re-
sponsible to their shareholders for financial gains, so the conflict between
product quality for ultimate end users (e.g., instructors and students) vs.
shareholders is often difficult to navigate. (Potential authors courted by
publishers also face these conflicts in deciding whether or not to sign a
publication agreement. They are encouraged by potential royalties and
legitimately enjoy attention, respect, and relationships with publishers.
They often transfer copyrights to the degree possible, limiting access to
their work, and give up control to write the book they want to write.)

    Commercial approaches also have an impact on the development of
learning resources. Publishing industry veteran Beverlee Jobrack's book
about the K-12 textbook industry describes how commercial incentives
shape the K-12 textbook publication process. Jobrack explores how mar-
ket research, competitor analysis, and focus groups lead to the develop-
ment of educational materials rather than educational research, rigorous
study, and effectiveness of past use of course materials. Publishers rarely
fund studies to understand the development of a subject and how it has
been taught in the past, strengths and weaknesses of previously used ma-
terials, nor the educational research literature. In focus group sessions
"publishers confirm that teachers rarely care about program effectiveness
when weighted against a perceived useful design ... and when curriculum
specialists are in the room, they nearly always prefer research-based ma-
terials, but realize that it would be an upward battle for their teachers
to accept them" (Jobrack, 2012, p. 62). As a result, textbook develop-
136  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ment focuses mainly on features that are appealing rather than effective.
While disheartening, Jobrack's observation that the development process
for commercial textbooks focuses on aspects that appeal rather than being
chosen for their effectiveness is an observation for open education advo-
cates and instructors who develop or adapt open educational resources. At
the end of the day, if effectiveness is more important than appeal, openly
licensed resources focused on effectiveness should be different in impor-
tant ways than those developed with appeal in mind.

    Some faculty feel compelled out of habit to require a textbook even if
it is not used very much in the course. Other faculty explore pedagogies
as far away as possible from passive, consumable resources, some using
Wikipedia assignments or creating a textbook as part of their course
(DeRosa & Robinson, 2017). Others are implementing practices to en-
courage student agency, such as giving students flex or pink time (Baird,
Kniola, Lewis & Fowler, 2015). Increasingly, instructors are seeing stu-
dent engagement with the course and course content as the key to im-
prove learning (Hunt et al., 2016)

A Way Forward?
Let's return to the question posed early in this chapter: Where can an
open education advocate, or simply someone that cares about teaching
and learning, start to make a contribution if they are not the course mate-
rial decision-maker? For open education advocates, the keys to addressing
the course material adoption issues on campus rest in working to under-
stand the distinct realities of campus and departmental contexts and cul-
tures, gathering information, building trust among instructors, decision-
makers, and others working to address course material and teaching-re-
lated issues on campus, introducing a new paradigm of values and open
educational practices (West, 2017).

    Academic librarians and instructional designers already do many
things to model, champion, critique, invent, improve upon, and/or sup-
port open educational practices. These may include but are not limited to:
open access authoring and publication, creating and building sustainable,
Creative Commons-licensed editable curriculum materials, modeling ped-
agogies and web development strategies dependent upon openly licensed
content and open source software, contributing to open source infrastruc-
Course Material Decisions and Factors: Unpacking the Opaque Box  137

ture, developing open and sustainable models of operation through col-
laborative networks, and implementing student-centric pedagogies which
grant increased student agency or emphasize creation of artifacts which
have value beyond the classroom.

    Others contribute to and aid faculty, staff and students to interact
with authored content in ethical and sustainable ways by creating, remix-
ing, and sharing research outputs with open licenses. OER are just one of
many possible ways to implement the ethic or concept of openness. Li-
brarians may be engaged or desiring to be engaged in course material or
learning resource initiatives at their academic institution, including orga-
nizing evaluation or selection of openly licensed or other course materials
and course material formats.

    Building new expertise helpful to processes where there is no or min-
imal expertise may have even more potential. A few examples from this
brief overview of course material production and selection where open
advocates could add value include: provide more support for faculty train-
ing in course material evaluation and selection, curate tools and methods
for all effort levels of course material review, and when developing openly
licensed course materials, focus on effectiveness more than appeal.

    And finally, build trust. Everything runs on trust and, in an ideal
world, accurate information, sharing, and trustworthy processes and sys-
tems. Course material selection decisions are based on trust in people, in-
formation, and/or processes. Accurate information, reliable services that
provide needed information, support, logistics or somehow add value, and
a willingness to listen, learn, and respond with integrity should greatly
add to creating a way forward that keeps learners at the center, values
transparency, requests and accepts constructive feedback, gives credit, and
promotes sharing.

Introduction
At its core, open pedagogy describes an intervention aimed at improving
teaching and learning. Open pedagogues recognize that education is
never value-free or politically neutral. For us, education at its finest
is liberatory, democratizing, critical, antiracist, and decolonized (hooks,
1994). As such, open pedagogy is a vehement rejection of the incumbent
and predominant "banking model" of education, in which knowledge is
something to be deposited, stored, and withdrawn at a later date (Freire,
1970). Open pedagogy instead represents a vision for education that re-
places classrooms of control with communities of possibility. This is
precisely why open pedagogues seek to empower students and educa-
tors to interrogate and subvert power structures that systematically limit
their agency and restrict their access to high-impact education practices.
Open pedagogy--an integral part of the contemporary open education
movement (OEM)--is firmly and explicitly grounded in concerns about
social justice.

    In this chapter, we examine how to build an institutional home
for open pedagogy, with particular attention to recommendations for
libraries and librarians. While librarians have always been central to
disseminating public knowledge, more recently they have engaged di-
verse ways of becoming community-led agents of social change (Morales,
Knowles, & Bourg, 2014) and leading social justice activists (Library
Freedom Project, n.d.). We believe that it is no coincidence that librar-
ians are found at every frontier of open education. Indeed, academic
librarians' expertise and their interstitial, consultative relationships make
libraries a natural home for open pedagogy.
142  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    As we write this chapter (2017), it is an exciting time to be part of
a growing and vibrant international community of open education prac-
titioners, one that hails from all segments of academia. Librarians are of
course already an essential part of this community. They are enhancing
the formal, informal, and professional learning support that they already
perform by training their communities in open licensing, providing phys-
ical places for workshops on open pedagogy and other open educational
practices (OEP), cataloging open educational resources (OER), and engag-
ing in numerous other activities that support open education. The support
of librarians is essential as the community debates and experiments with
ways to implement more socially just, open approaches to supporting the
universal human right to education (United Nations, n.d.). This support is
essential given the experimental nature of open pedagogy, as it allows us
to leverage collaborations across faculties and institutions as well as learn
lessons from previous open pedagogical experiments.

    In this chapter we examine the experimental terrain of open peda-
gogy as an approach and clarify how we are using the term. We then
illuminate ways in which open pedagogy in higher education not only
involves but often relies on academic librarians and libraries by explor-
ing diverse, real-world examples of open pedagogy projects. Finally, we
draw some common themes from the examples and offer an outline of
ways in which academic librarians can support OEP in their various in-
stitutional contexts.

Open Pedagogy: Past and Present
The ways in which we define open pedagogy undoubtedly impact the
ways in which we can support open pedagogy. While open pedagogues
tend to engage deeply in constructivist and critical approaches to learning,
the lack of a common understanding of the role of OER in open pedagogy
has recently become a point of debate. While use of the term open peda-
gogy can be traced back to learner-centered approaches dating to at least
the 1970s (see for example Cronin, 2017; DeRosa & Jhangiani, 2017; Jor-
dan, 2017; Morgan, 2016), contemporary use of the term has most often
been linked to the development of OER and OEP. The spectrum of nar-
row to broad definitions of open pedagogy that have formed the basis for
recent debates tend to emphasize either OER or OEP (Green, 2017). Nar-
An Open Athenaeum  143

rower definitions are closely related to the development and use of OER
as defined by the 5 Rs (Wiley, n.d.; described fully in Section 1 of this vol-
ume) whereas broader definitions tend to link open pedagogy to a spirit
of openness that underpins a wide array of educational practices that do
not necessarily involve openly licensing (Grush, 2014), such as syllabus
co-creation, public scholarship, and service learning.

    These terminology debates reflect the experimental nature of open
pedagogy and are the result of three factors. First, open pedagogy is a
relatively new approach, so understandings of what activities it entails
are under healthy and vigorous debate. Second, open pedagogy is a syn-
cretic blend of several critical and constructivist pedagogies, so the ways in
which relationships are framed among the subject matter, learners, teach-
ers, learning objects, and their human environment can be profoundly
divergent. Third, open pedagogues grapple on a daily basis with emerg-
ing practices devised for the unique challenges and possibilities entailed
in using OER and integrating the radical transparency of open education
practices into courses.

    In the case of the open pedagogy debate, the community has to a large
extent agreed to disagree. In fact, by early 2017 David Wiley (an influ-
ential writer, organizer, and advocate for open education) relabeled his
earlier, oft-cited but narrower version of open pedagogy as "OER-enabled
pedagogy" in order to move beyond terminology debates and establish a
term that could be operationalized to research the use of OER within a
constructivist teaching approach. He writes,

      OER-enabled pedagogy is the set of teaching and learning
      practices only possible or practical when you have permission
      to engage in the 5R activities .... We learn by the things we
      do. Copyright restricts what we are permitted to do. Con-
      sequently, copyright restricts the ways we are permitted to
      learn. Open removes these restrictions, permitting us to do
      new things. Consequently, open permits us to learn in new
      ways. (Wiley, 2017b, para. 5, 9)

In this chapter, we engage primarily with this latter definition of open
pedagogy (or OER-enabled pedagogy), to which the creation, adaptation,
and adoption of OER are central.
144  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    To the extent that engagement with open pedagogy increases the use
and prevalence of OER, this pedagogical approach supports students and
institutions. Indeed, a rapidly growing body of research attests to the pos-
itive impacts of OER use on student and institutional cost savings (Hilton,
Robinson, Wiley, & Ackerman, 2014; Hilton, Gaudet, Clark, Robinson,
& Wiley, 2013) as well as on student performance, persistence, and com-
pletion (Hilton, Fischer, Wiley, & Williams, 2016). While a focus on
OER-enabled pedagogy may seem to overly weigh the importance of OER
artifacts in relation to other open practices, we argue that it actually rec-
ognizes that open education is fundamentally a community of practice.

    The open education community of practice involves diverse stake-
holders interested in lowering barriers to education. The community is
maintained and built through formal conferences (e.g. the annual Open
Education Conference and OE Global), workshops (e.g. Digital Peda-
gogy), and informal networks that focus on sharing and learning practices
such as ways to create OER, implement OEP, support open education pol-
icy, and build strategic initiatives. The activities and organizing that define
OER-enabled pedagogy reflect lively and sustainable ways of invigorating
the relationships in the community of practice and maintaining momen-
tum towards the above goals.

    The title of this chapter invokes an open athenaeum. An athenaeum
can be an institution, library, or reading room that contains artifacts; it can
also be a group of people that engages in the promotion of literary and
scientific learning. The idea of the open athenaeum metaphorically repre-
sents the contemporary transitions that librarians successfully navigate and
that we face in the OEM. It represents the challenges of transitioning from
archiving and supplying materials to consulting and serving communities,
from focusing on artifacts to focusing on teaching and learning ecosystems,
from conveying to co-creating knowledge, and from focusing on OER to
facilitating OEP. The open athenaeum thus enables open pedagogy as both
a community of practice and as shared physical and digital resources.

Open Pedagogy in Practice
A broad range of approaches to understanding and defining open ped-
agogy offers a diverse slate of potential examples of what these projects
may look like in practice. Although the six project examples that follow
An Open Athenaeum                     145

represent different aspects of the open pedagogy spectrum, they should
each be recognizable for the manner in which they trust and empower
students, encourage faculty to relinquish tight control and to depart
from the familiar, provide authentic and meaningful learning experi-
ences, serve the wider community, and make use of the permissions that
accompany OER. In each case, the description of the open pedagogy pro-
ject is followed by a reflection on the role and significance of librarians
in supporting similar projects.

Project Management for Instructional Designers
Successive cohorts of graduate students enrolled in a course on project
management at Brigham Young University revised and remixed an open
textbook on project management to suit their needs and the needs of
future formal and informal learners. The students aligned the book chap-
ters with professional certification standards, filmed and integrated video
case studies into the chapters, replaced generic examples with those
written from an instructional design perspective, completed a word-
for-word re-editing to improve readability, created text-to-speech audio
recordings of each section, replaced copyrighted images throughout the
book with openly licensed ones, and added a glossary of key terms. The
revised and remixed book was republished as an open textbook, Project
Management for Instructional Designers.1 David Wiley, the faculty lead for
the project, wrote:

      Each time I give this kind of assignment, I find that my stu-
      dents invest in their work at a completely different level and
      go far above and beyond what I ever imagined they could do.
      Now these students are co-authors on a book that is being used
      in programs across the US (and world? let me know if you're
      using PM4ID in your class!) and have an incredible portfo-
      lio piece to showcase to future potential employers and their
      moms. (Wiley, 2012, para. 5)

It is worth noting that PM4ID was adapted using technology from
Pressbooks.com.2 While the choice to use the Pressbooks website or the

146  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Pressbook plugin on a personal WordPress installation is perfectly suit-
able for publishing open textbooks, there may be advantages to having
student work integrated into local, institutional installations of Press-
books. Academic libraries can play a central role in making such local,
institutional installations open to successive cohorts in one or several
courses, making sure the book is cataloged and discoverable, and using
Pressbooks to encourage awareness of OER and possibilities for open
pedagogy projects.

Environmental Science Bites
Undergraduate students enrolled in a lower-division Introduction to En-
vironmental Science course at the Ohio State University were tasked with
describing some of Earth's major environmental challenges and discussing
ways that humans are using cutting-edge science and engineering to pro-
vide sustainable solutions to these problems. Their work would eventually
form the different chapters in the open textbook Environmental Science
Bites.3 In the words of Brian Lower, the faculty lead of the project,

      In writing these chapters, our students learned a great deal
      about the publication process. They learned: (1) How to find
      information from primary and secondary sources and critically
      evaluate topics, issues, results and conclusion. (2) How scien-
      tific research is conducted and how results and conclusions are
      reported to the public so that people can make more informed
      decisions in their own lives. (3) That the peer-review evalua-
      tion system is an integral part of the scientific process, which
      enables scientists to maintain high quality standards and pro-
      vides credibility to research and scholarly works. And (4) that
      peer reviews are a necessary part of the writing process be-
      cause it focuses attention on particular details and considers
      the input of an actual audience. (Lower, 2015, para. 2)

information sourcing and evaluation can be made ready for use by stu-
dents across the institution in different disciplines. Another interesting
aspect of this project is that it is published on a Pressbooks installation on
Unizin.org. Unizin is a consortium formed by several major research in-
stitutions in the US and currently supports digital learning technologies
for 22 institutions. While it hosts an open textbook, it does not necessarily
provide an openly available catalog of the OER students at partner institu-
tions have contributed to their platform. Integrating these digital learning
objects into the search functions of the partner institution libraries might
increase their discoverability, increase their use, and allow professors
across institutions teaching environmental science or other subjects to
contribute to the collection.

Wiki Education Foundation
With the assistance of the Wiki Education Foundation, more than 22,000
students enrolled in >1,000 courses at institutions across the world have
participated in the Wikipedia assignments, collectively revising and re-
fining more than 37,000 articles. This includes medical students working
with Dr. Amin Azzam at the University of California, who receive course
credit in exchange for improving this public resource while improving
their own ability to describe complex processes in layperson's terms.4 Dr.
Azzam feels that "it should be part of a physician's social contract to pro-
vide high quality health-information on open repositories like Wikipedia"
and that "as a result of all this training, my medical students are well-quali-
fied to be improving the medical and health-related content on Wikipedia
pages" (Salvaggio, 2016, para. 11, 14).

    This open pedagogy project encourages students to interpret sci-
entific knowledge and create accurate, up-to-date resources for public
knowledge dissemination. Libraries and librarians can help navigate
Wikipedia's unique framework for contributions, create formal or in-
formal working groups that allow faculty members across campus to
smoothly integrate Wikipedia assignments into their courses by drawing
from institutional knowledge of best practices and existing human con-

nections (such as a campus Wikipedia ambassador5) to the Wiki Educa-
tion Foundation and the Wikipedia community itself.

The Noba Project
The Noba Project's efforts to address a wide array of psychology topics
led to the creation of an annual competition in which students create
short topical videos. The competition offers $10,000 in prizes for three-
minute videos that best help viewers understand and remember the
concepts around the topic. The students' Noba Student Video Award
projects are openly licensed for review and reuse under a Creative Com-
mons license. The process empowers the students who create the content
and results in learning tools for other psychology students (DeRosa &
Robinson, 2017, p. 119).

    In the words of Michael Harris, co-author of one of the award-win-
ning videos about Personality Traits during the 2016-17 competition,

      They say that teaching a subject is the best way to truly learn
      it, and I now see why they say that. After writing the script,
      filming many takes of talking to the camera and our (hopefully
      funny) examples of the big 5, then editing it with my very tal-
      ented friend Matt all into a final product, I feel that I know this
      content in a way I never did before. I am incredibly grateful for
      the opportunity and had a great time making the film. I hope
      we see more media-meets-psychology projects like this in the
      future. (Harris, 2017, para. 1)

While many large institutions have special units focused on producing
professional audiovisual content, the ability of libraries to provide fa-
cilities for learning and audiovisual production for students across the
campus can be a key to success in projects such as the one above. Pro-
vision of physical infrastructure, a repository for the produced digital
materials, and expertise in the Learning Commons of the library helps
open pedagogy projects flourish and can create synergies across courses.

Geographic Information Science, Open Science, and
Land Policy
In 2016, nearly one hundred students in the Department of Geography at
the University of British Columbia (UBC) undertook an open pedagogy
project to contribute scientific knowledge regarding British Columbia's
Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR).6 Using open science principles and
open data, over 20 teams of students conducted independent analyses of
subsections of the ALR in order to measure how much agricultural land
was actually in the protected farmland zone. The key question here was
whether official estimates of agricultural land used by the province and
media refer to actual agricultural land or just to everything within the ad-
ministrative boundaries of the ALR.

    Student feedback on the project was positive. Many students noted
their increased ability to critically analyze open data sources and open
data accessing, processing, handling, analyzing, and interpretation. Many
students expressed shock at the types of data that the British Columbia
provincial authorities did not provide to the public under open licenses.
They were also surprised to find instances where crowdsourced, open data
(like Open Street Map) appeared to be more detailed than proprietary
data sets. The students learned many core ideas about data quality in GI-
Science (geographic information science), yet the project also presented
many pedagogical questions and quandaries for the instructors. For ex-
ample, many students pointed out possible outcome differences between
using open data and proprietary data for analyses. As an open science pro-
ject, we needed to share our data yet proprietary data could not be shared.
Given different methodological decisions taken by student groups, should
the results be framed as part of the learning process or should the results,
even if problematic, enter into the public debate to stimulate more re-
search? How is it possible to design and use an open science project for
successive cohorts? How do we assess learning in the context of open sci-
ence? The students' final reports, maps, and spatial data were published
on a public-facing website providing open resources for people interested
in BC's agricultural lands. The project website provides a brief overview

6 For background information on the Agricultural Land Reserve, see:
http://blogs.ubc.ca/alrmap/alr-background/
150  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

of the project process and groups of outcomes from the project, including
lessons learned by the instructors for implementing GIScience, open sci-
ence, and open pedagogy projects.

    Once again, librarians were fundamental to the success of this project.
The UBC Data & GIS Librarian came into the course to provide an overview
of open and proprietary data sources, how to access them and attribute
them, how to understand metadata, and how to use some basic software
for visualizing data. Students and faculty were able to rely on the librarian's
technical expertise in data and vast knowledge of data sources while building
their methodological approaches for the actual GIScience analyses.

Open Pedagogy in Broader Terms
While all of the above examples convey open pedagogy work with an
array of openly licensed resources (from open textbooks to open data
to open science documentation), broader understandings of open ped-
agogy practices can also be supported by libraries. For example, open
pedagogy can be understood as openness in co-creating course outlines
with students. As Kevin Gannon argues, current course outlines are not
learner-centered:

      The role of a syllabus has become contested for a variety of
      reasons, resulting in maladroit attempts to balance institutional
      needs and effective pedagogy. Because syllabi are now inter-
      preted as contracts in addition to curricular documents, they
      have become the default landing site for university policies, ac-
      creditation box-checking, and myriad other items attracted to
      the platform like cat hair to a black shirt. (Gannon, 2016, para. 6)

What could be more learner-centered than the openness of having the
students themselves agree upon the learning outcomes, course conduct,
behaviors, and even the assessment strategies (Monsen, Cook, & Hannant,
2017)? This openness to engaging the learners in framing their relation-
ships to each other, to the subject matter, and to the instructor provides
an honest model of learning together. However, it is scary for many fac-
ulty to relinquish control over the course. While arguments about course
outlines being an unbending contract or the intellectual property of the
instructor need to be addressed, much of this fear might simply be because
it is hard to imagine what a student-created course outline might look like
An Open Athenaeum                                 151

and we have very few among us with experience in co-creating course
outlines. So, we need more examples and best practices.

    Librarians can make a major contribution to this type of openness.
There is a valid argument for course outlines being cataloged and refer-
enced in institutional repositories in the same way that other scholarly
materials are treated. These repositories can be tagged with many key-
words, and not just disciplines and departments. Some of these keywords
might focus on the pedagogy employed and if students were involved in
the creation of the course outline. This would provide faculty with invalu-
able insights into openness. How is it being done, who is doing it, and
what are the expected outcomes and best practices?

    Several other projects that do not focus necessarily on OER but rather
on opening the teaching and learning process might also be supported by
librarians. For example, Robin DeRosa's work on an open anthology not
only involved students creating OER, but making curatorial decisions in
the selection of types of texts to include (DeRosa, 2016). Her students'
open pedagogy project resulted in The Open Anthology of Earlier American
Literature.7 Other examples include Rajiv Jhangiani's (one of the authors
of this chapter) work with students to create a question bank to accom-
pany an open textbook for social psychology (Jhangiani, 2017c). As well,
projects emphasizing public scholarship as a type of openness might be
important. For example, UBC Geography students in an environmental
geography course developed dozens of case studies analyzing wicked en-
vironmental problems (see https://environment.geog.ubc.ca/); these case
studies are not openly licensed but emphasize creating and disseminating
scientific knowledge through public scholarship. While we believe that
openly licensing public scholarship provides greater potential utility for
learners, these efforts nonetheless reflect a push towards openness and
getting away from disposable assignments.

    Whether or not these projects openly license their products and can
be considered OER-enabled pedagogy, the above examples reflect open
and collaborative approaches to effective pedagogy. Librarians can sup-
port the above examples of openness in pedagogy by working on dis-

coverability, creating institutional repositories for types of resources, and
hosting workshops that feature open educational practices. Below we
distill many of the lessons learned from these cases into six recommen-
dations. While these recommendations are easiest to implement in cases
where institutional resources support full- or part-time support positions
to support open education, the recommendations can be pursued through
collaborative, sustainable partnerships with other units on campus.

Building an Open Athenaeum
So, just how does an institution facilitate open pedagogy? Let's get down
to brass tacks to look at some concrete actions that librarians can take to
champion open pedagogy from the library. Our list draws from the above
cases and our professional experience as faculty working closely with li-
brarians and students, but it is certainly not meant to be exhaustive. Anita
Walz points out, "Depending on our main roles and the needs of our in-
stitution we may implement and connect open educational practices very
differently. There is no single model for librarian involvement in open ed-
ucation; I think this is a good thing" (Walz, 2017, p. 153). Towards locating
a suitable model, Quill West proposes a useful framework of habits that li-
brarians can focus on. She writes: "We achieve openness by exploring and
encouraging the six habits of open practice: sharing, early drafting, sup-
portive feedback, studying licenses, giving credit, and putting students at
the center" (West, 2017, p. 140). The embodiment of these different habits
within your particular institutional culture needs to be creative and contex-
tualized. Likewise, you can adapt our suggested actions as they are relevant
to your situation and how you approach open pedagogy.

Collaborate and Grow a Community of Open
Practitioners: A Campus Working Group
If your campus does not already have a formal, cross-functional Open Ed-
ucation Working Group (OEWG), librarians can be the driving force to
create one. The group might include faculty, administrators, union rep-
resentatives, students, and staff from the bookstore, accessibility services,
and the teaching and learning center. Although the composition of an
OEWG may vary across institutions, the critical guiding principle is to
not omit interested internal stakeholders, as the recommendations of the
group may otherwise be perceived as confrontational. Moreover, the nat-
An Open Athenaeum  153

ural temporal turnover of students as well as the particular politics of
administration and faculty units might unnecessarily undermine or politi-
cize open education.

    Having the OEWG run by librarians brings several benefits. First, it
gives the work of the group the veneer of institutional approval and a
stability that individual stakeholders cannot easily manage. Second, the
formal group can serve as the go-to point for people interested in learning
more (the provision of this information is a natural function of the li-
brary--the official commons--in the campus ecosystem). Third, the work-
ing group can plan and offer professional development opportunities for
faculty (e.g., how to adapt an open textbook, how to design a Wikipedia
assignment), run an open textbook review program that provides hono-
raria to faculty willing to write a peer review of an open textbook within
their area of expertise (an especially handy way of countering the low-
quality myth), run an OER grant program (to support faculty to make
necessary changes prior to adopting OER), manage an institutional list-
serv for OEP, and apply for internal and external funding to support all of
the above.

    The technical expertise of librarians and the physical and digital spaces
that the library supports are key assets for all of the above working group
actions. This is the group that can ensure that OER are widely understood
in terms of their permissions, so that even if people "come for the cost
savings, they stay for the pedagogy" (Wiley, 2017a, para. 6). This ap-
proach--one that highlights both social justice and pedagogical innova-
tion--carries the additional benefit of widening the appeal of OER adop-
tion as only the first stop on a journey of exploration into open pedagogy.

Collaborate and Grow a Community of Open
Practitioners: Informal Networks
One of the reasons why working groups are such a useful mechanism is
that collaboration and partnerships are key to the success of this grass-
roots movement. So even if not formally connected within working
groups or written partnerships, librarians may collaborate with the cam-
pus store to help them explore revenue models based on OER (e.g., selling
print copies of open textbooks, including on demand) and the campus stu-
dent association to help raise awareness about the impact of high textbook
154  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

costs and the availability of OER. Librarians may also work directly with
faculty interested in revising and remixing OER to build course-specific
LibGuides (see, for example, http://nmc.libguides.com/psy250mccord/
welcome) that allow faculty to share their work with institutional sup-
port but outside of the closed institutional learning management system
(LMS).

    In order to provide support for open pedagogy librarians should espe-
cially explore collaborations with the teaching and learning center (TLC).
The TLC administrators and staff are the ones who will most likely be
aware of the innovative pedagogues across different faculties, the teachers
who are eager to explore new technologies and who might be excited at
the prospect of empowering their students via open pedagogy.

    Strongly supporting these innovators (especially within high-enroll-
ment departments or flagship programs) as they engage with OEP is a
strategy that can pay dividends, for when their efforts are recorded, recog-
nized, and celebrated these innovative pedagogues become carriers for the
message of OEP for the many early adopters waiting in the wings across
campus. In addition to the organic spread of ideas through pedagogical
mavens, librarian- advocates are then able to point to respected peer inno-
vators on campus, a powerful strategy that aligns both injunctive norms
(what people ought to be doing) and descriptive norms (what people are
actually doing).

    Assuming the goal is to normalize the adoption of OEP on campus,
collaborating with the TLC once again provides several mechanisms to
build and grow a community of practitioners, whether by creating faculty
learning communities or other communities of practice (ideally led by the
faculty innovators) that collaboratively explore the full potential of work-
ing in the open. Once again, fostering interinstitutional collaborations can
help by reducing individual workloads, enhancing quality via peer review,
and widening impact.

Raise Awareness
As you might have intuited from reading the above, a critical action is to
raise awareness of both OER and open pedagogy, and here librarians can
really flex their technical expertise and leverage their interstitial position.
Awareness of OER remains relatively low among the academic commu-
An Open Athenaeum  155

nity. Speaking from our experience, many students have never heard of
open education and therefore cannot be effective advocates. Likewise,
many administrators confuse open education with online education and
therefore do not see how or why additional institutional support might be
necessary or beneficial to the institutional goals. Faculty are not immune
either as studies show that most faculty continue to confuse what is "open"
with what is merely free or what happens to be in digital format.

    This all points to the critical need for more education. We describe
this as critical because, after all, it is not the "free" that enables open ped-
agogy but rather the "freedom" or the 5R permissions. Fortunately, this
is precisely the sort of education that librarians are perfectly positioned
to provide, both online through licensing guides and modules and face-
to-face during consultations or professional development workshops. Or-
ganizing campus events that bring in external speakers is an effective
strategy, partly because doing so provides inspiration with concrete exam-
ples of practice, but also partly because all too often the identical message
conveyed by an internal expert is readily discounted.

Address Discoverability
Once the awareness barrier has been tackled, basic strategies to address
the discoverability of OER can help ensure that open resources get into
the hands of teachers and learners, who may then decide to take advantage
of the 5R permissions. Addressing discoverability can take many
forms--such as importing MARC records for open textbooks into the
library catalog, integrating open repository searches into the discovery
layer, or developing LibGuides for OER.

    One interesting strategy that has been found to work at institutions
across British Columbia is integrating open educational materials into
seasonal displays that are often found near the entrance of the physical
library. While a wide array of OER can be displayed and discovered, print-
ing open textbooks and including examples of open pedagogy (student-
created) projects can lead faculty, staff, and students to discoveries that
stimulate curiosity, raises awareness, and encourages adoption.

    Similar efforts to support OEP include gathering and publishing
course outlines (if they are not made public elsewhere), publishing rubrics
to assess renewable assignments, writing case studies to profile diverse ex-
156  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

amples of open pedagogy, or facilitating the deposit of students' creative
and academic work in the institutional open repository. Whether for OER
or OEP, the goal is the same: ensure that practical tools and resources are
made available and discoverable to faculty who learn about open practices
and wish to adopt them. Happily, addressing discoverability is something
that can be more easily achieved by proactively reaching out to and collab-
orating with peers at other, like-minded institutions or via consortia.

Enable Adaptation
Enabling adaptation across the institution can contribute to and in many
cases may rely upon the technical expertise of librarians and the physical
and digital infrastructure of libraries. While the physical infrastructure
enables workshops on creating openly licensed materials for both students
and faculty, the digital infrastructure and technical expertise in project
management can be just as valuable. For example, drawing from ongoing
work at the Rebus Foundation, Billy Meinke at University of Hawaii em-
phasizes teaching OER production workflows (Meinke, 2017). Teaching
these soft skills of navigating and managing the OER creation process al-
lows faculty to see entry points for learner activities and for learners to
better able to conceptualize how their contributions are part of a larger
picture that perhaps involves learners at other institutions.

    Libraries have the potential to lead the needed implementation of dig-
ital architecture for enabling adaptation. OER are not always in an ideal
format for remixing or adapting (Levine, 2017). This poses limitations not
just to adoption but also for the use of OER in open pedagogy projects. For
example, in British Columbia, BCcampus led the successful implementa-
tion of Pressbooks as an open textbook repository. The repository allows
people to freely access online and download digital copies of textbooks
in several different file formats. In Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario, the
BCcampus Pressbooks model and content is mirrored by agencies advanc-
ing open education in their respective provinces. While widely dispersed,
these repositories often contain static editions of learning objects. So fac-
ulty and students are unable to easily edit and contribute in the same
way they might through a more dynamic shared wiki or website. This
limits adaptation and the use of OER in open pedagogy. UBC librarians
Leonora Crema and Erin Fields recognized this hurdle and decided to ex-
An Open Athenaeum  157

periment with implementing a locally hosted Pressbooks installation that
allows faculty and learners to import and edit openly licensed materials
from other repositories. This enables long-term OER adaptation projects
across courses and departments. It is likely that enabling local adaptation
of OER will translate into better rates of adoption and to learning objects
more relevant and engaging for students in their local contexts.

Inspire and Emphasize Practices
Librarians can provide multiple entry points to meet people at their un-
derstanding level of open education and broaden the open education dis-
course beyond OER cost savings to OEP and open pedagogy. After all, "if
cost savings were the only goal, then OERs are not the only answer. Ma-
terials could be made free, or subsidized, which are not openly licensed"
(Weller, de los Arcos, Farrow, Pitt, & McAndrew, 2016, pp. 84-85). Open
pedagogy offers other benefits such as peer-to-peer efficiency in the adap-
tation and dynamic updating of materials. When faculty move from being
consumers of texts to realizing the potential power of adapting and creat-
ing OER for enabling OEP then "we've come within striking distance of
realizing the full power of open" (Wiley, 2016, para. 16).

    Aside from making fuller use of the available permissions, the broader
takeaway for those of us seeking to advance the open education move-
ment is that when we advocate for OER we can engage in aspirational
visions of education and avoid the appearance of judgment or guilt. Aspi-
ration better supports innovation and engages in "approach motivation"
(Elliot & Covington, 2001). In a broad aspirational vision of what we may
be able to accomplish in open pedagogy and OEP, material cost savings
may be the least significant benefit of OER (Jhangiani, 2017a).

    Indeed, "for faculty who enjoy experimenting and innovating, open
textbook adoption does feel like a meagre position to advocate. These
are instructors who care deeply about authentic and open pedagogy, who
may take full advantage of the permissions to revise and remix, and who
understand that adopting OEP is really just about good pedagogy ..."
(Jhangiani, 2017b, p. 275). On the other hand, as principled agents in a
principal-agent dilemma, faculty who adopt high-priced textbooks may
feel guilty about their decision and bend a course to better conform to and
utilize an expensive textbook. These empathetic teachers are cases where
158  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

the social justice reasoning for open textbooks may resonate particularly
well (Jhangiani, 2017b, p. 275).

    The above recommendations indicate the need for librarian-advo-
cates to know their audience and meet them where they are, something
that is made easier by the multiple entry points to OEP. These entry points
are described by Weller and colleagues (2016) as three categories of OER
users:

    Of course these categories are neither static nor mutually exclusive,
as individual faculty will evolve, whether in terms of the specific Creative
Commons license they are comfortable applying to their newly created
work or their motivation for adopting OEP. Nonetheless, they offer some
insight into the different starting points for different faculty in their jour-
ney towards greater openness. Librarians can chart the typical paths of
these different types of users, link these users to one another, and provide
the ligaments of the community of practice so necessary for open pedagogy.

1. The OER active are engaged with issues around open education, are
    aware of open licenses, and are often advocates for OERs ... An exam-
    ple of this type of user might be the community college teacher who
    adopts an openly licensed textbook, adapts it and contributes to open
    textbooks. (pp. 80-81)

2. OER as facilitator may have some awareness of OER, or open licenses,
    but they have a pragmatic approach toward them. OERs are of sec-
    ondary interest to their primary task, which is usually teach-
    ing ... Their interest is in innovation in their own area, and therefore
    OERs are only of interest to the extent that they facilitate innovation
    or efficiency in this. An example would be a teacher who uses Khan
    Academy, TED talks and some OER in their teaching. (p. 82)

3. Finally, OER consumers will use OER amongst a mix of other media
    and often not differentiate between them. Awareness of licenses is
    low and not a priority. OERs are a "nice to have" option but not essen-
    tial, and users are often largely consuming rather than creating and
    sharing. An example might be students studying at university who use
    iTunes U materials to supplement their taught material. For this type
    of user, the main features of OERs are their free use, reliability and
    quality. (p. 85)

Conclusion

We reiterate that it is no coincidence that librarians are to be found
at every frontier of the open education movement. Librarians are the
ones whom students approach when they need to borrow a textbook
that has been placed on course reserve. Librarians witness pairs of stu-
dents daisy-chaining interlibrary loans to last the length of a semester.
Librarians conceive of and manage alternative textbook programs. Librar-
ians try to persuade their faculty to make greater use of the institutional
repository. Librarians build guides to help faculty and students locate the
subscription-based resources for which the institution has dedicated pre-
cious resources. Librarians deal with increasingly exorbitant and opaque
database subscription fees. Librarians are the perennial champions of im-
proved access and student support because they have benefited from hard-
won lessons learned along their profession's journey from print to digital
and from resources to services. From conversations about open textbook
publishing to the push for embedding inclusive design principles within
OER creation, librarians are offering expertise, infrastructure, insights,
and communal cornerstones for OER and OEP.

    These experiences, combined with their expertise and the consulta-
tive nature of their relationship with faculty perfectly position the library
to be the open athenaeum--the institutional home for open pedagogy.

Throughout this book, particularly in this third section, we see themes of
the librarian as both catalyst and central collaborative leader for awareness
building, adoption oversight, and project management. Librarians are cen-
tral in supporting OER adoption. Here, we investigate the roles librarians
play in identifying and cultivating partnerships with student organizations,
government entities, multiple institutions, and the profession.

    As described previously, advocating for a broad adoption of OER can
be a challenge to organizational culture, and changing culture takes time
and true collaboration. Our hope is that practitioners will learn about how
to cultivate productive partnerships with a variety of stakeholders to sup-
port broad cultural change and uncover concrete strategies for finding and
evaluating existing OER in preparation for adoption, modification, and
creation of OER.

    In the first chapter, Cummings-Sauls et al. highlight the role of the
librarian in catalyzing partnerships across a broad array of stakeholders.
The authors offer clear advice on how to engage with a variety of partners
within one's institution and with broader external communities.

    Rigling and Cross outline the creation and implementation of an
OER program at North Carolina State University (NCSU). The authors
describe how they built partnerships with their student population to sup-
port wider advocacy for the program. Readers will find valuable insights
on strategies for partnering with students and assessing outcomes.

    Further emphasis on the importance of student engagement comes
in Ivie and Eillis' chapter on advancing access for first-generation college
students. Here, the authors discuss the role of the library in advancing
OER through integration with various campus entities, and in particular
164  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

advocacy work focused on multiple student organizations. The authors
offer practical suggestions in working with students to market and assess
programs.

    Continuing with this focus on student engagement, Baker and Ippoliti
describe how they engaged students at Oklahoma State University to be-
come advocates for OER adoption and how they worked with student
organizations, supported by a development grant, to design OER and ad-
vocate for their adoption.

    Kirstin Dean describes the multi-pronged approach to library-led
OER adoption at Clemson University. Dean frames the issue as a com-
munication challenge, and describes the methods she has used in effec-
tively communicating the importance of OER to student organizations
and other campus stakeholders.

    To complete the section, we shift focus to extra-institutional and pro-
fessional partnerships. First, LaMagna describes an approach at Delaware
County Community Colleges, in which faculty librarians advocate for
OER and train colleagues in implementation strategies though profes-
sional development programming. Readers will learn about the creation
of the program, the funding sources, and the design of the curriculum.

    Frank and Gallaway outline the train the trainer approach, outreach
efforts, and how library leadership manifests in OER initiatives carried
out by Louisiana's state library consortium. Their description of coordi-
nating OER efforts at a statewide level, in concert with a legislative body,
includes discussion of a variety of challenges and opportunities.

    Finally, Hare, et al. explore inter institutional collaborations to im-
plement OER programming across the Duke Endowment Libraries. This
case study explores the different settings and campus cultures across the
endowment libraries and how working with endowment support to train
the trainer, engage faculty, and assess their collaboration.

Introduction: The Value of Having Partners--Why You
Don't Want to Go It Alone
Leading or partnering with others on an open educational resources
(OER) initiative is one of many ways libraries provide value to students,
as well as visibility on campus. As Joseph A. Salem Jr. suggests, "... part-
nering early in the process will allow the library to lead in areas where
expertise is needed and missing. If no programmatic approach is under-
way, these partnerships offer the library an opportunity to lead overall
on an initiative focused on student success" (Salem, 2017). Combining li-
brary services with others across the institution may result in a robust,
enriching initiative, leveraging various types of expertise or infrastructure
throughout an institution.

    The successful OER initiatives that we discuss here have been built
upon partnerships. Partnerships may include any number of individuals
or groups ranging from libraries, the Student Government Association
(SGA), faculty support offices, bookstores, administration, and more (in-
cluding outside your institution). A possible starting point for a part-
nership is to first consider your available resources, the needs at your
institution, and what would help bridge the gaps. Promoting what you
have to offer, while seeking others to complement those resources or
services, can naturally lead to opportunities to partner. Libraries, for ex-
ample, may have key services in place that contribute to OER initiatives,
such as assistance finding high-quality OER, copyright consultation, cen-
tral infrastructure, expertise in publishing, and existing relationships with
campus departments. While partnerships are not necessary for imple-
menting an OER initiative, for our universities' partners they have been
166  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

invaluable in increasing awareness, building and sustaining momentum,
and bringing a variety of perspectives, skills, and resources that contribute
to long-term success.

    Throughout departments, colleges, and universities there are shared
goals involving education affordability and student success, which dove-
tail with OER goals. "Combining the strengths of key campus units to
build OER into the campus culture" is a powerful way to move these goals
forward (Woodward, 2017). Partnerships can bring many benefits, but re-
quire effort, ongoing development, and flexibility. Partnerships may be a
time-consuming, labor-intensive way to move an initiative forward, yet
the authors have found the rewards can be exponential in return. Goodset,
Loomis, and Miles found that the "greatest challenge in collaborating with
a faculty member, perhaps unsurprisingly, was navigating schedules and
deadlines," and that agreed-upon methods of communication were "essen-
tial" (Goodset, Loomis, & Miles, 2016). This holds true of all partnerships,
and becomes more challenging and critical as additional partners join the
initiative. Goals and expectations should be clearly stated, agreed upon,
and periodically revisited throughout collaborations. That being said, it is
also important to be flexible in your goals and expectations.

    In this chapter, we describe OER partnerships at three institutions:
University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), Kansas State
University (K-State), and Grand Valley State University (GVSU). In each
institution, the libraries are a leading partner in OER initiatives, joined
and supported by a variety of partners from the university community.
Throughout the chapter, our discussion of these partnerships will illus-
trate a variety of different goals and outcomes. In some instances, the
nature of the partnership is focused largely on advocacy. In others, new
services were developed to meet faculty pedagogy and student learn-
ing needs. And in other examples, existing services and infrastructure
were combined to provide more cohesive support for supporting OER.
With each stakeholder, we highlight potential hooks and motivations
for the partner's involvement, roadblocks you may encounter recruiting
them, and benefits of their participation. Our goal is to share our experi-
ences through this framework so that you may be able to identify similar
partners within your institution, customize and implement strategies we
describe, and overcome the challenges inherent in OER collaboration.

Library
Following the path blazed by educational technologists, distance educa-
tors, and instructional designers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) with the creation of their OpenCourseWare program in the early
2000s (Abelson, 2008) libraries have begun to fully embrace and sup-
port the development of OER in the last decade. Initially thought of as
content locators, contributors, and organizers (Atkins, Brown, & Ham-
mond, 2007), libraries are now leading OER funding initiatives, educating
faculty, and providing infrastructure for the storage, creation, and dissem-
ination of OER (Kleymeer, Kleinman, & Hanss, 2010; Santos-Hermosa,
2012; Gallant, 2015). The authors' libraries have recognized the con-
nections between OER efforts, which work to remove the barrier of
high-cost resources for students and encourage new teaching methods for
faculty, and existing open access (OA) and open data work. To address the
faculty concern that they do not have time to find or create alternatives to
their existing teaching materials, libraries have begun to initiate and co-
ordinate incentive and grant programs, develop or support the work of
other campus OER efforts, and dedicate staff time to supporting and ad-
vocating on behalf of OER.

    OER efforts may be led by or centralized in one of many different li-
brary units. Many germinate in scholarly communication departments due
to their expertise in OA publishing, institutional repositories (IR), fair use,
and guidance on the use of Creative Commons and other copyright/intel-
lectual property rights issues (Wesolek et al., 2017). Library teaching and
learning, collections, or administration units are similarly well suited to
support OER programs (Yano, 2017). For academic department liaisons,
reference and reserves staff, library administrators, and student support
teams, collaboration on OER may be an opportunity to build new relation-
ships with departments, demonstrate the library's value to campus, or meet
student information needs. No matter what library unit they belong to, find
someone who is passionate about these issues and willing to advocate on
behalf of your efforts. If you are not a librarian and planning to launch an
OER program, the library should be one of your first partners.

    In addition to material support, libraries may offer funding opportu-
nities for OER. With the growing trend of library budgets moving away
from "big deal" journal packages (Anderson, 2017), there is an opportu-
168  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

nity to reallocate these funds towards OA projects. Many libraries have
Friends of the Library or other community groups willing to support ini-
tiatives that directly impact students. Library development offices can be
great at finding alumni or large donors who want to support the library
in a meaningful way. Libraries may also have access to federal grant funds
from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Insti-
tute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which both support the
development of open materials. However, it's no secret that library bud-
gets are tight; since OER is a relatively new area for libraries it has not,
with some exceptions, established a foothold in traditional library bud-
gets. OER funding often falls into the "special projects" category and is
thus not necessarily sustainable over the long term. Greater efforts to in-
stitutionalize funding for OER within libraries will need to happen in the
future to guarantee their viability as a core library service.

    Currently, full-time OER positions in libraries are rare. Many OER
efforts on U.S. campuses are managed by someone with other respon-
sibilities, such as IR management, reference, or undergraduate support
(Okamoto, 2013; Kleymeer et al., 2010). One way to gradually introduce
more OER work into the library is by including it in revised job de-
scriptions following retirements and vacancies. But even without new
positions there is a plethora of existing staff who can help spread the word
about OER. Library subject specialists or reference staff, who interact with
faculty regularly and are great promoters of library services, can intro-
duce faculty to the concept of OER and recruit them to participate in a
program. They can also create or assist with creating OER subject guides.
Reserves departments can plug OER when faculty are looking for course
materials or placing textbooks in the reserves collection. Archives and
special collections departments can present faculty with untapped, unique
archival material that can be used as teaching materials. Metadata staff can
assist with resource description that helps surface OER in local catalogs
and worldwide indexes. Acquisitions staff can identify and ingest qual-
ity OA journals, monographs, and textbooks. Library development and
communications departments can promote OER efforts as well as develop
possible funding streams for an OER initiative. Libraries can also provide
infrastructure support for OER projects. Many academic libraries have
stable fiscal processing ingest for processing grants/awards. Libraries also
Open Partnerships  169

often support an institutional repository or OA press that provides host-
ing and publishing of locally created OER. The fabric of support for OER
runs throughout almost every unit in the library.

    Libraries, however, are not always equipped to provide expert advice
on all OER matters. Support for the mechanics of publishing (copy edit-
ing, proofreading, editorial decisions, layout, graphic design, etc.) is some-
thing that OER authors frequently need that libraries can't always pro-
vide--as with GVSU's library publishing program, which has relied on
authors to prepare and format OER before they are made available online.
Libraries have increasingly started to collaborate with university presses
and others to address this need (Sutton & Chadwell, 2014). The accessibil-
ity of the variety of formats generated with OER content, especially video
and audio material, is oftentimes outside the area of libraries' expertise
as well. Partnerships, vendors, and training are some of the ways to ad-
dress this important aspect of OER creation, but there are others. K-State,
for instance, addresses accessibility issues in one way by inviting someone
from the Student Access Center to sit on each application review board.
UMass Amherst Libraries recently partnered with the Assistive Technol-
ogy Center to provide training for staff and students on closed captioning
and audio description of video material.

    Even when a library has the potential to support all aspects of an OER
program, collaborating with allies on campus enables the resources and
time of the library and librarians to have faster, greater, and better impact.
Let's look at some other campus stakeholders you may want to include in
an OER initiative.

Faculty
Faculty members are an absolutely vital partner in OER initiatives on your
campus. Plain and simple, because faculty teach the courses, if faculty do
not become involved in the process you cannot have a successful OER ini-
tiative. The good news is that it takes just one to start. Most likely you
already have at least one faculty member in mind or as a friend on campus
where you may be able to begin. Reaching out to connections that you al-
ready know, or know exist, is a great first step in building faculty partners.
If you are new to campus or don't feel that your connections are right,
reach out to the individuals within the library, who we discussed above,
170  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

that may have or may want to have a vested interest in OER. Ask these
individuals to introduce you to their faculty connections, which can be as
simple as a forwarded email with a short message or meeting for coffee.

    You may also have faculty on campus who are already using an
open or alternative resource. These faculty may be able to convert an-
other course to OER and they may let you know which faculty have
shown interest in their efforts on campus. Plus, they can be the obvi-
ous, great examples of how OER can work on your campus. Once you
have worked with faculty on campus, you may be able to call upon them
to participate in future OER events, share their experiences in promo-
tional material, and to convert other courses that they have in their
course load. It is important to remain in contact with faculty who have
participated in the initiative, to ensure that they are continuing use of
the resource and have been satisfied with the process. Use their feed-
back to make improvements when possible and be sure to communicate
your efforts with them, as faculty word of mouth can be a powerful tool
in making future faculty partners.

    Beyond being trailblazers for selecting and implementing OER, fac-
ulty also serve as advocates among their colleagues. Faculty may be
sources of expertise, bringing direct hands-on experience of using OER.
These faculty can be great allies in creating and supporting the initiative
on campus and in some cases may become an initiative partner or member
of your OER committee. In fact, the K-State Open/Alternative Textbook
Initiative Team consists of faculty members from three different depart-
ments on campus and several others are asked to join the review commit-
tee each year.

    In addition to individual connections, there are several other ways
to connect to faculty on campus. Calls for applicants or interested faculty
should be placed in your campus communications channels (i.e. email,
newsletters, magazines, flyers) that you have available. Holding events and
activities on OER during nationally recognized open access or open edu-
cation weeks can draw in faculty and highlight OER efforts on your local
campus. Attend other faculty-focused events and make small talk with
other attendees. Where appropriate, mention that you may be able to pro-
vide grant funding and/or support for their transition to OER. Even when
you can't talk about your initiative, you are expanding your connections.
Open Partnerships  171

When possible, reach out to those you met to reintroduce yourself, and
don't forget a link to your OER website in your email signature.

    Some universities have, on their own or working with an external
partner like Open Textbook Network, held workshops to inform faculty
about the impact of open textbooks. During these workshops, faculty are
asked to complete a review on an existing open textbook to gain famil-
iarity with a resource that they may want to use in their course. Faculty
may receive a small stipend or award for their participation, depending
on your local policy and resources. At K-State, some faculty have reported
uncertainty in completing the OER grant application itself. If you have
an application for participation, providing information sessions where
the application process is explained and discussed can provide faculty an
added comfort level in completing the process. At the very least, this pro-
vides you an opportunity to interact with faculty who show some level of
interest in participation.

    Soured or unsatisfied faculty relationships with commercial publish-
ers can also lead faculty towards OER. At GSVU, the general chemistry
course has adopted an OpenStax textbook in reaction to publisher price
hikes. Faculty at K-State frequently report dissatisfaction with commercial
options as a prime reason they are looking at OER. OER has given faculty
the ability to produce a textbook for a discipline that commercial pub-
lishers have not yet shown interest in or that is too niche to recoup
investments. Faculty with a passion for these areas may be looking for an
outlet and OER is the perfect option. The most important thing to keep
in mind with faculty partners is to not dictate what you want them to in-
corporate into their course. You may even hold off on suggesting content
until they have asked you for possible options.

    Faculty members, at our universities and more generally, have some
degree of freedom to select their desired course materials. The AAUP
Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure states acade-
mic freedom "is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher
in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning" (American Associ-
ation of University Professors, 1940). Whether committees or individual
instructors select the resource, faculty usually decide on the text. If doing
so by committee, you just have more people to enlist. Ultimately, faculty
are the ones who can make the decision to move a course to OER.
172  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Research by Tyton Partners support "Faculty time/effort" as a re-
ported obstacle for all faculty by administrators in digital learning (Lam-
mers & Tyton Partners, 2017). As OER coordinators, we see that this is
especially true as it pertains to reviewing OER content for use in courses.
Faculty may have more opportunity to conduct these tasks during the
summer months, when they have fewer demands on their daily routines.
Some faculty are off-contract with their college or university over the
summer and can use grants/awards for stipends to cover their efforts dur-
ing this time. Faculty without publishing experience may have concerns
over their lack of expertise. These faculty should factor the costs of pub-
lishing, such as copy editing, into their applications when applying for
their grant award.

    To alleviate quality concerns, faculty should be encouraged to gather
and reflect on reviews of their OER. For newly created content, authors
are asked to receive traditional textbook reviews from internal/campus
and external reviewers in their discipline. Along with gathering and in-
corporating feedback from traditional reviews, each semester students in
the course will provide or should be asked about their perceptions on the
quality and relevance of the content to their needs. Hearing that students
valued and appreciated the OER has led faculty at K-State to convert ad-
ditional courses to using OER.

    Multiple faculty members at each of the authors' institutions have
explored, adopted, adapted, or created OER. By the end of spring 2017
K-State had granted OER awards to approximately 80 faculty from 26 dif-
ferent departments. The faculty of the math departments at both GSVU
and K-State have been actively involved in converting their courses to
OER to provide innovative teaching to their students. Faculty members
from our initiatives have reported that they are interested in OER as a way
to provide flexibility in their teaching and more learning options for their
students. Faculty instructors report concern for student costs as a major
factor in the selection of course materials, as well as the quality of the re-
source, providing a fair and equitable resource, and student engagement
(Green, 2016). Faculty have discipline-specific and pedagogical expertise
that make them excellent OER partners for evaluating and creating re-
sources to use in their courses.
Open Partnerships  173

Academic Department Heads
Department heads make a strong partner in OER as they may stall or
accelerate your OER program. Unlike many other partners whose pri-
mary focus is on student success, department heads are more focused
on their faculty and departmental success, even if they still teach one or
two courses. You may be able to identify the department's current prior-
ities by reviewing their goals, mission, and other documents (if any are
available to you). Often, a department head's first consideration will be
the faculty tenure and promotion process and how a faculty member's
commitment of time on a textbook fits in with their other duties and re-
quirements. Also, for some faculty, the creation of OER is not an added
value to their portfolio. Working on an open textbook project could lead
to a department head discouraging participation. Unknown challenges for
new faculty can mean added stress, mainly due to limited faculty and/
or department time. Showing how an open textbook could impact posi-
tively on a particular discipline, improve teaching evaluations, bring the
faculty teaching awards, or provide opportunities to produce research on
the integration of OER in the classroom, can help persuade a resistant de-
partment head. It is also beneficial to know, in advance, where to find and
create OER before approaching the department head. This will show the
department head that you are ready to assist their faculty if they are ready
to encourage the change.

    Some departments on our campuses have struggled in the past with
unifying courses taught by several graduate/teaching assistants. Suggest-
ing the adoption of a single OA textbook can elevate this issue and ensures
that, even if the teaching styles still vary, all the students are learning from
the same content. This strategy has brought whole teams of faculty on
board at once for some K-State courses. Using a $100 average cost savings
for a course with 1,800 yearly student enrollments provides department
heads evidence that moving large courses to open educational resources
means the department is able to show the students large savings and the
dean a large return on investment. However, moving smaller courses to
OER allows the department and faculty to experiment with the process,
ensure they will receive a reward or see a benefit, and encourages faculty
or the department to do what they want to do first. With either approach,
departments have had success, so encourage the department head to use
174  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

the approach that feels most comfortable. You should work with the de-
partment head to prepare for rotation of faculty and staff and discuss the
possibilities of the course being cancelled. These can be signs of courses
that may not be ready for conversion, or the opposite--those that are
primed for OER.

    In our experience, certain departments have internal peer pressure to
not go open. The best counterweight to this is education. On the other
hand, some subject areas are embracing OER wholeheartedly and at the
authors' institutions, department head allies are providing support to fac-
ulty for additional resources that go beyond grant funding. We have even
seen department heads providing funds to cover commercial textbook
conversions when OER initiatives cannot. Money is far from the only
support a department head can offer: asking a department head at GSVU
to help promote an OER event resulted in that department's faculty con-
tributing over half of the event's participants.

    Department heads at K-State have also begun to show interest in be-
ing able to identify courses, (through an icon next to that department's
courses in the course catalog), that are using OER as a draw for students.
Since this has only been implemented for a couple of semesters we are not
able to determine the rate of positive draw or negative push of this icon,
but we have had faculty requesting the icon be added to their course and
report of a faculty member worried that the icon would have students en-
rolling in the other section instead of their own. In addition, with easy
identification and searching the OER icon can be used in future marketing
of their department to draw in new students.

    K-State has the benefit of having department heads as lead developers
and participants on the Open/Alternative Textbook Initiative team. Most
direct outreach to other campus department heads has been directly from
our mathematics department head partner, which, as colleagues in this
role at the university, has made for an easier, and often more candid con-
versation about the possibilities of converting department courses. These
open discussions have aided in identifying barriers that may be an obsta-
cle for specific areas. A recently implemented student fee for approved
courses using an open or alternative textbook has caught the attention
of several department heads on campus. With this, 89 percent of the
$10.00 fee (per student) goes directly to the department. Having depart-
Open Partnerships  175

ment heads on the team who understand budget constraints it was very
important to not limit the funds, apart from following already approved
university guidelines for spending. For the K-State mathematics depart-
ment last year, that was over $30,000 for the first year of participation.

    Department heads are the captains of the department "ship" whose job
it is to set the direction and look out for the "shipmates." For these part-
ners you will need to let them choose the path, demonstrate that you are
prepared, and find a way to show there are big rewards for the efforts.
With these strategies, we hope to see more department heads encourag-
ing strong support and adoption over next few years.

Students
In discussions surrounding the cost of textbooks and OER, the student
voice is central. Students are the stakeholders who are most directly im-
pacted by textbook costs and should be involved in working toward alter-
natives. The high cost of textbooks is often the cause of students not buying
required textbooks, taking fewer courses, or receiving poor grades because
they didn't have the books (Florida Virtual Campus, 2016). With the in-
creased availability and awareness of OER, there is now an alternative that
can help mitigate the cost issue. Because of the tangible impact on their
day-to-day finances, it is very easy for students to see the benefits of OER.
The challenge is finding ways to channel that awareness into action. But it
is worth it. Students can be the most passionate, articulate, and authorita-
tive voices on behalf of OER efforts. On our campuses, collaboration with
students range from activism to advocacy. Students, if well organized, can
have significant influence over their peers, professors, and administrators.

    One place to begin to collaborate with students is your local SGA. The
common goal of the SGA is to advocate on behalf of students, and as a re-
sult, SGAs have a built-in infrastructure where they can encourage faculty
and administrators to support OER. SGAs also often have access to funds
that can be used for OER incentive programs. At K-State, the SGA sup-
plied funds for the local initiative, edited, paid for, and wrote promotional
materials, and successfully advocated for an "OER icon" that is included in
the course catalog next to classes that use open or alternative materials.1

1 K-State open or alternative resources can include: the use or adaptation
176  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

They also supported and helped advocate for a student fee to help pay for
open/alternative courses.

    SGAs frequently have close connections with other student represen-
tatives in the region, so you may encourage them to reach out and discuss
how OER programs are working on other campuses. GVSU's SGA has fo-
cused on awareness, helping to raise the profile of OER by distributing
promotional materials, holding events, and passing resolutions to encour-
age OER adoption. At UMass Amherst, the SGA, with the assistance of
the library, began recognizing faculty "OER Champions". The SGA pub-
licly recognizes the faculty member for their efforts to ease the financial
burden on students. Non-monetary student recognition of faculty OER
use can be a valuable incentive: a similar initiative at Texas A&M Univer-
sity was designed so that the SGA's award could be used by the faculty as
evidence of teaching quality for tenure and promotion (Herbert, 2016).

    The SGA can reach campus leaders through representation in faculty
governance, meetings with administrators, and Boards of Trustees meet-
ings. Libraries or other campus OER partners can support student leaders
as they meet one-on-one with provosts to advocate for increased support
of OER programs. OER leaders may "coach" students before these meet-
ings with general facts about OER as well as local qualitative and quanti-
tative data illustrating the need for, and benefits of, OER. During faculty
governance meetings, the SGA has an opportunity to speak on a topic of
their choice. They can use this opportunity to educate faculty about OER
and encourage them to seek local support for the use and development
of OER in the classroom. SGA candidates running for office may also use
OER as part of their election platform. Students at K-State did this and
were successfully elected (K-State Today, 2015). Partnering with the SGA
can prove to be very effective at advancing an OER campaign at the grass-
roots level.

    In addition to the SGA, any student groups working on issues of af-
fordability, student debt, or access to higher education are great candidates
for collaboration. At UMass Amherst, the state PIRG (Public Interest Re-
search Group) has followed the lead of U.S.PIRG and begun working

of an existing open access textbook, library resources, high quality OER,
media, and/or faculty-authored materials.
Open Partnerships  177

on a textbook affordability campaign. The UMass Amherst Libraries has
worked with MassPIRG to support their #TextbookBroke campaign (Stu-
dent Government Resource Center, 2014). They have set up information
tables in high student traffic areas, collected data about textbook costs,
and handed out postcards for students to give professors that encourage
them to consider OER. Although cost is not the sole consideration for
faculty when choosing textbooks, it is a factor, along with quality and ef-
fectiveness (Allen & Seaman, 2016). If faculty hear from students that they
cannot, or will not, buy a book because of the cost, it can help motivate
faculty to look more closely at OER.

    Of course, not all work with students may be fruitful. Because of their
transient nature, it is hard to nurture long-term partnerships and maintain
relationships with administrators and faculty. Students may rotate out of
SGA, graduate, become consumed with classwork, or lose interest. This
means that you will have to frequently re-engage with new students to
keep partnerships going. One way to do this it to invite SGA or student
representatives to serve on grant application review committees. If you
make a major announcement, release news, or produce a report on the
initiative, forward it to the student groups with a note about why it is im-
portant to them. Include students in the planning of OER events and be
sure to send them a special, personalized invite where appropriate. Con-
nect with new officers following every election. Set up meetings with the
new SGA officers to review their successful OER election platform and see
how it aligns with your goals. There is no guarantee that students will share
the goals of your initiative, but informing them of your efforts will at least
allow them to make educated decisions about their future strategies.

    Students may be OER advocates in other ways as well. Students who
have used OER in the classroom can be featured in promotional content
about OER, encourage other students to enroll in OER courses, and en-
courage faculty to use OER in other classes. Students are able to provide
classroom feedback about OER resources used in a course in student
teacher evaluations. Some faculty are enlisting students to become co-
authors on collaborative OER as alternatives to traditional "throwaway
assignments" (Wiley, 2013). When coordinating student contributions to
OER projects consider copyright and the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974.
178  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Students are often integrated with OER initiatives at many levels,
from SGA to taking an OER course. Making them a partner instead of
just a participant can have lasting impacts. Students can provide advocacy,
funding, feedback, and much more; just ask.

Faculty Support Offices
If faculty partners are an essential key to the success of an OER initiative,
then faculty support offices can be the key to faculty participation. This
broad category of stakeholders may include instructional designers, edu-
cational technology specialists, teaching and learning centers, accessibility
experts, or other administrative and professional specialists. Faculty sup-
port can also encompass institution-wide committees, centers, or projects
focused on particular issues, like digital humanities/digital scholarship,
big data, or community engagement. The exact constellation of resources,
people, and organizations often varies by institution--GVSU's instruc-
tional designers, for example, are part of the information technology (IT)
department, while at UMass Amherst instructional designers are em-
ployed by both IT and the teaching and learning center. In any context,
however, these stakeholders are united by a shared focus on support-
ing the scholarly and pedagogical practices of faculty members, through
professional development programming, grant funds, consultations, and
other services. As a result, faculty support offices--whatever form they
take--have broadly similar motivations, face some of the same obstacles,
and bring similar benefits as an OER partner.

    Faculty support offices, more than many campus stakeholders, reflect
and help to realize their institution's strategic priorities: a research-driven
institution may have more services and support to help researchers com-
pete for grant funding, while GVSU's instructional design and technology
specialists, for example, enable progress towards the university's goal of
increased online course offerings. By linking OER with the priorities and
values of your institution, you can frame OER engagement as an opportu-
nity for faculty support offices to be more effective and successful. Strate-
gic documents, vision statements, and institutional culture can reveal key
values and concepts--innovation, sustainability, equity, student success,
recognition, research impact, competitive rankings, and more--which of-
fer an entry point to recruit these partners. With some critical and cre-
Open Partnerships  179

ative thought, you could pitch OER to faculty support offices as an en-
gaging pedagogical practice, a more sustainable approach to textbooks, an
opportunity to make higher education more equitable and affordable, or
an innovative form of scholarship with global reach. By doing so, you
position OER engagement as something that advances the partner's own
goals, instead of diverting resources from core services.

    Other OER narratives have more universal appeal, like the growing
body of research surveyed by John Hilton (2016) which suggests that,
beyond affordability, OER adoption leads to similar or better student
learning outcomes compared to traditional textbooks. Perhaps the sim-
plest reason for faculty support offices to join an OER initiative is if faculty
begin asking them for OER-related support. For example, grant manage-
ment offices may see more OER needs due to the U.S. Department of
Education's recent policy requiring open licenses of educational resources
produced through Department of Education grants (U.S. Department of
Education, 2017). Participation in an OER initiative can thus enable fac-
ulty support offices to address emerging needs and connect the faculty
they serve with other campus resources.

    Recruiting faculty support offices for an OER initiative can be challeng-
ing, of course. These stakeholders probably have far more opportunities for
collaboration on campus than resources to meet every request, especially if
they award grant funding. OER-related grants or new services may come at
the cost of other grants and services, and may be preempted by higher-pro-
file or higher-priority needs (hence the value of positioning OER as a path
towards a support office's core mission). If your institution's faculty support
offices are not well informed about OER, it may take sustained relationship
building and information sharing before they are ready to be enthusiastic
OER allies: GVSU's OER collaboration with faculty support offices only oc-
curred after several years of communication and groundwork. Even faculty
support offices that are informed and engaged OER partners face a con-
tinual learning curve as the theory, praxis, and communities around OER
emerge and evolve. As always, ongoing outreach and information sharing
are essential to breaking down silos, continuing existing partnerships, and
welcoming new parties to the OER conversation.

    Once on board with an OER initiative, faculty support offices can be
tremendously valuable allies: their relationships with and services for fac-
180  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ulty provide additional conduits to the stakeholders ultimately responsible
for adopting and creating OER. The connections that faculty support of-
fices build in the course of their normal activities offer a ready audience
for OER promotion and education, while also raising the profile of OER
projects among faculty. The GVSU grants office has systems in place
to support scholarly and creative activities, whether through funding, a
lighter teaching load, or sabbaticals, and faculty across campus are keenly
aware of these advantageous resources; by explicitly including OER as a
supportable activity, the office raises the profile of OER-as-scholarship at
the same time as directly empowering faculty OER creation.

    With practical expertise and dedicated programming on instructional
design, educational technology, or grant management, faculty support of-
fices allow an OER initiative to provide more, better, and faster support
than a library could offer on its own. At both K-State and GVSU, faculty
support specialists regularly help faculty develop online courses, create
digital learning materials, or work with learning management systems.
This assistance generates excellent opportunities to highlight the benefits
of OER, encourage open licenses on faculty-created materials, and inspire
faculty exploration of OER-enabled practices.

    Faculty support offices can both amplify OER awareness efforts and
directly assist faculty OER engagement through existing resources or ser-
vices, especially if you have successfully framed OER as an aspect of
effective teaching, innovative scholarship, or other priorities. With high
demand on these offices, it is important to locate their strategic priorities
and tie OER into those areas.

Administration and Foundation
Senior administration and foundation offices can be challenging and
sometimes intimidating to approach, but are exceptionally valuable part-
ners in an OER initiative. Presidents' and provosts' offices represent both
prestige and direct financial resources, while a foundation, alumni center,
development office, or other fundraising arm could be a conduit to ex-
ternal funding and influential community members. Compared to other
stakeholders in this chapter, administration and foundation offices are less
likely to be aware of OER and will have substantially more high-profile
demands on their time and resources. Persistent engagement and ongoing
Open Partnerships  181

education are essential early steps: take the time to invite these leaders to
OER events or activities and share great things happening in OER both
locally and nationally. Universities have also employed the competitive
spirit of showing off regional rivals' figures and highlights to entice their
leaders to act. The height of the football season, or whichever sport is
popular on campus, may be a great time to send this communication.

    K-State received minimal support from these areas for the first year
or two, but once we were able to engage the leaders in OER, show the
local return on investment, and provide evidence of the strong student
and faculty support, they were easily brought on board. In fact, the pre-
vious president of K-State, Kirk Schultz, participated in marketing, fully
supported the open/alternative student fee, and brought our initiative to
his new university. Which brings us to the point that, like students and
faculty partners, administrative partners will also have turnover and it is
important to actively engage with each new member. The major hook
for getting these players on board is the ability to market the vast stu-
dent savings with communications and marketing promotions. K-State's
Foundation Office interest was piqued after seeing donor reactions to the
initiative. Administration at K-State has provided substantial funding to
the OER initiative since the first year, and now actively seeks new donors
to K-State's Open/Alternative Textbook Initiative.

    Although difficult to engage at first, administration at your institution
can bring a high-level spotlight on your initiative. This light will make
your efforts visible to a wider audience. Use this wisely and you can in-
crease your impact even further.

Campus Bookstores
"But what about the bookstore?" It's a common question in OER con-
versations, and an understandable one. Free online textbooks can seem
like a direct threat to the business of bookstores, but book-
stores--whether independent, university-owned, or vendor-man-
aged--can be beneficial stakeholders for an OER initiative. Depending
on your context and the bookstore's willingness to engage, you may seek
to enlist the bookstore as an active partner, soothe concerns from the
bookstore or their stakeholders, or simply keep the bookstore's staff in-
formed and in the loop.
182  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Strategies that work for enlisting other campus partners are effective
at engaging the bookstore, too. For GVSU's university-run bookstore,
involvement with OER is a way to advance the university's student-cen-
tric mission and values. For externally-run bookstores, meanwhile, OER
engagement can be an opportunity to generate goodwill with students
or with the vendor's contractual partners at the institution. At UMass
Amherst, the transition to Amazon as the campus bookstore in 2016 gave
the library an opportunity to push for the surfacing of OER content and
to receive valuable data on assigned class materials. This was mostly due
to the library having representation on the team that selected Amazon as
the new campus vendor.

    OER can also generate new sales opportunities: a GVSU bookstore
manager noted that if they sold fewer textbooks, they'd have more space
for technology and for university-branded merchandise (both of these
sales opportunities offer higher profit margins than the competitive text-
book market that is currently taking up this space). A bookstore may
remain able to sell physical OER materials, from the traditionally pub-
lished OpenStax print textbooks to print shop or print-on-demand copies
of OER (depending on the licensing). In 2016-17, GVSU's bookstore sold
physical books to more than 10 percent of students enrolled in a course
that adopted an OpenStax book, even though the book was freely avail-
able online.

    In many cases, recruiting a bookstore as an OER ally may be more
challenging than other stakeholders. It is important to note that some
bookstores' contracts with the college or university may have strict policies
(in which case, you may want to target the institutional contract-holder
as a potential OER ally). If a bookstore is expected to be a revenue source
for the university or for student government, the store's financial concerns
about OER could inspire concern from university or student leaders. This
presents an opportunity to emphasize the financial benefits of OER to
those leaders and explore alternative revenue sources to reduce dependence
on textbook sales. A bookstore that is already facing difficulties with the
evolving textbook market might see an OER initiative as the most im-
mediate, visible cause of their financial trouble: a formerly independent
bookstore for K-State knew online competition had hurt sales, but also
blamed the university's OER projects for financial difficulties. Early and on-
Open Partnerships  183

going outreach to the bookstore and its own stakeholders can be helpful in
identifying obstacles like these and deciding how--or whether--to address
them. In some cases, the best approach may simply be sharing information
in good faith and keeping a door open for bookstore engagement while you
focus on other partners. Ideally, however, the bookstore will benefit from
engaging at some level with an OER program, even if that engagement is
preparing for a future with decreased textbook sales.

    Bookstores' relationships with students and faculty are valuable assets
for their business that can similarly benefit an OER program. Whether
independent, institution-run, or vendor-managed, bookstores communi-
cate regularly with faculty to explore options for course materials and li-
aise with publishers or vendors. These relationships are an opportunity to
present OER as one of many options for course materials and to connect
faculty with other OER support at their point of need. By facilitating the
adoption of an OpenStax textbook for the chemistry department, GVSU's
bookstore strengthened their relationship with the department while si-
multaneously enabling an OER adoption that affected more than 1,700
students in the 2016-17 academic year. Some bookstores are becoming
active partners in OER: bookstore management company Follet recently
launched a collaboration with OER service vendor Lumen Learning (Fol-
let, 2017), and while Follet and Lumen benefit from new revenue streams,
institutions with Follet bookstores will benefit from new resources to
support faculty OER adoptions. Bookstores have similarly high-value
connections to students, which can help raise the profile of OER and the
faculty who have adopted OER.

    A bookstore's network of relationships and role as a hub of textbook
activity also makes them an unparalleled source of data on course ma-
terial use and practices. The data they collect in the course of normal
operations--faculty selecting materials to assign or deciding not to re-
quire any texts, student purchasing behaviors, specific cost data--could
be a treasure trove for an OER initiative. GVSU's OER program is be-
ginning to explore the potential of bookstore data for both outreach
opportunities and for more accurately estimating the monetary impact of
OER adoptions. UMass Amherst is using data from Amazon to begin an
experimental textbook affordability program in the Acquisitions and Re-
serves departments.
184  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    After reading this, you are probably still wondering "But what about
the bookstore?" Ultimately, that's a question only you can answer for your
own institutional context, but in many cases advocating for OER may
not prevent a rewarding collaboration with the campus stakeholder who
sells textbooks. There are advantages that can be gained on both sides
when this partnership is successful. Begin with information sharing and
see where this partner is willing to go from there.

External Partners
For the purposes of this chapter, we define external partners as anyone
outside of the college or university governance structure and alumni com-
munity. Many of these we briefly describe below are library-centric and
some may require a fee for different levels of participation. However, we
encourage you to look for OER partners in any institutional connection,
whether or not they currently have an OER focus or library relationship.
Your community and institutional context undoubtedly contains other
distinctive organizations that could be valuable allies.

OER Communities
The professional and practice communities that have emerged around
OER communities are usually pretty "open" and welcoming, so becoming
a part of the community is rather easy. That being said, several of the
communities do require a fee to participate in depth. Some of these com-
munities still provide resources to the general public, but the "good stuff"
is members-only or behind a sign-in. An OER community can be a valu-
able source of information, provide opportunities for partnership on OER
or research, and offer colleagues to lean on with your challenges and cele-
brate your successes.

    The Open Textbook Network (n.d.-a) is a nonprofit organization of
libraries and universities supporting the use and creation of OER. This
support includes the Open Textbook Library, a portal for finding high-
quality OER with publicly posted reviews by faculty members, which is
open to any and all users. Membership in the Open Textbook Network
itself brings further benefits, including professional development events
as well as resources for creating and remixing OER (n.d.-b). Membership
in the Open Textbook Network offers outside legitimacy for OER efforts,
valuable training to empower OER allies, and access to an engaged com-
Open Partnerships  185

munity of OER users and creators--benefits that have made the Open
Textbook Network a worthwhile partner for OER programs at K-State
and UMass Amherst.

    OpenStax (n.d.-a), a nonprofit textbook publisher affiliated with Rice
University, is an easy entry point into OER for many instructors, but also
a potential partner for an OER initiative. Beyond their high-quality open
textbooks and supporting resources, OpenStax (n.d.-b) offers a grant-
supported institutional partnership program for institutions interested in
rapidly expanding the use of OER on their campus. This program, open
to new applicants annually, includes professional development, strategy
guidance, and community support for OER adoption programs. Although
the extensive OpenStax library often plays a central role in partners' ef-
forts, the program supports adoption of any OER.

    Scholarly, professional, and advocacy organizations, in addition to
state and regional associations, have thriving networks of librarians and
instructors engaged in OER practices. OER-focused sessions are increas-
ingly common in conferences focused on academic libraries, educational
technology, and instruction, not to mention the annual Open Education
Conference. The events and communities facilitated by organizations like
SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition,
https://sparcopen.org/), the Library Publishing Coalition
(https://www.librarypublishing.org/), and the Association of College &
Research Libraries (http://ala.org/acrl/) make these groups valuable as in-
formal partners, allowing your OER initiative to connect to other commu-
nities of practice, share ideas and information, collaborate, and innovate.

    Of particular note are community college organizations and associ-
ations, no matter your institution type. Community colleges are among
the leading OER innovators, from the "Z-Degree" pioneered by Tidewater
Community College (Wiley, Williams, DeMarte, & Hilton, 2016) to
Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges' Open
Washington initiative (2017), and can be an inspirational partner as you
grow your OER program. On a regional level, GVSU's OER initiative
benefits from connections with enthusiastic OER champions at Michigan
community colleges who have organized public events and shared infor-
mation resources focused on OER. The Community College Consortium
for Open Educational Resources (CCCOER) is a national organization with
186  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

a lively community of practice around OER (https://groups.google.com/
forum/#!forum/cccoer-advisory) where participants can share their suc-
cesses and failures and benefit from cross-institutional support.

Commercial OER Service Providers
A myriad of commercial services have emerged in response to increasing
attention to OER at colleges and universities. Companies like Lumen
Learning, PanOpen, bepress, and Pressbooks typically provide tools, ex-
pertise, or platforms that make it easier for instructors to adopt, use, and
create OER. For example, Lumen Learning's suite of services includes as-
sessment instruments, student learning aids, and course design support,
while Pressbooks' open source publishing platform supports user-friendly
book creation. These commercial partners can provide an OER initiative
with immediate, scalable support for faculty instructors, thereby making
OER adoption easier and more appealing.

    The Digital Commons platform from bepress enabled GVSU's library
to begin publishing faculty-created OER in 2012 with minimal additional
staff time and money. However, this example highlights a potential prob-
lem with commercial partners, beyond the obvious cost consideration:
bepress' acquisition by mega-publisher Elsevier in 2017 refreshed con-
cerns among many institutions and organizations over the implications
and consequences of scholarly infrastructures controlled by profit-driven
organizations (Joseph & Shearer, 2017; Schonfeld, 2017).

Government Offices
Local and regional governments--and the members of the public whom
they serve--are practical stakeholders and potentially transformative allies
in an OER initiative. Arguments in favor of OER can appeal across the po-
litical spectrum, from innovative pedagogy and equitable access to knowl-
edge, to college affordability and efficient use of taxpayer dollars (given
Senack and Donoghue's 2016 estimate that every year, U.S. students spend
$3 billion of government-subsidized financial aid on textbooks). In re-
turn, government partners might be a source of additional funding, can
raise the profile and legitimacy of OER, and can influence the priorities of
publicly funded colleges and universities.

    The #GoOpen program developed by the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion, and adopted by a growing number of state Departments of Education,
Open Partnerships  187

focuses on OER in K-12 education (Leu, 2017). Even so, post-secondary
OER programs can benefit from making connections with their state's
#GoOpen project, building relationships with a broader educational com-
munity and sharing OER expertise. Institutions with teacher education
programs can also use #GoOpen engagement as an entry point into con-
versations with the institution's education faculty. In the long run, K-12
OER adoptions may change students' and parents' expectations for post-
secondary institutions, providing additional pressure in favor of OER.

Conclusion
Throughout this chapter, we have highlighted stakeholders with sig-
nificant potential as allies in an OER program, based on experiences
at GVSU, UMass Amherst, and K-State. Although in many cases our
individual relationships with these partners formed organically or op-
portunistically, exploring these partnerships through the framework of
motivations, challenges, and benefits is a useful model for any form of
advocacy, as well as a template for building partnerships from scratch.
Any goal is easier to achieve when the people and organizations involved
are united by common ground, yet motivated to participate by their own
reasons, values and priorities.

    If you are involved in an OER program, your work with partners and
potential allies will undoubtedly be different, dependent as each stake-
holder is on your individual institution's context. Your institution's mis-
sion and goals, demographics, internal and external pressures, and the
individual people who make up any organization create an environment
that you can and should approach on its own terms.

    As a result, it is natural that different OER initiatives will have differ-
ent definitions of what makes a successful collaboration. Even in the three
institutions represented in this article, the authors' OER programs have
developed along unique paths with different goals. GVSU's OER part-
nerships mostly involve building awareness of OER across campus and
keeping OER in the forefront of partners' existing services and conversa-
tions. Success in this collaboration has led to more workshops and profes-
sional development opportunities around OER, growing faculty interest
in OER creation, and a network of supportive stakeholders potentially
positioned to support new activities or resources for OER. At K-State,
188  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

partners have made their program grow from a pilot OER grant project
enabled by students and the libraries to collaborations with administrative
offices to both expand the program and develop long-term funding from
external donors. Those partnerships are continuing to generate high-im-
pact collaborations with faculty OER creators and sustainable funding for
new projects. And at UMass Amherst, successful collaboration has meant
more funding, sharing the burden of promoting and supporting our OER
program, and increased awareness across campus.

    Regardless of what success means for your context and your program
right now, a wide network of partners can help you achieve and advance
beyond that success. OER initiatives can require a significant investment
of time and resources, but they are a rare and exciting opportunity for
stakeholders across an institution to collaborate on an issue because the
collaboration benefits every stakeholder's own mission.

    Hewlett Foundation President Larry Kramer (2015) wrote that, "`No
brainers' are incredibly rare in education, where strongly held, widely dis-
parate values all too often stymie potential reforms. Well, OER is a no
brainer." We would argue that building partnerships for OER programs is
an equal no brainer. An OER initiative may begin as a small collaboration
with an individual faculty member or department. Undoubtedly, a well-re-
sourced and focused library could develop and implement an entire pro-
gram of OER advocacy and support on its own, if it wanted to devote the
necessary resources. So too could many of the stakeholders we describe,
and of course individual faculty have been creating and using OER since
before OER was a common term. Maybe you can go it alone on an OER
initiative, but since working with partners can help your initiative advance
faster, reach farther, and be more efficient, why would you want to?

    This chapter outlines several partners the authors have worked with
and can be a starting point for potential collaborators for your OER ini-
tiative. Remember that each campus is unique; some partnerships work
better on certain campuses, and even if you engaged a partner once and it
was not successful, there may yet be an opportunity for successful collabo-
ration in the future. Finding the partner's hook, incorporating their needs,
and recognizing the value that they bring to the table will carry your OER
partnership into the future and hopefully on to new programs too.

Introduction
Textbook affordability has been a priority for the North Carolina State
University (NCSU) Libraries for the better part of the past decade. As a
large public land-grant institution, NCSU has a deep commitment to wel-
coming all students, particularly first-generation students and those from
underrepresented populations. As a science, technology, engineering, and
math (STEM)-focused institution, NCSU must balance this commitment
against the high cost of STEM textbooks, which are often significantly
more expensive than textbooks for humanities courses. As the space on
campus where students, faculty, the campus bookstore, and others can
meet to work collaboratively, the Libraries have a unique opportunity to
meet our own stated mission to be the "competitive advantage" for stu-
dents working to navigate this challenging textbook marketplace. This
chapter details our efforts to not only encourage the use of open educa-
tional resources on our campus, but also to understand how our students
were navigating the information marketplace, and to educate and em-
power our students to leverage the rise of open culture into meaningful
and sustainable support for open education.

Library Support for Textbook Affordability
Our initial efforts date back to a 2009 student-led proposal submitted to
our University Library Committee, which led the NCSU Libraries to pilot
a textbook lending program. In partnership with the NCSU Bookstores,
the Libraries committed to purchasing at least one copy of every required
textbook for fall and spring semester classes and made them available
to students for a short-term loan. This program ensures that any stu-
194  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

dent who does not have the funds to purchase a textbook can have access
to the textbook through the Libraries. In the first year of the program,
the Libraries purchased approximately 1,200 textbooks to seed the col-
lection, and after the success of the pilot, we have continued to purchase
around 700 textbooks each year. Textbooks are added to a "Textbook
Collection" in our integrated library system (ILS) and interfiled with our
traditional course reserves, available for a two-hour checkout in each li-
brary (Thompson, Cross, Rigling, & Vickery, 2017).

    Our textbook lending program is designed to address an immediate
burden of the cost of textbooks and learning materials on our students,
but we also have taken steps to address the culture of faculty and de-
partments assigning expensive textbooks to students by initiating library
collaborations with faculty, students, and external partners to provide
free or lower cost alternatives to traditional textbooks. In 2010, the Li-
braries partnered with the NCSU Physics Department to license a physics
textbook used for all introductory physics courses. The Libraries paid a
one-time licensing fee of approximately $1,500 to the publisher to allow
all NCSU students to have free access to an electronic version of this text-
book and any future editions through the library catalog (Laster, 2010;
Rashke & Shanks, 2012). The impact of this program on our students did
not go unnoticed by our students, faculty, and the media. Nearly 1,300 stu-
dents take a physics course which requires this textbook each year, saving
students nearly $90,000 in textbook costs annually.

    The success of this open physics textbook laid the groundwork for
the Libraries to continue to address the financial burden of buying
textbooks through collaborating with faculty to seed innovation. In
2013, NCSU Libraries received a grant from The NC State University
Foundation to develop our Alt-Textbook project. This program was in-
spired by similar programs hosted in the Temple University Libraries
and University of Massachusetts at Amherst Libraries. Like these pro-
grams, NCSU's Alt-Textbook project provides small grants of between
$500 and $2,000 to individual instructors who are willing to replace an
existing commercial textbook with an openly licensed or freely avail-
able resource. This program solicited proposals from instructors who
were interested in developing a new resource, remixing existing re-
sources, or following the open physics textbook model to license a
Getting to Know You  195

copyrighted resource. A review team comprised of librarians and other
campus stakeholders, including a student, a faculty member, representa-
tives from the university Distance Education and Learning Technology
Applications office, and a representative from the university Office of
Faculty Development, voted on applications and awarded nine grants.
This project received press nationally in publications such as Library
Journal, and locally, including articles in NC State's student-run news-
paper, The Technician. After the first round of Alt-Textbook grants, our
student senate passed a bill stating their support of this program and ex-
pressing gratitude to the Libraries.

    After the first year, the Alt-Textbook project received internal fund-
ing from the NCSU Libraries. Over the course of three years, the Alt-
Textbook project has successfully converted 20 courses to using open
or free educational resources in place of costly textbooks. NCSU Li-
braries estimates, based on course enrollment and the cost of the replaced
commercial textbooks, that the Alt-Textbook project has saved students
nearly $300,000 in textbook costs. This program encouraged the adop-
tion of pre-existing open resources, and sought to engage students in the
creation of open resources. These resources have explored innovative
instruction such as student made-videos, 3D scan files and renderings,
remixed popular articles, interactive tutorials, and iterative courses de-
veloped through versioning tools like GitHub. These learning materials
are not just free to use, but have added value that is not provided by a
print resource.1

    As the footprint of Alt-Textbook grew, the Alt-Textbook team of
librarians' contact with students did not always follow suit. This faculty-
facing grant program didn't have obvious opportunities for students to
engage. Librarians involved in the Alt-Textbook project focused their
advocacy efforts for open textbooks on individual faculty members, de-
partments, and faculty-facing offices or groups on campus. Yet students
were an important driving force behind our commitment to textbook
affordability. The cost of textbooks affects our students above all, and
students have the potential to be the loudest and most persuasive voice

Textbook projects.
196  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

in a move towards open education on campus. This chapter discusses
the strategies and tactics we took to re-engage our students and em-
power them to become advocates for open education on campus and
beyond.

Getting to Know our Student Community
In order to build connections with our students around open education
and open culture, we focused on two approaches: researching the needs
of our students through analysis of textbook usage and communication
on social media, and interacting with them directly, through existing stu-
dent groups and with one-on-one conversations. By combining direct
engagement with a deeper understanding of student needs, the Libraries
have been able to develop partnerships that improved educational out-
comes for students.

    One of the first steps for our engagement was for us to develop
a deeper understanding of student needs and practices related to the
assigned learning materials in their courses. Because we could rely on ex-
isting research done at the national level related to the financial burden
of textbooks, we began our research with a focus on textbook afford-
ability at NCSU. To do this, we analyzed student use of two campus
resources: the Libraries textbook lending program and online commu-
nities devoted to informal textbook exchange and information sharing.
Significant work has been done by groups such as the Student Public In-
terest Research Group (PIRG) on the needs and practices of students at
the national level, but information about the needs of NCSU's students
was limited, and we needed to design engagement activities that would
be meaningful and effective at the campus level.

    Our textbook lending program has been a significant boon for our
students. Because it has been so heavily used, data gathered from the
program provided important insights into the needs it was meeting. By
tracking student use of the program and cross-referencing it with data
from the university bookstore about course size and textbook cost, we
were able to use it to identify a large set of granular data that informed
our broader understanding of student needs and behaviors (Thompson
et al., 2017). This research revealed clear areas where students were
relying heavily on textbook lending, either to replace an expensive text-
Getting to Know You  197

book or to provide access to a book that was physically unavailable
or inconvenient to use on campus. Although these areas crossed disci-
plines and instructors, a clear set of especially high-enrollment courses
with expensive assigned textbooks emerged that delineated pain points
for students. These specific courses--often, but not always introduc-
tory level--clustered around a few discrete areas of study are clearly
putting significant financial pressure on our students. By identifying
these courses, this research helped us map courses, majors, and commu-
nities that were struggling with textbooks and gave us the information
to speak credibly about student needs.

    This information dovetailed with our second area of research: analy-
sis of informal textbook exchange and information sharing that we have
called "student survivalism." In order to better understand students' use
of informal channels such as social media to share information about
courses and develop gray markets for buying and selling used materials,
we harvested data representing student activity on an institution-specific
Facebook group. We posted a question to an institutional-specific sub-
reddit, and a local online forum, requesting guidance for a new student
navigating these issues (Thompson et al., 2017).

    This research revealed an impressive community of students en-
gaged in social commerce at NCSU. Students have developed robust
markets for buying and selling not only textbooks, but also supplemental
materials, from classroom "clickers" and lab kits to forestry vests and
handball equipment. Students also use these markets for exchanging ma-
terials such as parking passes, loft beds for a dorm room, and, in one case,
a bald cap.

    In particular, students are using these exchanges to mitigate not only the
costs of textbooks, but also to mitigate the challenges created by digital ma-
terials that require access codes, which allow access to course materials but
which often expire after a single use or remain tied to a single user. In some
cases, access code materials were shared in this gray market. Students also
used these spaces for information sharing about assigned materials, asking
whether they "really need to buy" an expensive textbook or set of materials.
This exchange often went further, with discussions about whether a par-
ticular instructor was an engaging speaker, whether an elective course was
worth enrolling in, and how to navigate their academic career.
198  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Taken together, this research on student survivalism revealed im-
portant trends about student needs around the cost of textbooks, but
also provided insight into students' lives on campus. We discovered new
things about the way informal channels developed communities of stu-
dents that offered support and guidance for one another.

    The result of all of this research confirmed our sense that students'
engagement with issues of access to resources goes far beyond concerns
about open education and the costs of textbooks. Our research reaffirmed
that physical, commercial textbooks pose logistical and pedagogical chal-
lenges for students. At the same time, student consideration of the value
of educational materials goes far beyond the financial costs, leading to
questions about how a text fits into a course and whether instructors are
thoughtful about their assigned texts. These communities for unmoder-
ated discussion are valuable for students in a variety of ways and point to
the potential value of open culture for other aspects of student life. We
know students are also creators of scholarly and popular content that ben-
efits from openness. They value communities that connect them to new
collaborators and allow them to share their work.

    To understand the different ways that open culture resonates with
students, we reached out to students directly to understand their per-
spective and to begin to share the work we had been doing. As the
environment of students' lives and academic work came into view, these
conversations illuminated our shared aims: making student work openly
available, creating open spaces, and promoting open culture to facilitate
collaboration, discovery, and community. These conversations also began
to suggest opportunities to work together to meet these aims.

    Our first formal work in this space was a series of pop-up interviews
done as part of our Open Access Week programming. Held in October
2016, our Open Access Week events included exhibits of open source art,
training on use of open scholarly tools, and our "Power of Open" events
that connected work in the makerspace with open licensing. Along with
these events, we set up a small kiosk in our main library and asked stu-
dents about their experience with open culture.

Open Access Week Pop-ups
200  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Open Access Week Pop-ups

Using a set of simple prompts such as "what percentage of the materials in
the library will be available after you graduate?" or "what would you do if
you didn't have access to the library's databases tomorrow?" we asked stu-
dents about their information privilege and their experiences with open
materials and open culture. As an incentive, we provided candy.

    Over the course of the week we spoke to roughly 300 students from
across multiple departments and classes. These conversations revealed
student interest in open culture on a variety of fronts. Unsurprisingly,
many students had little or no awareness of open culture. Since they were
unlikely to be familiar with traditional points of references such as open
access, students often had, at most, a colloquial understanding of open
as "free." The idea that databases may not be available after graduation
took some by surprise. One student, when asked to estimate how much
the Libraries paid for a journal subscription guessed "$50." Responding to
questions about how they would cope if licensed resources were suddenly
unavailable, students suggested they would "be totally lost" or "cry." Some
Getting to Know You  201

students did suggest student survivalism strategies similar to those we ex-
amined in our research, such as the student who wrote that they could
always "download books illegally online."

    Some students did have familiarity with certain aspects of open cul-
ture. For example, students engaged with computer science identified a
strong commitment to open source licensing for software. Many students
were also familiar with openly licensed resources such as Creative Com-
mons or with gray market sites such as torrents. In many cases, however,
this awareness was connected to the idea of free resources, rather than the
more robust "5R" understanding of open that librarians and open culture
advocates are dedicated to.

    The other major takeaway from these pop-up sessions was that there
was a desire to learn more and to develop a community. Although stu-
dents may have been surprised to discover that licensed databases would
not be available once they graduated, they wanted to do something about
the issue. Naturally, reducing the cost of textbooks resonated particularly
deeply, but larger discussions about issues such as public access to scholar-
ship and global access inequity also animated lively discussion. More often
than not, students left the pop-up sessions energized about the issues and
more aware of the Libraries' role in addressing them.

    We had a similar experience when we reached out to individual stu-
dents through other contexts. We had productive and exciting discussions
with several of our student workers, who often had a better understand-
ing of library resources but still had much to learn about open culture.
Conversations with student workers confirmed many of the ideas we
identified in pop-up sessions: open was often conflated with "free." Stu-
dent workers also confirmed that many students did not understand how
open practice was a meaningful advantage for students, especially those
who were not planning to become scholars.

    As in the pop-ups, however, students were enthusiastic about issues
of access and quickly connected them with the value of open as a way
to develop communities of practice. Conversations about open access
publishing often seemed abstract to these students, but sharing work to
develop a portfolio for potential collaborators or employers made sense
in a very concrete way. Students were clear that library engagement with
open would need to spell out how open culture could make their lives
202  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

better by finding a job, completing coursework, or identifying new collab-
orators with shared or complementary interests.

    The final group we reached out to was student leaders. The responses
from student government representatives and students on campus com-
mittees shared many similarities with their fellow students. Knowledge
of open culture beyond free resources was scattered across campus and
generally tied to the majors or organizations they were engaged with on
campus. Even more than their counterparts however, these leaders were
enthusiastic about tackling these issues once they understood them. In a
few cases, student groups had partnered with the Libraries on small efforts
in the past. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the student sen-
ate had passed a resolution commending our Alt-Textbook project several
years earlier, although we were a bit puzzled that we had never been made
aware of the commendation.

    Without exception, committee members were happy to spread the
word about Libraries programs. Members of student government imme-
diately pledged to use their offices to help their fellow students and their
next question was often "how can we help?" Our job was to find an answer
to that question.

Turning Knowledge into Outreach
Armed with a new understanding of how our students understand and ap-
proach both textbook affordability and information access, we were ready
to find meaningful places to intervene with information about open cul-
ture. Our approach centered largely on the idea that, if students could
understand the value of openness in the work that they create or are in-
terested in, they could apply this concept to their course materials and
become great advocates for open education. This process, which we call
"stealth advocacy," involved identifying pre-existing Libraries or on-cam-
pus services that could be enhanced by a conversation about ownership
and openness and approaching this service to build a partnership. As a li-
brary with an active makerspace community that regularly engages with
open source software, open hardware, and openly licensed materials, we
chose to integrate this content into pre-existing makerspace instruction.

    This partnership began as an effort to create local programming for
International Open Access Week 2016: Open for Collaboration. We redesigned
Getting to Know You  203

the curriculum for the existing Arduino and 3D printing workshops for a
mini workshop series we called Power of Open. We chose these workshops
because existing curriculum required students to engage with open hard-
ware, open source software, and openly licensed materials. The content
was designed in a partnership between librarians with tool expertise from
the NCSU Libraries' makerspace and librarians from the NCSU Libraries'
Copyright and Digital Scholarship Center with deep knowledge of copy-
right, licensing, and the scholarly life cycle. These workshops began with
a primer on ownership and licensing, and then delved deeply into hands-
on tool training. We taught students how their individual making activity
is shaped by a larger community of makers who use open tools and open
licensing to enable sharing and community-building and mitigate or elim-
inate barriers to access.

Power of Open

The Power of Open miniseries drew an engaged audience of faculty, staff,
graduate students, and undergraduate students. The feedback was over-
whelmingly positive; participants filled out anonymous feedback forms
after the session where they were asked to rate the session on a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent) and all reported the session as a 4 or a 5. Addition-

Lauren and Lillian's workshop taught foundational lessons about free li-
censing, copyright, and operating a 3D printer, while providing hands-on
experience. The workshop also showed what makes makerspaces so spe-
cial: bringing the community together."

    After the success of the Power of Open miniseries and the feedback
from Harris Kenny, it was clear that this content had the potential to be
core to our students' learning experience. We redesigned the workshops
to include content about copyright, licensing, and sharing throughout,
and offered them as introductory Arduino and 3D Printing and Design
workshops. The new curriculum integrated hands-on activities with the
Arduino kits or LulzBot Mini 3D Printers into instruction on open li-
censing in the making community. For example, in the 3D Printing and
Design workshops, after a basic primer on Creative Commons licensing,
students were asked to download a CC-licensed remixable file from Thin-
giverse--a digital repository of files for laser cutting or 3D printing. They
then worked with this openly licensed file to remix and print the file. Fi-
nally, we discussed what their rights to the remixed file were, and how
they might upload or share their altered file or their original design to
Thingiverse or a similar repository of openly licensed files. We continued
to receive positive feedback on these workshops through our anonymous
feedback forms, and many students responded to the question "What was
the most useful thing you learned in today's session?" with a reference
to the licensing section of the curriculum. One student even responded,
"Copyright - refreshing topic!"

    We have continued to take this stealth advocacy approach for the
value of open with other workshops offered through the library. In spring
2017, we piloted a workshop for our digital media lab titled "Making Mu-
sic: Uncovering Copyright." This workshop was a collaborative effort be-
tween NCSU Libraries' Copyright and Digital Scholarship Center, and the
Digital Media Librarian from NCSU Libraries' Learning Spaces and Ser-
vices Department. This workshop not only taught students about owner-
ship and licensing in music through hands-on beatmaking and sampling
activities, but also pointed students to sources for openly licensed music
Getting to Know You  205

files, like ccMixter, and platforms which allowed students to upload and
openly license their own creations, like SoundCloud. In both of these
workshop series, students reported feeling more informed about own-
ership, and, in multiple cases, feedback forms specifically indicated that
students felt the most valuable topic covered was Creative Commons
and open licensing. We continue to identify partners with existing in-
formation literacy programming where we can find a way to talk about
openness to continue to build a community of engaged students that care
about open.

    We also took a straightforward approach to educating our students
about open. In an attempt to connect with motivated students across
multiple disciplines and departments, we hosted a full-day student-ori-
ented conference on open culture and open creation. With the support
of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)
and the Right to Research Coalition (R2RC) we applied to host an Open-
Con Satellite Event--a local meeting that leverages the momentum of the
international OpenCon meeting, designed with the mission of "Empow-
ering the Next Generation to Advance Open Access, Open Education and
Open Data." We hosted this event as part of Open Education Week 2017.

    We used the information we had learned through our informational
interviews and other information-gathering to design programming that
we felt would attract a wide array of students. In addition to bringing in
speakers from various library departments, including Collections and Re-
search Strategy, Digital Library Initiatives, and the Copyright and Digital
Scholarship Center, we brought in a local open advocate, Tom Callaway.
In Tom's work as the University Outreach Lead for Red Hat, he works
to help students and educators understand, use, and contribute to open
source efforts. We consulted with the NCSU Center for Student Leader-
ship, Ethics, and Public Service on the design and promotion of the event.

    The event was marketed as an opportunity to gain valuable skills for
careers in and outside of academia that hinged on openness and leader-
ship. We incentivized students to attend by providing the opportunity for
students to create personal web pages and have headshots taken through-
out the day. OpenCon 2017: North Carolina Student Leaders saw deep en-
gagement with a group of undergraduate and graduate students from the
sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explain the power of open-
206  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ness and open licensing in retaining control of their early work while
simultaneously engaging with a broader community of scholars and prac-
titioners. Throughout the day, students engaged with various facets of
openness through hands-on tool-based sessions, workshops, and talks
with established open advocates. Students received a brief introduction
to the concept of openness and how it applies to concepts like education,
data, and scholarship. Next, students attended a brief how-to session on
openly licensing their own work or identifying and using openly licensed
works. Students then had the opportunity to make their own online port-
folio using GitHub Pages where they can host a résumé or student work.

    Students also had the opportunity to meet Tom Callaway, who has
made a career working with open tools and openly licensing his own
work. In his keynote address, he told his own story of working on open
source and openly licensed projects in his early career and the doors that it
opened for him. He also discussed how he values visibility and openness of
a candidate's work when hiring new professionals. Finally, students par-
ticipated in advocacy training, where they learned how to demonstrate
the value of open to key stakeholders, including employers, professors, or
administrators. They had the opportunity to practice not only advocat-
ing for open, but also explaining why open was important to each student
as an individual and as a community member, in small groups. This ex-
perience gave students the confidence to speak to those in positions of
authority about the importance of openness.

    Finally, we reached out to our student senate, the same group that
had previously issued a statement in support of Alt-Textbook, about
helping us inform students about the services the Copyright & Digital
Scholarship Center at the NCSU Libraries could offer. We were able
to engage with their President-elect. After a frank conversation with
him about the success of Alt-Textbook, the textbook lending program,
and the other open programming the libraries supported, we offered
our support in any way possible. We invited him to attend OpenCon
2017: North Carolina Student Leaders, and followed up with him specifi-
cally about his experience. Our student government has the potential to
be the most persuasive body on campus to advocate for open education,
and we were willing and eager work with and support students in any
way possible. We were invited to the inaugural meeting of the student
Getting to Know You  207

senate for the 2017-18 academic year and allotted 15 minutes for a pre-
sentation.

    We led our student senators in a discussion about textbook affordabil-
ity, prompting them with questions about the cost of their textbooks such
as "What is the most expensive textbook you have ever purchased?" and
"How many of you have not purchased an assigned textbook? Can you tell
us why?" We devoted most of our presentation time to fielding questions,
positioning the Libraries as a partner and support on campus, rather than
presenting Alt-Textbook as a service offered by the Libraries. It was im-
portant that we opened the floor to feedback on our existing services in
order to provide room to create a partnership. We spoke candidly to the
students about our previous information-gathering conversations as well
as the data we had collected about the cost of textbooks on campus. Per-
sonalizing and contextualizing the conversation about open education to
NCSU's campus allowed the student senate to connect with the issue.

Shall We Dance? Funneling from "Open" to "OER"
By the summer of 2017, we had developed a two-way relationship be-
tween the Libraries and students at NCSU. The Alt-Textbook project is
well known, with stories in our student newspaper and student engage-
ment at the individual and student government level. Open is also under-
stood as an integral part of student work in and beyond the classroom.
Where there had been so little communication that library resources were
unrecognized and a student senate resolution of support went unreported,
there was now fertile ground for collaboration.

    One of the major results of this new relationship is a fundamental
change to our OER program. In its initial form, the Alt-Textbook project
was focused primarily on transformative pedagogy, inviting faculty in-
structors to "do something a textbook can't!" In collaboration with stu-
dents, we are reconfiguring the project to reflect the two aims of our
work. Instead of asking every project to both save students money and
create innovative instruction, we have split our grants into two comple-
mentary programs.

    Grounded in our discussion with students about immediate, concrete
impacts, we offer Student Success grants that save students money. These
can be simple adoption of an OER, use of licensed library resources, or
208  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

any other approach that reduces the burden on students in the current
semester.

    In order to connect students with the power of open in the larger
"5R" sense, we also offer open pedagogy grants that transform teaching
and learning. These courses, which replace static, one-size-fits-all materi-
als with shared learning, sustain our efforts to make open a tool to change
the environment in the long term. An early partnership with the Wiki
Education Foundation provides a promising prototype for these projects.
Replacing disposable research assignments that end up in the trash can
with research products that contribute to Wikipedia has energized both
students and faculty (Jhangiani, 2016; Wiley, 2013). By raising the level of
understanding about open culture as a transformative force, we know our
students are better prepared to engage with these courses.

    In addition to changing the program itself, we have begun to develop
strategies that empower students to drive change in open education more
broadly. One of our priorities will be to help students tell their stories. We
are proud of the advocacy work we have done with faculty and adminis-
tration, but we recognize that students have a unique perspective that can
be a powerful force for change. By raising their awareness of the poten-
tial of open culture, we have already seen students make more sophisticated
and impactful arguments about open education. Now our role is to amplify
those voices and connect them to decision-makers on campus and beyond.

    Connecting student voices to faculty is a clear first step. Many faculty
are unaware of the burden placed on students by commercial textbooks,
and too many more choose to prioritize convenience or even personal fi-
nancial gain over student success. In the Libraries we have heard and been
moved by students' stories and we aim to give faculty the same chance
to hear and react. This is especially true at the departmental level, where
engagement with a single faculty member may not be able to change
textbook assignments in adjunct-led introductory classes. No amount of
faculty outreach can solve this problem, but connecting students in a de-
partment with that department's administration can make a difference.

    Student voices can have significant impact on other campus stake-
holders such as our campus bookstore. We are fortunate to have a store
that is genuinely dedicated to student success and has been a willing part-
ner in our efforts around open education. Nevertheless, decisions made
Getting to Know You  209

without student input can seem appealing but miss crucial effects that
students are best positioned to notice. For example, the recent trend of
adopting "inclusive access" models where all students pay a course fee that
provides access to course materials may be appealing to a bookstore daz-
zled by potential savings and the promise of 100 percent sell-through.
Our students, however, are often suspicious of the inclusive access model,
which they fear will lock them out of long-term access and the ability
to avail themselves of the student survivalism skills discussed above. By
connecting our students with the bookstore, these concerns can be raised
directly so the bookstore is better able to meet its mission and students can
be assured their concerns are heard.

    We are also committed to giving our students the ability to share their
stories beyond campus. Our own advocacy has been strengthened immea-
surably by stories from students at other campuses and we need to add
our students' voices to the national conversation. This is particularly true
since students benefit so much from hearing from their peers on issues
of openness. Trumpeting their success can be an inspiration for students
at other campuses. Just as significantly, the quiet communities engaged
in student survivalism on individual campuses will be strengthened when
connected to a national and global community.

    In addition to broadcasting the voices of our students, the Libraries
are committed to giving students' voices greater impact on campus. As
frustrating as it was to engage and energize students in our initial pop-ups,
only to leave them with nothing to do with that energy, we must pro-
vide actionable steps for individual students and the student groups such
as student government that want to make a difference. Early efforts in
this area have included discussion with student government about nam-
ing a student-voted Faculty Champion. We are working to meet stated
student demands for early access to course syllabi, as required by the Fed-
eral Higher Education Opportunity Act 2008, so they know more about
individual courses before they register. If this is successful, we would like
to have our course listings indicate which courses have adopted free and
open materials so students can vote with their feet. This approach, which
empowers students to use their market power to address the imbalance in
the textbook market, is especially appealing because it is student- rather
than library-driven.
210  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Finally, we are excited about building on our shared commitment to
open culture to empower students in other areas. Partnerships with stu-
dent journals that are published open access and student groups that use
open source code for projects have built openness into student lives in
ways that are meaningful for them, not just assigned by an instructor
or administrator. Engagement with unmediated communication on social
media to tell students' stories and measure the impact of creative works
have prepared them for public science and lifelong learning. Use of open
platforms like GitHub and Creative Commons have made their works
openly available so they can find new collaborators and showcase their
work for employers as they move beyond our campus and into the next
phase of their lives. As an institution committed to openness, these stu-
dent benefits also benefit everyone, since a new generation of citizens,
artists, and entrepreneurs are conversant with and enthusiastic about
open culture.

Conclusion
In one year of open advocacy we have transformed the conversation about
openness on campus, and invited our students to not only participate in,
but to direct this conversation. However, with the rapid turnover in an
undergraduate population at a college or university we must continue to
be active in encouraging advocacy. This presents an additional challenge
at a large university where you rarely see the same face twice. Working
"on student time" means working at a much quicker pace than comes nat-
urally, and it means we need to continually make ourselves, our services,
and our accomplishments visible on campus. Though we want to encour-
age students to be the voice of open education on campus, the Libraries
must be diligent in providing support for students to do so.

    In the coming academic year, librarians from the Copyright & Digital
Scholarship Center, as well as any other librarians invested in open ed-
ucation on campus, must continue to engage face-to-face with students.
We must continue to get to know our students as they grow and change,
and we must continue to educate our students on the value of openness
in education and beyond. The process laid out in this chapter is not lin-
ear and finite. Rather, the steps need to be performed continually and in
concert.
Getting to Know You  211

    But now that we have the ear of student leaders, we need to keep them
engaged, active, and listening, finding the delicate balance of encourag-
ing students to prioritize open education advocacy while giving students
space to advocate in their own voice with their own methods. Our student
leaders expressed the need for guidance, support, and leadership with re-
spect to advocacy, which will allow us to be more hands-on. But they have
also asserted that NCSU's campus is unique, and the ways that other stu-
dent governments on other campuses have promoted open education may
not cut and paste easily onto our campus. We must step back and allow
students who are in place to represent the student body to decide what
will work best for our campus. We plan to stay involved and active in this
dialog, as NCSU students push our community to care not only about af-
fordability, but also about openness in scholarship, code, art, and more.

     Students: OER Advocacy at UT San Antonio

UTSA Background
The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) was founded in 1969
by the Texas Legislature in order to provide access to quality higher ed-
ucation for South Texans. Over the last 10 years, UTSA has expanded its
vision to become a Top Tier research institution, while still preserving its
founding mission to provide access.

    UTSA is designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), where
almost 60 percent are students of color. Over 40 percent of UTSA's un-
dergraduate students who have graduated within the last five years are
first-generation college students, with 40 percent qualifying for Pell fed-
eral grants (UTSA, 2017b).

    Typically, Latino students face economic barriers more acutely than
other groups starting college. In a Pew Research Study on Latinos and Ed-
ucation, 74 percent of Latinos surveyed who had a high school diploma
or less stated that the reason they could not pursue higher education was
because they needed to support their families (Lopez, 2009). College costs
can range from equal to many times greater than the average median net
worth of Latino households (Dowd & For, 2012). From 2005 to 2009,
Latino households' net worth shrank from $18,359 to $6,325 (Kochhar,
Fry, & Taylor, 2011). During the same period, tuition and fees for a four-
year public university rose to $6,695--approximately the same amount as
the average Latino family's net worth (National Center for Education Sta-
tistics, 2010).

    Over the next 20 years, the vast majority of growth in the student
population in South Texas will be driven by Latinos (Greater Texas Foun-
dation et al., 2011). The success of the region is increasingly becoming
214  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

inextricably tied to their success. As an HSI, UTSA has a significant role to
play in the continued growth and development of the South Texas region.

Providing Access to Quality Education in South Texas
In December 2011, UTSA kicked off an initiative to address two of the
biggest indicators of student success: student retention and graduation
rates. Out of the freshman cohort admitted to UTSA in fall 2011, only
15.2 percent graduated within four years (UTSA, 2017a). Research has
shown that HSIs have lower retention and completion rates when com-
pared with their non-HSI peers (Contreras & Contreras, 2015; New
America, 2015).

    UTSA set a goal to improve the four-year graduation rate to 25 per-
cent for the 2021 freshman cohort (UTSA, 2011). The Graduation Rate
Improvement Plan (GRIP) identified numerous ways to address the issues
of lower graduation and retention rates, including streamlining the cur-
riculum, financial incentives to finish on time, expansion of faculty and
student support, as well as raising admission standards (UTSA, 2011).

    More recently, UTSA has refined its approach to addressing gradua-
tion and retention rates, with a new initiative called CLASS: Coordinated
and Linked Approach to Student Success. The new approach includes
strategies focused on integrated approaches to student support services,
including advising, onboarding, leadership development, financial aid,
and enhancing the first-year experience (UTSA Office of the Provost,
2016). One of the innovative efforts to support the financial aid needs of
students is the offering of micro-retention grants, where small amounts
of funds can be the difference between staying in school or dropping out
(UTSA Office of the Provost, 2016).

OER as a Strategy for Student Success
Across the nation, there have been efforts made by numerous community
colleges, specifically through the Achieving the Dream Network, to con-
struct entire degree programs using only OER materials. These efforts
build on the success of institutions like Tidewater Community College's
Z-Degree program, which has created an Associate of Science degree pro-
gram with no textbook costs (Tidewater Community College, 2015).

    UTSA's leadership selected Georgia State as an exemplar institution
due to its incredible success raising graduation rates and its diverse stu-
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  215

dent population. There have been many discussions about how we can
adopt Georgia State's best practices and create new strategies to fuel stu-
dent success. OER is one of many identified supporting strategies that can
help us reach our student success goals.

    In 2003, Georgia State had an institutional graduation rate of 32 per-
cent, with underserved minority student populations having an even
lower rate (Georgia State University, 2016). Through multiple strategic
efforts, they have since increased their graduation rate to 58 percent in
2016 for their students of color. Although not one of the major strategies
for student success, Georgia State and the University System of Georgia
(USG) have funded efforts to promote OER as a means to reduce the fi-
nancial burden on students. Affordable Learning Georgia is a statewide
program offering financial incentives (grants), coordination between in-
stitutions, and online resources that support OER growth and sustain-
ability. Numerous studies and data support a positive correlation between
students' overall financial situation and their likelihood of persisting and
graduating (Alon, 2007; Hossler, Ziskin, Gross, Kim, & Cekic, 2009;
Tinto, 2004).

    USG piloted a new open textbook for US History I in the fall of
2013, and found a 6 percent increase in retention when compared with
the same semester the previous year (Affordable Learning Georgia, 2014).
Interestingly, an even greater improvement was seen in grades. Successful
completion of the course (grades A, B, or C) increased from 56 percent to
84 percent when using the open textbook.

The Potential for OER at UTSA
The cost of textbooks has increased at a rate of over 80 percent in the last
10 years (Senack, 2014). Students have felt that increase acutely, result-
ing in many students forgoing purchasing the textbook or buying a used,
older edition. In a survey we conducted of 568 students who used OER
in our grant pilot program, many alternatives to purchasing their text-
books were identified: not purchasing textbooks at all, renting, borrowing
from friends, or using library copies. Given UTSA's status as an HSI as
well as the economic challenges faced by our students, the adoption of
OER seemed like a strong strategy in support of increased retention and
graduation rates. It has been established that there is a clear link between
216  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

family income level, college retention, and graduation. The National Cen-
ter for Education Studies report, Placing College Graduation Rates in Context,
concluded that across universities with similar attributes, those that enroll
larger numbers of low-income students tend to have lower graduation
rates (2006). OER is one way that we can alleviate the financial strain that
students bear when faced with rising textbook costs; we hope it will con-
tribute positively to student retention at UTSA.

    In response to the cost of textbooks and students' financial limitations,
over the past six years the UTSA Libraries has purchased textbooks actively
being used in classes for circulation in reserves. Our reserves circulation is
primarily driven by textbooks, with circulation increasing 28 percent from
2013 to 2016, while circulation of other reserve materials overall falling by
30 percent during the same period (UTSA Libraries, 2015). Although pro-
viding print textbooks is a helpful service for students, check out periods
are limited to two hours, and there is often a wait list during peak times of
the semester. OER present us with a better alternative--textbooks that are
completely accessible at any given time, from anywhere.

UTSA Faculty
As of fall 2016, UTSA employed 1,396 faculty with 41 percent tenured,
15 percent tenure-track, and 44 percent non-tenure-track (UTSA Office
of Institutional Research, 2016, p. 2). Though total enrolment is hovering
at just under 30,000, the campus has a student to professor ratio of 22:1
(UTSA, n.d.).

    UTSA Libraries' 11 research and instruction librarians provide sup-
port for faculty and students in the 165 degree programs across the uni-
versity: University College; College of Architecture, Construction and
Planning; College of Business; College of Education and Human Develop-
ment; College of Engineering; College of Liberal and Fine Arts; Honors
College; College of Public Policy; College of Sciences, and the Graduate
School (UTSA, 2018).

    The UTSA Libraries' subject librarians partner regularly with faculty
in their academic departments to support teaching by: tailoring library
sessions to courses and assignments; creating online tutorials and re-
search guides; providing copyright support and guidance on fair use; and
providing innovative teaching spaces for class sessions throughout the
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  217

semester. In addition to teaching support, librarians are heavily involved
in events sponsored by their academic departments, including begin-
ning of semester departmental orientations, student welcome events, and
graduate student orientation. Librarians also maintain a steady stream
of communication with faculty in their areas to build the collection in
support of faculty research and new academic programs through new ac-
quisitions in all formats.

    UTSA librarians realized in the earliest stages of OER exploration just
how crucial faculty engagement would be to the successful adoption and
growth of OER at UTSA. Faculty are the key decision-makers when it
comes to textbook selection, which can greatly influence a student's suc-
cess or failure in a course. UTSA subject librarians have cultivated lasting
relationships with faculty in their areas and have a great foundation on
which to build current and future conversations with faculty interested
in growing OER at UTSA. Strong relationships with the Faculty Center
and Center for Teaching and Learning Services, and a constant presence
at faculty events, have supported new faculty-librarian partnerships and
reinvigorated existing ones.

Grant Program
At the writing of this chapter, the UTSA Libraries had completed the
first grant cycle (2015-16), collected student and faculty feedback on the
OER trials, and had awarded the second round of grants (2016-17). Even
though our program is still in the beginning stages, we've continued to re-
fine it and are constantly evaluating and incorporating new strategies for
growing OER adoption.

    During the first funding cycle, the Libraries offered $1,500 mini-
grants for faculty interested in adopting OER for their courses. The mini-
grants were funded solely from the library's budget, and we were able to
award a total of $7,500 to five faculty for using OER in their courses; these
five faculty are currently featured on our website (UTSA Libraries, 2017).

    Though we recognize there are many other incentives at play in
order for faculty to adopt and integrate OER into their courses, librarians
offered mini-grants to fast-track OER adoption in order to make an im-
mediate impact on our students. Although textbooks are only a fraction
of total college costs, every dollar saved can be used by our students to
218  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

meet other needs. Our thinking was that once the program took off, the
push for integrating OER into more courses would come from other fac-
ulty that had adopted OER with success, students that have successfully
completed OER courses, and, finally, campus administrative and student
leaders advocating for OER adoption.

    Because many of the courses we were targeting are taught by adjuncts
and sometimes graduate and PhD students, the only requirement the
library imposed, as far as faculty status, is that the applicants be the in-
structor of record for the course. To encourage collaboration and provide
additional support, applicants were also required to partner with their
subject librarian in order to identify and locate potential OER for their
course. Adoption of low- or no-cost materials for the class, completion of
an adoption impact report, including student and faculty feedback on the
OER used, and participation in a Faculty Center/UTSA Libraries work-
shop rounded out the requirements (UTSA Libraries, 2017).

    Grants were announced on February 1st (with an application dead-

line of March 13th) and were promoted on websites, social media,
emails, and newsletters owned and managed by UTSA Libraries and
the Faculty Center. Librarians scheduled a workshop with Nicole
Finkbeiner and Kedrienne Day of OpenStax for February 29th in the
Faculty Center: Leaping into Open Educational Resources: The Virtues of
Free Textbooks (UTSA Libraries, 2016c). In addition to the OpenStax
reps, faculty that had successfully integrated OER into courses were in-
vited to speak on a panel and were also encouraged to apply for the
grants. One faculty panelist invited a student from a past class where
an open textbook was used so that attendees could hear his perspective.
Approximately 20 faculty attended.

    For the 2016 funding cycle, we received 11 applications and ranked
them on application quality, number of students impacted, textbook cost,
and drop/fail/withdraw rate for the course. During the 2017 application
round, we received three times the number of applications received in
2016, so the ranking and selection process became more complex. We de-
veloped a scoring system based on textbook cost, enrollment, drop/fail/
withdraw rate for the course, and whether the applicant's course would
increase OER adoption; this became a significant factor because a good
number of the 2017 applications were OER continuations. Our campus
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  219

bookstore textbook adoption date for the fall is mid-April, so we notified
all applicants by April 1st.

    For the 2016-17 funding cycle, we retained the same grant structure
but made some adjustments. In order to make the highest impact, we of-
fered, in addition to individual grants, departmental grants, defined as
collaboration by two or more instructors to adopt OER in all sections of
a course. We asked applicants to provide the new price for their current
textbook and to explain how they would advocate for OER adoption
to their peers. In order to coordinate an earlier meeting between the
grant recipient and their librarian and to also establish firmer spending
guidelines, librarians and UTSA Libraries' Dean's Office staff drafted a
document that recipients were to sign and return within 30 days of award
notification; see Appendix 5. In addition to defining expectations, librar-
ians also provided boilerplate language for integration into the course
syllabus. The purpose of the language was to promote awareness among
enrolled students of the use of OER for the coming semester and to spur
a conversation between the professor and the students about OER. The
language provides clarification on what might be an otherwise unfamiliar
concept for students and also helps provide context for the end-of-semes-
ter OER survey.

Program Launch and Barriers to Adoption
UTSA librarians began exploring OER at the end of fall 2015. With in-
creased change in our university and library environment in recent years,
we created a process to streamline any projects that have a university-wide
impact or that would involve multiple stakeholders, internal or external.
The initial stage of any new project, including OER, starts with drafting
of a project plan that outlines the project scope, goals, stakeholders, and
identifies an implementation timeline.

    We also had initial conversations with OpenStax, with whom we
started an official partnership. As an OpenStax partner, we participated
in monthly calls with other schools in the same cohort, sharing tactics for
growing OER adoption at our respective institutions. Monthly partner
discussions centered on the crafting of institutional strategic plans, adop-
tion tracking, and sharing strategies for overcoming adoption roadblocks.
OpenStax membership has also helped us stay abreast of new develop-
220  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ments in the OER landscape through a partner distribution list, and direct
connection with one of the leading OER developers in the United States.
As we now enter the intermediary stages of adoption and begin formu-
lating a blueprint for a statewide OER initiative, OpenStax continues to
provide structure, support, and grounding, helping to ease the inevitable
uncertainty that arises when exploring uncharted territory.

    After just a few meetings with OpenStax and project stakeholders, we
were excited about the potential for OER at UTSA. We realized we had a
lot of work to do in order to achieve the goals laid out in our project plan.
During these initial explorations, we uncovered roadblocks and barriers,
some expected and some unexpected, to faculty OER adoption. These
discoveries shed light on issues faculty face when selecting and adapting
teaching resources, and have given us increased insight into our teaching
faculty and the struggles they face. Some barriers were unearthed through
our own explorations of OER repositories while others surfaced in one-
on-one and group conversations with faculty.

    The first and most obvious barrier to OER adoption is awareness
and discovery by faculty. A 2016 Babson Research Group Survey found
that while faculty awareness of OER has increased 20 percent from 2015,
adoption and use among faculty is still low with only 6.6 percent of faculty
reporting they are "Very aware" and 19 percent of faculty report being
"Aware" of OER (Allen & Seaman, 2016). Additionally, 49 percent of fac-
ulty report "there are not enough resources for my subject"; 48 percent
report it is "too hard to find what I need"; 45 percent report "there is no
comprehensive catalog of resources" (Allen & Seaman, 2016). While we
have yet to roll out a university-wide faculty survey on OER awareness,
discussions with faculty reveal that their knowledge of OpenStax has in-
creased since the initial stages of our program, while awareness of other
OER providers remains low.

    While numerous OER repositories exist, there is not a comprehen-
sive single search for OER, so UTSA librarians mine repositories sepa-
rately in order to successfully match OER to courses. Merlot II (Multime-
dia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching), a California
State University initiative, is UTSA Librarians first go-to for OER dis-
covery since it compiles OER from many repositories and features an
ISBN search that retrieves more accurate matches. UTSA librarians will
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  221

often point faculty to this, but the tool is not perfect, and it can still take
time to sort through results to find viable options. To help overcome
this barrier, UTSA librarians created two OER guides for the disciplines
and programs at UTSA, organized by format: textbooks, courses/ancillary
materials, videos, and a search for ebooks at the UTSA Libraries (UTSA
Libraries, 2016a, 2016b). When we receive a request for materials from a
faculty member, we check our guides first to see if that course has already
been matched. If not, we do a deep dive into repositories and develop a
custom list of potential OER, including ebooks in our collection when no
viable OER exist.

    Lack of ancillary materials has been identified by UTSA faculty and
librarians as another barrier to OER adoption and growth. While thou-
sands of OER are available and searchable through the various reposito-
ries, there is a much lower number of open textbooks neatly outfitted with
ancillary materials that integrate seamlessly with learning management
systems. Meanwhile, traditional textbook publishers have this market cor-
nered and offer an appealing package for our overburdened faculty. To
overcome this, UTSA Libraries has initiated conversations with UTSA's
bookstore managers. UTSA's bookstore is Follett-owned and features Lu-
men Courses in its IncludeEd faculty textbook discoverability tool, many
of which pair well with OpenStax textbooks. We are also heartened by
the recent release of OpenStax Tutor Beta and the gaps it will fill in the
OER ancillary landscape and are sharing these tools with faculty that have
adopted OpenStax texts.

    In spring 2016, UTSA librarians began meeting with faculty, both
in departmental meetings and one-on-one, to advocate for OER adop-
tion. During these meetings, we learned that faculty perceptions of OER
vary, and these perceptions influence other faculty's willingness to adopt.
Some of the hesitancy may be attributed to the availability of quality
OER for the discipline. In some cases, faculty that have authored or
edited textbooks and have received royalties can be opposed to OER
for personal reasons. To overcome these barriers, UTSA librarians have
continued one-on-one conversations with interested faculty and have
hosted annual workshops that highlight the virtues of free textbooks.
Though initial conversations with academic departments revealed hesi-
tations about OER adoption, attitudes have shifted since our program's
222  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

inception. We even had one department chair that was initially resistant
submit an application to our grant program; he now plans to continue
using OER in his course indefinitely. These conversations with faculty
have also reminded librarians that the decision to choose a certain text-
book over another is not always made by the individual faculty member
teaching the course, but instead by textbook committees. While some de-
partments allow instructors greater academic freedom in select learning
materials, others employ a committee structure. We quickly realized that
a hybrid communication strategy for our grant program would be essen-
tial in order to reach all levels of faculty at UTSA.

    Ultimately, the largest factor influencing OER adoption is part of a
much bigger conversation: how do faculty use their textbooks; how much
of the test material comes from the textbook; and how do faculty commu-
nicate with their students about their expectations and recommendations
for using course learning materials? Faculty that have been using a text-
book for a number of years that rely heavily on textbook publisher ancil-
lary materials will require more persuasion in order to transition to OER.
Likewise, faculty that test primarily from lecture notes may be more easily
convinced to transition due to decreased or no reliance on textbook pub-
lishers' out-of-the-box tools.

    Strategies for overcoming these barriers and more are all tackled in
a Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition ( SPARC, a di-
vision of the Association of College and Research Libraries dedicated to
advancing the open agenda) adaptation of an OER Mythbusting docu-
ment currently in the works. UTSA Librarians are using this document in
conversations with OER-resistant faculty and plan to incorporate it into
the faculty adoption toolkit on our website.

Communication Strategies and Advocacy
OER advocacy requires consistent and comprehensive effort. Our work
has been impactful and far-reaching due to multiple factors: the devel-
opment of an OER communication strategy and timeline, leveraging our
campus partnerships to get the word out, and our research and education
librarians' direct outreach to faculty. At UTSA, both tenure and non-
tenure faculty teach high-enrollment courses that we are targeting for
OER course transformation. Considering this, we worked with our com-
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  223

munications director to develop tailored messages for targeted venues in
order to achieve the widest reach.

    After the beginning of semester rush in fall 2016, we contacted
the Office of the Registrar to get a list of the 100 courses with the
highest enrollment in order to begin the OER matching process. These
matches would be incorporated into custom emails to all course in-
structors and paired with the spring grant application deadline and
OER workshop registration. Librarians worked intensely to match
open textbooks, ancillary materials, and media to high-enrollment
courses in November and December 2016, one of our quietest times
of the year. The goal of the matching served many purposes: to allevi-
ate OER discovery work for faculty, to demonstrate that matches exist
for courses, and to pique adoption interest. Since lack of awareness is a
major hurdle to adoption, providing matches seemed like an easy way
to get faculty over the initial hump, and it worked. We received appli-
cations from several faculty that were direct emailed, and even if they
weren't completely happy with the provided matches, they wanted to
know about other options.

    UTSA Libraries set the application deadline for the 2017 funding
cycle to March 20th, so all communication centered on this. Having pro-
duced a great deal of administrative and promotional materials during the
2016 cycle that didn't cleanly fit into either of our OER LibGuides, coupled
with the realization that a space for recognizing our diligent OER adopters
would be needed, we began developing an OER website. Librarians met
with our communications director and our web designer, presented a
draft of text for the OER website, and finalized the page design. On the
cusp of a major website redesign, we opted for a practical and basic layout
that we could refine over time. UTSA Libraries launched its OER website
early spring 2017; the website highlights our faculty OER adopters, pro-
vides background on student success initiatives at UTSA with a segue into
OER adoption, and serves a starting point for faculty interested in transi-
tioning courses to OER (UTSA Libraries, 2017).

    Once the website launched, we used it as the basis for our commu-
nications with faculty. Though we did not survey faculty applicants in
order to determine which strategy was the most effective, this is some-
thing we may do in the future. See Appendix 1 for our Adopt a Free
224  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Textbook communication timeline in its entirety and succeeding appen-
dices for sample communication pieces.

Campus Partners
Developing lasting partner relationships is critical to the success of any
OER program. Partner collaborations make OER an institutional effort,
increasing support for all aspects of OER discovery, adoption, and adapta-
tion for the classroom.

    One of the most obvious and important partners in an OER initiative
is the campus bookstore. The bookstore provides faculty with the discov-
ery source for textbooks, as well as serving as the de facto place students
go for their class materials.

    In order to ensure OER textbooks are presented alongside traditional
textbooks for course selection, we worked with our Follett campus book-
store to include all major OER providers in their online textbook selection
tool. The library has been granted access to this tool, so that we can see
what our faculty see, which allows us to better promote OER through
familiar channels. To facilitate communication between faculty, the book-
store, and students, we are sharing OER courses with the bookstore;
enrolled students may also opt for a print copy of these OER texts.

    In addition to facilitating discoverability for faculty when selecting
textbooks, it is also important to increase visibility of OER courses for stu-
dents who are registering. Because of this, the registrar's office is another
campus partner that can help promote OER on campus. UTSA uses Ban-
ner as the student information system, and students use the ASAP web
interface for registration. We have been working with the registrar to
include a new filter by which students can search for classes using OER
(free) textbooks. This effort is still in process, but we hope to have it fully
functional by fall of 2018.

    Partnerships with the Faculty Center and Teaching and Learning
Services are critical because they provide additional outlets for the UTSA
Libraries to communicate with faculty and cultivate lasting relationships.
The Faculty Center is a collaboration between UTSA's Office of Re-
search, Office of the Vice Provost for Academic and Faculty Support,
and the UTSA Libraries that exists as both a physical and virtual space
to support faculty needs (The Faculty Center, n.d.). Librarians and fac-
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  225

ulty often meet in this physical space to collaborate on projects, including
OER. Teaching and Learning Services, which reports directly to the Vice
Provost for Faculty Academic Support, is a division charged with sup-
porting faculty teaching. Teaching and Learning Services has been an
active partner in our OER effort by inviting librarians to speak at the
end-of-semester Provost's Academy for Teaching Excellence, which is
marketed to those same non-tenured faculty that teach high-enrollment
courses that the library is also targeting. Partnerships between the library
and both the Faculty Center and Teaching and Learning Services are
critical foundations upon which we are basing current and future OER
strategies and communication.

Outside Partnerships and Opportunities
While most partnerships associated with our initiative have been formed
within the campus community, some significant external partnerships
have also emerged. Most important is the partnership we began with
OpenStax in 2016, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development
and promotion of OER textbooks. The OpenStax partnership has con-
nected us with other institutions pursuing OER adoption and growth and
provided not only a sounding board for barriers but also given us venues
for sharing creative ideas, strategies, and models for implementation and
expansion. Starting in 2015, we began participating in monthly calls with
OpenStax partners, creating adoption goals for our individual institutions,
and we were also added to the OpenStax email distribution list.

    While OpenStax and OpenStax partner schools have been our pri-
mary external supports, we have also sought out and joined other OER
communities. While not formal partnerships like our partnership with
OpenStax, they have been critical in keeping us abreast of OER updates,
including new open textbooks, legislative updates, information about new
ancillary initiatives, and matching OER to specific courses here at UTSA.
We are currently in conversations with the Open Textbook Network re-
garding membership and hope to take advantage of their many textbook
development communities, OER tracking, staff training, and faculty
workshops. Other external opportunities we have pursued are open ed-
ucation conferences including the SPARC Meeting on Openness in Re-
search and Education, the National Association of College Stores' Text-
226  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

book Affordability Conference, and an array of other regional and Texas
conferences. The Association of College and Research Libraries' SPARC
and Scholarly Communication discussion lists (ScholCOMM) have also
been helpful for growing and sharing our expertise in this area.

Students
During our fall 2016 pilot, we were able to impact over 568 students with
our OER program. From our survey of these students, certain themes
emerged after the initial analysis that helped us better understand student
perspectives and have also revealed their perceptions of OER. Of the 568
respondents to our end-of-semester survey, over 40 percent relied on Pell
grants and student loans for tuition and textbook costs. Data from the Col-
lege Board reveals that "83% of Pell grant recipients had family incomes
of $40,000 or less, including 42% with incomes of $15,000 or less" (2016,
p. 28). For UTSA students, many of whom receive Pell grants, every dollar
is critical. Over 40 percent of the students we surveyed are spending
$400-600 per semester on textbooks, and 25 percent said they don't pur-
chase textbooks simply because they cannot afford them. Perhaps the
strongest argument for increased OER adoption at UTSA is that over
88 percent of those surveyed rated the open textbooks used in their courses
as good or better than a traditional text in helping them prepare for tests,
content quality, ease of use and accessibility, and practice opportunities.

    In addition to data gathered through our survey for the fall 2016 pilot,
we had individual conversations with students about the use of OER in
their courses and invited them to speak as part of faculty panels during
"Adopt a Free Textbook" workshops. The most compelling was a stu-
dent veteran's account of his experience receiving funding for tuition and
books through the G.I. Bill. He contrasted his use of an open textbook
that same semester in one class with his experience in another class using
a traditional textbook; since the release of funds came too late, he was
forced to drop the course with a traditional textbook, but was able to suc-
cessfully complete the course that used an open textbook. His account of
accessibility through mobile devices and helpfulness in preparing for tests
is compelling (UTSA Libraries, 2016c).

    In addition to the student survey data and the individual student testi-
monies in our faculty workshops, we started the process of meeting with
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  227

our Student Government Association (SGA) this past spring. The Acade-
mic Affairs Committee is a subgroup of UTSA's SGA, and we learned that
many of the candidates running for SGA president had free textbooks on
their platforms. Our primary focus until this point was reaching out to
faculty, who could be resistant, so our conversations with students were
enlightening and reinvigorating. We also shared data from Student PIRGs
to provide a step-by-step guide for advocacy (Student Public Interest Re-
search Groups, 2016). Since we are at an early stage of OER growth at
UTSA, we hope to partner with our UTSA Libraries Student Engagement
Committee and UTSA Student Government to plan and host a Textbook
Broke event for fall 2017 or spring 2018 (Student Government Resource
Center, 2014).

Measuring OER Success
Much of the research on OER has focused on how to best assess the im-
pact of using OER in the classroom. One of the frameworks that we have
found useful is the Cost, Outcomes, Usage, Perceptions (COUP) approach,
developed by the Open Education Group, which evaluates OER impact
using four factors (Open Ed Group, n.d.).

    Given the economic challenges our students face, the most immediate
benefit of using OER is the cost savings. As an institutional partner with
Rice's OpenStax College, we have been tracking metrics related to cost
savings to students. In our pilot grant program, we were able to save stu-
dents $94,000. As we continue to mature our grant program, and increase
the number and type of grants given, we expect that number to increase
significantly. One of the most compelling metrics related to cost is de-
termining ROI (return on investment) for the grant program, comparing
investment (grants awarded) to the cost savings for students. In our pilot
program, we determined an ROI of 1,153 percent.

    Assessing outcomes is a much more complex process. Many re-
searchers have evaluated outcomes by looking at grades and retention in
the course using OER versus the same course taught with a traditional
textbook. The OER Research Hub, in their 2013-14 report found that
only 27 percent of instructors surveyed found that OER improved perfor-
mance in classes using OER textbooks (OER Research Hub, 2014). Hilton,
Fischer, Wiley, and Williams (2016) looked at outcomes using a new mea-
228  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

sure they called course throughput rates--an aggregation of drop rates,
withdrawal rates, and C or better rates. They found when looking at mul-
tiple variables together such as drop, withdrawal, and pass rates, OER
has been found to significantly affect outcomes (Hilton, Fischer, Wiley, &
Williams, 2016).

    Another way to evaluate the success of OER materials is faculty usage.
Usage is defined as the level to which faculty engage with the open con-
tent, by embellishing, deleting, inserting, and rearranging content within
the open resource (Open Ed Group, n.d.). By itself, this engagement is not
necessarily significant, however it was found to be a leading indicator of
a few positive outcomes for students. Faculty who are more engaged with
the course material are more like to be engaged in their teaching practice.
The OER Research Hub reported in a survey that 92.2 percent of instruc-
tors strongly agreed or agreed that using OER "broadened their range of
teaching and learning methods" (OER Research Hub, 2014). Instructors
who used OER materials reported an increased level of collaboration with
their colleagues.

    Faculty and student perception of OER materials is an additional way
to look at OER success. Numerous studies have been conducted to assess
faculty and student perception of OER. A few studies with students have
focused on asking them to compare OER textbooks to traditional text-
books. Feldstein et al., in their survey of 991 students at Virginia State
University School of Business, found a positive response to OER used in
nine core courses (Feldstein et al., 2012). Almost 95 percent of students
surveyed agreed that their open textbook was "easy to use" and 78 percent
of students liked "how the textbook linked to other resources." We also
conducted a survey of 568 students who participated in four courses in our
pilot OER grant program. We found 75 percent of our student respon-
dents felt that "accessibility" was better than traditional textbooks, as well
as 63 percent of students who thought that "ease of use" was better. In a
survey which included eight community colleges, Bliss, Robinson, Hilton,
and Wiley found that instructor perceptions of OER were mostly positive,
with any negative feedback focusing on issues of quality (Bliss, Robinson,
Hilton, & Wiley, 2013). In our work with faculty at UTSA, perceived poor
quality was one of the major deterrents to considering adopting an OER.
It is important to assess student and faculty perception of OER (both be-
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  229

fore and after using an open text) in order to understand impediments to
adoption and use.

    Currently, we are only using the cost factor to evaluate the success
of OER, as it is the easiest attribute to assess. We do have future plans
analyze the relationship between outcomes, such as grades and/or persis-
tence, to the kind of textbook used (open, no-cost, low-cost, traditional).
The factor of faculty usage is more difficult to gauge. Many of our faculty
may not necessarily rearrange/change/embellish within an open text-
book, but they may use the open textbook as part of a greater body of
materials used for a class. These other materials may be open or low-cost.
This mix and match approach still shows engagement with the materials,
but not in the way defined by the COUP model. We are currently tracking
faculty and staff perception of OER materials used in courses, but we have
not yet begun analyzing the data. This is part of our future plan to assess
our OER program.

Future Directions
We see a very positive future for OER at UTSA. The 2017 academic year
wraps up our second round of grants incentivizing OER adoption, with
24 grants given--five times the number of grants awarded during our pi-
lot year. Once fully implemented, we will see $1,063,594 in student money
saved in one semester alone, with a total of $4,348,376 in student savings
over four semesters. We estimated this savings using OpenStax's method-
ology--the retail cost of the textbook, multiplied by the average number
of students in each course, multiplied by the number of semesters.

    We plan to increase our assessment activities for the grants this aca-
demic year, applying the full COUP model to more broadly determine the
impact on our students and faculty. Given the larger grant program this
last year, we will have a greater sample of students and faculty to study,
likely to yield more meaningful results (Open Ed Group, n.d.).

    Finally, over the last few months, OER has advanced at the state level.
On June 6, 2017 the Governor of Texas signed a law that will establish a
statewide OER grant program to be overseen by the Coordinating Board,
in addition to the creation of a Texas repository for open materials. We
hope this is just the beginning for coordinated, statewide progress for
OER in Texas.

Subject: Faculty Grants Available Fall 2017
As part of UTSA's efforts to increase student success, retention and completion, the

      UTSA Libraries has partnered with the Teaching and Learning Center to offer
      individual and departmental grants to faculty who pilot a free textbook in a
      course this fall.
The grant application deadline is March 20, 2017. There are two types available:

 · Individual: $1,000 for a faculty member to use a free textbook in one of their
     courses.

 · Departmental: $1,500-$7,000 (calculated based on number of students impacted)
     for faculty to adopt a free textbook in a course across the entire department.
Advancing Access for First-Generation College Students  233

Why are we offering these grants? All too often, the high cost of textbooks is a reason
      students delay or discontinue their educational path. By using free, high quality
      textbooks, UTSA can make great strides in higher education affordability for our
      students.

I hope you will visit our Open Educational Resources website to learn more. You'll
      find a video showing what UTSA students have to say about textbooks, and a
      plethora of research on the benefits of using free textbooks on our guide to free
      textbooks that most closely align with high enrollment courses in your discipline.

We hope you'll encourage faculty in your department to apply for the grant! Please don't
      hesitate to contact me or your departmental librarian with any questions you may
      have.

Introduction
This chapter will discuss how students can actively collaborate with li-
braries and other campus entities to provide their much-needed perspec-
tive, as well as present a case study of how Oklahoma State University
(OSU), a public land-grant university, is using student participation to
increase campus awareness and provide additional support for the devel-
opment and implementation of open educational resources (OER). OSU is
a research university with high research activity. The total student popu-
lation at OSU's primary campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma is approximately
24,000, with an undergraduate population of approximately 20,000. Ed-
mon Low Library is the primary library on campus and is used by under-
graduates, graduates, and faculty. Our initial efforts began due to informal
interest on the part of a few librarians and has since started to take ad-
ditional shape and direction as we continue to explore more formalized
approaches to integrating OER and discussions about open access in gen-
eral into campus culture and infrastructure.

Finding the Student Voice
There is a surprising lack of information about how university campuses
are including students in the OER conversation, at least on a formal level.
A scan of the journal literature indicates that student input is either not
included or is not a major factor in decisions surrounding the adoption
and use of OER. In order to understand why and how students might be
involved in OER efforts, it is important to consider the broader social and
pedagogical context in which these efforts might occur. Joyce (2006) states
"The prevailing culture in higher education places the responsibility for
240  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

innovation in the hands of academics, rather than students who may have
stronger incentives to experiment with and advance teaching and learning
methods" (p. 9).

    When an institution decides to adopt an innovation, the institution
as a whole and individuals within the institution progress through a
complex process. This innovation-decision process includes five stages,
(1) knowledge, (2) persuasion, (3) decision, (4) implementation, and (5)
confirmation. Those involved in this process make up a social system.
Rogers (2003) defines a social system as "a set of interrelated units en-
gaged in joint problem-solving to accomplish a common goal" (p. 23).
Students in higher education institutions are included in the social sys-
tem and should be a considered as part of this process as faculty begins
to adopt and use open textbooks. Faculty, students, and all involved in
the implementation process collaborate to identify needs and work to-
gether to solve problems that arise from the initial identification of the
challenges that need to be addressed. According to Rogers, when indi-
viduals within a social system can work together, the rate of adoption
of an innovation should increase. Ed Hegarty asserts that OER provide
a unique opportunity for students to take an active role in their own
learning processes in a way that traditional textbooks and pedagogical
approaches do not, as he defines an arc-of-life model as "a seamless
process that occurs throughout life when participants engage in open and
collaborative networks, communities, and openly shared repositories of
information in a structured way to create their own culture of learning"
(2015, p. 3). He goes on to discuss eight attributes necessary to achieve
this type of learning: participatory technologies, people/openness/trust,
innovation and creativity, sharing ideas and resources, connected com-
munity, learner generated, reflective practice, and peer review (2015,
p. 5). By their very nature, OER allow for the type of activities that
Hegarty outlines and provide an opportunity for collaboration by helping
to shape learner motivation so that the word "open" takes on a much
broader meaning than simply available to all: one that invites engage-
ment, reworking, and experimentation from both a learner as well as
an instructor perspective. By being able to change the course materials
themselves, students are responsible for both the learning experience as
well as its application not only throughout the course itself but also in
Student-Driven OER  241

other academic and even professional contexts as students become used
to this repurposing of information as a way to help them define and
achieve their goals. For example, through open pedagogy, students can
modify or create information for wikis, remix audiovisual content, write
or revise open textbooks, create and openly license supplemental content
to share with their peers, assist in developing test banks, or even create
their own course assignments (Hilton & Mason, 2016).

    Flavin (2012) offers an interesting perspective on the use of technol-
ogy and control over the learning process, which can be extrapolated to
include the use of OER within the classroom setting. He asserts that "when
digital technologies are brought into the classroom setting, the lecturer
may have to relinquish some of their authority" (p. 104). While this may
seem to disrupt the balance of knowledge, arguably this furthers the no-
tion that students can take control of their learning process by interacting
with this open content in a way that makes sense for them, as opposed
to being forced to utilize a printed source that may or may not support
their educational habits and goals simply because it was simple for the
faculty member to adopt. This point is also supported by Shaffer (2014)
who mentions that open platforms where students and instructors can
pedagogically interact "facilitate student access to existing knowledge, and
empower them to critique it, dismantle it, and create new knowledge,"
which highlights a two-way experience where both students and instruc-
tors can learn from one another.

    Finally, in a recent posting on the Open Oregon Educational Re-
sources blog, Lin Hanick and Amy Hofer (2017) discuss how open peda-
gogy can also influence how librarians teach information literacy. While
the discussion of the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy is beyond the scope of this
chapter, it does mention concepts and ideas that are related to OER.
Specifically, it states that "open education is simultaneously content and
practice" (p. 1) and that by integrating these practices into the classroom,
students are learning about issues such as intellectual property, the value
of information, and the other costs associated with these "free" resources
that they may not be aware of, by acting "like practitioners" (p. 5) where
they take on "a disciplinary perspective and engage with a community of
practice" (p. 5). These methods have deeply influenced our efforts at OSU,
242  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

where the Library has taken an active role in soliciting student input as
part of all of its services and programs, and OER is no exception. We view
the student perspective as central to our efforts and hope to integrate the
feedback we receive so that it will inform our outreach efforts as we con-
tinue to work with faculty in raising awareness of OER on campus and
build on or existing initiatives.

Institutional Context
Our initial efforts began when we received a donation to begin an Open
Educational Textbook pilot (http://info.library.okstate.edu/wiseinitia-
tive). The Wise OSU Libraries' Open Textbook Initiative was made pos-
sible through generous initial funding from Dr. James Wise, an OSU
alumnus who is a member of the Friends of the Library Board. Dr. Wise
has supported a wide variety of library projects over the years, most of
them focusing on innovation and technology. The goal of the Wise OSU
Libraries' Open Textbook Initiative is to encourage faculty by providing a
stipend for OER adoption or creation to consider open textbooks as less
costly alternatives for their students. The types of materials that could
qualify for the open textbook project can include material from differ-
ent media--articles, audio, video, websites--or the use of an existing open
access textbook. While some entities that are developing or funding the
development of OER focus on high- enrollment courses, OSU encourages
faculty in all areas and at all levels to consider using an open textbook.
The project is open to either individual faculty members or a group of fac-
ulty members teaching multiple sections of the same course (in the case of
partnered projects, the monetary award goes to a single representative of
the group). A major goal of the open textbook project is to demonstrate
how savings may be achieved for students while maintaining or improv-
ing the quality of their learning process.

    To assist with some of this work, we have developed our own pub-
lication platform, dubbed the OSU Libraries ePress (site is in progress),
which has allowed us to begin developing workflows for how these
manuscripts are copy edited and transformed into their respective epub
and PDF formats. In addition, we are offering a more interactive Word-
Press option for those faculty who are interested in being able to make
ongoing changes to their materials and take advantage of the platform's
Student-Driven OER  243

features. To date, seven faculty members have applied, and each project
is in various stages of development.

1. LSB 3010/5010: Patent Law and Managing Investments in Technol-
    ogy

2. ENGL 1123: International Composition
3. EDTC 5030: Learning in a Digital World
4. EDTC 5203: Foundations of Educational Technology
5. SOIL 4683: Soil, Water, and Weather
6. POLS 3103: Introduction to Political Inquiry
7. PHIL 1313: Logic and Critical Thinking

Open Pedagogy Project
One of the first courses to develop an OER was EDTC 5030: Learning
in a Digital World. In order to accomplish this task, the faculty member
reached out to graduate students asking if they would be willing to con-
tribute to its creation; 15 students agreed to help. The student writers
began this collaborative effort by selecting a project manager and brain-
storming ideas for topics which turned into chapters. The faculty member
took the topics to the department faculty to ensure the open textbook
would align with the objectives of the program. The focus of the open
textbook is learning in a digital world and includes sections such as His-
tory and Theory, Digital Literacy, Digital Divide, Pre-K to 12, Adult
Learning, Digital Learning Groups, Learning in Emerging Spaces, and
Tools and Strategies. Once the topics were agreed upon, the student writ-
ers determined which chapters they each would write. After the chapters
are written, the student writers and the faculty member will participate in
a peer review and editing process. The faculty member's role is the same
as the students', in that he will be writing and be part of the peer review
process. The practice of open pedagogy will continue after the open text-
book is used each semester. The students in future sections of EDTC 5053
will have an opportunity to modify or add to the resources through an
iterative process with continual input from the students. Students who
participate in this Wise initiative by helping write the text for the new
open textbooks do not receive monetary compensation, but they do par-
ticipate in the creation process to gain experience and lend their authors'
voices to the creation of the very tool that will enhance their learning.
244  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Collaborating with students is an important component to the OER
initiative. In addition to including students in the creation of OER
through open pedagogy, the Library collaborated with an OSU graduate
student who was an OER Fellow in the Department of Educational
Technology within the College of Education. We were able to hire this
student as a graduate research assistant for a semester to assist us with
key projects as part of our OER program. The research fellowship was
sponsored by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and admin-
istered by the Open Education Group. The fellowships are meant to
encourage research on the cost, outcomes, use, and perceptions of OER.
The partnership between OSU and the student led to several exciting
initiatives. One activity the student assisted with is co-teaching of work-
shops. The workshops included educating interested faculty on OER,
information on the Wise initiative, and how to get started with finding
or writing an open textbook. Through research and the trial of potential
platforms and templates, the student provided input on how to progress
to the development stage when faculty needed to go beyond the writing
or curation of content.

    Partnering with other departments and organizations on campus has
proven invaluable for developing stronger collaborations and extending
the reach of our programs. The Library is in the process of working
with the Student Government Association (SGA) to develop joint pro-
gramming for Open Access Week in fall of 2017. As part of this project,
we hope to build on our previous efforts which, though impactful, were
one-sided and did not engage students beyond a quick interaction. We
hope to co-develop an interactive exhibit during Open Access Week
that will serve a dual purpose of informing other students about these
resources, as well as give us additional data that we can utilize with cam-
pus administration and faculty. This will help drive a more strategic and
programmatic approach via our Textbook Affordability Committee and
possibly add OER to the campus textbook adoption guidelines that are
sent out each year from the Provost's Office. Although we have not yet
discussed the details of what the initiative might encompass, we are con-
fident that with the inroads we have made with the SGA thus far, we will
be able to continue collaborating and establishing some concrete action
items for fall of this year.
Student-Driven OER  245

    Another partnership which developed and which continues to grow
is between the Library and the bookstore as a result of the creation of a
textbook affordability program. This partnership is taking a holistic look
at options for students, and we are seeing OER being included as part of
that suite of materials. Moreover, the Library was recently invited to serve
on the Textbook Affordability Committee, and we are optimistic that our
inclusion will allow us to take a broad look at how these efforts can be
scaled and adapted at a university-wide level. As a small start, the Library
collaborated with an economics course in fall of 2016 to survey students
about their textbook needs and discovered that over 75 percent would use
an OER, and 46 percent would purchase a print copy of an OER textbook
and would be willing to pay about $20 for it. This percent is similar to a
previous study cited in Hilton and Wiley (2011) that shows 40 percent of
students continued to purchase print versions of their required textbooks
even when free online copies were available to them. The option of pur-
chasing a print copy is helpful for the students who prefer this format over
the digital version alone.

    This preliminary research has allowed the Library to work with the
bookstore to offer an on-demand printing model via our FedEx office on
campus, which gives students the opportunity to print only the sections
of an open textbook that they need for a nominal fee of approximately $8
and also allows them to pay for added customization, such as color images
and different binding options, depending on their preferences. Anecdotal
evidence from the bookstore indicates that students are unwilling to pay
$35 for an OpenStax textbook (which had been sitting on their shelves for
this course with virtually no demand) simply because they did not need all
of it and we hope that this model will encourage students to print what
they need. We plan to continue marketing this program campus-wide as
we get a better sense of how we can continue campus-wide conversations
around these topics.

    Finally, the Library regularly surveys students about their textbook
costs as part of their Open Access Week programming. During Open
Textbook Week 2014 and 2015, we set up whiteboards in the south lobby
to solicit student feedback/input on the cost of their textbooks with an
accompanying table display on open textbooks. Students would stop by,
and if they did not ask questions, they often made a hash mark or com-
246  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ment on the whiteboards. There was one constant question: How Much
Did Your Textbooks Cost This Year? The second board featured a question
that changed every other day:

· What Is Your Most Expensive Textbook?
· For What Class Did You Not Purchase the Textbook, and Why?

The images below detail the presentation as well as the responses from
students that we compiled during each of these sessions. This information
has allowed us to gather some informal evidence for our campus which
has supported national trends and which continues to lend the student
perspective to these issues especially as we determine ways we can con-
tinue working with campus administration to make our efforts more
visible and impactful.

Student-Driven OER  247

Future Plans for the Program at OSU

While we have covered some ground through these initial efforts, we recog-
nize that there is much that still needs to be done. We would like to scale up
the pilot into a full-blown program, where we receive proposals on an on-
going basis that are reviewed by a formal board comprised of campus faculty
and students. This would allow us to develop a more cohesive workflow for
the entire process from the initial idea all the way to the published product
and its integration within the curriculum. This model will require signifi-
cant effort on our part to develop an outreach and marketing program, as
well as further develop the underlying infrastructure so that authors are fully
supported throughout the duration of the project and the implementation of
the resource. We would also like to include these OER into our institutional
repository as a way to make them even more discoverable, and also to high-
light these works as part of the university's scholarly output. In addition to
the board, we hope to partner with our Technical Writing Program where
students can act as copy editors and gain professional experience while help-
ing us in an area where the Library might not have sufficient expertise.
248  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Finally, we plan to develop a survey to gather baseline information
about students' perception of their learning and overall course experience
using these resources. This will most likely take the form of a brief online
survey where we hope to find out how many students accessed the books,
how many printed them versus downloaded them. We would also like to
find out specifically what they thought of the format of these texts, and
ask them for ways that we can improve their discoverability, accessibility,
and overall functionality. We hope this will allow us to pave the way for
a more robust assessment model once we have additional projects under
our belt. Ideally, we would like to conduct some comparative analysis us-
ing faculty anecdotal data where we can determine how the quality of the
learning was impacted by these resources.

Tips for Engaging Students at Your Institution
It is important to include student input into any OER initiative to max-
imize the chances of success. Although adding a student voice to library
efforts does not guarantee success, it helps lend an added element of sup-
port that might sway other stakeholders, such as university administration
and faculty, to listen where they might not have before. A formal needs
assessment might help pave the way for some of these discussions and se-
cure additional buy-in from students and student groups. There are many
different ways to go about this, and the University of Idaho Extension
program details the most commonly used methods in a concise and useful
fashion. The main elements of any needs assessment consist of the follow-
ing steps (McCawley, 2009):

· What is it that you want to learn from the needs assessment?
· Who is the target audience? Whose needs are you measuring, and to

    whom will you give the information?
· How will you collect data that will tell you what you need to know?

    Will you collect data directly from the target audience or indirectly?
· How will you select a sample of respondents who represent the target

    audience?
· What instruments and techniques will you use to collect data?
· How will you analyze the data you collect?
· What will you do with the information that you gather?
Student-Driven OER  249

An important point to consider about this type of assessment is to in-
clude information about student needs that go beyond content. For
example, based on OSU's modest survey, we were able to determine that
students just wanted to pay for the content they needed and were not
interested in an entire textbook, even if it was fully bound and in color.
They were more likely to choose a "stripped down" bound version in
black and white if it meant they would get the information they had to
have and nothing extraneous. Without asking students what they pre-
ferred, we might have made some erroneous assumptions about their
desire to have better looking, yet less useful, versions of their textbook,
when in fact that was not the case.

    Another important step is to reach out to student organizations such
as governing bodies, resident life, and Greek organizations. This approach
is a more effective and scalable than trying to target individuals, and it
can result in a broader reach. The good news is that this issue should be
a fairly simple one to address with these groups because OER benefit stu-
dents directly. The question then becomes one of execution. Establishing
a clear yet flexible plan will allow these organizations to determine how
they would like to move forward. In the case of OSU for example, we
are discussing both developing some shared programming as well as ap-
proaching faculty members directly about the use of OER in their high-
enrollment courses.

    Using some of the evidence you have gathered (such as the statistics
above, for example) will also help lend more weight to your arguments
and proposed planning, and if they are collected by students at your in-
stitution and shared through those same students, they will have a much
stronger impact than simply citing statistics that may or may not pro-
vide enough compelling evidence about how these costs are affecting local
populations. Also, student groups can assist with marketing and outreach
efforts and can go with you when you make visits to faculty or talk with
administrators. They can actively participate in any open access program-
ming that is held on campus, and it is up to you to ensure that for every
faculty panel or participant, students have an equally strong presence to
keep momentum going and serve as a reminder of the purpose of cham-
pioning OER. Crafting a uniform and consistent message will ensure that
everyone is working towards a unified goal.
250  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Finally, plan for success by establishing a committee or taskforce com-
prised of library, faculty, student, and other campus representatives, to
look at these issues at a strategic level. Ensuring that students are invited
to the table as part of this work will not only signal that their feedback is
valued, but can also help shape how these resources are developed, imple-
mented, and assessed as part of an overall program. Thinking about both
in-class as well as out-of-class elements should provide a holistic picture
of how these resources are integrated and utilized throughout the entire
student experience. The former may require collaborations with the cam-
pus institute for teaching and learning and the faculty council. This will
prevent pedagogical considerations that are implemented from being seen
as trying to usurp existing processes for how faculty modify their curricu-
lum, especially since open pedagogy practices can require what some may
see as a radical shift in teaching habits and approaches. This work could
necessitate additional training for faculty in working with students in a
more collaborative capacity than they might have previously done, and
might require additional practice with assessing and grading the types of
artifacts that would emerge.

    This might be met with significant resistance and necessitate having
involvement from a higher administrative capacity in order to pave the
way for pilots and other smaller-scale implementations before a broader
open access program is announced, but having a group that is focused on
these issues should help you anticipate and resolve these types of chal-
lenges as they arise. This more expansive approach can help shift the focus
away from objections related to publisher kickbacks and long-held pre-
conceptions about these resources, because they are furthering student
learning and success which is everyone's ultimate goal.

Conclusion
There is no magic formula when it comes to championing campus-wide
OER efforts, and as we have explored throughout this chapter, there are
several ways in which students can become active participants both in and
out of the classroom. One of the most important lessons to be taken away
from these conversations is that of providing opportunities for faculty and
students alike to engage in the types of pedagogical and programmatic ac-
tivities that allow for deeper collaboration and re-imagining of both the
Student-Driven OER  251

learning process as well as the content itself. This is not an easy thing

to accomplish, as there are decades of preconceived notions, habits, and

practices in existence on both sides, but the library can provide a platform

where new projects and initiatives have an opportunity to be explored and

become successful as we continue on the path to redefining the way in

which OER influence the world of higher education and beyond.

Strategies for Connecting with Students and

              Faculty to Promote OER Adoption

    [S]hifting the mainstream public discourse is the best--and in most cases
the only--way to achieve lasting change. Without this crucial ingredient, other
movement successes--recruiting and empowering members in an expanding so-
cial organization; raising public awareness; and even convincing power holders
to change policy in a desired direction--may prove ephemeral. By contrast, a
movement that effectively alters the terms of discourse can overcome considerable
opposition and structural disadvantages to achieve sustained, meaningful change
(Woodly, 2015, p. 1).

Although Woodly was writing about national social movements, this
argument may just as well apply to the promotion of open education
(OE). Even if librarians and our allies succeed in advocating for open
educational resources (OER) by recruiting participatory faculty, raising
awareness across our communities, and gaining support from university
administrators, our best chance at achieving sustainable and ever-deepen-
ing change requires a focus on discourse.

    This chapter presents the practical details of how my colleagues and I
increased OE awareness and incentivized OER adoption through a faculty
stipend program at a public land-grant state university over the course of
one year. Our communication strategies, timelines, and preliminary out-
comes are grounded in the underlying assumptions that (1) conversations
can promote lasting change and (2) grassroots-led action is preferable to
top-down mandates. Although these assumptions may not apply in every
context, my goal is to conceptualize our local progress in terms that may
contribute to collectively developed models of successful and sustainable
254  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

initiatives. Therefore, I emphasize discourse--that is, foreground "seman-
tic tools and social processes" (Woodly, 2015, p. 22)--in this narrative of
our successes and failures. This fits our story because I initially approached
this work from a rhetorically influenced viewpoint. But I also contend
that careful attention to discourse is vital for all library-led OE programs,
since so much of our work can be classified as advocacy or persuasion. For
this reason, frameworks drawn from political science and communication
studies serve as useful analytic tools.

    In the following sections, I will describe the situation of OE at Clem-
son University; offer a one-year timeline of our major activities; analyze
our communicative approach; and reflect upon lessons learned and future
directions.

Open Education at Clemson University
Clemson University is a public land-grant university in South Carolina
with approximately 23,000 graduate and undergraduate students. While
we know that, as on most campuses, there are faculty members engaging
independently with OER, at the start of 2016 there was no coordinated
effort to promote open education at the University. The Head of Digital
Scholarship at the Clemson Libraries and colleagues at Clemson Online
(the distance education department) had discussed and even budgeted for
OER initiatives in previous years, but a lack of dedicated staff combined
with major administrative changes in both units meant that the efforts re-
mained speculative.

    Despite these barriers, they laid the groundwork for more concerted
action. In November 2014, the Clemson Libraries and Clemson Online
co-sponsored an invited presentation by Dr. Cable Green, a prominent
figure in the Open community. In early 2016, thanks to the Libraries'
membership in SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Re-
sources Coalition), we sponsored a faculty member from the College
of Education to participate in OpenCon. On his return, he addressed
the campus community on "Making the Most of Open Educational Re-
sources." These activities began conversations on campus as our local
Open advocates sought dedicated institutional support. The effects of this
preliminary work to connect interested parties, which in Clemson's case
meant representatives from the Libraries, Clemson Online, and the Col-
From Conversation to Cultural Change  255

lege of Education, are still evident. These early allies remain our strongest,
indicating the simple power of repeated social contact.

    In July 2016, I accepted the newly created position of Undergraduate
Instruction and Open Educational Resources Librarian. The Libraries had
decided to try out an official and specific investment in open education
by allocating 40 percent of the position to OER work. Classified as a
temporary lecturer, I was tasked with working to transition classes from
traditional textbooks to open materials through outreach to students and
faculty. (The remainder of the position is dedicated to undergraduate in-
formation literacy instruction.) Since my position was fixed for a two-year
term expiring in July 2018, we knew that we had to move quickly to cap-
italize on previous action and attempt to prove the lasting value of open
education for the Clemson community.

    The first challenge was clear and personal: at the start of 2016, I could
barely define "OER." I had vague understandings of open access and copy-
right issues from nearly three years as a library specialist, but in order to
take the lead on OER initiatives, I had a lot to learn. Throughout August
and September, I attended webinars, read as much as I could, explored
OER repositories and content types, and leaned heavily on the expertise
of colleagues across campus and external partners such as SPARC. (Special
thanks to SPARC's Assistant Director of Open Education, Brady Yano, for
his invaluable support during these early days and beyond.)

    These first few months were also about planning, defining, and con-
necting. The Head of Digital Scholarship, my supervisor and closest col-
laborator on the OER side of my job, introduced me to our indispensable
partners at Clemson Online. As we discussed our programmatic aspira-
tions, and as my knowledge of the OER universe slowly expanded, I began
to understand my task as a communications challenge. The general charge
to "establish an OER program" felt vague and daunting. So, like all good
research librarians, we started by seeking models. Unsurprisingly, most
institutions emphasized "awareness" as a vital first step. This, however,
still felt vague and daunting. "Awareness" was a job for marketing or pub-
lic relations or brand managers, not for introverted librarians! Failure
loomed whenever I attempted to imagine myself as a salesperson with
OER as my product, or even as a protestor agitating for policy changes.
Doubtful of my role, I looked around for context clues--and realized that
256  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

I barely knew my own context. I had learned about open education ab-
stractly, but still needed to break down our specific rhetorical situation at
Clemson. This heuristic, a familiar one from my background in rhetoric
and composition, provided guiding questions:

· Who is the audience?
· What is the purpose, message, and exigence?
· What is the medium and channel of communication?

Since each answer informs the others, I started by identifying our audi-
ences. After all, we can hardly "raise awareness" without defining whose
awareness we wish to raise. There are multiple stakeholders in the OE
movement, but the most obvious audiences on a university campus are
students, faculty, and administrators. As previously mentioned, we were
already operating under the belief that top-down mandates would be
slow, unsustainable, and potentially threatening to academic freedom. In
their reflection on leading change at the University of Michigan-Flint,
Gano-Phillips and Barnett (2008) concluded that they were only able
to achieve "sweeping cultural change" (p. 41) by avoiding heavy-handed,
top-down approaches. Instead, they "depended upon collective action" and
"used existing faculty governance structures" (Phillips & Barnett, 2008,
p. 41). This echoes much of the common wisdom about institutional
reform. In accordance, we prioritized grassroots-led efforts over adminis-
trative action. Thus, two target audiences remained: students and faculty.

    Our purpose was also twofold. Raising awareness may be an obvious
first step, but its success is difficult to assess, and we had a two-year
timeframe in which to produce outcomes that could inspire more perma-
nent institutional support. We clearly needed measurable action, not just
awareness. Previous conversations between the Libraries and Clemson
Online had laid the groundwork for a faculty stipend program inspired by
initiatives at other institutions. Establishing this stipend became a primary
action item, with the goal of incentivizing faculty adoption, adaptation, or
creation of OER for courses offered in fall 2017.

    The exigence of OER initiatives, as explored in detail throughout this
volume, is difficult to refute. Higher education costs are generally unten-
able, and textbook prices in particular have skyrocketed; most students
lack required learning materials at some point due to these financial reali-
From Conversation to Cultural Change  257

ties and/or the belief that such materials are unnecessary; open resources,
practices, and pedagogy offer exciting and relatively easy solutions to
these problems. However, the details and definitions embedded within
this seemingly straightforward message mean that translating it for those
with inconsistent OER knowledge requires careful tailoring--particularly
when trying to keep it succinct enough to capture the limited time and at-
tention of faculty and students. Moreover, convincing an audience of your
argument's validity does not automatically lead them to act. I will further
detail our messaging challenges and strategies later in this chapter.

    Lastly, the communicative mediums and channels available on Clem-
son's campus have always posed difficulties. As in any large organization
or community, and especially any decentralized university, multiple voices
vie for the limited time and attention of their audiences. Therefore, gate-
keepers often attempt to mediate this chaos by controlling access to chan-
nels such as email listservs and campus-wide news publications. Once
again, the strength of an argument is inconsequential if it never reaches
its intended audience. Knowing that this was a likely roadblock, opening
channels quickly became a priority.

    The Libraries already offered several avenues toward faculty. Liaison
librarians communicated with their assigned academic departments, the
Head of Digital Scholarship served on the Faculty Senate, and our admin-
istrative office provided me with contact information for each college's
coordinator. More broadly, we could reach a self-selected population of
faculty and students through the Libraries' blog and social media. But we
still lacked a direct line to students, a larger and more diverse group than
faculty and one whose communicative habits remained opaque. I needed
insight and inroads.

    As the fall 2016 semester began in earnest, I reached out to the
Clemson Undergraduate Student Government (CUSG). I emailed the
president, introduced myself and my task, and asked if we could meet to
discuss student needs and possible collaborations. After our discussion,
he delegated the (potential and undefined) project to CUSG's Academic
Affairs Committee. The committee chair suggested that one member, a
senator in her junior year, take the lead in working with me. Luckily
for us, she was enthusiastic and committed, and Clemson's burgeon-
ing OER movement gained a powerful ally armed with suggestions and
258  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

networks for reaching other students. Her work led to the passage of
a CUSG resolution expressing student support for OER adoption (see
Appendix I).

    Most of my conversations in these first three months were with col-
leagues and OER advocates as I developed content knowledge, learned
from others' experiences, defined goals, and decided how to approach our
local context. The following timeline describes what came next by chart-
ing our major events and activities up to May 2017.

Timeline of Major Activities

October 2016
In celebration of Open Access Week:

· Organized a pizza party for students with a presentation about OER
    basics by SPARC's Brady Yano via Google Hangouts.

· Assembled a display in the main library lobby that asked students to
    report their textbook expenditures on a whiteboard and to pick up a
    flyer about open alternatives.

· Offered students a chance to win gift cards if they recorded a brief
    testimonial about their experiences with textbook costs in our Adobe
    Studio's video recording room and signed a release allowing us to use
    the footage as needed for future media campaigns.

· Held two informational presentations for faculty: one by the Head of
    Digital Scholarship on open access publishing and one by me on defin-
    ing and adopting OER.

November 2016
Attended the Annual Open Education Conference ("OpenEd") and Open-
Con 2016, which both offered energizing opportunities to gather ideas,
make connections (e.g., meeting with an Open Textbook Network rep-
resentative), and get inspired. CUSG passed a Resolution in Support of
Open Educational Resources (see Appendix I).

December 2016
Held final meetings with campus partners at Clemson Online and Human
Resources to establish a faculty stipend program (see Appendix II for call
for proposals). Updated web presence in the form of a LibGuide listing
From Conversation to Cultural Change  259

OER repositories and related resources. Proposed membership in the
Open Textbook Network to library leadership.

January 2017
Presented to the CUSG on the possibilities of OER and asked for vol-
unteers to assist with Open Education Week in March. Presented to the
Clemson Faculty Senate on OER benefits and campus support for adop-
tion. Presented OER stipend details to liaison librarians in the Research
Services unit. Advertised the faculty stipend program via Libraries' chan-
nels (including: blog, social media, and paper flyers in interlibrary loan
books sent to faculty) and submissions to campus-wide news media.

February 2017
Continued soliciting applications for faculty stipend program, including
direct emails to coordinators in each college who forwarded the message
to their faculty listservs. Planned Open Education Week activities in col-
laboration with CUSG volunteers and advertised events via library chan-
nels, CUSG newsletter (sent to all students) and social media, and CUSG
volunteers' personal networks of friends, Greek organizations, etc. Began
receiving faculty stipend applications, primarily from the College of Edu-
cation.

March 2017
In celebration of Open Education Week:

· Offered students a chance to win a gift card for creating a meme about
    OE and tagging the Libraries on Twitter.

· Set up a table on the high-traffic footbridge in front of the main li-
    brary, staffed throughout the week by student volunteers, with candy,
    a sign advertising the meme contest, and flyers encouraging student
    advocacy for OER.

· Started a petition on Change.org (as per student suggestions) for stu-
    dents to sign in an expression of support for OER.

· Held two drop-in sessions for faculty with questions about the stipend.

Began receiving requests from faculty for consultations about stipend ap-
plications (by phone, email, and in person). Officially joined the Open
Textbook Network and announced membership via press release sent
260  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

to campus-wide publications. Contacted by the student newspaper, The
Tiger, for an interview about our initiatives.

April 2017
Continued to meet with faculty as requested. Faculty stipend committee
(with two representatives from the Libraries and two from Clemson On-
line) met to review applications and select award recipients.

May 2017
Updated CUSG partners on outcomes from Open Education Week and
stipend process (e.g., number of petition signatures, estimated fall savings
for students, etc.) before students left for summer break. Notified stipend
recipients with award details. Emailed remaining stipend applicants with
offers of assistance and suggestions of relevant OER for their courses.

Crafting Our Message
As evidenced by this timeline, most of our efforts in this first year have
been various forms of outreach: media and advertising; presentations to
both self-selected groups and influential campus bodies; contests; flyers;
displays; networking; one-on-one discussions; etc. The hope is that these
social processes will eventually transform our campus culture into one
that not only accepts but expects OE practices. (Although this chapter
focuses on Clemson's current work to encourage OER adoption in par-
ticular, I continually reference "OE practices" in general because I believe
that our strategies can and will be applied more broadly.) At that point,
the Libraries would primarily serve in a supporting role, offering expert
advice to faculty. But, for now, we must continue to actively shape the dis-
course on campus. In this section, I will consider some of the approaches
that helped us craft the messages behind our outreach activities.

    I have already referenced my rhetorical approach to analyzing our local
context, but the utility of rhetoric's classic emphasis on interactions be-
tween speaker/author, message/text, and audience(s) cannot be overstated.
Prominent commentators in the OE community are also reflecting this.
For example, in a blog post comparing pragmatic and idealistic approaches
to OER advocacy, Jhangiani (2017) considered different identities that we
may adopt as speakers/authors and how these stances affect our choice
of messaging. That is, "whereas idealists emphasize student-centered, per-
From Conversation to Cultural Change  261

sonalized solutions that foreground process and agency, pragmatists em-
phasize instructor-centered turnkey solutions that foreground content and
efficiency" (Jhangiani, 2017). In his response to this post, Wiley (2017)
shifted the emphasis from speaker to audience and argued that our mes-
sages should be shaped as specifically as possible, not only by distinguishing
between groups such as faculty or students, but by tailoring our discursive
choices to the individual. "Rather than a static framing like `what kind of
advocate should I be?,' I think a more useful framing would be dynamic, like
`as I'm advocating for open with this specific faculty member, should I ad-
vocate for an evolutionary approach to open ... or should my advocacy go
straight to revolution?'" (Wiley, 2017). In short, both Jhangiani and Wiley
are reminding us to be rhetorically aware.

    What does this all mean in terms of message content? We know that,
on most campuses, a majority of faculty still lack basic awareness and
understanding of OER. In a recent qualitative study, Belikov and Bodily
(2016) found that 73.9 percent of faculty still, quite simply, needed more
information (p. 243). In consideration of our audience's limited knowl-
edge, I have tried to ensure that every piece of general communication
includes a brief definition of OER and summary of their benefits, regard-
less of the rest of the content (see Appendix III for press release example).

    However, we are also attempting to incite action. When addressing
students, our goal this year has been to encourage advocacy. By asking
students to record testimonials, report textbook costs, and sign a petition,
we have been able to collect student voices for use in future campaigns.
Our direct requests for student action in the form of emails to, or office
hours discussions with, professors is difficult to assess and, admittedly, can
be a rather daunting task. Student participation in Open events, includ-
ing contests with gift card incentives, has also been low in this first year.
Clearly, garnering student involvement is an ongoing project. While mes-
sages about lowering textbook costs are highly resonant, as evidenced by
enthusiastic responses from both individuals and groups of students such
as CUSG, we are still seeking inroads and effective expectations for stu-
dent action.

    Realistically, when it comes to course material selection, faculty hold the
power. When addressing faculty, we have been trying to encourage adop-
tion of OE practices, with an emphasis on stipend applications and OER
262  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

use in this first year. Many others have noted the limitations of cost savings
arguments when addressing faculty, including Jhangiani (2017). To craft
messages that resonate more deeply, I once again turn to advocacy strate-
gies from political science. Woodly (2015) argued that "resonance is rooted
in ... combining familiar values, common concepts, and new ideas into pre-
sumptive wholes that can come to be taken for granted" (p. 125). In other
words, resonant arguments aim to shift the status quo by merging "exist-
ing understandings of the way things work or relate, with new arguments
about what is significant or what is to be done" (Woodly, 2015, p. 97). This
requires knowledge of underlying values and existing motivators. While,
ideally, such knowledge is gained at the local level, we can make some as-
sumptions about what drives university faculty at all institutions.

    Wergin (2001) usefully summarized key themes found throughout
research on faculty motivation, reporting that autonomy, community, recog-
nition, and efficacy (p. 50) are the most important factors. This research

provides another set of frames with which to analyze and organize our
activities. For example, our commitment to grassroots rather than admin-
istrative action reinforces faculty autonomy, although we must be careful

not to send the message that OER adoption is always the "best" or "only"
way. So far, the only direct sign of pushback that I have received was
during a conversation with an influential faculty member, in which he
warned that some of his colleagues might interpret our efforts as an en-
croachment on their freedom to choose course materials.

    We are working to develop a community around OE, although this is

an ongoing project that requires wider awareness and participation. The
faculty stipend recipients will, we hope, become the core of a growing
community of practice that the Libraries and our allies can nurture
through events and social networking. The stipend itself is one form of
recognition, although our limited communication channels means that this

recognition may not always spread as far as we would like. In future, the
goal is for news of faculty accomplishments to trickle up, reaching the ears
of influential campus figures (from department chairs to upper admin-
istration) who have the power to broadcast more widely in voices with
more weight.

    Lastly, we know that faculty care about their students. Proving the
efficacy of OE is currently a research emphasis throughout the open com-
From Conversation to Cultural Change  263

munity. Locally, part of our job is to collect, focus, and amplify the voices
of Clemson students. Anecdotal feedback gathered through displays, video
testimonials, petition signatures, the CUSG resolution, and personal in-
teractions indicates that students believe OER can help them succeed.
However, we have also found that they are understandably reluctant to di-
rectly advocate for OE to faculty members. Therefore, it falls on us to help
faculty recognize the value of OE practices for their students.

    These motivational factors serve as helpful frames when crafting mes-
sages directed toward faculty. However, it is still incredibly easy to fall into
the "carrots and sticks" mentality that Wergin (2001) maligned. Even the
widely popular stipend approach, which can be seen as offering a "car-
rot" of monetary rewards to faculty who agree to adopt or create OER,
has obvious weaknesses: stipends are only sustainable if libraries or other
advocates include them in their budgets, and--even more crucially when
viewed from a discourse perspective--they imply that adopting OE prac-
tices is "above and beyond" a faculty member's normal responsibilities, and
thus warranting additional compensation, rather than an expected part of
routine course planning activities. Similarly, although I believe that OE
efforts should eventually be recognized in tenure and promotion guide-
lines, any attempts to force such deep institutional changes, rather than
allowing them to organically grow as a result of cultural shifts, could have
unintended negative consequences. Once again, this leaves us to rely on
conversations, rather than carrots or sticks, as the core of our work--and
makes patience a necessary correlate.

Measuring Our Success
Happily, we do have some measures of success available at the end of this
first year. These outcomes are not only vital on a personal level, helping
advocates to avoid burnout by providing evidence of efficacy, but are also
required to garner continued institutional support.

    Our clearest measurable success is the faculty stipend program. We
awarded six $2,000 stipends and expect to save students nearly $100,000
in textbook costs in fall 2017. These savings should continue each semes-
ter. Our monetary inputs to yield this return include: $12,000 in direct
stipend funding provided by Clemson Online plus related expenditures by
the Libraries to fund 40 percent of a temporary lecturer position, SPARC
264  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

and Open Textbook Network membership fees, and professional develop-
ment funds used for OpenEd and OpenCon attendance.

    We can also measure faculty buy-in beyond that of the six stipend
recipients by considering total numbers of applicants and faculty consulta-
tions. For example, at least two faculty members (one from the College of
Engineering and one from the communications department) are planning
to adopt OER in their classes this fall even though they did not receive a
stipend. I have also had recent conversations with a group of mathematics
faculty who, prompted by my visit to the Faculty Senate, are interested in
adopting open homework systems. It may be difficult to track these ripple
effects with precision, but they certainly indicate an increase in OE-related
action across campus.

    Ultimately, it is difficult to quantify the effects that I argue are even
more important: steps toward a change in discourse, behavior, and cul-
ture. But there are some frameworks at our disposal to help chart this
movement. Raneri and Young (2016), in their discussion of OER pro-
grams at Maricopa Community Colleges, pointed to their use of John
Kotter's eight steps for leading change as one useful model (p. 583). Ac-
cording to Kotter, we must "establish urgency, form guiding coalition[s],
create vision, communicate vision, empower others to act, plan for short-
term wins, produce more change, and institutionalize new approaches"
(Raneri & Young, 2016, p. 583). In our case, the urgency of OE is already
globally established and locally confirmed; we have formed a guiding
coalition between the Libraries and Clemson Online, though its sustain-
ability is uncertain due to budgets and changing leadership; and we have
created and communicated a vision of OER adoption on campus through
our messaging. Our faculty stipend program is already enacting "short-
term wins," and we hope that it will instigate further change. By this
metric, our efforts to lead change are well underway.

    We might also look to measurements of behavioral change such as
Patrick Jackson's approach. I stumbled across this model while exploring
public relations basics in the hope of finding guidance for OER outreach.
Jackson listed these steps toward change: awareness, knowledge, interest,
desire to change, preference for new behaviors, and adoption of new be-
haviors (Black, 2014, pp. 26-27). Under this framework, I would locate
Clemson's progress toward the middle. We have been striving throughout
From Conversation to Cultural Change  265

this year to raise awareness, knowledge, and interest in OE among faculty.
The stipend program has led some to adopt, or at least try out, the new
behavior of incorporating OER into their courses. However, on a larger
scale, we are still in the early stages of cultivating faculty interest in
change. This is a long-term project, and Jackson's stages help us preview
our intended path.

Reflection: Why Discourse Matters
Our choice of communication strategies (whether targeted toward stu-
dents, faculty, administrators, or other campus publics) not only affects
the quantitative success of OE programs (e.g., numbers of OER adoptions
or dollar amounts of student savings) but also lays the groundwork for
long-lasting cultural change within our institutions. In this context, I use
"cultural change" to mean embedded shifts in routines, behaviors, values,
and expectations at both individual and institutional levels. For exam-
ple: expanding student and faculty expectations of what a "textbook" looks
like and how it can be used; changing instructors' processes for finding
and selecting teaching resources; and establishing institutionalized struc-
tures with budgets, staff, and policies to support OE. Discourse allows or
impedes these changes because "the way that we talk about issues in pub-
lic both reflects and determines what solutions are considered desirable
or plausible" (Woodly, 2015, p. 19). In other words, discourse constitutes
possibilities--and, in classical rhetorical terms, determines "the available
means of persuasion" (Aristotle, 350BCE) available to us as we plan our
advocacy work.

    In an essay about the rise of discourse perspectives in organizational
communications research, Putnam (1999) argued:

      Discourse, in this orientation, is the way that organizational
      understanding is produced and reproduced. Labels such as
      "ideal patient" and "healthcare provider" are not simply terms
      that classify occupational groups; rather they define expectations,
      forms of knowledge, and task activities for organizational groups.
      (p. 60, emphasis added)

The same is true for labels like "textbook" and "open" and "educational
resource": the way that academic librarians represent them in conversa-
tions or advertisements affects institutional activities. Schoeneborn and
266  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Blaschke (2017) confirmed the continuing influence of perspectives that
examine "the formative role of communication in constituting organi-
zational phenomena of various kinds" (p. xiii). This resonates with the
concept of constitutive rhetoric, which further defines how communica-
tion strategies can form, cohere, or "constitute" definitions, identities, and
realities (White, 1984; Charland, 1987). Accepting and leveraging the idea
that discourse has constitutive power can help us to sustainably achieve
our goals.

    A focus on discourse lends itself particularly well to decentralized
university contexts in which faculty governance and academic freedom
should stand at the forefront of any attempts at institutional change.
Rather than creating and passing down ideas about OE through admin-
istrative policies, starting with conversations among faculty and students
encourages OE practices to be constituted naturally and eventually rou-
tinized. This grassroots approach to change management also allows for
the fractures and contradictions (Putnam, 1999, p. 63) inherent in acade-
mia, from disciplinary or departmental differences to individual idiosyn-
crasies among faculty members.

    Moreover, this belief in the power of conversations helps us choose
strategies. At Clemson, we have decided that encouraging grassroots ac-
tion by students and faculty, drawing on existing values and motivations,
and working to change routinized behaviors will--slowly, but
surely--change our campus culture. After all, "National political agendas
do not merely develop; they are made by and through the speech and
action of officials, elite opinion leaders, news media, interpersonal inter-
actions, and the organized efforts of grass-roots" (Woodly, 2015, p. 33).
Similarly, a campus focus on open education does not spontaneously arise,
but instead requires initiatives led by OER advocates and carried forward
by organizations such as student and faculty governments; recruitment
of influential voices; campus-wide messaging strategies; and those all-im-
portant conversations, conducted at every turn.

Next Steps: Sustainability and Growth
By incentivizing initial OER adoptions and then gathering data, narratives,
and advocates, we hope to translate grassroots efforts among students and
faculty into part of our institutional identity, prompting wide-scale adop-
From Conversation to Cultural Change  267

tion and administrative support. Our success, at Clemson and beyond, will
ultimately be measured not only by number of adoptions, depth of peda-
gogical integration, and amount of money saved for students, but also by
the institutionalized structures--such as funding, policies, and staff--put in
place to provide sustainable support for OE practices.

    Clearly, we still have a great deal to accomplish before successfully
changing the discourse around educational resources and practices at
Clemson University. As I complete the first year of my position, we
already have several firm goals ahead. Our membership in the Open Text-
book Network means that we will host workshops in September 2017 for
faculty to learn more about the process and possibilities of OER and for
librarians and other personnel to learn how to support faculty adoption.
We will also continue to support the faculty stipend recipients as they im-
plement OER in their courses and highlight their progress to demonstrate
new possibilities for their colleagues. Further, since CUSG's involvement
has proven to be a useful representation of student interest, I will recon-
nect with our contacts when they return to campus in the fall. My goal is
to institutionalize support for OER at the student level by encouraging the
formation of a standing committee or work group in CUSG. Lastly, con-
tingent upon the success of the stipend program's fall semester results, we
should have funding available to offer a second round of stipends in 2018.

    As awareness increases, so does the need for resources. One pressing
project is to improve our web presence and distinguish it from Clemson
Online's Open Education web site. Although the basic distinction between
our departments is that the Libraries provide support with discovery and
adaptation of resources while Clemson Online supports the development
of pedagogical strategies, our roles naturally overlap. Luckily, we work
well together and share a passion for our goals. Unfortunately, however,
our websites do not currently help visitors clarify our differences or take
advantage of our connections.

    We must also capitalize on our first stipend program's results in order
to promote an anticipated repetition of the program in 2018 and to re-
cruit participation in other OE initiatives such as the Open Textbook
Network workshop. Media campaigns and future presentations to student
and faculty governments will feature the accomplishments of our stipend
recipients.
268  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Furthermore, although we have an estimate of student savings from
stipend recipients, we do not know how much OE practices are helping
students across campus to succeed in their programs. I plan to survey our
faculty to compile a comprehensive picture of OE activities, particularly
among faculty with whom I have not yet been in contact. The survey
itself will raise awareness, and its results will allow us to describe the cur-
rent state of open education at Clemson with far better accuracy. Ideally,
this survey will also gauge faculty understanding of OER and their pri-
mary motivations for interest in OE, helping us to craft more resonant
arguments. Once we have evidence in hand of OE on Clemson's campus,
rather than trying to generalize from the experiences of other institutions,
I will target high-enrollment classes and large programs (such as intro-
ductory math, writing, and chemistry) to expand our reach. This could,
of course, be a first step for other open advocates in their local contexts.
However, I consider these classes to be such important targets that I would
like to test our strategies, hone our arguments, and collect more data be-
fore approaching program leaders.

    I firmly believe that all of these efforts can only be made sustainable
through cultural change. If faculty and students start talking about and
expecting education in new ways, then administrative buy-in and institu-
tional structures to support OE will follow out of necessity. Unfortunately,
cultural change tends to be slow and difficult to measure, meaning that
most of our successes and failures will be proven only by time. However,
the current structure of education in the United States is tipping toward the
untenable. We are due for widespread changes. If we, as open advocates,
can help to change the discourse around educational materials and practices
on our campuses, then we may just be able to shape these new conceptual-
izations in ways that broaden opportunities for all students.

    2016/2017 Clemson Undergraduate Student Senate

    Committee: Academic Affairs
Purpose: To express Undergraduate Student Senate support for reducing

textbook costs and increasing the use of open educational resources at

Clemson University.
Whereas, as a result of regular increases in student tuition and fees, many

Clemson University students face economic challenges while completing

their degrees, and
    Whereas, open educational resources are low-cost yet effective sub-

stitutes for traditional textbook materials, and
270  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Whereas, traditional textbooks may fail to arrive on time, but open

educational resources
    Whereas, in an informal poll conducted by the Clemson University

Libraries, 84% of the 445 respondents reported not buying a required text-
book due to cost, and 29% of respondents reported dropping a class due to
textbook cost, and

    Whereas, in another informal poll of similar size conducted by the

Clemson University Libraries, 27% of respondents reported incurring
more debt due to textbook cost, and 13% of respondents reported forgoing
basic necessities to purchase required textbooks.

    Therefore, Be it Resolved by the Clemson Undergraduate Student

Senate assembled in regular session the following:
    That the Clemson Undergraduate Student Senate supports the use of

more affordable educational materials including, but not limited to, open
educational resources.

Appendix II: Faculty Stipend Call for Proposals
The Clemson University Libraries and Clemson Online seek proposals for
the implementation of Open Educational Resources (OER) into existing
Clemson courses. OER are instructional materials such as textbooks that
are free to users and openly licensed to allow unlimited distribution and

course transitions, we are awarding $2,000 to one faculty member in each
college.

    Proposals Due: April 14th, 2017
    Eligibility: All faculty.
    Requirements: Adopt, adapt, or create Open Educational Resources

(OER) to replace existing materials in a course currently offered at Clem-
son University. All implemented OER must be licensed under a Creative
Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license or similar.

    Selection Committee: Two representatives from Clemson Univer-

sity Libraries (Head of Digital Scholarship and OER Librarian) and two
representatives from Clemson Online (Deputy Director of Curriculum
and Instruction and Manager of Learning Systems and Resources).

anteed a stipend.

Appendix III: Press Release
Clemson Joins Open Textbook Network, Offers $2,000 to Faculty Members

    Clemson University is a proud new member of the Open Textbook
Network, an alliance of colleges and universities working to promote "ac-
cess, affordability, and student success through the use of open textbooks."
Open textbooks are written by experts and peer-reviewed, just like tra-
ditional textbooks -- but because they're published online under open
licenses, they're free to use and customize!

    The average college student spends over $1,000 each year on text-
books, and many Clemson students report spending even more. As text-
book costs continue to rise at over four times the rate of inflation and stu-
dent debt reaches unprecedented levels, students are increasingly forced to
make tough decisions about how to afford their education. For too many,
that means not buying required textbooks, taking fewer classes, and suf-
fering both academically and financially.

    Joining the Open Textbook Network is just one part of a larger initia-
tive sponsored by the Clemson University Libraries and Clemson Online
to bring open educational resources (OER) to campus and reduce costs
for students. Last November, the Clemson Undergraduate Student Gov-
ernment (CUSG) declared its endorsement by passing a Resolution to
Support the Use of Open Educational Resources. CUSG senators are con-
tinuing to raise awareness and make student voices heard. You may have
recently seen them on the library bridge during Open Education Week, a
global celebration of educational equity.
272  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    We know that change isn't easy, so the Clemson Libraries and Clem-
son Online are offering professional support along with $2,000 stipends
to help faculty transition to OER. Faculty interested in replacing their

course materials with OER may apply here by April 14th.

    As part of our Open Textbook Network (OTN) membership, we will
also be hosting a workshop this fall with financial incentives for partici-
pating faculty. A team of OTN experts will be on hand to provide training
in OER assessment and adoption, along with continuing support. Stay
tuned for more details!

Introduction
Although faculty awareness and use of open educational resources (OER)
is currently growing at many institutions of higher education given the
continued conversation about course content access, course material
costs, and retention and completion efforts, in 2012, the level of aware-
ness among college and university faculty members was not as wide-
spread. Given the gap in faculty awareness and adoption of OER, faculty
librarians at Delaware County Community College (DCCC) wanted to
not only bring increased awareness on campus through advocacy but also
take a leadership role in the process. Using a model of advocacy through
institutional professional development, faculty librarians at the college
were able to build awareness and use of OER. The Professional Devel-
opment Committee drives all professional development at the College.
This is a committee made up of representatives from all constituencies
at the college to design and implement a total of eight days of manda-
tory professional development opportunities for members of the college
community. Although these professional development days were origi-
nally designed exclusively for faculty, these experiences have evolved to
address the overall needs of the college community. These days consist of
several approximately 90-minute sessions that utilize a variety of modali-
ties including lectures, panel discussions, workshops, and meetings.

    College costs continue to dominate the discussion among politicians,
parents, and prospective students. Since the recession in 2008, colleges
and universities have looked at ways to reduce tuition, room, board, and
ancillary costs to attract prospective students. Students at all institutions
of higher education face financial challenges related to housing, food cost,
274  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

and rising tuition prices. At the macro level, within the greater Philadel-
phia area where DCCC is located, Rosemont College made national news
by announcing a significant reduction in the cost of tuition to attract
new students (Snyder, 2015). In addition to reducing the tuition costs of
attendance, colleges and universities also understand the importance of
reducing the number of obstacles students may face at the micro level
to improve retention and completion rates. Specifically, for community
college students, there are additional financial obstacles that are not nec-
essarily faced by students at other institutions of higher education. In
addition to tuition costs, community college students often struggle when
faced with personal financial obstacles as well as other non-tuition educa-
tional costs (Camera, 2016). These non-tuition financial obstacles include
housing, food, transportation and the cost of educational resources and
materials (Camera, 2016). While these obstacles are not exclusive to com-
munity college students, as this impacts students at all institutions of
higher education, the nontraditional population of community college
students makes the use of OER in the community college environment a
natural fit (Vitez, 2018).

    OER "demonstrate great potential as a mechanism for instructional
innovation as networks of teachers and learners share best practices"
(William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, 2011). The case to migrate
course content away from traditional publisher content toward OER has
never been stronger. The growth in the range and quality of content now
available to faculty members from across disciplines demonstrates that
OER have a place in higher education. Academic libraries and professional
librarians are well positioned to advocate for the use of OER based on our
service to the college community at large and our professional knowledge,
skills, and abilities.

    Beginning in 2012, faculty librarians at DCCC offered institutional
professional development programs during the college's faculty in-service
days related to OER. The first professional development program, titled
"Alternatives to the Textbook: Open Educational Resources and Open
Access Journals" was well received by faculty members throughout the
college and resulted in a second professional development program titled
"Open Educational Resources: Alternatives to the Traditional Textbook"
the following year. This advocacy of OER by the faculty librarian built
Making the Connections  275

interest among the general faculty and administration, which led to the
formation of the Alternatives to the Textbook Committee--later short-
ened to Alt Text Committee. As interest in the use of OER continued to
grow at the college, members of the Alt Text Committee created addi-
tional professional development programs for faculty related to licensing,
creation, and adoption of OER. The continued advocacy of OER via in-
stitutional professional development opportunities inspired the college to
invite an outside keynote speaker to a faculty in-service professional de-
velopment day to discuss OER.

    This continued focus on OER through institutional professional de-
velopment has further contributed to the realization of several
institution-wide OER initiatives, including: an awarded grant to fund the
migration of business courses away from traditional textbooks toward
OER, an increased interest by the general faculty in the application of
OER, and a formal discussion among administration on the feasibility of
developing a zero textbook cost degree program. The role of the acad-
emic library in building an OER program centered on an information
campaign focused on the larger college community about the growing
importance and practicality of these resources. This case study describes
the importance of advocacy through the use of institutional professional
development at DCCC; it will also interweave how other approaches to
advocacy intersect with professional development.

Literature Review
Through the examination of the specific literature stream related to ap-
proaches utilized by academic libraries when advocating the use of OER
at the institutional level, the literature provided relevant and practical ap-
proaches to ensure positive results. When academic libraries advocate for
the use of OER, they need to move beyond the basic marketing efforts
that have been a hallmark of library services promotions. This will require
moving beyond writing columns for the library's newsletter or posting
information on the library's website (Kachel, 2017). The American Associ-
ation of School Librarians (AASL) offers a relevant definition of advocacy
that can be applied in the higher education setting. The AASL (n.d.) de-
fines advocacy as an "ongoing process of building partnership so that others
will act for and with you, turning passive support into educated action for
276  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

the library program. It begins with a vision and a plan for the library pro-
gram that is then matched to the agenda and priorities of stakeholders."
Using this definition to inform the process to develop an impactful OER
program, Fasimpaur (2012) offers four concrete steps to advocating for the
use of OER. The first step that Fasimpaur (2012) identifies is "start with
your curriculum goals and involve teachers from the start" (p. 38). This is
followed by "offering high quality professional development - early and of-
ten" (Fasimpaur, 2012, p. 38). The final two steps are "find the OER that
are right for your students" and "use OER to customize curriculum and dif-
ferentiate learning" (Fasimpaur, 2012, p. 39-40).

    The academic library's role in developing OER programs is outlined
within the four steps put forward by Fasimpaur (2012). Most importantly,
academic libraries can build awareness and advocate for the use of OER by
first educating the college community, specifically teaching faculty, about
the resources that are available. As Allen and Seaman (2014) note, there
is a lack of knowledge among faculty concerning OER, how to find the
content, and how to use the materials in a legal and ethical manner. This
lack of knowledge concerning OER offers libraries the opportunity to de-
velop professional development programs that advocate for the proper
use of these materials. These educational and professional development
opportunities can be workshops, learning communities both within the
library and outside, and other opportunities (Hess, Nann, & Riddle, 2016;
Miller & Homol, 2016; Smith & Lee, 2017; Woodward, 2017). Grant pro-
grams are another approach and provide a similar opportunity to advocate
for OER use on campus through the creation and/or adoption of content
(Blick & Marcus, 2017). Ultimately, successfully advocating for the use of
OER and building a successful program require collaboration between the
library and the faculty members (Goodsett, Loomis, & Miles, 2016). Using
these collaborative approaches to providing educational or professional
development opportunities within the college or university, libraries can
take a leadership role in advocating for the use of OER.

Institutional Profile
Founded in 1967, DCCC serves suburban, urban, and rural populations
in two counties in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Currently, DCCC has nine
campus locations in Delaware and Chester counties. As of the spring 2017
Making the Connections  277

semester, the College has a total student population of 10,998 students
and a full-time equivalency of 7,765 students in a range of transfer and
career and professional degree programs (Institutional Effectiveness Of-
fice, 2017). Currently, 60 percent of students enrolled at the College take
classes on the main Marple Campus, with the remaining 40 percent of
students enrolled at branch campus locations in Delaware and Chester
counties (Institutional Effectiveness Office, 2017). At DCCC, the Online
Campus offering distance learning courses and programs continues to
grow with a 3.1 percent increase from 2016 to 2017 and a total enrollment
of 6,936 students (Institutional Effectiveness Office, 2017). Teaching these
students are approximately 830 full- and part-time faculty members
(Delaware County Community College, 2017).

Institutional Professional Development Priorities
As part of DCCC's shared governance structure, the College Advisory
System (CAS) focuses on "support[ing] the college's mission to facilitate
learning by providing quality educational programs and services that are
student-focused, accessible, comprehensive and flexible to meet the ed-
ucational needs of the diverse communities it serves. In doing so, the
college will enable its students to develop themselves to the limit of their
desires and capabilities and to be successful" (College Advisory System,
2016, p. 3). One standing committee associated with CAS is the Profes-
sional Development Committee (PDC). This committee is charged with
identifying "professional development needs, interests, and priorities of
full- and part-time faculty members, support staff, and administrative em-
ployees through committee members and general advertisement to the
College community" (College Advisory System, 2016, p. 22) (see Appen-
dix A for a complete list of committee functions).

    Part of the work of the PDC is to develop faculty in-service oppor-
tunities twice each semester for a total of four professional development
in-services each academic year. Before the start of each semester in Au-
gust and January, faculty members are required to attend two days of
professional development. During the fall semester in October and dur-
ing the spring semester in February, faculty members are required to
attend two additional days of professional development. Recently, these
professional development days have grown to include administrators,
278                   OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

staff, and adjunct faculty as participants. In addition to faculty, divisional,
and administrative meetings, professional development programs are of-
fered throughout the day. It is during this period that faculty librarians
offered professional development programs related to resources and ser-
vices with specific attention to new resources or important topics. With
an increased focus on the rising costs of textbooks, faculty librarians be-
gan exploring the feasibility of using OER at the College.

    Faculty librarians examined the textbook costs at DCCC. Using prices
from 2012, the faculty librarians determined what the cost would be for
students taking four typical courses during a semester at the College,
based on existing academic program structures. At that time, the total cost
would be $646.33. For comparison, those textbooks were found on Ama-
zon at a less expensive price of $505.12.

    It was this information that initially convinced the faculty librarians
to advocate for the use of OER, and to do so through the existing pro-
fessional development program for faculty. The mandatory professional
development day was ideal to begin this conversation because of the cycli-
cal nature of these events (occurring for two consecutive days, four times
per year) as well as the captive target audience they provide (manda-
tory for all full-time faculty). The textbook cost comparisons illustrated in
Table 1 were also utilized to initiate the conversation with teaching fac-
ulty regarding the value of exploring and possibly adopting OER at the
College. At the time this information was first reviewed and evaluated
by the faculty librarians, there was some concern about electronic access
to course material, because the Florida Distance Learning Consortium
(2011) survey indicated that only 45 percent of students would prefer that
some or all of their course material be available in an electronic format.
While Dahlstrom, De Boor, Grunwald, and Vockley's (2011) study indi-
cates there was an increase in personal computing device ownership at the
time, they did note that "students at associate's colleges and other two-year
programs are more likely to own stationary technologies, such as desk-
top computers and stationary gaming and video devices, particularly in
comparison to students at doctorate-granting institutions" (p. 9). With
280  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

these considerations in mind, the plan to advocate for the use of OER
was developed and the focus was through the institution's professional de-
velopment days. This provided the faculty librarians with access to the
greatest number of faculty members at one time and would allow those
interested in learning more about this topic to self-select into attending
these sessions.

Faculty In-Service Presentations
Beginning in January 2012, two faculty librarians offered the first profes-
sional development program related to OER to the College community.
As Fasimpaur (2012) stated, it is important to "offer high quality profes-
sional development - early and often" (p. 38). As part of this advocacy
through professional development approach, the first program was de-
signed to provide a foundation of knowledge about the issues of rising
textbook prices and what alternatives existed at the time. The professional
development program was titled Alternatives to the Textbook: Open Educa-
tional Resources and Open Access Journals (see Appendix B for the profes-
sional development program description).

    This program was well attended and resulted in faculty members
approaching the librarians to discuss both current, informal open educa-
tional projects the individual faculty members were working on and to
discuss best practices on migrating away from a traditionally published
textbook and adopt OER in their classes. It was clear after this session
that although many faculty members showed an interest in OER adoption,
they were largely isolated events without collaboration or larger vision.
Some of the singular projects and ideas that were shared as a result of
this session were: the adoption of an open access textbook through Flat-
world Knowledge and OpenStax, the development of OER by a faculty
member in the area of studio arts, and the creation of a collaborative pro-
ject between the library and an English faculty member that would load
OER onto Amazon Kindles to ensure students had continuous access to
course material. The interest in reducing textbook costs on campus both
from faculty members and administrators allowed the library to purchase
these Kindles through funding from the Provost's Office. The two faculty
librarians that offered this program developed a LibGuide as a starting
point for faculty members interested in moving in this direction.
Making the Connections  281

    The interest generated from this first institutional professional de-
velopment program led the PDC to request a second program on issues
around OER. The use of professional development in advocating for the
use of OER proved successful. A second professional development pro-
gram was offered in October 2012. While the first program was offered
by two librarians, the second institutional professional development pro-
gram included the faculty member who used open educational content
loaded on Kindles, the Director of Online Learning, and instructional de-
sign staff member in addition to two faculty librarians. The program was
titled "Open Educational Resources: Alternatives to the Traditional Text-
book" (see Appendix C for a complete professional development program
description).

    As with the first presentation, this second one was well received. It
was at this time that the campus-wide Alt Text Committee was formed
to examine the use of OER on campus. This committee included faculty
members from across the college including librarians and interested staff
and administrators. In addition to the committee, the Provost's Office of-
fered funding for faculty members interested in developing OER for use
at the college.

    To support the Provost's Office's desire to create OER at the college,
the next set of institutional professional development opportunities were
designed to provide faculty members with the knowledge, skills, and abil-
ities necessary to produce content. During the February 2014 Faculty
In-Service there were three sessions offered specifically to continue to ad-
vocate for the use of OER by faculty members. The three professional de-
velopment program titles were: Look Ma! No textbook!, Building Alternative
Course Content, and Copyright in the Academic Environment (see Appendix D
for complete list of the series professional development program descrip-
tions).

    This final set of institutional professional development opportunities
included bringing to campus a nationally known figure in the library and
information science field to discuss the use of OER. The combined foci of
the keynote address along with three sessions showed faculty how impor-
tant this work was to the institution.
282  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Discussion
During the two years of concerted professional development opportuni-
ties the library was able to work with a range of faculty members on OER
projects. This work included conducting a second pilot program using the
Amazon Kindles as delivery tools for OER. It was clear this was an ap-
proach that alleviated fears among faculty members that students without
home access to technology would still be able to access the content outside
of class.

    As these pilot programs continued, the work for advocating for the
use of OER moved in a new direction based on the work of the Alt Text
Committee. Because they were working with the Provost's Office, this
committee soon shifted from advocating for the use of OER and instead
changed to working with faculty on developing their own content for use.
The desire was that faculty members would create content specifically for
DCCC courses based on the Master Course Outline, which dictates how
a course is taught. This would ensure that course sections taught by full-
time faculty members and those taught by adjunct faculty members would
use this content so as to ensure all students would benefit from the pro-
gram.

    To facilitate the development of OER on campus, the Provost's Office
worked with the Office of Institutional Advancement, and received fund-
ing from a large local employer to fund faculty grants. These grants would
fund faculty interested in producing OER during the summer months.
The Alt Text Committee did not receive many applications. At this same
time there were changes in senior leadership in the Provost's Office,
which resulted in new directions for the OER program. Because of this
uncertainty the Library and Learning Commons once again took leader-
ship for advocating and assisting faculty in migrating and integrating OER
in their classes.

    In 2016, the Library Services within the Learning Commons received
a $10,000 Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant from the
State Library of Pennsylvania, for use in working with faculty members
in the business department to transition high-enrollment classes from tra-
ditional textbooks to OER (DCCC, 2016). Collaboration between Library
Services and a business faculty member resulted in moving BUS 130: Busi-
ness Communications from a traditional textbook course to one using
Making the Connections  283

OER. The success of this collaboration resulted in additional faculty mem-
bers from other departments expressing interest in participating in this
program. In addition to the business course, the college was able to tran-
sition COMM 111: Public Speaking from using a traditional textbook to
using OER. The LSTA grant funded professional development, OER eval-
uation and review, and support for the transitioning of these courses. The
faculty member who participated in this grant expressed strong support
for the use of OER and plans to continue using these materials.

    Because of the success of the LSTA grant program, the next step for
OER is to begin another round of institutional professional development
programs. Currently, we plan to work with the two faculty members who
participated in the LSTA grant program and ask them to offer personal
accounts of their process migrating and integrating OER into online and
classroom-based courses. Having faculty as part of the professional devel-
opment workshops enhances the credibility of OER and provides others
with professional resources who can speak directly about what to expect.
In addition, through collaborating with faculty members on the profes-
sional development workshops, we plan to revisit some of the previous
professional development programs and update the content so that we
reach new faculty members who joined recently.

Conclusion
While DCCC has a unique model for delivering professional development
to the campus community through consistent opportunities for interac-
tion, academic libraries can replicate this approach by applying similar
strategies on their campuses. Academic libraries can develop short pro-
fessional development opportunities during the course of a semester at
times convenient for faculty members to attend by analyzing the semester
course schedule or by targeting a specific academic division through their
library liaison. These short programs should be approximately 60 minutes
in length and can be delivered both in person and synchronously online,
using affordable or free web conferencing software. Libraries should con-
sider creating a professional development program in which each work-
shop is sequential and designed to build on the work of the previous
session, but would also allow for faculty members to jump into the series
when needed without consequence. This allows faculty members who at-
284  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

tend professional development workshops to become more aware and
educated about OER and begin larger conversations within their own
departments, divisions, or across the College. It provides them with an
opportunity to discuss how they might migrate and integrate OER into
their own courses.

    Advocacy through professional development also ensures that the
college community understands the role the library can play in leading
OER initiatives. Librarians leading this project need to highlight their
subject matter expertise when promoting and advocating the use of OERs
on campus and discuss the value they can bring to the adoption of this
content. It is essential to connect faculty members that are interested in
using OER content with appropriate sources. Facilitating the use of this
content will ensure librarians are viewed as subject matter experts. Librar-
ians should be active partners in this work with faculty, be responsive to
their needs and help to identify any possible pitfalls of adopting these re-
sources. Ideally, this ongoing partnership should further strengthen the
relationship between the faculty and the library. When a faculty mem-
ber expresses interest in pursuing or even adopting an OER, follow-up by
the faculty librarian is essential through one-on-one meetings and email.
Early adopters are often the leading advocates on campus if their experi-
ence is a positive one and can be invited to present their own professional
development program within the series.

    Finally, librarians, while working with the library administration,
need to connect with the larger institutional administration structure to
ensure the support and resources necessary for OER adoption is available.
The focus of this work should be through the Provost or Vice President
of Academic Affairs office. For academic libraries interested in taking a
leadership position on campus in advocating for the use of OER, there
are a number of approaches. The literature on advocating for OER shares
that collaboration, grants, and encouragement work when connections
are made by librarians to the curriculum and through specific disciplines.
Based on our understanding of the OER atmosphere on our own campus,
our successful approach was advocacy through professional development.

Look Ma! No textbook!
"This idea of ditching the commercially published textbooks for free or

lower cost materials sounds wonderful BUT..." If that is your response,
then this discussion is for you! There are many opportunities and chal-
lenges in the adoption or editing or creation of non-commercially pub-
lished course content. There are many possible formats. The pricing mod-
els are confusing. The technology might be daunting for you or your
students.

    The Textbook Alternatives Committee was formed in Fall 2013 to
look at all of these issues (and more!) in order to determine what the pos-
sibilities are for us at the College. Please join members of this grass roots
group in a discussion of what the issues are, what's already happening on
campus, and what the future could look like.

Building Alternative Course Content
Have you have you been thinking about adopting or editing course con-
tent that is not coming from a commercial publisher, or even creating
your own course content? Here's your chance! In this hands-on workshop,
you will discover whether you want to adopt a resource completely, adopt
but edit and mix content, or create content from scratch. You will explore
which format might work best for your courses, e.g. an open textbook,
a printed or e-course pack with both free and licensed content, a course
management system-like format, a collection of digital videos, an iBook,
or even something else altogether. There are many possibilities! You'll
learn where to look for existing content. You'll also spend time working
hands-on with online resources created to make your concept resource
become a reality. (Please note: This workshop requires a working knowl-
edge of copyright including Creative Commons licensing and the use of
the Copyright Clearance Center's Annual Academic License.)

Copyright in the Academic Environment
What is "Fair Use?" Can I put commercial video clips on my faculty web-

What happens if I unknowingly break the copyright law? How do I get
copyright permission? What is the Annual Academic Licensing Service
subscribed to by DCCC?

    This workshop will address the questions faculty and administrators
frequently ask when working with copyrighted materials in the academic

Introduction
Efforts to encourage the adoption and creation of open educational re-
sources (OER) have increased nationwide in recent years, with work
taking place at multiple levels within the larger ecosystem. In higher edu-
cation, projects are taking root at the state level and within specific schools
and departments; and are being pushed by legislators, librarians, profes-
sors, students, and even publishers. It can be a challenge to achieve an
approach where the work of these stakeholders at multiple levels is inte-
grated instead of occurring in separate silos.

    Recent work in Louisiana offers an example of a more unified ap-
proach. Led by the state library consortium, LOUIS: The Louisiana Li-
brary Network, stakeholders across levels have worked in tandem toward
a common goal. At the same time, these stakeholders have achieved own-
ership of their work in order to provide specialized approaches for their
audiences and to champion their individual successes to their constituen-
cies. By linking library activities to student success, LOUIS has demon-
strated how libraries, though not revenue-generating enterprises, provide
value in terms of the retention and success of students. Through this pro-
gram, branded as Affordable Learning LOUISiana, libraries have received
new investments in a climate where annual budget reductions have be-
come the norm. LOUIS has been able to leverage the consortial model to
build capacity among librarians and to design programs that the member-
ship could adapt and launch in order to achieve accomplishments on their
campuses.

    This chapter highlights how these efforts began with LOUIS respond-
ing to support that galvanized at the state level. When the Board of
292  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Regents, a state governmental body, sought to advance OER and textbook
affordability projects, they directed funds to LOUIS. This chapter dis-
cusses how LOUIS used these funds to design a project that built the
capacity and infrastructure needed to develop an OER culture in the state,
and how local institutions have applied this model to the degree to which
they have had the ability and interest to support it.

Literature Review
State-level initiatives and funding for OER have increased in recent years,
resulting in the application of top-level support to encourage OER growth
through many types of approaches. This review attempts to capture the
variety of the strategies being deployed and to highlight projects at dif-
ferent stages of maturity. For a comprehensive summary of state legisla-
tion activity, SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources
Coalition) provides an OER State Policy Tracker webpage:
https://sparcopen.org/our-work/state-policy-tracking/.

    California has been at the forefront of support for OER, passing two
bills in 2012: SB 1052, Public Postsecondary Education: California Open Edu-
cation Resources Council, and SB 1053, Public Postsecondary Education: Cali-
fornia Digital Open Source Library. Together, these enabled the California
public higher education system to develop an OER library, initially
focused on identifying material for 50 high-impact courses. The legisla-
tion does not mandate adoption of OER but has encouraged discovery
of free and open textbooks through the site COOL4ED (California Open
Online Library for Education, www.cool4ed.org). COOL4ED builds on
earlier initiatives by using the infrastructure of The California State
University's MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning
and Online Teaching, www.merlot.org) project, which was launched in
1997 as a tool to collect and share OER materials. Affordable Learning
Solutions (AL$, http://als.csuprojects.org/), a related initiative, sup-
ports the use of OER and other free and low-cost course materials.
AL$ enables adoption of affordable content through strategies such as
providing faculty grant programs, highlighting available course mate-
rials, and supporting authorship. More recently, AB 798, the College
Textbook Affordability Act of 2015, has established an Open Educa-
tional Resources Adoption Incentives Program to provide campuses
Advocacy in OER  293

with funds to support faculty and staff OER activity and professional
development (AB 798, 2015).

    The state legislature in Connecticut has been active in presenting
and passing legislation for OER. In 2015, it passed SHB 6117, An Act
Concerning the Use of Digital Open-Source Textbooks in Higher Education.
This special act promoted the use of OER by requiring the Board of Re-
gents for Higher Education to collaborate with state university and col-
lege systems to create an open source textbook consortium (HB 06117,
2015). The consortium was charged with leading a pilot program that
would focus work in two areas: "(1) assess the use of high-quality digital
open-source textbooks, and (2) promote the use of and access to open-
source textbooks" (HB 06117, 2015). Students were instrumental in the
passage of this legislation, testifying in favor of it, outlining the quality
and value of OER, and sharing the consequences of high-cost tradi-
tional textbooks (Smart, 2010). More recently, the state senate passed
An Act Concerning Digital Discounts to Reduce the Cost of Textbooks and
Other Educational Resources, which provided the Board of Regents for
Higher Education and the University of Connecticut the authority to
"establish guidelines that encourage public and private colleges and uni-
versities to implement programs that reduce the cost of textbooks and
other educational resources for students" (SB 00948, 2017). The work
highlights textbooks and OER as a recognized strategy in the state for
making higher education more affordable.

    In the northwest, state funding, in addition to private funds from the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, financed Washington's Open Course
Library. The collection is composed of course materials that cost $30 or
less and align to 81 high-enrollment courses in the state (Reynolds, 2011,
p. 182). The collection of materials primarily supports cost reduction but
secondarily promotes curriculum reform by providing engaging and in-
teractive materials that, in turn, drive completion rates (Reynolds, 2011,
p. 182). In 2015, Oregon passed HB 2871, which provided $700,000 to es-
tablish an OER grant program, create an OER Resource Specialist staff
position, implement a course designation that would highlight courses
that use free or low-cost materials, and identify OER for 15 high-en-
rollment, general education courses taught commonly across institutions
("HB2871 Update," 2016).
294  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    In Georgia, the Affordable Learning Georgia (ALG) initiative devel-
oped after multiple years of OER activities in the University System of
Georgia (USG). Initially, this included a partnership with California State
University's MERLOT to create a repository of digital learning objects:
the USG SHARE project. Subsequently, grant funding from the Institute
of Museum and Library Services supported the creation of the Georgia
Knowledge Repository, a project connected to academic libraries in the
state. Finally in 2013, the USG, under the infrastructure of the statewide
library consortia, GALILEO, and with the support of California's AL$,
launched ALG (Gallant, 2015). ALG covers 30 institutions across the USG
and includes projects like a competitive faculty grant program, referred
to as Textbook Transformation Grants, which are given to faculty to
redesign courses to reduce or eliminate the textbook costs to students.
Currently in its eighth round, the Textbook Transformation Grant pro-
gram prioritizes the redesign of high-enrollment courses. Some projects
utilize existing OER resources, including textbooks, while others result in
the creation of new textbooks.

    Minnesota's OER initiatives were advanced through inclusion in the
state's omnibus higher education appropriations bill, SF 1236, which was
passed in the 2013-14 legislative session. This bill incentivized the de-
velopment of an OER strategy to reduce student textbook expense by
1 percent. Higher education was motivated to develop this plan as one of
five performance goals that, when completed, would result in an addi-
tional 5 percent appropriation for higher education (SF 1236, 2013). One
programmatic example of this is the continued institutional support of the
Center for Open Education at the University of Minnesota. This center is
the home of the Open Textbook Network (OTN) and the Open Textbook
Library. The OTN has grown to include many national member institu-
tions, creating a community of practitioners and providing professional
development in open education.

    In North Dakota, an OER program was developed as a result of a
legislative study committee introduced in 2013 (North Dakota Legislative
Council, 2013). House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 3009 involved the
study of the potential uses of open textbooks in the state. The findings of
that study committee were developed into a white paper and presented
during the following legislative session to the Higher Education Funding

Committee. Subsequently, an appropriation of $110,000 was granted to
the North Dakota University System for the launch of an OER program
(Spilovoy, 2016). Funded initiatives included membership and training
with the OTN and the launch of a grant program for redesigning courses
to integrate OER.

Louisiana Higher Education Climate
Interest in OER increased in Louisiana amid a challenging budgetary en-
vironment. The national recession began in 2007 and, coupled with a
shift in state budget priorities away from higher education in 2008 and
steep declines in oil and gas prices, a main state revenue source, resulted
in significant budget cuts for higher education. These cuts persisted in
Louisiana even after funding for higher education began to rebound in
many states (Mitchell, Palacios, & Leachman, 2014). From the 2007-08
to the 2015-16 academic years, the state cut higher education funding by
44 percent (Harlan, 2016). The far-reaching consequences have included
reductions in the state's higher education appropriations by 43.4 percent
from the start of the recession to 2017 and, as a consequence, more than
doubling of in-state tuition at Louisiana State University, the state's flag-
ship, over that period (Gluckman, 2017).

    In response to an increasingly constrained budgetary environment,
the legislature began to explore ways to positively impact costs in higher
education. The Board of Regents, a 15-member board representing the
state's seven Congressional districts, is charged with planning, coordi-
nating, and budgeting public higher education in Louisiana. Based on
recognition in the legislature of the consequences of the high cost of text-
books, the Regents provided $145,000 in funding for LOUIS to design and
execute a two-year pilot project that would positively impact this issue in
the state.

LOUIS and the Board of Regents
LOUIS was identified for a leadership role because of the organization's
demonstrated capacity for project design and management of statewide
initiatives. Formed in 1992, LOUIS serves as the statewide library consor-
tium for 47 member institutions, composed of all public and private col-
lege and university libraries in the state. In this role, LOUIS provides cost-
effective coordination of resource procurement and technology imple-
296  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

mentation and oversight. Additionally, the consortium coordinates pro-
fessional development programming and information sharing. This is
done through LUC, an annual LOUIS Users Conference, and Learning
with LOUIS, a monthly webinar series for sharing training and best prac-
tices. LOUIS provides the communications infrastructure for service desk
management; listserv hosting and coordination for systems administra-
tors, interlibrary loan, electronic resources, and information literacy per-
sonnel; and maintains social media and a newsletter, LOUIS Lagniappe, for
outreach to member libraries.

    Although state funding is a small portion of LOUIS' overall operating
budget, the vast majority being received in library membership fees, it re-
mains critical to the success of the consortium and it also ensures a contin-
uing connection between statewide higher education priorities and those
of the library community. The state portion of funding for LOUIS origi-
nates at the Board of Regents and LOUIS cannot independently advocate
for or request funding through the legislature. As a result, a reciprocal re-
lationship has been established with the Regents, and LOUIS staff work
to tell the story of their efforts to them, providing compelling data to un-
derscore the work. As a consequence, LOUIS has been recognized as a
solutions provider by the Regents, with a reputation for being able to pro-
vide cost-effective services.

    The budgetary climate and LOUIS' standing converged when a mem-
ber of the Louisiana legislature discussed the cost of textbooks and en-
couraged the Board of Regents to explore approaches to mitigate this
expense. In response, the Regents provided funding to LOUIS for a proof-
of-concept project. Funds were intended to provide an introduction to
what the state could be doing on this issue. Thus, LOUIS set out to
design a program with student-focused impacts in the area of textbook
affordability. The development and branding of the Affordable Learning
LOUISiana (ALL) program came soon after the initial Regents funds in
order to present a cohesive and overarching project strategy.

Affordable Learning LOUISiana: Grant Program
LOUIS' initial design for ALL was informed by small-scale projects oc-
curring locally in the state, and influenced by larger programs beyond
Louisiana. Locally, two academic libraries had begun work in this area.
Advocacy in OER  297

Louisiana State University had launched a program that aligned library-
licensed ebooks with classes, specifically promoting books with user-
friendly licenses ("About the E-Textbooks Initiative," n.d.). Loyola Uni-
versity had begun promoting open access books and OER and advocat-
ing for their use in classes in an initiative led at the library (Gallaway &
Hobbs, 2015).

    Considering the success of these two programs, the inaugural work
of ALL focused on a statewide grant project for member libraries looking
to implement or extend these strategies through multiple rounds of fund-
ing. More specifically, the first round focused on two types of projects.
One asked librarians to identify a campus faculty partner and collaborate
on the selection of ebooks for course use that could be licensed by the
library and provided to students on that campus at no cost. LOUIS en-
couraged ebooks with user-friendly licenses: DRM-free, enabling students
to print and save content; unlimited user simultaneous access to allow an
entire class to use the title at once; and with perpetual access, maintaining
the resource in the collection beyond the initial semester of use. Nonethe-
less, LOUIS allowed libraries to purchase or subscribe to titles that worked
for their context, including single and 3-user licenses (often with multiple
copies of a title to enable course use) and ebook rentals. The second option
was for librarians to identify a faculty partner to collaborate with on se-
lecting and implementing OER to replace a textbook.

    In the first round, about $10,000 of grant funding was requested--less
than envisioned. After reviewing the program, it was determined that the
lack of training on OER support models and the limited infrastructure to
support ebook procurement or licensing had resulted in modest participa-
tion and success. Additionally, there was no strategy to promote student
savings or return on investment, making it difficult to communicate the
impact and value of the program to the Regents, a faculty audience, or li-
brarian stakeholders. The initial round did, however, demonstrate LOUIS'
ability to engage multiple member libraries around textbook affordability.
The participating libraries supported campuses from a variety of types of
colleges and universities: from technical and community colleges to sem-
inaries to large doctoral-granting institutions. Finally, regardless of the
environment, all projects were student- and savings-focused, providing an
opportunity to put the library at the center of a student success initiative.
298  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Next Steps: Strategy
Reflecting on the initial work, additional LOUIS staff were assigned to
the project and tasked with addressing the limitations of the first round
and developing an evaluation plan for moving forward. This resulted in
a program strategy revision, implemented during the fall of 2015. The
strategy continued to center around OER and licensed ebook initiatives
for course material affordability, but added emphasis on building and
supporting a community of interested and knowledgeable librarian prac-
titioners through professional development, communications, and assess-
ment. For this strategy, LOUIS created an action plan (see Appendix). The
primary activities of the strategy included: to provide an updated and con-
solidated listing of resources to enable member libraries to quickly identify
existing OER, to create opportunities for state experts to share best prac-
tices, to develop a communications plan to ensure OER remained a topic
of interest, and to develop an outcomes-based ebook purchasing program
focused on course use titles available in DRM-free formats.

    LOUIS began directing staff time toward promoting the ALL brand
with a focus on reaching internal consortium member stakeholders and
external audiences. The message firmly positioned libraries as expert or-
ganizations in the campus discussion relating to affordability and un-
derscored the role of libraries in student success. Specifically, content
prepared for internal and external audience emphasized that libraries are
positioned to lead efforts to reduce the costs of education for students by:

· Leveraging expertise in the cooperative procurement of licensed con-
    tent from textbook publishers

· Collaborating with faculty on the selection or purchase of materials
    within library collections that are appropriate for course adoptions

· Cooperating with campus bookstores on identifying faculty-selected
    materials that are owned or can be purchased

· Curating collections of OER and open access scholarly content
· Designing and supporting discovery systems and institutional reposi-

    tories that enable access to and delivery of educational content
· Delivering educational programming to faculty and educational tech-

    nology professionals on tenets of scholarly licensing, including Cre-
    ative Commons principles
Advocacy in OER  299

· Developing professional competencies for new roles as advocates for
    affordability and leaders on their campuses

· Advocating for institutional policies that support open access, open
    education, and open data

As librarians became exposed to the content highlighting these roles, and
as they received professional development training provided by LOUIS
to sharpen skills in some of these areas, they were able to internalize
messages and competencies and demonstrate these roles in their local en-
vironments.

    Finally, once the second round of grant funding was announced, cri-
teria were revised to place a new emphasis on tracking student savings
and to exclude projects involving textbook rentals due to sustainability
concerns. Through summer 2017, five rounds of the grant program have
taken place.

Institution-Level Deployment of Strategy
The grant program allowed local institutions to direct funds to reflect the
local priorities and culture of the institution. In doing so, ALL enabled
individual academic libraries to become campus champions for textbook
affordability. This work represented a new focus in the state, and the in-
fusion of funds enabled librarians to find and capture low-hanging fruit
within their institutions. With success stories to promote, librarians could
build momentum and begin developing an OER culture locally. The grant
program was structured in a way that local institutions were able to ap-
ply this model to the degree to which they had the interest and capacity to
support it. $50,000 was allocated to this program, with each site having an
initial allocation of $1,000 for a self-selected project. Unexpended funds
were reallocated in subsequent rounds of funding. This allowed as many
member sites to participate as able, so long as they submitted an eligible
project. After the first round, the ALL approach responded to member
needs and revised the structure to support the development of state-level
infrastructure. LOUIS scaled up offers of administrative assistance, such
as in purchasing and licensing of ebooks.

    These efforts were coupled with increased focus on professional de-
velopment in the open area that launched a collaborative community of
Louisiana librarians through which further learning and sharing could oc-
300  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

cur. LOUIS coordinated activities that were led by local librarians for open
access and open education weeks, and encouraged institutions to share
emerging best practices and accomplishments through newsletter posts
and "Learning with LOUIS" webinar sessions. Encouraging librarians to
tell their stories to one another contributed to the development of a cul-
ture where librarians were prepared and eager to talk about OER and
textbook affordability to diverse audiences.

Next Steps: Open Textbook Network
A significant program expansion came as a result of connections to the
national open education community. LOUIS began collaborating with
peer groups, bringing in outside expertise for programs including a we-
binar with ALG on textbook transformations. In the spring of 2016,
LOUIS began discussions with the OTN on joining the network as a
system or consortial member. The OTN initially supported adoption
of OER by working with individual campuses to deliver workshops to
instructional faculty, but it was also beginning to expand its scope to sup-
port states' or systems' ability to enable librarians to host faculty work-
shops at campuses by using a train-the-trainer model. At the 2016 con-
ference of the International Coalition of Library Consortia, the Boston
Library Consortium (BLC) presented an overview of their system mem-
bership with OTN. LOUIS, which was already in negotiations to join the
OTN, was able to design a train-the-trainer cohort model based on the
experiences of the BLC.

    LOUIS adopted the OTN's train-the-trainer model because of the
demonstrated benefits it offered. One appeal was its outcomes-based ap-
proach that focused on how the organizing entity could demonstrate
student savings through OER. Because of the focus on OER adoptions, the
program aligned with LOUIS' assessment goals of tracking student sav-
ings from course textbook replacements. The model had relatively low
overhead and did not require the costly support structure of other OER
projects, such as extensive course redesigns using a variety of OER types
and technologies. It positioned librarians as campus leaders in this af-
fordability work. Finally, this strategy was scalable and replicable. LOUIS
could invest in training and in building and maintaining a local network
and then member libraries could grow their programs.
Advocacy in OER  301

    To begin work, LOUIS used a nomination process to select three
participants from member libraries to attend OTN's Summer Institute,
an intensive training workshop. Participants had to agree to continued
involvement in terms of delivering local workshops to campus faculty fol-
lowing the training and supporting other librarians to do the same in the
future. LOUIS' ALL project leader also attended the summer training in
order to ensure that there was a coordinated statewide plan upon comple-
tion of the program to outline train-the-trainer rollout. After returning,
the three librarians, with the support of the project leader, each planned a
workshop at their respective campuses. Additionally, they held bi-weekly
conference calls to address planning and administrative issues preceding
and following these events.

    The following December and January, OTN came to Louisiana to
give two train-the-trainer workshops for other interested librarians. At-
tendees were offered the opportunity to bring a campus partner, such as
a teaching and learning staff member, instructional designer, or faculty
member. Through these one-day workshops, 60 individuals were trained
and then placed into small groups--cohorts led by a Louisiana librarian
with experience in OER and/or OTN's model. This mentoring program
supported the development of a community of practice centered around
open textbooks. Additionally, ALL provided small grants and administra-
tive support for local libraries hosting faculty workshops. In total, in the
fall preceding the train-the-trainer sessions and in the subsequent spring,
approximately 120 faculty received an introduction to open education,
open textbooks, and Creative Commons, and an invitation to complete
a review of a textbook in their discipline. The number of participating
faculty reflected the number of requests from librarians for funds to host
workshops, therefore demonstrating alignment between librarian inten-
tions and faculty interest. LOUIS shared these successes and the result
provided positive exposure for the ALL initiative at the Board of Regents,
state legislature, and on the individual campuses.

    Finally, to make OER more relevant and findable in a Louisiana con-
text, LOUIS recruited six librarians who worked alongside four LOUIS
staff on the creation of a crosswalk between available content in OTN's
Open Textbook Library and Louisiana's higher education curriculum.
This leveraged the state's common course articulation and was modeled
302  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

on the ALG's Top 100 Undergraduate Courses, which lists the 100 USG
courses with the highest enrollment and corresponding OER. LOUIS'
project provided a high-level view of potential open textbook adoptions
for the state and helped to identify courses and subject areas of high prior-
ity in terms of creation of new OER content. As with other products and
strategy, existing communication channels between LOUIS and member
sites were harnessed to promote these tools, including the listserv and so-
cial media. In response, librarians who have used the tool while working
with faculty on OER adoptions have shared that it was a helpful launching
point for beginning discussions and finding materials.

Institution-Level Response
The train-the-trainer model allowed librarians to develop and demon-
strate expertise. The initial three librarians to receive training served as
peer librarians who could share their experiences through a Louisiana lens
and highlight how approaches could be tailored in light of local oppor-
tunities (a budgetary climate that made affordability initiatives especially
appealing) and restrictions (increases in teaching loads that resulted in
professors valuing textbooks with integrated homework and test manage-
ment systems). The train-the-trainer model created a scalable program
focused on building capacity relatively quickly and fairly inexpensively.
It wasn't possible to send all interested librarians to the Summer Insti-
tute, but LOUIS was able to disseminate a similar, compressed training by
bringing it to Louisiana. In the process, this approach built a community
of librarians and developed collaborations that extended beyond a single
campus or library.

Collaborations to Advance Affordable Learning
LOUISiana
The ALL initiative has prioritized the development of infrastructure and
capacity. The overarching method for achieving this has been by focusing
on communication of program outcomes and building an OER professional
development program for librarians. To facilitate and deepen this process,
LOUIS has sought out collaborations within Louisiana and beyond.

    LOUIS developed ALL with other state initiatives in mind and one
early program mentor was GALILEO's ALG group. ALG was natural
peer group because of its administrative structure within a state library
Advocacy in OER  303

consortium. ALG offered opportunities for shared programming with
a joint webinar offered to constituencies on textbook transformation
strategies and a model for tracking the program's financial impacts.

    LOUIS also partnered with the Louisiana Library Association (LLA),
an organization that works to promote the interest of libraries in
Louisiana through work including professional development and legisla-
tive advocacy. LLA's Legislative Committee has supported legislation to
promote or extend OER. During the 2016 legislative session, HCR 80
was put forward and passed. This resolution was informed by the work
of ALL and proposed a partnership with LLA, the state library, public li-
braries, and K-12 librarians to develop a study committee to investigate
and recommend a virtual library and a continued textbook affordability
initiative for higher education. Following the work of the study commit-
tee, a virtual library proposal, an appropriations bill, was considered but
ultimately not put forward at the request of the state library due to a dif-
ficult state budget climate. Nonetheless, LOUIS has continued to pursue
sustainable funding for ALL. LOUIS completed the HCR 80 study com-
mittee with a testimony to House and Senate education committees. The
testimony presented ALL outcomes and acknowledged a need for legisla-
tive support for further investments in higher education for OER. While
not tied to an appropriations request because of the administrative struc-
ture of LOUIS, the testimony was positively received and underscored
ongoing support for Regents investment.

Future Directions
In the 2016 legislative session, Act 619 was signed into law. This man-
dated a "a comprehensive review of the educational demands of the state
and its regions; to provide for an evaluation of the state's post-secondary
education assets, needs, gaps and barriers; to provide for a report of
the findings and recommendations; and to provide for related matters"
(SB 446, 2016). As a consequence, the Regents supplied a formal report,
Response to Act 619 of the 2016 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature,
with recommendations to the Senate and House committees prior to the
commencement of the 2017 legislative session. It was through this that
the Regents identified ALL as a legislative priority--an acknowledgment
of LOUIS' prior advocacy with the Regents and ability to provide an ex-
304  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ample of positive impacts to students of higher education in the state.
The Regents' response included a commitment to develop the Afford-
able Learning LOUISiana Plan, a statewide plan for the "utilization of
Open Educational Resources" and to "build on current efforts related to
eTextbooks, eLearning and related technologies designed to significantly
lower costs of course materials for students while enriching the educa-
tional experience"(Louisiana Board of Regents, 2017, p. 35). This plan is
due in the fall of 2017 and is being completed by LOUIS in conjunction
with the Regents and the state's eLearning Task Force--a subgroup of the
Regents. Components identified for inclusion include LOUIS' success-
ful implementation of the OTN train-the-trainer and faculty workshop
model and an outline for its continuation, and the continuation of the
course alignment project.

    To ensure that LOUIS' ongoing participation in this and other
Regents-led statewide efforts aligns with the needs and abilities of
LOUIS library constituents, an Affordable Learning Taskforce is under
development. This will promote greater member participation and over-
sight in the development of the Regents' statewide plan and provide a
mechanism to connect the ALL goals with the development of LOUIS'
overarching strategic plan, which may include exploration of future
staffing needs and funding models.

    The expanding statewide interest in textbook affordability has also
resulted in institutional-level investments in OER, and LOUIS continues
to support these efforts when requested. When the Louisiana Commu-
nity and Technical College System (LCTCS) announced that an annual
eLearning grant fund would be dedicated to OER initiatives, LOUIS was
contacted by system representatives outside of the library with a request
for support and coordination. LOUIS integrated the library and coor-
dinated a successful grant-writing project for LCTCS using library-cen-
tered affordability initiatives. LOUIS staff continue to offer consultation
services to other member schools designing OER projects, including for
other recent grants offered by the state's eLearning Task Force. In this
manner, LOUIS has been able continue to propel success stories for the
state through infrastructure and administrative support.

Conclusion

The legislature-to-library consortium-to-university model has allowed
multiple stakeholders to take ownership of an element of this project and
apply leadership at their level while working toward shared success in
the state. The financial support, administrative infrastructure, and profes-
sional development offered through ALL showed local institutions that
OER are a statewide priority, backed by the Board of Regents, and a pos-
sible venue for funding and advancement in terms of skills and services.
Though ALL started with one-time money, LOUIS has worked to develop
a program worthy of reinvestment by continually telling the story of how
students are impacted and by backing this story with numbers to show re-
turn on investment. In doing so, LOUIS has worked to rewrite a narrative
in Louisiana that frames libraries as campus cost centers and that regu-
larly results in funding cuts. Instead, LOUIS has highlighted libraries as
the core of the ALL story, demonstrating libraries' ability to successfully
lead initiatives on local campus and underscoring libraries' impacts on stu-
dent success. This, in turn, provides the foundation for future requests for
funding as a way to continue the program goals.

           resources that have direct impact on reducing student expenses. The impact of
           those purchases should be collected and disseminated to demonstrate cost
           savings (and/or cost avoidance) to students.

     Goal: The information regarding availability of content and licensing terms of

           e-book/e-textbooks can be confusing. To assist member libraries in negotiating
           best possible pricing and license terms for DRM-free content, LOUIS will
           extend its existing mini-consortia services to these resources as well as provide
           technology to expose the relevant e-book/e-textbook resources that are
           available for purchase and meet a set of DRM-free criteria.
     Initial Actions: Establish a working group to document criteria for the selection of

           DRM-free e-books; develop/purchase a product, mechanism or infrastructure
           to identify content that meet the criteria and match isbn/e-isbns of content

Introduction
Academic libraries are increasingly providing education and support for
faculty interested in open educational resources (OER). Some academic li-
braries offer comprehensive training programs and dedicated staff to sup-
port the creation and adoption of OER. Other libraries focus on smaller
initiatives seeking to explore the interests of OER stakeholders on their
campuses. However, there are still a significant number of academic li-
braries with little or no experience supporting faculty OER needs. This
was the situation at Duke University, Davidson College, Furman Univer-
sity, and Johnson C. Smith University in early 2016.

    Most of the librarians at these institutions had minimal to no expe-
rience working with OER, and had no clear concept of which of their
faculty had adopted or contributed to OER. Fortunately, these institutions
have access to a shared endowment that facilitates collaborative program-
ming across their institutions. Beginning in the summer of 2016, librari-
ans from these four schools joined together to develop a unique OER pilot
program that pooled resources and created a support structure across in-
stitutions with notably different student populations, faculty interests, and
library structures.

TDEL OER Pilot Program
The OER pilot program implemented by Duke, Davidson, Furman, and
Johnson C. Smith benefited from external funding and interinstitutional
collaboration made possible by the Duke Endowment. Established in 1924
by the tobacco and hydroelectric power magnate, James B. Duke, the Duke
Endowment is a permanent trust fund with designated beneficiaries.
310  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Among these beneficiaries are four institutions of higher learning: David-
son College, Duke University, Furman University, and Johnson C. Smith
University. In 2001, the libraries from these four institutions established
an informal group called the Duke Endowment Libraries (TDEL) to foster
collaboration and share knowledge and training across the institutions'
libraries. In 2015, TDEL established a project fund to provide financial sup-
port for joint projects among two or more of the Duke-endowed libraries.
During preliminary discussions about possible uses of this fund, the topic
of OER presented itself. With the exception of Davidson College, the OER
experience among the libraries was fairly limited. Working collaboratively,
the Duke-endowed libraries could realize the following benefits:

· Connect librarians at different institutions with a shared interest in
    supporting open access and OER.

· Collect and analyze OER information from several institutions to
    identify larger trends and interests in higher education.

· Maximize resource utility by pooling training and funding across in-
    stitutions, while still facilitating a program that best suits the needs of
    each individual campus.

Even with all the benefits of collaboration, it is important to note that the
four beneficiary institutions of the Duke Endowment are very different
from one another. They have varying missions, student bodies, and levels
of involvement in scholarly communication initiatives. The TDEL library
directors felt this institutional variety was an asset to the project.

    Davidson College is a highly selective liberal arts college of almost
2,000 students located just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina. For its
size, Davidson has been fairly progressive in the field of open education.
In 2015, their Library and Center for Teaching & Learning began offering
Open Educational Resources and Open Pedagogy Stipends. This program
awarded $500 to five faculty interested in integrating OER into their fall
2016 classes (Center for Teaching & Learning, 2016).

    Duke University is a private research university of over 14,800 un-
dergraduate and graduate students located in Durham, North Carolina.
While the Duke University Libraries have been active in scholarly com-
munication including the management of the University's institutional
repository and offering funding to support faculty open access publica-
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  311

tions, they had done very little in the realm of strategic OER program-
ming prior to this project.

    Furman University is an undergraduate liberal arts university located
in Greenville, South Carolina serving 2,700 students. While Furman Li-
braries have been actively involved in other scholarly communication ini-
tiatives including the management of the University's institutional repos-
itory and the administration of the University's Open Access Fund, they
had done virtually nothing related to OER prior to this project.

    Johnson C. Smith University is a historically black college and uni-
versity (HBCU) serving approximately 1,350 students in Charlotte, North
Carolina. The library has a strong reputation of collaboration with faculty;
however, they had very little hands-on experience with OER prior to this
project.

    In the spring of 2016, the TDEL library directors approved the cre-
ation of a collaborative OER pilot program for academic year 2016-17.
The OER pilot program was developed to have two major elements: a
Train the Trainer Workshop and a Faculty OER Review Program. The
budget for the program was $12,800 with $10,000 earmarked for faculty
stipends. The program had the following goals:

· Increase knowledge of OER among librarians;
· Increase awareness of OER among faculty on campus;
· Assess campus knowledge and climate regarding open access and

    OER;
· Inform the development and/or expansion of OER initiatives sup-

    ported by the libraries.

Train the Trainer Workshop
As noted above, an important goal of this program was to increase knowl-
edge and experience of OER among the Duke-endowed librarians. To that
end, they organized a Train the Trainer Workshop where an OER expert
educated the librarians on the benefits and limitations of open resources,
offered hands-on experience with locating and evaluating OER, provided
tips for engaging faculty, and facilitated a brainstorming session on imple-
menting a successful faculty OER review program.

    Selecting an expert for the Train the Trainer Workshop was the re-
sult of interinstitutional collaboration. Each librarian conducted research
312  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

to identify possible candidates to lead the workshop. This list of candidates
was then discussed and decided over the phone. William Cross, Director
of the Copyright and Digital Scholarship Center at North Carolina State
University (NCSU), was chosen. His knowledge and expertise in imple-
menting the Alt-Textbook Project at NCSU was a contributing factor in
his selection (North Carolina State University, 2017). Because he was lo-
cated in the Carolinas, like the other institutions, it was an added benefit
that he had familiarity and a strong frame of reference for the Duke-en-
dowed libraries.

    Two librarians from each institution attended the workshop, which
was held in the James B. Duke Memorial Library of Johnson C. Smith
University. Having two librarians in attendance was extremely benefi-
cial. First, it increased the amount of cross-collaboration and knowledge
sharing within and between the institutions. Second, it allowed for a
more distributed workload in implementing and running the OER fac-
ulty review programs at each local institution. Each of the librarian
participants had other duties and responsibilities within their libraries.
At the same time, none of the libraries had dedicated staffing to sup-
port open education initiatives, making it even more imperative to build
expertise and support across neighboring institutions. There were a
myriad of tasks involved in setting up the OER pilot program, such as
training, logistics, outreach and promotion, budgeting, reporting, and
maintaining a commitment to the proposed timeline. Because of the
amount of work required and the limitations in staffing, having two li-
brarians from each institution allowed for a more even distribution of
the workload.

    In the workshop, Cross introduced the concepts of open education
and OER. He also incorporated an interactive exercise in finding, evalu-
ating, and using these materials by providing hands-on experience with
the OER websites OpenStax, Open Textbook Network, OER Commons,
and MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and On-
line Teaching). He then illustrated various models for establishing a
successful and engaging OER faculty review program, including the Alt-
Textbook Project at NCSU. He worked with the TDEL librarians to
create an action plan that defined the priorities and timelines for or-
ganizing the logistics of an OER faculty review program centrally and
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  313

implementing it locally. Cross concluded with a brainstorming session
on how to conduct an OER training workshop for faculty with tips for
promoting the program on each of the campuses.

OER Faculty Review Program Overview
The second component of the OER pilot program was a faculty review
program in which faculty were paid a $250 stipend to conduct a written
review of one or more OER. The faculty were not required or even
encouraged to adopt OER for use in the classroom. The goal of the pro-
gram was simply to introduce them to the concept of OER and allow
them to spend some targeted time assessing an OER to see how it might
work in their classroom.

    Supporting the creation of faculty OER reviews through stipends had
several benefits: it created an opportunity to start conversations about
OER on campus; it allowed librarians to build expertise in locating and
evaluating OER; and it provided faculty with hands-on experience using
OER. Finally, this program was a low-resource, high-impact way for the
libraries to slowly transition into campus OER support.

    The concept of implementing a review program as a first step in
OER support is not a new one. The TDEL libraries were inspired by
initiatives like the University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Network
review program (Senack, 2015) and the University of South Carolina's
SCoer! Awards (University of South Carolina, 2017) which demon-
strated great success in engaging faculty by paying them stipends to
conduct reviews of OER. The University of Minnesota determined that
awarding stipends to faculty willing to review OER eventually led to
more holistic faculty adoption. OER expert Ethan Senack (2015), writ-
ing about the Minnesota program, stated that "[w]hile the original
intent of the project was to build open textbook credibility through
reviews, it soon became clear that when faculty engaged with open con-
tent to provide a review, they were likely to adopt the open textbook
in their class" (p. 13). This model has been highly successful for the
Open Textbook Network (OTN), a consortium of over 600 campus
members working to increase open textbook adoption and access to
314  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

course material. While the TDEL libraries considered a consortial OTN
membership, both funding and time constraints were barriers to mem-
bership. The group ultimately decided that creating a similar internal
program and implementing it successfully would be a good first step to
potentially asking the TDEL libraries directors for additional funding
for OTN membership.

    In summary, even though other libraries had conducted similar fac-
ulty review programs, the TDEL program was unique, because it was
conducted collaboratively across four institutions with varying student
populations, faculty interests, and library structures. For the program
to be a success, it was necessary to establish cross-institutional program
features for standardized results and also accommodate individual institu-
tional customizations.

Cross-Institutional Program Features

Common Documentation
To incorporate both the standardization necessary for cross-institution
analysis and the flexibility of campus-specific marketing and data, the
group decided to develop base forms for program participation. These
base forms included the standardized elements in a format agreed upon
by the TDEL librarians. Each institution would then create a copy of
the forms to customize. Colors, logos, and identifying information were
customized to the individual institutions. If schools wished to gather ad-
ditional information, they added unique questions to the forms. Since the
core of each form was the same across institutions, results could then be
easily aggregated and analyzed.

    The base forms are publicly available in Google Drive for other insti-
tutions to copy, adapt, and reuse under the license CC-BY 4.0.

· Consent Form (Adobe PDF): https://bit.ly/2q5yNji

Faculty participants completed a consent form prior to official partici-
pation in the program. Because of privacy concerns, this form was not
created in Google Docs. Instead, it is a fillable PDF form that was printed
out and physically signed by faculty.

· OER Review Form (Google Forms): https://bit.ly/2ItHGtM
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  315

The review form was created in Google Docs, easily allowing the institu-
tions to make copies of the base form and customize as needed.

· Stipend Form (Microsoft Word): https://bit.ly/2q8wFao

Stipends were paid by the Duke University Libraries Business Services
which preferred stipend forms formatted in Microsoft Word.

· Feedback Survey (Google Forms): https://bit.ly/2Iw0dWb

The feedback form was created in Google Docs, easily allowing the insti-
tutions to make copies of the base form and customize as needed.

Institutional Review Board (IRB)
In keeping with research best practices, prior to launching the OER fac-
ulty review program, the librarians applied for Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approval through Furman University. Originally, the application
was submitted as Exempt Status, because the review form was similar in
nature to a survey, and because the information being collected was not
deemed by the librarians to pose any potential risks. However, after re-
viewing the application, the IRB requested it be resubmitted as Expedited
Review. It is important to note that an IRB at a different institution may
have come to a different conclusion and determined that Exempt Status
was sufficient.

    As part of the Expedited Review proposal, the librarians were re-
quired to address the following: a thorough rationale for the program,
complete copies of all four forms, detailed procedures and methodolo-
gies, privacy and security of the research, and potential risks to partic-
ipants. One of the major concerns expressed by the IRB related to the
level of personally identifiable information that could be publicly in-
cluded with the faculty reviews. Three out of the four institutions were
small in size and the Board was concerned that individual faculty mem-
bers could be easily identified due to limited demographic information.
Given the concerns, the librarians updated the consent form to allow
faculty to choose the level of personally identifiable information they
were willing to share. The Board also required that the consent forms be
paper-based (rather than a Google Form) and stored off-line to protect
participant privacy.
316  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    The IRB process was a new one for the Furman librarians who took
the lead in conducting this portion of the project. As such, they were re-
quired to go through extensive training on IRB procedures, and also had a
much greater learning curve in understanding and completing the appli-
cation. This process added several weeks onto the faculty review program.
Because IRB approval was not built into the initial timeline, it did delay
the launch of the program by a week. However, approval was well worth
the delay because it enabled the librarians to publish and present on the
results of the faculty review program.

Faculty Participant Requirements
Faculty participants from all the TDEL institutions went through essen-
tially the same process, although its implementation differed slightly from
institution to institution.

    The format of the consultation was the most varied part of this
process. In some cases, workshops were used to allow multiple faculty to
be introduced to OER and the program process simultaneously. In other
cases, the specific interest of a faculty member coupled with the diffi-
culty of scheduling group meetings led to one-on-one consultations. In
all formats, the consultation included: an overview of OER, particularly
licensing; a discussion of the review criteria; and an introduction to plat-
forms and sites designed for OER discovery.

    As required by the IRB, all participants completed a hard copy consent
form to participate. This detailed the program and allowed participants
to indicate what level of identifying information they would allow to be
included in any written or publicly available materials resulting from the
study. The form also indicated the title and URL for all OER to be re-
viewed. Faculty were allowed to choose one large curricular component,
such as an online course or textbook, or several small components such as
videos or content modules.

    A standardized review form was utilized across all four institutions.
The first section covered basic demographics and contact information.
The second section asked for basic metadata about the OER, including li-
cense and content level. The main body included a professional review
that was based on the BCcampus OER review criteria (BCcampus, 2013).
Faculty ranked and commented on the following areas:
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  317

    A fourth section completed the survey with a personal review where
faculty reflected on strengths and weaknesses of the OER as well as how
the resource might be used in their own teaching.

    Once the completed review was received by librarians at the faculty
member's home institution, they were directed to the Business Services
Office at Duke University which collected the sensitive information re-
quired for issuing payment from the Duke Endowment funds. External
payment processes are complex, particularly when compensating faculty
at different institutions. It's important to plan ahead, document how the
compensation process will work, and think through the collection of
sensitive information beforehand to ensure that expectations of faculty
participants are clear.

1. Attend a workshop or one-on-one consultation with a librarian, which in-
    cluded identifying possible OER.

2. Sign a consent form to participate.
3. Complete a written review for each OER using a standardized form.

     · Comprehensiveness
     · Content Accuracy
     · Relevance/Longevity
     · Clarity
     · Consistency
     · Modularity
     · Organization/Structure/Flow
     · Interface
     · Grammatical Errors
     · Cultural Relevance

4. Submit personal information required for $250 stipend to be issued.
5. Complete a follow-up survey.

Participants who completed a review were sent a follow-up survey in early
summer after the program. This survey aimed at determining the success
of the program as both a specific OER review and a larger OER awareness
campaign.

    The first section asked participants to rank their experience and
knowledge of OER before and after the program, as well as reflecting on
318               OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

benefits and challenges to OER adoption in their teaching. A second sec-
tion asked about perceived OER knowledge and challenges at the depart-
ment and institutional level, including whether faculty would consider
adopting OER in their classroom. The final section rated the various ele-
ments of the OER review program individually as well as a whole.

    Questions about concrete textbook savings were not asked as this
project was an introductory effort intended to build knowledge and un-
derstanding of the concept of OER.

Individual Institution Customization

Even though the faculty review program was largely standardized, each

institution also had the flexibility to make its own customizations. Li-

brarians utilized their knowledge of successful communication strategies,

effective outreach tactics, and existing culture around openness on their

campus to maximize success. As previously mentioned, while faculty

across institutions were required to meet with a librarian to learn more

about OER, each institution could decide what that meeting looked like.

     At Davidson College, the program was promoted through the faculty

listserv, internal web pages, and an OER tab on the Davidson Open Access

guide (https://davidson.libguides.com/open/oer). Librarians met with in-

terested faculty in one-on-one consultations where they could tailor their

searches to each faculty member's interest, as this aligned with the small,

liberal arts college culture at Davidson.

     At Duke University, the program was promoted through the Center

for Instructional Technology (CIT) newsletter, a blog post on the Duke

University Libraries website, and a presentation at the CIT Showcase. The

program was also promoted to library staff through presentations at a staff

digital scholarship discussion group, departmental meetings, and a discus-

sion series about scholarly communication topics entitled "ScholComm

in the Edge." A website was also created: https://scholarworks.duke.edu/

open-access/open-educational-resources/.

     At Furman University, the OER faculty review program was pro-

moted at the New Faculty Orientation and an Undergraduate Evening

Studies  Faculty  Orientation.             An  OER  Guide

(http://libguides.furman.edu/oer) and information about the review pro-

gram in specific was created and posted to the library website. Because of
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  319

significant interest from these two orientations, the program was not ac-
tively marketed elsewhere. Group workshops to introduce OER and the
program requirements were held to reach multiple faculty at once. A few
faculty members who could not attend the workshop or joined the pro-
gram later had one-on-one consultations with a librarian.

    At Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU), there was no familiarity in
general with OER. Some faculty were using OER without realizing it,
however, when teaching with public domain materials and Creative Com-
mons-licensed journal articles. To publicize the pilot program, liaison
librarians for different subject areas attended meetings for their respec-
tive departments as well as meetings of the library committee and with
departmental chairs. A LibGuide was also created to assist in promoting
the iniative (http://jcsu.libguides.com/OER). Word of mouth about the
$250 stipend also assisted in recruitment and outreach efforts. Like David-
son, Johnson C. Smith found that meeting with professors for one-on-one
OER consultations was a better model than a group workshop, because
faculty could more easily receive individualized and modified assistance
for their particular courses.

    It was important to balance standardization across the TDEL group
with institutional customization. Others hoping to create a similar pro-
gram should aim to balance data collection across institutions with cus-
tomization to each institution's goals, mission, and culture in order to be
effective.

Results

OER Review Results
As of June 12, 2017, 28 faculty members had completed 37 professional
reviews of OER for the program. Johnson C. Smith and Furman had ro-
bust faculty response, with 11 and 10 faculty participants, respectively.
Duke and Davidson had a smaller response, with 3 and 4 faculty par-
ticipants, respectively, on each campus. Every possible rank of faculty
was represented across all four campuses (see Table 1), with Assistant
Professor and Instructor being the most common. The participants also
represented a wide variety of disciplines and departments, (see Table 2),
though the social sciences dominated the group. Also of note, 10 of the
participants taught in nontraditional undergraduate programs. Introduc-

    As noted previously, the professional review categories were de-
veloped from an OER evaluation rubric developed by BCcampus. This
same rubric is utilized by Open Textbook Library and other organiza-
tions, making it a common and accepted tool for evaluation of OER.

    Considering the variety of faculty and resources being reviewed,
the professional reviews consistently gave high marks across all cate-
gories (see Table 4). On a five-point Likert scale, each area received
above average scores.

    Faculty participants were also asked about how they might use the
resource, with the ability to choose more than one option. Participants in-
dicated that they would not use the resource at all in its current form with
only four OER, with the majority indicating that they would use it as sup-
plementary material and several indicating that they would replace their
textbook with the resource (see Table 5). When asked about changes to
the resources, suggestions ranged from updating and expanding content
coverage to supplemental resources such as bibliographies, timelines, and
glossaries. With these changes, only two resources were still listed as not
having a potential use for the faculty member (see Table 6).

Feedback Survey Results
As of June 12, 2017, 23 faculty participants representing all four insti-
tutions had completed a program feedback survey (see Table 7). Paired-
samples t-tests were conducted to compare self-reported OER knowl-
edge and OER experience before and after participation in the review
program. There was a significant difference in the pre-program knowl-
edge ranking (M=2.22, SD=1.04) and the post-program knowledge
ranking (M=4.04, SD=0.77); t(22)=-7.59, p=0.01). There was also a sig-
nificant difference in the pre-program experience ranking (M=2.09,
SD=1.04) and the post-program experience ranking (M=3.91,
SD=0.79); t(22)=-6.72, p=0.01). This supports a finding that the pro-
gram met its stated goals of increasing OER knowledge and experience
on the campuses.
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  325

    Interestingly, while faculty ranked their own OER knowledge before
the program fairly low (Average rank=2.2; 1=None, 5=Expert), they per-
ceived the knowledge amongst their colleagues as moderate (Average
rank=3.2; 1=None, 5=Expert). Faculty participants also indicated that
they were more likely than not to adopt the OER they reviewed for the
program (Average rank=3.6; 1=Not at all, 5=Guaranteed) and to consider
OER in future course development/revision (Average rank=4.4; 1=Not
at all, 5=Guaranteed). The most consistent challenge to adopting OER
was time and discovering appropriate resources. The program itself was
well received, with faculty ranking indicating general satisfaction with
the review form and the entire faculty review program. The most com-
mon suggestion for improving the program was to increase recruitment
of participants.

Engagement Results
In addition to the quantitative outcomes, the review program had some
unexpected and exciting outcomes related to library and faculty en-
gagement. The new connections made between faculty members and
librarians were valuable, even at institutions that did not see high partic-
ipation in their review programs.

    While all of the library/faculty interactions were positive, some
faculty became incredibly engaged with OER as a result of their partici-
pation. At Furman University, one program participant was so interested
in OER, he began conducting research about OER in his discipline. He
developed a survey to determine the impact of OER in his discipline at
other liberal arts colleges. He also conducted informal research by teach-
ing one of his classes with OER and another with traditional textbooks.
He then surveyed the students throughout the semester to compare their
experiences with the course materials. Finally, he is actively partnering
with the librarians at Furman to create presentations and publications
on his research. At Johnson C. Smith University, a faculty member is
planning a new course on LGBTQ and gender studies using OER ex-
clusively. She is working with the librarians to choose materials for the
class. Another professor plans to use the resource she reviewed as the
main textbook in her class beginning fall 2017.

    Faculty members from two different institutions were inspired to
author their own OER. At Davidson, librarians were embedded in two
spring 2017 courses (History 338: Berlin in Translation and Religion 278:
Islamic City) where students learned more about copyright, intellectual
property, and openness. One librarian at Davidson traveled to Berlin
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  327

with the class to teach students about open access and privacy as a result
of a Faculty OER Review Program consultation. At Furman University,
a faculty participant in the program conducted a review of a LibreText.
She liked the general content of the LibreText but felt that it needed sig-
nificant revisions and additions before she could use it in her class. Since
her review, she has been working with the LibreText website to create
her own LibreText for an upcoming class in the fall.

    Perhaps the most exciting outcome for the program was that it
sparked broader discussions of OER adoption within the library and at
the campus level. For example, at Duke University, the program trig-
gered interest in rolling out a larger strategy for the use of OER in their
MOOCs (massive open online courses). Through its MOOCs, Duke Uni-
versity has taught over 2.8 million students (Manturuk & Ruiz-Esparza,
2015). Adopting OER for MOOCs would have significant positive results
for these enrollees. In addition, the Furman University Undergraduate
Evening Studies (UES) program offers a small selection of bachelor's de-
grees to nontraditional students. Five of the faculty from Furman's OER
review program taught in the UES program. Their participation has led
UES directors to begin investigating the feasibility of converting the UES
classes to OER-only.

    All four institutions enjoy strong relationships between librarians
and faculty. The faculty review program served to strengthen these re-
lationships in several significant ways. The one-on-one consultations
afforded faculty and librarians an opportunity to learn about one an-
other's expertise more deeply. Librarians gained a deeper understanding
of the faculty members, their teaching focus, their classes, and their re-
search. Similarly, faculty members gained a greater appreciation for the
services, programs, resources, and research available to them from the li-
brary. For example, faculty who initially expressed interest in OER began
to have discussions related to the use of the library's print and electronic
subscriptions and databases to support their classes. Moreover, the rap-
port built among librarians and faculty enabled some faculty members
to begin collaborating with the library on unrelated, but equally valuable
projects. These conversations would likely not have occurred if not trig-
gered by the Faculty OER Review Program.

Lessons Learned
The TDEL OER pilot program was an experiment in interinstitutional
collaboration with the goals of increasing knowledge of OER among li-
brarians and faculty; assessing campus knowledge and climate regarding
open access and OER; and informing the development and/or expansion
of OER initiatives supported by the libraries. The pilot program achieved
these goals all while fostering knowledge sharing, cooperative program
management, and distribution of resources among the TDEL libraries.
The success of this program can be attributed to four major factors:

1. Building an OER support network;
2. Providing opportunities for frequent virtual and in-person collabora-

    tion;
3. Establishing a flexible timeline;
4. Managing expectations and goals.

Building an OER support network was a critical component to the OER
pilot program. The Train the Trainer Workshop served as a catalyst
for forming this network, building trust, and giving all of the librarians
a baseline understanding of OER. Through the workshop, Will Cross
not only provided participating librarians with a wealth of information
about OER, but also provided an interactive session allowing them to
brainstorm, share ideas, and build a sense of trust and community. The
workshop also included an informal lunch, allowing the TDEL librarians
to chat personally, thereby increasing their camaraderie. These in-person
interactions were a critical component to the success of their future virtual
interactions.

    To foster the rapport and collaborative spirit that was developed dur-
ing the workshop, it was important for the TDEL librarians to meet
on a frequent basis. These one-hour meetings were held every four to
six weeks virtually using the online conference software Zoom. While
a conference call would have sufficed, Zoom offered the added benefit
of virtual face-to-face discussions and screen-sharing capabilities. During
these meetings, the TDEL partners shared their progress in implementing
the OER faculty review program. They also brainstormed about next
steps, shared ideas about outreach efforts, discussed challenges, and cele-
brated successes. In between the scheduled meetings, the librarians used
Interinstitutional Collaborations to Forge Intracampus Connections  329

email and Google Drive to communicate. As a group, the TDEL librarians
found that having a support structure of eight librarians (two librarians
from each institution) was invaluable. Being able to share tactics for suc-
cess and brainstorm solutions to challenges collaboratively has enabled the
librarians to be more effective on their campuses.

    Another important component to the success of the program was
flexibility. As with any program, unexpected difficulties arose, so building
in flexibility during the planning process was critical. This was especially
true with the timeline. When establishing the timeline, the TDEL librari-
ans failed to take into account the need for IRB approval. Adding this step
to the timeline caused delays in rolling out the program, which was origi-
nally scheduled to launch at the beginning of the fall semester. Luckily, the
general flexibility of the schedule allowed them to easily adjust the dead-
lines to compensate for the delay.

    In addition to flexibility, it was also important for the librarians to
manage their goals and expectations. This was especially important when
it became clear that all four institutions would not be able to contribute
the anticipated 10 faculty reviews. This happened for a variety of reasons,
including faculty time constraints, lack of interest, and a lack of OER in
niche topic areas. While this was a disappointing outcome, the number
of completed reviews was not and never had been the only goal of the
program. The reviews were simply a means to broaden faculty awareness
of OER and start fruitful conversations about how the library could sup-
port teaching and research in nontraditional ways. Keeping this in mind
throughout the duration of the program allowed the TDEL librarians to
manage their expectations, and to celebrate their successes, even if those
successes were different at each institution.

    Due to privacy restrictions of the IRB process, faculty reviews were
not shared. Developing a joint repository of reviews could be a goal of a
prospective partnership; however, due to staffing and managerial changes
at our institutions, next steps for future collaborative efforts have not yet
been determined. One of the goals of this particular program was to spark
OER interest on our respective campuses and that objective was defini-
tively met.

    Libraries wishing to pursue a cross-institutional collaboration to fur-
ther their OER outreach should focus on not only creating efficiencies
330  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

but also community. Starting OER outreach with a faculty review pro-
gram can be a useful way to gauge campus climate while demonstrating
librarian expertise and building connections on campus. Pooling financial
resources and creating a shared OER faculty review program were an ef-
fective means for building a support structure, creating shared resources
and workflows, and collaboratively working toward a better understand-
ing of OER.

In this final section, we explore the shifting emphases in more mature
OER initiatives. The maturation of OER initiatives brings with it a shift
in focus from advocacy and education efforts to adopting or adapting ex-
isting OER for use in the classroom, and in some cases, facilitating the
creation and dissemination of new OER. In addition to their roles as ed-
ucators and occasional advocates, librarians have a long and rich history
of connecting researchers with relevant information, preserving mater-
ial, and facilitating access to that material. In the OER space, these skill
sets are being augmented to include the integration of existing OER into
curricula, and in some cases catalyzing the creation or adaptation of new
OER through innovative award programming and external partnerships.
This section explores the role of the library in adopting and creating OER
through a series of case studies. Readers are offered a variety of strategies
to support OER discovery, adoption, and creation within a range of insti-
tutional environments. Whatever the realities of one's home institution,
the pages ahead will offer transferable practices.

    The section begins with two chapters outlining the maturation of OER
programs at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University
of Oklahoma. First, Smith explores the mature OER program at U. Mass
Amherst, with a focus on developing partnerships to cultivate true open ed-
ucation. He offers an introduction to creating a library support program and
strategies for sustainably supporting it. Second, Waller, Taylor, and Zemke
map out the maturation of OER initiatives at the University of Oklahoma.
While the program at their institution is aided by substantial top-down sup-
port, the authors detail the creation of an OER position and planning com-
mittee, along with strategies for assessing OER technology and course design.
332  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Pivoting to a bottom-up approach to OER adoption, Ross and Francis
describe the approach taken at the University of Saskatchewan. Here, the
authors focus on cultivating individual champions to serve as instruments
of change. The authors describe their use of the university's institutional
repository in support of OER adoption efforts.

    Miller takes a similar approach, viewed through the institutional con-
text at Rollins College, a small liberal arts college in Florida. In his chapter,
Miller describes the OER initiatives in this environment, including the
unique challenges facing professors of art and art history, political science,
and physics.

    We end this section with a concrete example of the potential success
inherent in combining OER initiatives with library-based publishing pro-
grams. Batchelor details a case study in publishing OER through the
University of Washington and Reebus foundation. In this new space of
OER publishing, as is illuminated by the author, partnerships, both within
the institution and broadly, are critical, but librarians can and do serve as
important connectors and catalysts in these important partnerships.

Introduction
This article explores the development of the Open Education Initiative at
the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the earliest library-led
OER initiatives. The Open Education Initiative is an incentive program
that offers UMass Amherst instructors small stipends or grants to ex-
plore alternatives to high-cost textbooks. The origins of the program in
2009-11 through its use today are discussed. Strategies around funding,
campus partnerships, implementation, and assessment are considered.

Origins
In the winter of 2009, Scholarly Communication and Special Initiatives
librarian Marilyn Billings traveled to the ALA Midwinter meeting in Den-
ver. Along with former W.E.B. Du Bois Library Director Jay Schafer, she
attended a panel sponsored by the Association of College and Research
Libraries (ACRL) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources
Coalition (SPARC) entitled "The Transformative Potential of Open Ed-
ucational Resources (OER)" (Malenfant, 2008). The panel featured OER
pioneers Richard Barniuk, the founder of Connexions, now OpenStax;
David Wiley, a leading openness advocate and thinker; Nicole Allen, then
an organizer with PIRG (Public Interest Research Group), now Director
of Open Education for SPARC; and Mark Nelson, of the National Associ-
ation of College Stores, NACS. Billings and Schafer came back to Amherst
inspired by the panel and began to contemplate how they might introduce
some of the ideas at UMass Amherst.

    The idea of incorporating open educational resources (OER) into the
work of the library was a natural one. In 2006, Billings had launched
334  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

ScholarWorks, a Digital Commons-hosted institutional repository, to
house the scholarly output of the University. While building Scholar-
Works between 2006 and 2009, Billings reached out to college deans, the
Graduate School, Faculty Senate, and administrators about the value of
open access publishing of scholarly material. This became even more top-
ical as federal funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health,
began to issue open access mandates for all grants, which opened an op-
portunity to work with the Office of Research on guiding the campus
policy around open access.

    As Billings and the library thought about new ways to encourage fac-
ulty to consider using OER, SPARC hosted a member phone call with
Stephen Bell, the Associate University Librarian for Research & Instruc-
tional Services at Temple University, and Eric Frank, a UMass Amherst
grad and co-founder of Flat World Knowledge. At the time, Flat World
Knowledge was a publisher of free openly licensed textbooks.1 On the
February 2011 call, Bell discussed Temple's then brand new Alternate
Textbook Project, (subsequently renamed the Textbook Affordability
Program), which seeks to "encourage faculty experimentation and inno-
vation in finding new, better and less costly ways to deliver learning
materials to their students" (Bell, 2007). Temple's program offers "incen-
tive grants" of $500 for faculty to: "create an alternate to the traditional
textbook using a combination of Open Educational Resources (OER) and
licensed library content" or "adopt an existing open textbook and use it to
replace the existing commercially published textbook". Bell's program in-
spired Billings to create a similar program at UMass Amherst and in April
of 2011, the first round of grants for the effort, billed as the Open Educa-
tion Initiative (OEI), was announced and disbursed.

    It should be noted here that one of the driving forces for launching
the OEI in 2011 was the seemingly unending rise in the cost of textbooks
and the increased attention being paid to student debt. In addition to
the cost of textbooks, UMass Amherst also had a serious budget cut in

1 Flat World has since rebranded and focuses on low-cost customizable
textbooks and homework systems instead of free openly licensed ones.
Their new content is no longer published with an open license, but the
original line of open textbooks is still available in places like the Open
Textbook Library.
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  335

2008 that led to a larger than usual increase in the cost of attendance.
The institution was still feeling the effects of that in 2009-10. As Sara
Goldrick-Rab has so eloquently explored in her devastating study of the
cost of college for today's students, Paying the Price, students sometimes
drop classes, work an extraordinary amount of hours outside of school,
purchase course materials with student loan money, lack food and hous-
ing, or leave school with no degree and a generation of debt (Goldrick-
Rab, 2016).

    The 2002 UNESCO Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for
Higher Education in Developing Countries, which ostensibly launched
the current wave of the OER movement, recognized the potential that
OER had to overcome educational barriers in the developing world. The
report issued at the end of that conference pledged to "develop together a
universal educational resource available for the whole of humanity" (UN-
ESCO, 2002). It has become increasingly clear in the ensuing decade and
a half that this need is as great in the United States as it is throughout the
world.

Implementation
Building a grant program in a large academic library with no permanent
support staff was not easy. Fortunately, support for the program came
easily from Schafer and James V. Staros, the UMass Provost at the time.
Director Schafer was a strong supporter of OER (he was on the 2011
SPARC phone call) and convinced Staros to commit some discretionary
funds toward the project if the library would match it. Staros was a former
faculty member himself and was familiar with the burden placed on stu-
dents. Billings, with the help of a resident librarian (a program for early
career scholarly communication librarians), managed the mechanics of the
grant. She also enlisted departmental librarians to announce the grant to
their faculty and provide support once the projects began. Her vision was
to integrate OER work into the existing workflows of academic support
units within the library.

    To ensure that grants were selected by a cross-section of campus
support staff, an advisory group was created to help choose successful
recipients for the grant. The group had representation from Academic
Computing, the Center for Teaching and Office of Faculty Development,
336  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

and the Academic Information Technology Program. Collaboration was
a central tenet of the OEI and reflected the library as the hub of campus
support for open access projects and student success. What distinguished
the UMass and Temple effort from earlier OER projects was the fact
that it was led by the library rather than educational technologists, dis-
tance learning course designers, or international education groups, such
as had been done by previous early-to-mid aughts OER projects (Smith &
Casserly, 2006).

    An initial funding amount of $10,000 was settled on for the inaugural
round. $5,000 came from the Provost's Office and $5,000 from the library.
Compared to large, administratively-led, foundation-sponsored, campus-
wide open education efforts such as MIT's OpenCourseWare project, the
UMass plan was decidedly humble (Abelson, 2008). An information ses-
sion was held for prospective applicants where various aspects of OER
were discussed, such as available library and openly licensed material,
copyright, technology, and pedagogy. Representatives from the library,
Center for Teaching, and Academic Computing all offered their support
for prospective projects. Eight faculty members from the colleges of Edu-
cation, Humanities & Fine Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social and Behav-
ioral Sciences, as well as management, submitted proposals. In April of
2011, the first round of grant winners was announced.

    Initially, the OEI was focused on textbook affordability, which res-
onated with students, faculty, and administrators. Because of that, there
was not a strict emphasis on OER. Licensed commercial library materials
and services such as ebooks, article databases, reserves, archival material,
and interlibrary loan, were shared with grant applicants as well. When dis-
cussing library-licensed content with faculty, it is important to emphasize
that these are distinct from OER in that they are free for everyone at the
institution but not open and not free to the library. Many library materi-
als do not pass David Wiley's 5R test for OER: retain, revise, remix, reuse,
redistribute. Wiley himself believes that there is too much emphasis by li-
braries on affordability and not enough on the pedagogical and ownership
freedoms that OER affords (Wiley, 2017). If an OER or affordability effort
is led by a library, it is natural that library offerings would be discussed.
The high cost of textbooks is an easy entry point to begin talking to fac-
ulty about the other tenets of OER such as creating, revising, and sharing
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  337

openly licensed material in new conceptual ways. This can also segue nicely
into larger discussions about open access research and scholarship.

    The initial outreach strategy for the OEI was fairly simple. An infor-
mation session was held for all prospective applicants, advertised through
typical library channels such as posters around campus, a press release,
and website placement. These events were aimed not only at faculty
considering applying for our grant, but anyone on campus, including ad-
ministrators, interested in the concept of OER. The workshops consisted
of overviews of copyright, OER vs. licensed library content, technologi-
cal and pedagogical support, and more. This was also an opportunity for
the faculty to hear about each other's proposals and get ideas on how they
might structure their own.

    The core team then got together to review the applications. During
this first round there were not more applications than there was funding,
so the selection criteria did not need to be rigorous. However, as the pro-
gram has become more recognized, this is no longer the case. For this first
round, all eight instructors received $1,000 grants.

    Among the first OEI cohort were instructors from across many aca-
demic areas of the university: education, women's studies, art, animal
science, natural resource policy and administration, communication, soci-
ology, and management. The initial round of projects included: adopting
an OER Flat World accounting textbook, creating an open natural re-
source policy lab manual, authoring an introductory women's, gender,
and sexuality studies textbook, utilizing library databases for a language
arts course, and finding interdisciplinary OER case studies for a graduate-
level communication course. The projects varied between adoption, adap-
tation, and creation of OER, non-OER, and library materials. We found
that a majority of the projects were hybrid projects, meaning they used ex-
isting as well as newly created content.

    The program was a hit and ended up saving students approximately
$101,632 from 2011 to 2015 from an initial investment of $10,000. 2015
is the last year on record that any of the original eight faculty taught the
class that used the material developed with OEI money. Of course many
of these faculty have continued to use OER in their other classes and have
convinced colleagues to do the same or apply for the OEI. The second
round of grants was done in the fall of 2011. This time, the budget was
338  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

increased to $15,000. The cost was again split between the library and the
Provost's Office. For this round it was decided to offer more money for
larger classes due to the fact that the $1,000 grants were only attracting
small, upper-level classes. Based on the Provost Office's experience with
other grant programs, it was decided that a larger amount of $2,500 might
attract instructors from larger classes who felt that the higher amount was
worth their time and risk.

    The second round attracted 13 applicants from a diverse range of
colleges and departments including: agriculture, civil and environmental
engineering, public health, anthropology, chemistry, and geoscience. All
13 applicants were able to receive funding and, again, put forth a wide
range of projects that have saved students $167,964 since 2012. Some of
these courses continue to be taught; but it is often the case that an instruc-
tor will rotate out of teaching a class and we have not tracked whether the
following instructor has continued to use the open/free materials. How-
ever, we have found that many of the faculty who participate in the OEI
continue to seek out alternatives to high-cost textbooks in their other
classes whenever possible.

    In the ensuing six years, the library has orchestrated eight rounds of
grants, saving students a total of $1.8 million dollars.2 The schedule has
been slightly erratic due to staffing variables and funding. Some years, we
were able to offer two rounds, while others we only offered one.

    Our grantees are required to do the following:

· Attend a kickoff meeting where we answer questions, discuss open
    licensing and copyright, and outline technological, pedagogical, and
    research support.

· Circulate a qualitative and quantitative survey to all of their students
    at the end of the first semester they utilize the materials.

· Provide a copy of the revised syllabus or course outline used for the
    class.

2 This figure includes every instance of the class taught by the faculty
who received the funds. So if a faculty member from 2012 has taught a
class three times, we multiply the average new/used cost of the original
book times the total number of students in each of the three classes.
Other initiatives simply use an average of $100 for every book.
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  339

· Deposit any openly licensed material created into an appropriate open
    repository (e.g. UMass' ScholarWorks, Open Textbook Library,
    MERLOT (the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and
    Online Teaching), etc.)

· Write a final grant report that includes a narrative summarizing the
    challenges and accomplishments of their experience creating/finding/
    using the materials, the impact on their teaching, the impact on stu-
    dents and their performance, and lessons learned.

· Participate in long-term assessments of the Open Education Initiative.

Partnerships
Partnerships with other campus stakeholders are indispensable to any
OER effort. As I have illustrated throughout this chapter, it is through
these partnerships that we have been able to facilitate our initiative. There
is another chapter in this book, which I contributed to, that goes into
greater detail on campus partnerships, so I will give a cursory overview of
the partners utilized here at UMass.

    Instructional Innovation, formerly known as Academic Computing,
is the office that bridges the gap between information technology and aca-
demics. Instructional Innovation offers hands-on technical help for any
faculty wishing to utilize unfamiliar or cutting-edge technology in the im-
plementation of their project. Instructional Innovation also participates in
our workshop for grantees and helps select proposals.

    The Center for Teaching Excellence and Faculty Development
(TEFD) "supports the professional development of faculty across all career
stages and disciplines with programs and resources focused on student-
centered teaching, course and curriculum design, faculty mentoring, in-
tercultural competency, scholarly writing, leadership, and more." ("About
TEFD", n.d.) Among their many other offerings, TEFD aids faculty in
transforming classes when the infrastructure provided by a traditional
textbook is removed. TEFD also participates in our workshop for grantees
and has a member on our selection team.

    We partner with faculty by including one faculty member from the
Academic Information Technology Program on our selection team. Hav-
ing the perspective of faculty can help interpret ideas included in proposals.
Faculty also collaborate with the library on OER forums and programs.
340  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Throughout the history of our program we have had several panel
discussions, presentations, and forums where past grant participants have
discussed their projects. We have several OER "champions" on campus
who share their OER experiences with colleagues. Faculty have also sup-
ported global OER efforts by attending an on-campus OER workshop led
by the Open Textbook Network and authoring reviews of OER textbooks
in the Open Textbook Library.

    Students play a significant role at UMass Amherst. We are fortunate
to have a very active PIRG (Public Interest Research Group) and student
activists on the Student Government Association. Students help agitate
administrators, faculty, and other students to advocate for the use of OER.
Students in the MassPIRG chapter have met with the Provost to push
for more institutional support for OER, staffed information tables around
campus, and held public information sessions. They also held a rally in the
library lobby about OER that was covered by local print media. The Stu-
dent Government Association has passed resolutions in support of more
OER adoption and given an "OER hero" award to an instructor who sup-
ported their students by utilizing OER. A possible next step could be for
the Faculty Senate to adopt a similar resolution.

    Obviously, the program could not prosper without the support of
library and campus administrators. Funding and encouragement from ad-
ministration has enabled our program to thrive for the past six years.
With budgets always a concern, wider financial support from upper ad-
ministration has been cautious. In the future, there may be opportunities
to utilize student support funds for the development of OER as a driver of
student retention, recruitment, and success.

    Faculty support the OEI by participating in the program as well as
by acting as ambassadors for OER to colleagues in their respective disci-
plines. Faculty at UMass Amherst have encouraged fellow instructors to
apply for grants and have spoken at local and national events about their
use or creation of OER. In our physics department, one faculty member
began teaching an introductory physics course with the OpenStax College
physics textbook. He then encouraged two additional faculty to apply to
our initiative. They both moved to OpenStax and now the entire part 1
and 2 of introductory physics, featuring large, 150+ person classes, uses no
textbook.
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  341

    In addition to local on-campus partners, the library has partnered
with national OER organizations that support our local work. These
include the Open Textbook Network (OTN), Rebus Community, and
OpenStax Institutional Partners. OTN is part of the Center for Open Ed-
ucation at the University of Minnesota and supports OER with three
initiatives: the Open Textbook Library, Network, and Fellowship. UMass
Amherst is a dues-paying member of the Network.

    Being a member of the OTN has been beneficial for several reasons.
In addition to a day-long workshop for librarians and faculty, we have
participated in a pilot project to facilitate the development of open text-
books with Pressbooks and the Rebus Community. Pressbooks is a Word-
Press-based open source platform for presenting online texts in a "book-
like" way. It also allows readers to download texts in multiple formats
such as PDF, mobi, epub, XHTML, and more. The Rebus Community is a
"non-profit organization developing a new, collaborative process for pub-
lishing open textbooks, and associated content. Rebus is building tools and
resources to support open textbook publishing, and to bring together a
community of faculty, librarians, students and others working with open
textbooks around the world" (Rebus Community, 2017). It is through
these local and national partnerships that we are able to provide high-
quality support for OER initiatives.

Assessment
Although not at the top of everyone's planning list, assessment is a key
element of any OER initiative. Data gathered through assessment can
illustrate to library and campus administrators that an investment of re-
sources in OER is a sound financial and pedagogical decision. Even if the
resources aren't immediately available to process and analyze the data, it
should be gathered at the beginning of any initiative for future exami-
nation. The more data collected, the more opportunities to illustrate the
success of a program and share local results with national OER assessment
efforts.

    As the OEI developed over time, we amassed lots of qualitative and
quantitative data. Initially, not much had been done to analyze it. This
was mostly due to the constraints put on the project by the lack of a
full-time position. Once that position was filled, we were able to look at
342  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

the data and gather more. We instituted some of the principles of the
COUP Framework. COUP stands for costs, outcomes, usage, and percep-
tion. The COUP Framework was conceived of by David Wiley, Lance
Fischer, and John Hilton III of the Open Education Group. The COUP
Framework is an "approach to studying the impact of open educational
resource...in secondary and post-secondary education" (Open Education
Group, n.d.). The COUP looks at the financial impact of OER on stu-
dents, the learning impacts of OER, the use/reuse of OER by students and
faculty, and student and faculty perceptions of OER. Although the frame-
work is primarily intended to analyze OER, we use it to assess our hybrid
OER/free/low-cost materials approach.

    As part of the application process, we ask faculty to include the title
and average new/used cost of the current class textbook and the ap-
proximate number of students that will be in the class. Following the
completion of the first semester using the OER/low-cost materials, we
acquire the precise number of enrolled students from the online course
catalog and multiply that by the average cost of the textbook to determine
the money potentially saved by students. We have calculated this for all of
the classes we've funded since 2011. We also add in cumulative data for
each class over time. So if a class stopped using a $140 textbook in 2014
and has been taught twice since then, we multiply $140 times the number
of students in all three instances of the class taught by the funded instruc-
tor.

    All funded faculty are required to write a final 1-3-page grant report
following the completion of their first semester using the materials they
used or created. This report allows us to gather qualitative information on
how the faculty used the materials as well as their perceptions of the effec-
tiveness, coverage, rigor, and format of OER. We continue to engage with
faculty over time by periodically sending out electronic surveys to gather
their longitudinal perceptions of OER and their sense of student engage-
ment with the material. We ask them if they have continued to use the
material developed with the grant, used OER in other classes, converted
colleagues to OER, and more. This helps us measure whether opinions
and perceptions of OER among our grantees change over time.

    We also survey students in the classes that we fund. We gather data
on student perceptions of the OER/free/low-cost materials used in the
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  343

class. We ask what the students think about the quality of the materials
and how they compare to traditional materials as well as their level of
engagement in the course. We also ask the students about their general at-
titudes and behaviors around textbook purchasing such as what they do to
avoid buying textbooks, how much they spend, and how the cost of text-
books has impacted their academic choices. We use this data mostly for
advocacy with faculty and administrators.

    We have compared results on the local Student Response To Instruc-
tion forms, which are filled out by students every semester, for classes
before and after our initiative was introduced. Our data mostly mirrors
data collected by the Open Education Group, which shows that students
perform as well academically, if not better, in classes where access to the
learning material is not hindered. In the future, we plan on doing more in-
vestigation into academic outcomes by comparing drop rates, graduation
rates, and number of students receiving a C or better, in OER and non-
OER classes.

Obstacles
As originally conceived, the UMass OEI was an experiment. It has essen-
tially existed in beta form since 2011. This, of course, has positive as well
as negative consequences. This next section attempts to address some of
these, so one can potentially avoid some of the same pitfalls.

Staffing
Staffing can be one of the most challenging obstacles when managing a
successful OER program in a library. Although elements of OER-related
work can be found in many library areas like research support, reserves,
acquisitions, archives and special collections, and scholarly communica-
tion, there are very few full-time staff devoted to OER. Here at UMass,
the program was begun by the head of the Scholarly Communication de-
partment, who also managed the institutional repository, served on sev-
eral internal and external committees, and was responsible for additional
administrative tasks that did not allow the amount of time needed to ad-
minister an OER program. Luckily, the library had a resident librarian
program, which funded recent graduates of library school to have real-
world library experiences. These emerging professionals were enlisted to
help with the administrative burden of managing the Open Education Ini-
344  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

tiative by tracking data, communication, arranging publicity and events,
and supporting faculty once the projects were initiated.

    We were fortunate to have the resident program, but the success of
the initiative forced the library to commit to supporting it in a more sub-
stantive way with permanent staffing in the spring of 2015. At this point,
my position in Special Collections and University Archives was temporary
and the library had decided to make a stronger commitment to support-
ing OER work. I was asked to consider moving into a permanent position
that would be dealing with all things OER, in addition to other scholarly
communication-related work. I accepted the position of the Digital Pro-
ject Manager, which became, in essence, an OER librarian.

    The evolution from temporary to full-time staffing was due in no
small part to the dogged advocacy efforts of Marilyn Billings and Library
Director Jay Schafer. Without their belief in the centrality of the library's
role in this emerging field, it may have not survived past the pilot phase.

    It is true that we are born of our own circumstances and that not
every academic library has the resources to do what we have done. How-
ever, our experience has shown that if at least one person in the library
is passionate about starting an OER initiative, and can garner administra-
tive support for a pilot, and is successful, the benefits of the program will
become evident and illustrate the clear need for more institutional pro-
grammatic support.

Grant Administration, Faculty Awareness, and
Accountability
With the improvisational nature of the UMass OEI comes a fair amount
of experimentation with how to administer a grant. Questions about the
timing of funds, what the funds can be used for, and accountability all
need to be addressed. Having a partner in the library business office is
a must. The library business office will often be the ones who disburse
money and will need to know when to transfer the funds, to whom, and
how. Budget cycles must also be considered when planning the timing of
a grant. Being in communication with the business office, the dean of the
library, and your department is the best way to keep everyone in sync.

    Anticipating potential issues with grant proposals can help make fac-
ulty proposals a success. Although the majority of our projects have run to
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  345

completion, a few have either not followed the original proposal in some
way or have not happened at all. Out of the 60+ faculty who have par-
ticipated in our initiative since 2011, only one received funds and did not
complete their project. Faculty become very reliant on commercial text-
books to form the skeleton of their classes and sometimes don't anticipate
the fallout of removing it. Some proposals fail or alter after negative stu-
dent feedback during the implementation semester.

    Sometimes, while preparing their proposal, faculty will do a cursory
search of the available material and once they actually start working on
the grant, find it challenging to find appropriate open or library material.
We also find that faculty have not thought through, or are unaware of,
the differences between fair use, the public domain, Creative Commons-
licensed material, free web content, and "free" library content. They also
don't necessarily know how copyright affects the 5 Rs.

    One way to address these issues is to hold information sessions for ap-
plicants before the grant deadline or afterwards for grantees. Alternately,
a one-on-one meeting can be held to tease out ambiguous language in
proposals or explain misunderstandings. Asking the right questions on
the proposal form is also important. We have oftentimes been able to
meet with faculty in advance to help them shape their proposals. This
always clears up misunderstandings and tempers expectations. The pro-
posal process must force the faculty members to think through the conse-
quences of their ideas clearly and cohesively.

Sustainability
Building a successful and sustainable OER program can mean different
things to different institutions. What works for a statewide initiative with
government funding will not work for a one-person program at a com-
munity college. Therefore, it is hard to define what a sustainable OER
program looks like for everyone. Funding for our program has lasted six
years so far, but could be cut at any point during an inevitable budget
shortfall or financial crisis. Funding has fluctuated between the Provost's
Office, donations from the Friends of the Library, the Center for Teaching
and Faculty Development, and more recently, a dedicated line item in the
yearly library budget. The initiative has been very successful with partici-
pants, students, and administrators, but that is no guarantee of longevity.
346  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Other obstacles to sustainability facing innovative initiatives like OER
include some of the antiquated support systems currently available on
college campuses. Donna Desrochers of the RPK Group, an education
consulting firm, has spoken about this issue. She finds that although open
to innovation, many campuses lack the organizational structure to sustain
it. Funding models in higher education are outdated and not designed to
incentivize innovation. There is a general lack of appropriate data systems
to track the impact of innovative projects. Desrochers recommends sev-
eral strategies for combating some of these barriers:

· Ensure stakeholders understand that OER is not just a "grant" or
    short-term initiative, but another tool to support student success.

· Communicate timeframes for achieving success.
· Begin planning early on to fund ongoing cost of supporting OER. Per-

    haps institute a course fee.
· Identify opportunities to reallocate resources.
· Capture potential return on investment for students, the institution

    and other stakeholders (Desrochers, 2017).

Since the OER position was created in 2015, we have attempted to find
ways to make the program more sustainable. In late 2016, we wrote a pro-
posal outlining how the OEI could improve and grow. Writing that the
program was in a state of permanent beta, we presented the following five
recommendations to the Provost and library dean:

    1. Increase funding

    Many faculty on campus would happily create open textbooks for
use by their students for free if they were given the technical and fi-
nancial support that matched what a commercial publisher can provide.
Estimates of the costs associated with producing a new textbook range
from $10,000 to $1 million. Currently, with our funding structure, it is
a rare faculty member who is able to produce an open textbook for the
amounts we provide. We believe that if we were to offer one or two
incentives per year of at least $10,000 for the development of an open
textbook, there would be significant interest from faculty. The Univer-
sity Libraries have recently partnered with Rebus/Pressbooks and the
Open Textbook Network to provide technical support for the develop-
ment of open textbooks by faculty at UMass Amherst. However, this
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  347

partnership does not account for the time that actually goes into the
production of a textbook.

    2. Provide faculty release time to produce open materials

    According to the latest report from the Babson Survey Research
Group on open textbooks, a significant obstacle to the adoption/creation
of OER by faculty is time (Allen & Seaman, 2016). If faculty were given
release time for the production of OER, it would eliminate this barrier.
Another barrier for faculty is that work on original OER, and teaching ac-
tivity in general, is minimized during the promotion and tenure process,
especially at research institutions. If this were to change, we believe it
would stimulate further work in the field. We acknowledge that this is
more of a culture shift, but it is worth mentioning.

    3. Develop a campus-wide advisory group

    To reach the wider campus and increase its profile, the Open Educa-
tion Initiative must create a campus-wide advisory group that consists of
representatives from the student body, administration, the library, faculty,
and University Press. This will not only highlight the support of the cam-
pus for the goals and mission of the OEI, but it will position us to broaden
the initiative across the entire UMass system in the future. This will put us
in line with other system-wide efforts such as Affordable Learning Geor-
gia, California State University System, Open Oregon, and BCcampus in
Vancouver, which according to a recent report from OpenStax are among
the colleges that have saved their students the most during the 2015-16
academic school year (Ruth, 2016).

    4. Change funding structure

    To maximize the funds allotted to the OEI, we suggest offering four
categories of grants based on the scope of the project. Typically, OER fall
into three categories (adopt, adapt, or create). Adopt is simply the process
of adopting an existing OER as is. Adapting is a hybrid approach in which
one takes elements of multiple OER and constructs, or remixes, a cohe-
sive corpus of material. Creation is the creation of OER from scratch. The
fourth category is for projects that don't fit neatly within any of the other
three categories.

· Category 1: Adopt--Redesign course to incorporate an existing open
    textbook or open course content: $500.
348  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

· Category 2: Adapt--Combine existing OER with new open content to
    bridge gaps in available resources: $1,500.

· Category 3: Create--Create a new open educational resource or open
    course when there are currently no sufficient OER available to meet
    learning objectives. Range: $2,500-$10,000+.

· Category 4: Other--Projects not covered in any of the above: $TBA.

Many of our prior grants utilized library subscription materials in con-
junction with other materials like blogs, websites, podcasts, and maybe
some OER. These types of projects are not always considered open by the
standard 5R definition and usually can't be shared with others outside of
the university. However, we have funded them because they are free or
low cost and therefore fit within the larger goal of the OEI to reduce costs
for students. Additionally, many faculty still require incentives to rework
their syllabi. Although we should still fund these types of projects, we be-
lieve that these should fall within category 1. This then allows us to focus
the funding on projects that are more fully "open." Projects that aim to
simply use existing library databases and other purchased materials can be
funneled into the existing support infrastructure in the library and forgo
funding.

    5. Target Gen Eds

    During the spring 2013 and 2016 grant rounds, we sought to target
general education classes as an experiment. This reduced the number of
applicants, but, once the projects are implemented, will impact more stu-
dents. Many of the general education classes at UMass Amherst are large
introductory courses that are geared towards non-majors. These types of
classes are more likely to have quality OER available to them. In a recent
study of UMass Amherst Gen Ed classes, we found a majority (26%) used
commercial textbooks. It makes sense to target these specific classes, where
there is a higher chance of OER being available. We would encourage all
Gen Ed faculty to adopt existing free library resources, but would focus our
funds towards those that wanted to develop, remix, or use open materials.

    Of the five recommendations, only two were implemented during the
spring 2017 grant round. We were able to secure some additional fund-
ing from the Provost's Office in order to offer one $10,000 grant to a
faculty member who wrote a proposal to author an open textbook on
Seeking Alternatives to High-Cost Textbooks  349

radical social theory and we changed the funding structure to an adopt,
adapt, create model, to shift the focus towards OER and away from li-
brary material. We plan on continuing to advocate for the other three
recommendations and have discussed the possibility of creating a UMass
system-run program that would provide funding and facilitation for the
Amherst, Worcester, Dartmouth, Boston, and Lowell campuses.

    Another area of future exploration for us will be the creation of a
campus-wide OER policy. An OER policy can be a key ingredient in in-
stitutionalizing and sustaining OER across campus. Similar to an open
access policy, it can serve the dual purposes of acquiring buy-in from a
large swath of instructors and administrators and open up an opportunity
to promote and enshrine the culture of OER within campus departments,
Faculty Senate, the board of trustees, and state legislators. Lumen Learn-
ing, the OER course development company, has created an OER policy
development tool on their website that allows anyone to choose one
of several policy templates to customize for your environment (Lumen
Learning). For OER to grow, it must move out of the grassroots and into
the firmly rooted peaks of campus administration.

Conclusion
Having the vantage point of six years allows the UMass Amherst Libraries
to look back at the successes, missed opportunities, and unforeseen pitfalls
of their OER/affordability initiative. The overriding philosophy has al-
ways been improvisational. An idea may start one way, but will often
respond to feedback or the changing campus and industry environment.
The people served by OER, faculty, students, and administrators, are al-
ways exploring new ways of teaching, learning, and "administering," so
librarians must be prepared to respond. Whether one is planning an ini-
tiative for the first time, or is expanding an existing one, I hope the efforts
of UMass Amherst will provide inspiration.

    Although much of what libraries do is support students and faculty
in their pursuit of knowledge, it is rare that they also help facilitate the
creation of new materials that can be freely shared with the world, open
new possibilities for teaching and learning, and remove a barrier for fi-
nancially disadvantaged students. This is what makes the future of OER
and libraries so exciting.

                                  Oklahoma's OER Efforts

In February, 2013, University of Oklahoma (OU) president, David Boren,
issued a letter to all OU faculty members highlighting the high cost of
textbooks, expressing his strong "support for the move to open access
materials in teaching and research," and a charge to carefully "evaluate
whether our textbooks and course materials add value to the educational
experience equal to their cost to our students." President Boren's letter
also announced the imminent hiring of one of the nation's first full-time
librarians dedicated solely to open educational resources (OER). Boren
recognized, as did many academic administrators, that college affordabil-
ity was becoming increasingly important to the university's efforts to
attract and retain students. The cost of textbooks, in particular, had risen
dramatically, and the OU community proved willing to rise to Boren's
2013 charge. This case study describes OU's OER initiatives that arose
from President Boren's charge from 2013 to the present--with a specific
focus on the Alternative Textbook Grant, which by August 2017 had
saved OU students over $1,000,000 in textbook costs.

OER Program Development as a Start-Up Initiative
The University of Oklahoma Libraries senior administration created
the position of OER Coordinator in 2013 and is believed to be the first
academic institution in the United States to dedicate a full-time librar-
ian solely to OER. The first coordinator was an instructor in the OU
School of Library and Information Studies and had a background in the
OER movement, having attended the annual Online Learning Consor-
tium/MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and
Online Teaching) conference (Online Learning Consortium, 2017), as
352  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

well as developing a learning object repository as a contractor for a
textbook publisher.

    This Coordinator developed a plan for the first year, which focused
on researching current OER initiatives at other academic libraries and
then building awareness of OER on OU's campus. At the time there
were only a handful of OER initiatives across the country. Fortunately,
they were well documented, and their organizers were willing to share
their experiences. These initiatives included those at University of Massa-
chusetts Amherst (Billings, Hutton, Schafer, Schweik, & Sheridan, 2012),
Kansas State University (Kansas State University Center for the Advance-
ment of Digital Scholarship, n.d.), and Open Textbook Network at the
University of Minnesota (Center for Open Education, n.d.-b). SPARC was
just beginning to develop OER as one of their three focus goals (Scholarly
Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition [SPARC], 2007), but their
support was still critical.

    OU's Alternative Textbook Grant program was modeled after the
successful initiatives at University of Massachusetts Amherst and Kansas
State University, and the University of Oklahoma Libraries (and particu-
larly the OER team) still owe a debt of gratitude to these programs today.
These programs, and subsequently University of Oklahoma's program,
were built with the goals of:

· supporting faculty in creating open content
· supporting faculty in adopting open content
· creating awareness of open materials on campus.

The OER Coordinator formed an OER Strategic Initiative Planning Com-
mittee to formalize the OER initiative in the OU Libraries planning process.
This committee of six was comprised of librarians and library staff who de-
fined the first year of initiatives and researched the most expensive and most
used textbooks held in the Libraries' textbook reserve program. The com-
mittee determined OU Libraries purpose regarding OER would be:

      to support the use of OER and affordable learning solutions
      (ALS) to reduce student costs. This will include the adoption
      of OER/ALS by faculty to replace traditionally purchased ma-
      terials and by students for study support.
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  353

The committee further developed the scope of the OER initiative: "This
project will focus on piloting sustainable and scalable OER/ALS adoptions
on campus. The project will focus on four implementation areas," namely:

· OU Libraries will support the development and use of OER and ALS
    to replace textbooks in the classroom, to save students money, and to
    give faculty more control over their educational content.

· OU Libraries will support the development and use of OER and ALS
    to replace course packs in the classroom, to save students money, and
    to give faculty more control over their educational content.

 · OU Libraries will work with the University College (University of Ok-
    lahoma, 2016) to identify appropriate OER as study aids for students.

· OU Libraries will provide an appropriate platform to support the dis-
    covery, creation, reuse, revision, remixing, and redistribution of OER
    and other affordable learning materials for faculty and students.

The committee also developed corresponding project deliverables and es-
tablished a timeline of spring 2014-spring 2015 for implementation.

    Recognizing the need to support the OER Coordinator's quick-mov-
ing start-up effort, OU Libraries hired a student employee to assist the
OER Coordinator. The timing was serendipitous; the hired student, an
undergraduate electrical engineering major, had made contacts in the li-
brary while doing class research on "openness" and Creative Commons
licensing. He was interested in technology to support open courseware
and through his research had become knowledgeable about open licens-
ing and the open landscape. His technical background, combined with
this interest in open education, made him an excellent addition to OU
Libraries and the OER effort. From January 2014 through October 2015
the OER team consisted of one full-time equivalent (FTE) (the OER Co-
ordinator) and a 0.5 FTE (the OER Student Assistant) who were solely
dedicated to OER.

    One of the first identified issues was a lack of knowledge about open
content on the OU campus. The OER Coordinator created connections
on campus to increase awareness of the rising cost of educational ma-
terials, as well as present possible solutions using both openly licensed
content and materials licensed through OU Libraries. Fortunately, the
use of openly licensed content was beginning to take hold in several key
354  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

strategic areas across the university: the Dean of OU's College of Arts
and Sciences had recently adopted the open textbook Introduction to Soci-
ology (Griffiths et al., 2015); OU's Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE)
was working on a MOOC (massive open online course) platform, Janux
(NextThought, 2017), and was encouraging the development and use of
openly licensed materials; and the University of Oklahoma Regents had
joined MERLOT as a Higher Education Partner (MERLOT, California
State University, 1997) with a faculty member from OU's Department of
Physics and Astronomy serving as the Project Director/Partner Liaison.
Yet these were isolated uses of OER, and there was otherwise a lack of
knowledge among the general faculty, including the library faculty, on
OER and its related components: Creative Commons licensing, finding
and evaluating OER, and "open" as a concept.

    Believing that faculty members listen and learn from their colleagues,
the OER Coordinator first began her awareness efforts by enlisting three
faculty members who were already familiar with open textbooks to give
a panel presentation at OU's annual Teaching Scholars Initiative in fall
2013, less than a month after she was hired. She also quickly partnered
with OU's CTE to design and distribute a survey to all faculty members
with the goal of identifying those who had been using open materials or
who were interested in knowing more about reducing the cost of ma-
terials for teaching and learning. Additionally, she continued to partner
with staff at CTE to support Janux (NextThought, 2017), by finding open
materials for faculty planning to teach in the platform. When the Janux
platform launched, many of the courses were taught using fully open ma-
terials that had been curated by CTE and the OER Coordinator.

    During fall 2013, the OER Coordinator also began to build awareness
among librarian faculty by working with the subject specialist librarians
in group and individual instruction sessions covering Creative Commons
licensing and the OER movement. During these sessions, each partici-
pating librarian was given a matrix of large OER repositories such as
MERLOT (MERLOT, California State University, n.d.), OpenStax CNX
platform (OpenStax, n.d.), OER Commons (Institute for the Study of
Knowledge Management in Education [ISKME], 2007), and the Open
Textbook Library (Center for Open Education, n.d.-a). In some cases,
more specialized repositories, such as ComPADRE (ComPADRE Digital
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  355

Library, 2003) and the Noba Collection (Diener Education Fund, 2017)
were provided. Librarians then filled out the matrix by evaluating the
quality and coverage of their corresponding disciplinary resources in these
OER repositories. This exercise achieved two goals: it enabled librarians
to become more familiar with OER repositories and the specific disci-
plinary resources held in each, and it provided the seeds for building an
OER-focused LibGuide to assist faculty and librarians in their selection of
OER and alternative course materials.

    In anticipation of the soon-to-be-introduced Alternative Textbook
Grant, the OER Coordinator developed the OU Libraries OER LibGuide
(Taylor, Waller, Zemke, & Biamah, 2017) and an accompanying blog
(Taylor & Zemke, n.d.) with the goal of making it easier for interested
faculty to find open textbooks and OER by subject and disciplinary area.
The blog was used to document OER-related matters, such as detail-
ing the LibGuide development process, recording searches and search
strategies for OER, publishing liaison librarian reviews of OER reposi-
tories, and posting interviews with OU faculty members currently using
an open solution for their courses. The latter strategy, specifically, was
a popular and engaging format in which to share faculty members' ex-
periences and illustrate the many achievable (and easy) ways to use open
content. The blog also gave the OER Coordinator an opportunity to
grow OU Libraries' OER program by further supporting the activities of
these faculty members.

    Additional outreach efforts during this early phase of the initiative in-
cluded events held during Open Education Week (Open Education Con-
sortium, n.d.):

· A "Waffles for Writers" event, which connected faculty with OER and
    OU's Writing Center

· Tabling events designed to raise student awareness of OER
· A Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon to improve Wikipedia content about

    women in the history of science. This event was a particular success,
    because of partnerships already established with the Writing Center
    and a faculty member in the Department of History of Science who
    provided extra credit to participating students.

Establishing the Alternative Textbook Grant
In spring 2014, the OER Coordinator introduced the Alternative Text-
book Grant at OU's annual Academic Tech Expo. The primary purpose
of the grant program was taken directly from the OER Strategic Ini-
tiative Planning Committee--to reduce student costs. The initial grant
program was extremely flexible, and the OER Coordinator was willing
to support projects as long as they saved students money. This included
the use of OER and library-licensed materials such as databases, ebooks,
and collections of items placed on reserve. The OER Coordinator relied
heavily on personal relationships to recruit applicants, and she contin-
ued to reach out to those faculty members who had already indicated
interest in using OER. For example, some of the recruitment targets
had responded to the Center for Teaching Excellence survey that had
been distributed in the fall; some had attended OER events; some were
already active library users, and others had been involved in OU's
Teaching Scholars Initiative. These faculty members were thought to be
most interested in new approaches to teaching and learning, so it was
thought they might also be most interested in transitioning from tradi-
tional course materials to OER.

    The Alternative Textbook Grant was designed to support faculty
members in finding and creating alternative course materials for their
classes. The amounts awarded in this pilot phase were between $1,200
and $2,500 and were designed to compensate instructors for the time
and effort it took to find, adopt, modify, or create new resources as well
as time and effort required to create accompanying slide decks, tests,
quizzes, handouts, and other ancillary materials. The initial cohort of
grantees consisted of five faculty members who were awarded a total
of $9,600. They projected that for one semester a total of 420 students
would be impacted, saving those students $57,975 in displaced textbook
costs. In actuality, $59,842 was saved the first semester of implementa-
tion. The terms of the grant required the alternative resource be used
for two semesters (the semesters did not necessarily have to be sequen-
tial, acknowledging that not all courses are taught every semester), and
the projected savings for two semesters for the initial $9,600 "invest-
ment" was nearly $116,000.
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  357

The Not-So-Terrible Twos
During the second year of the initiative, the OER team continued an
awareness campaign--now about OER in general and the Alternative
Textbook Grant specifically--and continued to look for additional strate-
gies to save students money. The first year's outreach had focused on
"likely candidates" and "low-hanging fruit," but it was now time to recruit
instructors who may have never heard of OER.

    Therefore, a key component of building awareness in the program's
second-year initiative was to go to the faculty members, instead of relying
on personal contacts. One successful outreach strategy was to meet indi-
vidually with faculty members, in their office, as a traditional publisher's
textbook representative might. Instead of representing a traditional pub-
lisher, the OER team members became the "Open Textbook Represen-
tatives." Prior to these meetings, the OER team would research existing
open textbooks and other OER that were applicable to the discipline and
the class taught by the faculty member with whom they were about to
meet. They would then go to the faculty members' offices with a curated
list of sources and perhaps a complimentary coffee.

    The OER Coordinator, where possible, attended faculty meetings to
discuss OER--even if it was for only five minutes. Developing, practicing,
and memorizing an "elevator pitch" targeted to every campus constituency
(faculty, administrators, students, etc.) in as many disciplines as possible
became important to this effort, because it was often necessary to quickly
relay the benefits of OER and open initiatives in very short conversations.

    Staff in the OU Libraries Circulation Department were already re-
ceiving a textbook list from the university bookstore in order to purchase
copies of highly used textbooks to place on reserve, a strategy that cer-
tainly saved students money. The OER team began using this textbook
list for an additional purpose--identifying the top 30 courses requiring the
most expensive textbooks. This exercise prepared the team for focused
faculty recruiting in the classes that would demonstrate the highest cost
savings for students if the expensive textbooks were replaced with OER.
The textbook list also allowed the OER Coordinator to glean additional
insight about assigned texts. For example, she could now easily determine
which classes were using a traditional textbook authored by an OU faculty
member or which classes were using "custom" books assembled by pub-
358  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

lishers. The OER team chose to forgo outreach to these faculty members,
for these would perhaps be more difficult conversations with higher bar-
riers. Instead, the OER team used the textbook list to focus on faculty
members who were assigning expensive texts but who would likely have
fewer objections and obstacles.

    Additionally, the OER team identified the most expensive course packs
(collections of articles printed and bound at a local copy shop), and analyzed
them to determine if they included materials that were available through
library databases. While other academic institutions may have had success
with this strategy, the second-year OER team did not. Many of the articles
were not available through OU Libraries subscriptions. Additionally, the
resources necessary to disentangle associated copyright issues prevented
the team from exploring this idea more fully until 2017 when OU Libraries
purchased a subscription to Leganto powered by Proquest SIPX, formerly
Stanford Intellectual Property Exchange (Ex Libris Ltd., 2017).

    In the initiative's second year, the OER Coordinator made the deci-
sion to partner with two existing organizations and, along with a handful
of other academic institutions, became early partners with OpenStax (Rice
University, 1999) and the Open Textbook Network (Center for Open Ed-
ucation, n.d.-b). Membership in these two organizations provided OU's
OER initiatives with the additional support and resources necessary to
grow the OER program. For example, OpenStax provided a textbook rack
and physical copies of several of their then-current textbooks. The OER
Coordinator used this rolling display rack at outreach events as a way
to increase awareness among students and as a way to demonstrate the
quality of open textbooks. Using the OpenStax books in this way also
clearly demonstrated that open textbooks were available in a physical for-
mat should students desire to purchase them.

    The Open Textbook Network's initial support included an on-site
workshop, which at the time was a half-day learning opportunity for fac-
ulty members and librarians. Staff from the Open Textbook Network pre-
sented the background and context for open textbooks, and they provided
the structure and incentives for OU faculty members to review open text-
books on the Open Textbook Library platform. This activity was extremely
successful. By allowing faculty members to judge the quality of open text-
books themselves, they confronted one of their preconceptions--that open
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  359

textbooks were not rigorous enough for their classes. Of the 18 faculty
members who attended the workshop and wrote reviews, 14 have gone on
to adopt, modify, or create an open textbook for use in their classes.

    The second year also brought the beginning of two important part-
nerships that continue today. As previously mentioned, OU's Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) had already adopted the OpenStax
book Introduction to Sociology (Griffiths et al., 2015) for his sociology
classes, which had approximately 300 students per semester. Using the
book over a number of semesters gave him the opportunity to compare
the open textbook to the traditional textbook he had previously used, to
learn how students used the open resource, and to determine if the open
textbook provided the same or better learning outcomes for his classes
(The University of Oklahoma, 2014). His experience and his students' ex-
periences were positive, so he was sold on using OER in classes where it
was possible. As the Dean of CAS, he could help advocate for the use of
OER among CAS chairs, directors, and individual faculty members. Even
better, he became the first dean at OU to provide matching grants for
CAS faculty members who received an OU Libraries Alternative Text-
book Grant. Doubling the amount of money available to grantees helped
motivate CAS faculty members to apply for these grants. In the third
year of the grant program, OU's Price College of Business joined in the
partnership by contributing matching funds as well. Since 2015, the Al-
ternative Textbook Grant program has had funds contributed from CAS,
OU's Business College, or both.

    The second year of the OER initiatives also saw a rise in the outreach
and support the OER Coordinator gave to using Wikipedia in the class-
room. Wikipedia allows students to contribute in a way that helps further
worldwide knowledge, instead of writing a term paper or capstone paper
that gets graded and sits on a shelf (or worse). Wikipedia for Education's
tag line is, "The end of throwaway assignments and the beginning of real-
world impact for student editors" ("Wikipedia," 2017), and Wikipedia has
enhanced their educational resources and tools, making it much easier for
faculty members and students to participate in a Wikipedia-guided and
structured course. Supporting faculty members on Wikipedia projects had
the added benefit of engaging subject specialist librarians in OER projects,
which until then had been relatively challenging.
360  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    The second year of the Alternative Textbook Grant saw an increase
in faculty grantees over the first year, with 17 participating faculty saving
students $274,000 in the first semester alone.

OER Initiative and the Evolution of Understanding the
Technology
When OU Libraries began its pursuit of increasing the use of OER on
campus, there was always a question about the form in which OER should
be delivered. Initially, most of the OER used on campus were created by
a faculty member at another university, which, for delivery at OU, meant
distributing open textbooks as PDFs. Yet from the first year of the pro-
gram, OU faculty pushed the bounds of available OER formats.

    In the first year of the Alternative Textbook Grant, one of the
grantees--a faculty member in OU's College of Engineering (now Gallogly
College of Engineering)--used his grant to continue developing a plat-
form he had created for his undergraduate engineering classes. This web-
based platform, OU Engineering Media Lab eCourses (Gramoll, n.d.), con-
tained resources on thermodynamics, statics, dynamics, solid mechanics,
and calculus. Through this platform he also delivered exams to his stu-
dents--students entered their responses into a web form using specially
configured tablet computers. This grantee used funds from his Alternative
Textbook Grant to purchase additional tablet computers necessary to
deliver these resources. Also as a condition of his award, the grantee fac-
ulty member added a previously absent Creative Commons license to the
eCourses site.

    Also in the first year of the Alternative Textbook Grant, another en-
gineering professor was awarded funds to implement an open textbook in
her thermodynamics class. She chose to modify existing thermodynamics
content available under a Creative Commons license. Instead of deliver-
ing the content as a PDF, she wanted to host the content on a website of
her own so that she could make immediate changes to it as she presented
to her students. She used her Alternative Textbook Grant to hire an ex-
ceptional student who had recently taken her thermodynamics class: this
student helped her edit the content of the openly licensed thermodynamics
books so that it would better fit her class. Because the original text had been
published on the web, it was copied as HTML, and it was in this format
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  361

that her student did the content editing. Many faculty members may have
an aesthetic in mind for their website; however, they often do not possess
the know-how to create such a site. This case was no different. Neither the
faculty member, the thermodynamics student, the OER Coordinator, nor
the OER Student Assistant had solid experience building the website envi-
sioned by this engineering faculty member. The OER Student Assistant set
out learning how to do so, and built an adequate website that served the
faculty member's needs and her students' needs. Even though the resulting
website was not aesthetically appealing or responsive to mobile devices, the
exercise taught two important lessons about OER delivery: 1) how to prop-
erly display equations on the web, and 2) creating websites from scratch to
host open content was not sustainable.

    Realizing that mobile responsiveness would be key to future OER
projects, the OER Student Assistant began to learn about responsive frame-
works and eventually applied Bootstrap, a popular responsive framework,
to the second iteration of the open thermodynamics book. Though this
made the content easier to read on mobile devices, implementing it on
websites built from scratch required far more individual attention than
could be given to a single project with the available resources. This proved
to be problematic if OU's OER efforts were to scale as hoped.

    Also in the first year of the Alternative Textbook Grant, a faculty
member in OU's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry received an
award to make his biochemical methods lab manual more accessible. Prior
to receiving a grant, he had hired a graduate student to create the lab
manual, which was created using iBooks Author. This yielded an attrac-
tive result, but such a solution made it only accessible to students who
owned Apple devices. Other students who were required to use the lab
manual had to borrow an Apple device from the Libraries or print the
content using an Apple computer. Those involved in the project deter-
mined that transforming the lab manual into a website would make it far
more accessible. Because a Bootstrap layout had already been built for the
thermodynamics book, it was decided to "simply" insert the lab manual
content into that same framework. Although the process was easier the
second time around, it was still too labor-intensive to continue providing
this service with the available resources; yet, it was too complex a process
to ask the grantees to do it themselves given the technical skills required.
362  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Not long after building these sites, the OER team discovered The
American Yawp, a "free and online, collaboratively built, open American
history textbook designed for college-level history courses" ("The Amer-
ican Yawp," n.d.). The OER team was inspired by its appearance and
interface. Until this point, they had only known WordPress to be used
for creating blogs, but The American Yawp definitely did not take the same
form as a blog. This led to an investigation of WordPress as a publish-
ing platform for OER. Applying what was learned from the previous
two projects, the OER Student Assistant made use of a MathJax plu-
gin (MathJax Consortium, 2009) for rendering equations from LaTeX
markup and applied a mobile responsive theme to a WordPress instance.
Given its promise, this approach was recommended as the preferred and
supported solution for the next Alternative Textbook Grant cycle.

    During the second grant cycle, a faculty member in OU's Department
of Biology was the first grantee to use WordPress as a publishing plat-
form. While he worked on authoring his biology textbook in Word-
Press, the OER team continued experimenting with WordPress by con-
verting the previous year's thermodynamics content and the biochemical
methods lab manual into their own WordPress site. These three individ-
ual WordPress sites were maintained by a single WordPress multi-site
instance managed by the OER team.

    Using WordPress as an OER publishing tool put the OER team one
step closer to an ideal solution. It allowed them to publish equations to
the web in an easy way--a feature that has become a litmus test for de-
termining if a publishing solution is worth pursuing. Publishing with
WordPress also allowed them to create their own OU OER-branded,
mobile-friendly theme and apply it to all the works they produced. De-
spite these features, it became apparent after one year's worth of effort
that WordPress might not be an ideal solution after all. Clearly it was
better than building websites from scratch, but modifying WordPress
themes was difficult, and some of the relied-upon plug-ins did not work
well together. Any change they wanted to make to a theme required
wrestling with "child-themes" and large stylesheets. More importantly,
using WordPress this way made the OER team the gatekeeper of content
hosted on the multi-site WordPress instance. Even though grantee au-
thors were given login information and all reasonable privileges to their
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  363

respective sites, authors would still contact the OER team regarding is-
sues such as adding contributing authors. While this problem sounds like
a very small one (and it was), the OER team did not want authors to
depend on them to access or otherwise manage their content. They felt
strongly that continuing to operate in such a way was antithetical to the
principles of OER and the 5R Permissions (Wiley, n.d.).

    During the search for a better way to author and publish OER,
the OER Student Assistant learned about a widely used authoring and
publishing tool, Pressbooks ("Pressbooks for EDU & Open Textbooks,"
2017). Because he was already experimenting with WordPress, investi-
gating Pressbooks was a natural next step--Pressbooks is a WordPress-
based publishing platform featuring the option to export its contents as
a number of different file types. Its ability to export content in this way
was attractive and would theoretically make content available and acces-
sible to as many people as possible, technically speaking. The OER team
believed Pressbooks might answer the question they had been asking
themselves, "What format will we officially support for OU-generated
OER?" With Pressbooks they believed they could support them all! The
OER team installed an instance of Pressbooks and began running tests
and evaluating the platform, including the litmus test mentioned ear-
lier, "How well does it handle equations?" Because they had encountered
math-heavy projects early in the OER initiative, they were attuned to
the challenges equations pose and considered it good fortune to have
faced these challenges so early. Aspirationally, they sought to incorpo-
rate the beauty and functionality of the equations in The Feynman Lectures
on Physics (Feynman, Gottlieb, & Pfeiffer, 1963) to the projects on which
they worked. Simply put, Pressbooks does not support the inclusion of
equations in all of its output formats. Because the seamless inclusion of
equations is foundational to OER, this did not bode well for the contin-
ued use of Pressbooks.

    Aside from its difficulty displaying equations, Pressbooks operates
differently than other WordPress plug-ins. For one, Pressbooks com-
pletely "takes over" the familiar WordPress interface. This, in and of
itself, was not a problem; instead the OER team was more concerned
with the difficulty this posed for our desire to modify its front-end
interface. In particular, OU's OER team did not appreciate the skeuo-
364  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

morphism apparent in Pressbooks' front-end interface. There is little
reason to force a web browser to behave like a book and appear "book-
like" to a reader. This, in combination with its clumsy way of displaying
equations and its too-imperfect pagination in other export formats,
closed the team's investigation into Pressbooks as a publishing plat-
form--at least for the time being.

    Having determined that Pressbooks was not the right platform and
still not entirely pleased with scaling WordPress implementations, the
OER team continued its pursuit of a better publishing workflow and next
explored Markdown (Gruber, n.d.), a simple markup language often used
in conjunction with a tool called pandoc ("Pandoc - About pandoc," n.d.).
Intended to be both easily read and easily written, Markdown's syntax
corresponds to the most common HTML tags making its syntax concise
and easy to learn. When composing documents in Markdown, the con-
tent is by nature separated from the styling. In contrast, programs such
as Microsoft Word require that authors compose and style documents
simultaneously. Separating content from style allows content to exist in-
dependently of any output format, which is well suited for OER. Again,
publishing OER in as many formats as possible is what OU's OER team
strives for. By composing their works in Markdown, OU's faculty au-
thors are, in essence, composing structured data that can then be made to
take the form of a website, a PDF, an epub, and many other formats.

    Even better, Markdown is easy to edit. Markdown files are flat, plain
text files which means they can be opened and edited in any text editor,
many of which are freely available. This is in contrast to open textbooks
distributed as PDFs, which can be difficult to modify. Because Mark-
down can be converted to a variety of formats, it can be thought of as the
"universal source code of open textbooks"--as long as an open textbook's
Markdown files are available, anyone has the ability to very easily edit
the textbook. Using Markdown to author OER allows the OER team and
their grantees to stay true to the fundamental to the tenets of OER, the
5R Permissions (Wiley, n.d.).

    Though it is easy enough to read during the authoring process,
Markdown is a markup syntax, so it is not intended to be read by end
users. In order to put Markdown into a more fitting form for readers
it needs to be converted. The open source conversion tool, pandoc, is
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  365

one of the most useful and extensible tools for converting Markdown
to more useful formats. Pandoc can convert and export Markdown
to all the same file formats that Pressbooks can--HTML, epub, mobi,
DOCX, and PDF. A drawback of pandoc is that it must be used via
the command line. This nearly made the OER team forgo using Mark-
down, as they knew their grantees would, in most cases, be unwilling
to jump over this additional hurdle. Encouraging them to learn Mark-
down seemed daunting enough; requiring them to use the command
line seemed insurmountable.

    Instead, in order to make writing Markdown as easy as possible the
team set out to create a better way for grantee authors to access and
use pandoc. In late 2016, the OER team built what is currently called
the Markdown Converter (Taylor, n.d.), a web interface to pandoc pack-
aged with additional tools and style sheets that make it ideal for quickly
and easily producing a variety of outputs from one uploaded folder. Au-
thors upload a zipped folder--containing the Markdown flat files along
with accompanying image files to be used in the open textbook--to the
web-based Markdown Converter, choose one or more output formats,
and select and preview a style sheet. The Markdown Converter then
quickly produces the properly formatted result in as many output formats
as selected. The OER team is piloting the use of the Markdown Con-
verter with instructors who received an Alternative Textbook Grant in
the 2017 cycle for the 2017-18 academic year.

Operationalizing the OER Initiative: Into Adolescence
The 2015-16 academic year brought changes to OU's OER initiatives. In
October, the OER Coordinator decided to pursue another job opportu-
nity. Because the OER program had now developed some legs of its own,
and because of changes to other OU librarians' job responsibilities, the
OER Coordinator position description was revised to encompass both
OER responsibilities and Scholarly Communication responsibilities--a
change that more closely aligned the role with similar job responsibili-
ties across the country. The new position, now called "Open Educational
Resources and Scholarly Communication Coordinator," was split 70 per-
cent OER and 30 percent Scholarly Communication and was posted in
early November 2015, around the same time the original OER Coordina-
366  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

tor left. A new OER Coordinator was hired in March but was not able to
begin working until late May 2016. This is especially remarkable because
during these seven months between November and June, the OER pro-
gram was run nearly entirely by the 0.5 FTE OER Student Assistant with
support from the Associate Dean for Scholarly Resources and Services.
While this undoubtedly slowed the program's forward momentum a bit,
the OER Student Assistant did an outstanding job of keeping the Alter-
native Textbook Grant program running. In April 2016 OU Libraries
awarded grants to 17 faculty members for 19 different OER projects. In
early June, the program "restarted" with the new OER Coordinator and,
by this time, the OER Student Assistant had proved to be such a valu-
able asset to the organization that he was hired full-time as one of OU
Libraries Emerging Technologies Librarian, devoting 30 percent of his
time to OER projects.

    The first order of business for the new OER Coordinator was to
personally meet with all 17 grantees in order to better understand their
projects, their personalities, and the support the Libraries could provide
to them. These meetings primarily took place during summer 2016. At
the same time, she began working on providing more structure to the
Alternative Textbook Grant. The program had done very well up to this
point, but much of the grant program's expansion had taken place organ-
ically and without clear guidelines. The new OER Coordinator wanted
to bring more standardization to the program, while still allowing it to
be flexible enough to accommodate as many projects as possible. This in-
cluded establishing a tiered service model that outlined the services the
OER team and subject specialist librarians would provide based on the
type of OER project undertaken by each grantee.

Formalizing the Alternative Textbook Grant
The OER team had always kept track of their grantee's projects, and the
new OER Coordinator determined these projects most often fell into
four general categories:

· Library resources: Those who used library resources to replace their
    existing, traditional textbook, often assembling a reading list or using
    an ebook with a multi-user license from OU Libraries collection.

· Adoption: Those who replaced their existing, traditional textbook by
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts     367

    adopting an existing open resource and using it as is, or using signif-
    icant portions of it and requiring minimal editorial changes.
· Modification: Sometimes called "adaption" or "adaptation," this cate-
    gory included grantees who made more significant editorial changes
    to an openly licensed resource. This sometimes included combining
    chapters from several different sources or adding a small amount of
    original content to an existing open resource so that it was tailored
    to their particular class.
· Creation: Those who created an original resource from scratch, which
    sometimes included heavily modifying content from an already exist-
    ing open resource.

The OER team decided to formalize these categories, with the under-
standing that some grantees may fall into more than one category. They
then determined the suite of services that they could provide for grantees
at each of the four levels. This enabled support services to be more fo-
cused, instead of attempting to support every project possible. It also
provided clear guidelines and expectations for the grantees. Of course,
grantees have the freedom to pursue whatever alternative textbook solu-
tion they prefer; however, the OER team could no longer guarantee that
they could support any and every solution.

    The services the OER team provided at each level acknowledged the
range of efforts in transitioning from a traditional textbook to an alter-
native solution and were as follows:

    The formalized service model also explicitly stated the terms to
which the grantees would agree. While the original OER Coordinator
had always required grantees to sign a memorandum of understanding
(MOU), those terms were not always clear to faculty members before
they received a grant. Beginning in 2017, recipients of the Alternative
Textbook Grant agreed to the following:

    To make these categories and services clear to potential grantees, the
OER team revised the existing grant application and moved it from a
Qualtrics-based survey to a Google Form for ease and access. The new
application linked to a LibGuide (Waller, Taylor, & Biamah, n.d.) that de-
tailed the new service model, and it asked participants to place themselves
in at least one category. The revised application form requested, among
other details, information about the applicant, the course, the resource be-
ing replaced, and the process by which the applicant intended to assess the
effectiveness of the OER used.

    Creating a formalized service model and asking grantees to place
themselves into a category, combined with the updated grant application,
also provided the OER team with an additional way to evaluate grant
proposals. For the first several years of the program when fewer faculty
members applied for grants, it was relatively easy to contact each applicant
and discuss their project well before the submission deadline. Addition-
ally, many of the previous grantees had come from personal connections.
As the number of grant applications grew, it became more challenging to
reach out to each applicant individually. This was also a partial drawback
of the new grant application as a Google Form--when the grant applica-
tion was in Qualtrics, the OER team was able to see who had started an
application and how far along they were in the process. With the move
to Google Forms, this was no longer possible. Therefore, the additional,
clarifying questions on the grant application allowed the OER team to bet-
ter understand applicants' projects, even when we had not heard about
them prior to evaluating the application.

    With a more formalized program in place, the OER Coordinator be-
gan a concerted marketing and outreach campaign. The 2017 grant cycle
kicked off with a panel presentation at the Academic Tech Expo where
the OER Coordinator moderated a session that included three previous
grantees and the Emerging Technologies Librarian working on OER.
This was the start of many presentations over the next several months
while the grant application was open--presentations in faculty and depart-
mental meetings, Deans and Directors meetings, Executive Committees
of Colleges, and for other university committees. Each presentation was
similar, but each slide deck was individually tailored for the particular au-
dience. For example, the OER Coordinator used images specific to the
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  371

audience, such as a photos of a department's home building when pre-
senting to faculty in a departmental meeting. Further, each slide deck
always contained general information about textbook costs, but they also
contained costs specific to the textbooks used in the particular academic
department.

    General "drop-in" information sessions were also scheduled between
the time the grant application opened and when it was due. These sessions
were held at least once per week until a month prior to the grant due date;
in that last month, they were held between two and four times per week.
Drop-in sessions were held in the main OU library, branch libraries, and
in departmental conference or meeting rooms across campus. The OER
Coordinator worked with the subject specialist librarians to schedule the
departmental sessions. None of the sessions drew large attendance, but
most sessions drew enough interest to warrant continuing them, and all
sessions resulted in making a personal contact with someone interested in
OER and/or the Alternative Textbook Grant.

    The Alternative Textbook Grant was advertised on a rotating header
on the home page of OU Libraries website, in addition to digital signage
throughout OU Libraries, especially in high-traffic areas. The OER Coor-
dinator crafted emails that subject specialist librarians could send to their
faculty members, either in whole or in part, and she ensured that subject
specialist librarians had the tools they needed to advocate and promote
the Alternative Textbook Grant. Information about the grant, including
dates for the drop-in sessions, was also posted in OU Libraries monthly
faculty newsletter and the OU Provost's weekly newsletter. The drop-in
events were advertised on the OU Libraries website as well, and the OU
Libraries Communication Coordinator used social media, primarily Twit-
ter and Facebook, to further spread the word across campus.

    One of the most successful outreach strategies was a direct email
campaign, which consisted of three different target groups: 1) faculty
members who taught classes that mapped closely with existing OpenStax
textbooks, 2) faculty members who taught classes with the most expensive
textbooks, and 3) faculty members who taught classes where transitioning
to an open textbook would make a high financial impact--classes con-
taining a large number of students combined with a relatively expensive
textbook. Each email was tailored to a specific faculty member, addressing
372  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

them by name and explicitly referring to the textbook they used. These
three campaigns, sent over a period of three weeks, generated grant ap-
plicants, and--more importantly--generated an increased dialog between
faculty members and the OER Coordinator. Faculty members were will-
ing to discuss their thoughts and opinions about OER, which often gave
the OER Coordinator an opportunity to provide accurate information and
to clear up misconceptions about open content. Creating, tailoring, send-
ing, and responding to these direct emails was time-consuming, but well
worth it for the increased dialog and applicants that resulted from this tac-
tic.

    Grant applications were reviewed by the OER team, which consisted
of the OER Coordinator, the Emerging Technologies Librarian working
on OER, and a new OER Student Assistant, hired in January 2017. The
Associate Dean for Scholarly Resources and Services also served as a
final reviewer. In an effort to formalize the evaluation process, the OER
team developed a rubric, which was later abandoned. The OER team de-
termined that since the grant applicants hadn't seen the rubric prior to
applying, it would not be fair to apply it to judge their submissions. There-
fore, applications were reviewed, and grants were awarded based on:

· The potential for student savings, which was the product of the pro-
    jected class enrollment and the cost of existing materials. OU's OER
    team calls this "impact," and higher impact classes receive more fund-
    ing.

· The frequency of course offering, with more frequently taught courses
    receiving higher funding.

· The overall impact of the project on open education. For example, an
    applicant creating an OER, especially one where there was an existing
    gap in openly available material, received higher funding than an ap-
    plicant using library-licensed resources.

· Scheduling: the course had to be scheduled for summer 2017, fall 2017,
    or spring 2018. Courses that occurred later than spring 2018 would be
    placed on the next grant cycle.

· Adoption date: with some exceptions, course material had to be cre-
    ated and/or adopted over the summer and fall of 2017.

· Applicants' agreement to the terms in the support/agreement chart.
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  373

Grants, including any matching or contributed funds from other colleges,
are paid in two installments; the first half of the grant is paid in the sum-
mer, and the second half of the grant is paid in the fall. Members of the
OER team work closely with each grantee throughout the year to ensure
they are making good progress on their grant projects.

    OU Libraries places no restrictions on how grant funds are spent.
Examples of how previous grantees have spent their funds include: sup-
plemental income, funding a student to help create open resources, pur-
chasing technology to be used in the classroom, and airfare and lodging
for colleagues to travel and collaborate on creating alternative resources.

    The 2017-18 grant cycle was the largest grant cohort, with 18
grantees representing 19 different projects across five colleges. With this
grantee cohort, OU has cumulatively saved their students $1,631,935
throughout the four-year existence of the Alternative Textbook Grant
program.

Growth Toward Adulthood: Next Steps
The OER team at OU has much to celebrate, especially the $1,000,000
milestone. But the celebration will be short-lived as the team looks toward
future growth of the program. Some of these plans include:

· Formation of an OER Action Committee: the original OER Strategic Ini-
    tiative Planning Committee was an internal library group, and it dis-
    banded after delivering on its original goals. Recognizing the need for
    additional collaboration, the OER team, with support from the Dean
    of Libraries, has formed an " OER Action Committee" comprised of
    stakeholders across the university. These committee members include
    representatives from the Center for Teaching Excellence, the College
    of Liberal Studies (which houses OU's online degree programs), the
    Provost's Office, the Disability Resource Center, Information Tech-
    nology, the Office of Academic Assessment, the OU Bookstore, and
    OU Press. Additionally, the committee will have a faculty member
    representing STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and
    math), a faculty member from the University Libraries Committee, a
    faculty member from social sciences or humanities, and undergraduate
    and graduate representatives from Associated Student Government.
    The OER Action Committee is charged with promoting the aware-
374  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    ness, reach, and uptake of OER at OU and will begin meeting in fall
    2017.
· Enhancing access to OER used at OU: The Alternative Textbook Grant
    program has enabled the use and creation of a great number of OER,
    and these resources have clearly saved OU students money. The OER
    team has stayed busy keeping OER initiatives running and enhancing
    its existing programs, which has meant it has been challenging to
    make OU-authored works available to learners across the globe. Too
    often grantees use their OER in the learning management system, but
    it is not shared more broadly. One of the OER team's highest priorities
    is to provide better access to these works through a dedicated collec-
    tion in OU's institutional repository, SHAREOK.
· Better promotion of our textbook on reserve program and ebook collections
    as alternative textbook solutions: Purchasing hardcopy textbooks of the
    most popular classes and placing them on reserve is neither a sus-
    tainable nor sought-after solution, yet it still helps save money for
    students. Unfortunately, not enough students are aware that they can
    check out textbooks on reserve at the Libraries. Additionally, like
    many, OU librarians are purchasing more ebooks. When licensing
    terms allow, the OER team would like to better market these ebooks
    to faculty members as low/no-cost solutions for OU students. While
    neither of these solutions fit the strict definition of OER, they do help
    lower the amount students spend on their education.
· Refining Markdown authoring/publishing workflow: As the 2017-18 aca-
    demic year is the pilot year for using Markdown for authoring and
    publishing, the OER team will be making adjustments and enhance-
    ments to the Markdown Converter and the ways in which they assist
    faculty members in its use.

In addition to these actionable items, the OER team has also been thinking
more philosophically about how it supports and advocates for OER in the
future. For example, the Alternative Textbook Grant gives preference to
authors who create original OER. These are the grantees who, generally,
receive the most money and support. But perhaps it would be wiser to pri-
oritize the adoption of already existing OER, which requires less time and
energy on everyone's part. Additionally, the team has begun to rethink the
From Start-Up to Adolescence: University of Oklahoma's OER Efforts  375

term "ROI" and how administration views a "return" on the amount of
money used for Alternative Textbook Grants. A "return" on OER is best
analyzed over the long term, instead of on a semester or even yearly ba-
sis, for they cumulatively build over semesters of use, which for OU's OER
team is an apt metaphor for the value of OER in general.

Appendix A: OER Initiative Scope

This project will focus on piloting sustainable and scalable OER/ALS adoptions on campus.
      The project will focus on four implementation areas:

 · OU Libraries will support the development and use of OER and ALS to replace
     textbooks in the classroom, to save students money, and to give faculty more control
     over their educational content.

 · OU Libraries will support the development and use of OER and ALS to replace course
     packs in the classroom, to save students money, and to give faculty more control over
     their educational content.

 · OU Libraries will work with the University College (University of Oklahoma, 2016)
     to identify appropriate OER as study aids for students.

 · OU Libraries will provide an appropriate platform to support the discovery, creation,
     reuse, revision, remixing, and redistribution of OER and other affordable learning
     materials for faculty and students.

            University of Saskatchewan Experience

Introduction
During the 2017-18 academic year, approximately 3,500 students at the
University of Saskatchewan (U of S) were assigned open textbooks for
their classes, replacing commercial textbooks. This represented a more
than 10-fold increase since our first major adoption in early 2015 and was
a landmark in the increasing use of open educational resources (OER)
at the university. This rapid growth is the result of individual efforts
by our faculty, educational developers, and librarians, working with the
students' union to champion the use of OER across campus. This rapid
growth suggests a desire for OER in our classrooms. Supply has stoked
demand from students and faculty for alternatives to commercial text-
books and we must be ready to meet this demand and the expectations of
our community.

    The U of S has a long history of grassroots innovations in research,
teaching, and learning exemplified by OER adoption at the institution.
We define our grassroots approach as one that emphasizes people-driven
initiatives for change that are not fully reliant on the administrative struc-
ture of the university. The U of S is a medical/doctoral university in
Western Canada and a member of the U15 group of research-intensive
Canadian universities (akin to a Carnegie R classification). The University
Library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and
the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL), with 145 full-
time equivalent (FTE) librarian faculty and staff serving over 27,000 fac-
ulty, staff, and students, with a 2017 FTE student count of approximately
17,000 undergraduate students and approximately 3,000 graduate stu-
dents (University of Saskatchewan Website, n.d.).
382  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    This chapter examines how we have encouraged the adoption of OER
at the U of S from a grassroots effort as opposed to a top-down adminis-
trative directive. We illustrate the benefits and challenges of this approach
along with the obstacles remaining to fully realize the potential of OER for
teaching and learning institution-wide. We propose ways these obstacles
could be surmounted through partnerships and collaborations between
teams on campus. The library, teaching and learning center, distance ed-
ucation unit, administration, student government, faculty champions of
OER, and other support units all have important roles to play in the highly
integrated network of systems, services, and resources that will make the
full-scale adoption of OER successful. The library is uniquely positioned
to provide leadership for multiple aspects of OER adoption because of its
ties to research, teaching, and learning at all levels on our campus.

The Role of the Academic Library
Academic libraries have the potential to lead in three areas that can en-
courage the adoption of OER on our campuses: leadership in OA publishing,
teaching and learning, and OER systems. Although leadership is an ambiguous
and oft-used piece of jargon in modern institutions for a range of initia-
tives, it is an apt term to describe the natural alignment between academic
library advocacy and the advancement of institutional goals and the fact
that libraries cannot do this work alone. Ferguson (2016) describes this col-
laborative model well in relation to the production and use of OER:

      As the faculty, and in some cases students, work to produce
      the content for their courses, libraries and librarians can play a
      key role in the production, adoption, and promotion of OERs,
      assisting with funding, research, copyright, and publishing op-
      tions (p. 256).

Making a connection to the historical role of academic libraries, Clobridge
(2015) draws a direct line from the library as information source to pro-
ponent for open access and OER. They argue that it is not beyond of
the purview of academic libraries to become a leader for OER and that
through "the auspices of an open access program or library publishing
efforts, encouraging innovation in scholarly communication, or encour-
aging student success, libraries have ample opportunities to get involved
in promoting and supporting open textbooks" (p. 68). There are many
A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption  383

ways that academic libraries can support the culture change required to
shift attitudes and actions on campus regarding the adoption of OER. The
following sections explore three major areas where libraries can show
leadership for OER initiatives that leverage their expertise and reputation
and that we have considered in the context of OER use at the U of S.

Leadership in OA Publishing
Academic publishing at universities and colleges is, by virtue of the types
of required inputs and outputs, a necessarily complex activity and the re-
sponsibility for it often resides across academic and support units, as it
does at the U of S. Okamoto (2013) notes that libraries are in a strong
strategic position to support, promote, or even create and distribute OER;
however, with expanding mandates, libraries and library systems must be
selective about the related services they wish to offer. This concept of "li-
brary publishing" (Howard, 2013) can partly address the rising costs of
acquiring and maintaining collections by supporting the production of
open and locally relevant publications for teaching and scholarship. Gain-
ing skills in all aspects of OER publishing help librarians and library staff
add value to an institution's open strategies by improving the usability,
discoverability, and learner accessibility of OER materials (Ovadia, 2011).
West (2017) notes that librarians are in a unique position to "help faculty
find appropriate repositories or platforms to share their OER (textbooks
and other resources)" (p. 43) and, we argue, to support faculty to develop
their own OER.

    Bell (2015) describes an example at Oregon State University where
libraries collaborated with the university press on open textbook pub-
lishing. Under that model, faculty members supplied original or compiled
works while the press offered editorial support, a peer review process, and
an editorial board. Goodsett, Loomis, and Miles (2016) described a case
where a university English professor had created curricular materials that
were later converted to an electronic OER format by a team of library
developers. The authors noted that success factors included an acknowl-
edgment of the usefulness of project management, a need to respect the
availability of staff and faculty time and using the diverse technical and in-
formation expertise of the library team (Goodsett et al., 2016). At the U
of S, we currently do not have a library press, but we are exploring op-
384  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

tions for digital publishing services to meet growing demands on campus
by mobilizing teams that can meet the complex challenges of digital pub-
lishing and long-term preservation and access.

    One of the significant barriers to OER publishing is understanding
copyright restrictions on the use and reuse of materials. Ferguson (2016)
notes that bringing library expertise to OER development teams regard-
ing copyright issues is an important factor of success. Given the changing
landscape regarding copyright and acceptable use of educational materi-
als--and the number of possible institutional areas where this responsi-
bility may reside--leadership from the academic library is crucial when
advancing OER throughout the institution.

Leadership in Teaching and Learning
An area where individual librarians can demonstrate the value of OER is
in developing open curricular materials, teaching strategies, instructional
designs, and assessments. Emphasizing the natural advantages of place and
personnel of the academic library, Mitchell and Chu (2014) note that "li-
brarians have a unique role as translators and mediators between content
generators (faculty) and content users (students and other researchers). Li-
braries are positioned to provide guidance to faculty exploring alternative
education materials" (p. 16). At the U of S we have seen examples of shared
physical and virtual teaching spaces and relationships between librarians
and instructors that have led to the adoption of OER for teaching on our
campus. How these individual relationships have been a critical force in
growing OER at the U of S is described in detail later in this chapter.

    Academic libraries often act directly as teaching supports for faculty
members. Hess, Nann, and Riddle (2016) report on an academic library
that developed an online guide to OER, providing a basic introduction to
the topic including best practices and design considerations. This approach
could be easily adopted at the U of S and most other academic libraries
that use online library guide systems (such as Springshare's LibGuides) and,
in turn, could be produced as open teaching and learning materials. Other
software systems (such as SelectedWorks) can be used within a university
system to develop a shared understanding of faculty research and teaching
interests, leading to an ongoing, portfolio-driven discussion between faculty
and librarians in the area of support for teaching (Goodsett et al., 2016).
A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption  385

    Libraries should consider themselves one academic support unit in a
network of academic support units when considering taking a leadership
role for OER support. Walz (2015) describes ways to use existing rela-
tionships with faculties and departments to better understand OER audi-
ences. This helps librarians and library staff understand what educational
resources are used, authored, or assigned and identifies faculty decision-
making processes, values, and requirements in order to engage effectively
(Walz, 2015, p. 27). It is not difficult to imagine the number of depen-
dencies that exist between information technology staff, teaching and
learning centers, faculty groups, continuing and distance units, and the
university library. Ongoing, communicative partnerships with groups and
units is key to ensuring support for OER teaching and learning.

    The advancement of technology-based approaches to teaching and
learning will continue to be an area where academic libraries can demon-
strate leadership. Publishers continue to change their business models to
adapt to the sharing economy, making significant adjustments to how vir-
tual course packs, journals, and teaching texts are licensed and used. Very
few professionals in a university or college setting outside of the library
will have training and capacity to remain current and engaged with these
emergent issues. This is a key area where academic libraries can bring
their expertise and connections to bear on the challenge of communicat-
ing problems with scholarly publishing models and the benefits of OER
for students and instructors.

Leadership for OER Systems
While there are large OER repositories that house resources from mul-
tiple institutions such as the Open Textbook Network (Salem Jr., 2017;
West, 2016), OER Commons (Hess et al., 2016; Salem Jr., 2017), and
California Open Online Network for Education (Ferguson, 2017), many
post-secondary institutions have invested in locally hosted digital repos-
itories that can be used to support OER. Maintaining a locally hosted
repository offers many benefits, including being able to control new col-
lections and metadata schemas (Mitchell & Chu, 2014), but it also brings
significant challenges. Developing and maintaining digital infrastructure
to support OER creation and use at a college or university demands
significant investments of time and resources in technical systems and
386  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

cultivating local expertise. These costs can be significantly reduced by
partnering with libraries that already maintain infrastructure required for
digital repositories (Ferguson, 2017; Walz, 2015).

    Goodsett et al. (2016) demonstrate that established library systems
and related services can be effectively leveraged to support OER. Search
and discovery systems, data storage, metadata and indexing, digital preser-
vation, and copyright expertise, long the domain of academic libraries,
make hosting OER a logical extension for traditional library services
(Walz, 2015). For example, stand-alone repositories tend to struggle with
sustainability and suffer from short lifespans (Hess et al., 2016). Friesen
(2009) found the average lifespan of non-government-funded repository
projects to be less than three years, a lifespan closely correlated with pro-
ject funding cycles. Academic libraries can provide a stable place to host
and access OER, mitigating serious preservation challenges that come
with short-term funding and leadership from temporary project teams.
Expertise and experience in preservation and access of digital information
is a major strength libraries bring to OER partnerships. Libraries often
already have the digital systems infrastructure and expertise in place to
support a successful OER project, providing solid, ready-made platforms
on which to build projects upon (Ferguson, 2017).

    A common example of existing digital library infrastructure that can
be utilized to support OER are institutional repositories (IRs) which can
serve as the primary access point for OER produced by faculty, staff, and
students (Ferguson, 2017). Salem Jr. (2017) noted that libraries are often
a leading partner in the development of OER repositories. While the tra-
ditional focus of IRs has been to host electronic theses and dissertations,
journal articles, and conference proceedings (Goodsett et al., 2016), their
functionality and the expertise gained by developing IR technology and
services can be extended to include OER. For example, Goodsett et al.
(2016) described a diverse set of collections in the Cleveland State Univer-
sity IR that included "more than 11,000 papers in over 680 disciplines, 200
books, thirteen conferences, six e-journals, image galleries, videos, mu-
sic collections, and more" (p. 336). The ability for library-hosted systems
to expand to accommodate new types of digital scholarly and teaching
materials, including OER, make libraries a strong center of expertise to
strategically grow OER across campus.
A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption  387

    At the U of S, we have invested in two major library-owned systems to
manage digital scholarly, research and teaching materials. We have an IR
for digital theses and dissertations, pre-prints, open access articles, presen-
tations, and posters. We also have a digital asset management system that
allows us to build digital collections for researchers and instructors that stu-
dents can contribute to and use as OER in the classroom. In addition to
digital publishing platforms and traditional library systems for discovery
and access of open textbooks, these systems allow our library to meet the
growing demand for technical infrastructure that makes the creation and
long-term maintenance of OER possible and affordable for instructors.

    In addition to hosting systems, libraries can extend systems leadership
in service areas they have expertise in. Ferguson (2017) mentions devel-
oping policies and systems support for multiple versions of resources as
an area where libraries can contribute to OER projects. The modular na-
ture of OER is highly desirable and can lead to multiple versions that must
be carefully managed. Libraries are centers of expertise in creating de-
scriptive metadata and using it to describe and provide access to complex
materials. They also bring deep experience in dealing with technical chal-
lenges, such as providing concurrent user access to electronic resources,
software and hardware conformity for digital platforms, and accessibility
of locally developed and adopted OER (Billings, Hutton, Schafer, Schweik,
& Sheridan, 2012). These are challenges libraries are accustomed to deal-
ing with when providing licensed digital content and they have developed
practices to provide technical support for students. Library frontline staff
often first encounter students struggling with technology issues and, thus,
they are in a good position to provide support to students when adopting
OER (Billings et al., 2012). Hagel, Horn, Owen, and Currie (2012) wisely
cautioned that OER project leaders must be cognizant of the various levels
of digital literacy students have and work to meet the needs of those who
may be disadvantaged by increasing reliance on online resources. The li-
brary is a natural place to both encounter and provide help for students
struggling with OER technology.

How We Got Here
From the fall of 2014 to the spring of 2018 the number of students using
OER in place of commercial textbooks at the U of S skyrocketed from fewer
388  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

than 50 to more than 3,500, with a total estimated savings of more than
CAD$625,000 during that four-year period. This increase was the result
of workshops, partnerships, tenacity, and some serendipity. The success of
OER adoption and the growth of support for open access (OA) initiatives
generally have been the result of grassroots efforts from many directions
on campus. One of the players in this area has been the University Library.

    The adoption of OA practices and initiatives in the library has been
driven by individual champions of OA. In 2010, a team of librarians de-
veloped the University of Saskatchewan Librarians and Archivists Open Access
Commitment (University of Saskatchewan Librarians and Archivists, 2010)
which affirms that librarians and archivists at the U of S would deposit
the output of their scholarly activities in our local institutional repository
(eCommons@USask, n.d.) and seek to publish in open access venues. To
realize the commitment made by library faculty, the U of S Library ex-
panded its use of the IR from hosting electronic theses and dissertations
to include library faculty scholarly output. In 2016, in response to demand
from the campus community and new OA requirements for federal Cana-
dian research grant recipients, the library began a pilot project to expand
the availability of the IR to other colleges and departments across campus.
This leadership in assisting researchers at the U of S to deposit their work
in the IR provides an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of pub-
lishing resources that are freely accessible and provides the systems and
support to do so.

    The library has also been a proponent, although not the sole player,
in OA publishing on campus, a theme that emerged in our review of
the literature. One example is the University of Saskatchewan Undergraduate
Research Journal (USURJ), an open access, faculty peer-reviewed journal
featuring original work by undergraduate students at the U of S. USURJ
is published through Student Learning Services in the University Library
and is listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) (University
of Saskatchewan Undergraduate Student Research Journal, n.d.). The li-
brary has reinforced their commitment to support OA publications by
including the DOAJ in the library catalog to increase the visibility of these
publications to library users.

    While the growth of OA support and services in the library has been
the result of grassroots efforts, successes have led to increased institutional
A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption  389

support. The U of S Library is a member of SPARC (the Scholarly Publish-
ing and Academic Resources Coalition, https://sparcopen.org/) and has
included initiatives to build OA expertise and service capacity in the library
in the last two strategic plans. The library is also preparing to release a po-
sition statement on OA unequivocally stating the library's support. The OA
expertise, resources, and campus-wide relationships that exist in the library
make it a natural partner in the expansion of OER use on campus.

    The U of S first engaged an OER approach in 2014, with what was
termed a TOOC (Truly Open Online Course). The Gwenna Moss Center
for Teaching and Learning (GMCTL), offered a face-to-face non-credit
course for instructors and graduate students, Introduction to Learning Tech-
nologies, while simultaneously registering worldwide participants via a
Google Form where they could provide the link for the blog they would
use for assignments. They also could follow the course on Twitter, via
a Facebook group, or via a Google Community. More than 300 partic-
ipants signed up for this open course. All course resources carried Cre-
ative Commons licenses and were posted to a WordPress site. While this
course progressed, the provincial governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta,
and British Columbia signed a three-year memorandum of understanding
agreeing to:

1. Through an efficient and effective process, facilitate cooperation be-
    tween the Participants in the sharing and development of Open Edu-
    cation Resources;

2. Identify, share and encourage the use of best practices in Open Edu-
    cation Resources among the Participants; and

3. Through the best use of technology for students, faculty and ad-
    ministrators, foster greater collaboration and understanding of key
    issues and trends in Open Education Resources between and among
    post-secondary institutions in the Participant's jurisdictions.
    (Saskatchewan Government OER MOU, 2014)

The following year, the TOOC was offered again, but through the Can-
vas Network (all materials continued to carry Creative Commons li-
censes and the WordPress site was updated to align with the Canvas
course) with more than 1,200 participants. Both offerings were sup-
ported by the Vice Provost Teaching and Learning (VPTL), whose port-
390  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

folio includes the teaching and learning center. In early 2015, the univer-
sity also launched a TOOC on Circumpolar Innovation through the Inter-
national Centre for Northern Governance and Development in consulta-
tion with the GMCTL. This course received development funding from
the U of S Curriculum Innovation Fund. However, as can happen with
open courses, participation and interest in the open courses dropped off
and the university decided that this was not the model to move open for-
ward at the institution.

    In 2014, the GMCTL began considering ways to encourage instruc-
tors to adopt open textbooks. The use of open textbooks to lower student
costs had been part of the campaign platform of the president of the U
of S Undergraduate Student Association, but no U of S courses were us-
ing these resources yet. During this time, much was being done with
open textbooks in British Columbia, led by BCcampus, a province-wide
agency that supports institutions of higher education in the areas of OER
and open pedagogy, curriculum sharing and development, and learning
technologies.1 BCcampus had facilitated the creation of several new open

textbooks and had pulled together a catalog of open textbooks available
online. This work created an opportunity for the U of S to make use of
these existing resources to the benefit of its students.

    In the fall of 2014, a BCcampus poster describing open textbooks as
an alternative to expensive commercial textbooks was placed outside of
the GMCTL. This prompted a professor in the College of Agriculture and
Bioresource to adopt the OpenStax Principles of Economics for one of his
courses with roughly 270 students enrolled. Around this same time, DeDe
Dawson (science librarian and OA proponent) was approached by a pro-
fessor from the chemistry department who said that he could no longer, in
good conscience, ask his students to pay more than CAD$250 for the re-
quired textbook, and sought an alternative. She recommended OER, and
the next term he replaced the commercial book with the open Analytical
Chemistry 2.0, which he found through the BCcampus website. This single
adoption benefited more than 120 students that year and created an OER
champion in that professor. The librarian, long a champion of OA in the

1 For more information, see the BCcampus website:

A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption  391

library, also became an advocate for instructors to consider OER and open
pedagogy, a concept that will be discussed later in this chapter. Other li-
brarians have since followed suit in an effort to improve both access to
materials and pedagogy, thus demonstrating another theme from our re-
view of the literature, leadership in teaching and learning.

    An associate dean from the Edwards School of Business (ESB) heard
about open textbooks and reached out to the GMCTL early in 2015 won-
dering if there might be an open resource to meet the needs of students in
a course that served as an introduction to both university studies and ESB.
Soon after, the associate dean and her co-instructor began adapting College
Success, which was available through the Open Textbook Library through
the University of Minnesota. They adapted the book as they taught the
course to approximately 375 students, releasing their modified sections to
students as they were completed. In the fall of 2016, their finished edition,
University Success, was released publicly and soon added to the BCcam-
pus open textbook directory. This project was supported through funding
from the U of S and instructional design support from the distance educa-
tion unit (DEU).

    Late in 2015, the Saskatchewan government announced
CAD$250,000 in funding to be shared equally between the three major
post-secondary institutions in the province--the University of
Saskatchewan, University of Regina, and Saskatchewan Polytechnic--to
create open textbooks and other OER. At the U of S the VPTL was tasked
with administering the funding. A small OER advisory group was formed
consisting of the VPTL, the GMCTL director, and the educational de-
veloper who had thus far led the OER initiative. In addition, four faculty
members, including the professors who had adopted open textbooks in
agriculture and chemistry, and the associate dean from the ESB who had
completed the adaptation, provided the instructor perspective as members
of this group. The teaching and learning center was given the role of as-
sisting faculty in completing applications and providing ongoing support
while the professors made up the review committee.

    The GMCTL, after conversations with educational developers work-
ing with OER at BCcampus, brought on board the DEU at the U of S
to do ongoing work with faculty on the development of the open text-
books. The DEU provided instructional design expertise and were the
392  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

initial hosts of the university's Pressbooks installation. The new textbooks
were for specific topics that did not yet have existing open textbooks, such
as engineering, economics, and human geography.

    By the 2015-16 academic year approximately 900 U of S students
were enrolled in courses using open textbooks. The provincial govern-
ment announced a second year of funding and the GMCTL began offering
regular workshops on the creation, adaptation, and integration of OER
to raise awareness and encourage instructors to apply for funding. By the
summer of 2016 five open textbooks were in production at the U of S,
including books in geography, biology, and engineering economics. In
addition, an instructor was provided with funding to create a test bank
to facilitate her adoption of Introduction to Sociology--2nd Canadian Edition
from BCcampus.

    In the spirit of the memorandum of understanding signed by
Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, the Canada OER Group
was formed. This community of educational developers and librarians
working with OER in higher education in Canada began meeting virtually
to share updates about current projects, opportunities for collaboration,
and ideas about promotion and integration of OER. While it initially con-
sisted of members in the three most western provinces, the group soon
grew to include representatives from institutions across the country.

    During the 2016-17 academic year the number of students enrolled in
courses using open textbooks at the U of S grew to more than 2,700, with
OER replacing commercial textbooks in 23 courses. The conversations at
the institution around OER began to shift toward the idea of open ped-
agogy, using the flexibility of OER to engage students instead of simply
replacing commercial textbooks with free textbooks. Instructional design-
ers from the DEU and educational developers from the GMCTL shared
ideas about this potential with instructors, including through the an-
nual Course Design Institute, and we discovered several instructors were
already doing it without knowing what it was called. For example, an in-
structor in astronomy had students post undergraduate research findings
on an open WordPress site for future course participants and students
at other institutions. Concurrently, a professor in the College of Law
gave students the option of either writing a traditional paper or editing
Wikipedia articles on topics covered in the course.

    With the sizeable increase in the adoption of open textbooks for the
2016-17 academic year, the GMCTL began surveying students in courses
using open textbooks to gather their opinions about the specific books
being used. Those results are pending. In addition, they looked at one par-
ticular course where the instructor had previously taught sections without
the open textbook. For that course, they compared student marks, which
stayed the same compared to previous sections where the commercial
textbook was used, while the percentage of students who completed the
course increased.

    In early 2017, the university appointed a new University Library Dean
who arrived with experience working with and enthusiasm for OER. She
joined the U of S OER advisory group just as that group was finaliz-
ing an institutional OER and open pedagogy strategy. Adaptations of two
more textbooks on geology and physics went into production around the
same time, and the GMCTL, library, and Information and Communi-
cations Technology (ICT) unit began planning for an institutional OER
repository (the third theme from the literature review, leadership for OER
systems). Finally, the educational developer leading the OER initiative
also began having targeted conversations with subject area librarians in an
effort to enable them to serve as advocates and supports for OER across
the institution. We offer the following table as a means of summarizing
the partnerships around the institution relating to OER:

What's Next at the University of Saskatchewan
Based upon our collective experience to date and the direction suggested
by the university's planning documents, we see the future of library lead-
ership for OER manifesting in the following ways:

· Leadership in OA publishing: Investigating how the library, instruc-
    tional designers, and other educational developers could turn existing
    or future curated digital projects into OER (see example from Mitchell
    & Chu, 2014).

· Leadership in teaching and learning: Leveraging relationships between
    subject librarians and instructors to encourage the adoption of OER,
    Creative Commons licensing, and open pedagogy.

· Leadership for OER systems: Providing systems support (e.g., Islan-
    dora, DSpace, eCommons) and developing a service model to support
    locally developed OER and OA publishing and to ensure robust
    preservation and access for these materials.

In addition to the areas for leadership identified in our literature review,
the OER advisory group and all proponents in the library and across cam-
pus can continue to grow the adoption of OER in the following ways:

· Continuing broad membership representation and activity on the
    OER advisory group.

· Providing targeted professional development training for librarians
    and other OER support groups on campus.
A Grassroots Approach to OER Adoption  395

· Educating and helping students to advocate to their professors in sup-
    port of OER.

· Widening overall institutional adoption by moving from strictly a
    grassroots approach to an approach where the integration of OER and
    open pedagogy increasingly gets on the agendas and planning cycles of
    academic and administrative university units.

Our Next Investment: Adaptations, Ancillary Resources
and Open Pedagogy
There is a significant opportunity for the U of S to build upon the existing
success of our OER initiative by focusing future efforts on not only adop-
tion of existing OER, but also on adapting existing OER, including open
textbooks, and creating needed ancillary resources (e.g. test bank ques-
tions, which are frequently provided by publishers when instructors re-
quire students to purchase a commercial textbook). These approaches are
more cost-effective than creating entirely new open textbooks and allow
the institution to stretch limited resources to benefit more students.

    Increasing the number of adaptations and the utilization of open ped-
agogy will also allow for supporting other institutional priorities and
building partnerships with the leaders of those initiatives across campus.
For example, customizing an open textbook or having students conduct
and openly share undergraduate research as part of the integration of
indigenization and internationalization at the U of S would help meet de-
mands for instructional resources needed for those priorities, while also
improving the learning experience and outcomes for students.

Conclusion
The use of OER and open pedagogy improves student access to learning
materials and allows for resources to be adapted to meet local needs and
priorities. The monetary savings to students at the U of S in the past four
years by using OER is considerable, while opportunities to improve ped-
agogy and build upon other university initiatives with these materials and
learning methods is clear.

    The OER initiative at the University of Saskatchewan has been suc-
cessful in large part due to the partnerships across the institution between
the library, teaching and learning center, distance education unit, media
production, and ICT. The role of librarians, educational developers, in-
396  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

structional designers, and instructors as passionate champions has been key

in raising awareness and supporting the development and adaptation of

OER, as well as introducing the concept of open pedagogy at the U of S.

    Librarians across the institution are now well positioned to take on

a greater leadership position in the areas of OER publishing, teaching

and learning, and systems to move the OER and open pedagogy initia-

tive forward.

In this chapter I will describe the genesis of an open educational resources
(OER) grant program; why we decided to support a grantee through three
iterations of a course; and how and why we involved other experts from
Instructional Design & Technology and from the Center for Teaching
Effectiveness; outline our experience with the first three grantees; and fi-
nally relate this grant program to our strategic focus.

    A common stereotype of liberal arts colleges is that they are elite insti-
tutions occupying a small niche in U.S. higher education, serving a small
proportion of students whose families can afford to pay for small class
sizes and personal attention from professors. Such a student population,
and the professors who teach them, hardly seems like fertile ground for
the growth of OER. This stereotype seems to be reflected in the profes-
sional literature. A combined search of the LISTA and ERIC databases
for the terms "Open Education Resources or OER" and "liberal arts" re-
trieved one record, while and "Community colleges" retrieved 19, and
"university" retrieved 359. An informal unpublished survey of the Oberlin
Group of liberal arts college libraries conducted by Janis Bandelin of Fur-
man University in late 2015 found that only 11 of the 80 member schools
were supporting OER and most of those varied efforts were quite tenta-
tive (J. Bandelin, personal communication, November 15, 2015). A review

of the membership of the Open Textbook Network shows that only two
liberal arts colleges are individual members of the network, although oth-
ers might support the network via consortial membership. Add to this
liberal arts stereotype the very real phenomenon that personal attention
from faculty means that many courses at liberal arts colleges are, in the
best sense of the word, idiosyncratic, and do not make use of traditional,
standardized, textbooks. With a small number of librarians to serve the
diverse information needs of the community, why would one such liberal
arts college library devote time and resources to an OER grant program?

    Founded in 1885, Rollins College is the oldest institution of higher
education in Florida. The total student body consists of approximately
3,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) students served by 235 full-time faculty
and 93 adjunct and contingent faculty members. As of May 31, 2016, the
endowment was worth $339,700,000 and the total annual tuition and
room and board for a student in the College of Liberal Arts, before any fi-
nancial aid, was $60,970 (Rollins College, 2016).

    These figures would seem to confirm the liberal arts stereotype. But
a closer look at the college shows that even in this admittedly privileged
environment, the rising cost of required textbooks and course materials
can be a burden for students. The college consists of three schools; the
full-time undergraduate College of Liberal Arts, the Crummer School of
Business, which provides a variety of MBA programs and a small DBA
program, and the Hamilton Holt School, which provides both undergrad-
uate and graduate degrees to non-residential students drawn from the
Central Florida region, most of whom are part-time students who also
work while pursuing their degrees. Holt School students pay by the course
and are very often funding their own education. They are very sensitive
to price, and textbook purchases, which are concentrated in the first week
of the semester just as the students have managed to pay their tuition, can
be especially hard on these students.

    But it is not just Holt School students who are sensitive to text-
book costs. In 2016, 87 percent of College of Liberal Arts students
received financial aid (S. Booker, personal communication, June 19,
2017) and the vast majority of our students are digging deep into fam-
ily resources to pay for college. Just like their colleagues in the Holt
School, expensive textbook purchases at the beginning of the semes-
Bringing OER to the Liberal Arts: An Innovative Grant Program  401

ter, right after the family has paid their tuition bill, can come as a very
unwelcome shock.

    All three schools are supported by a single library, the Olin Library,
with 10 librarians and 12 staff members. The Library Director also over-
sees the Tutoring & Writing Center located in the Olin building, and
the Information Technology (IT) Help Desk and Instructional Design &
Technology staff are also housed in the Olin building. In the summer
of 2017 we were joined in Olin by the Christian A. Johnson Center for
Teaching Effectiveness and the Office of Accessibility Services.

    The Rollins faculty and librarians have a long history of supporting
open access (OA). College of Liberal Arts faculty passed an open access
policy in early 2010 (Rollins College, Faculty of Arts & Sciences, 2010)
and the library administers an open institutional repository that, among
many other collections, makes accessible the scholarly publications subject
to that policy. A more detailed account of Rollins faculty engagement with
OA can be found in the author's 2011 guest column in College & Research
Libraries News (Miller, 2011). In his role as the Library Director at Rollins
and working through the ACRL (the Association of College and Research
Libraries), the author has also been active in OA advocacy at the federal
level, as have several other librarians at Rollins. In more recent years the
librarians at Rollins have decided to move beyond advocacy to devote a
portion of the collections budget to financially sustaining certain OA pro-
jects. Jonathan Harwell describes this effort in a 2016 Against the Grain
column (Harwell, 2016).

    All this interest in and activity around OA meant that the librarians
followed developments in OER, but did not take any action until the
College began to consider the future of the College bookstore. Rollins stu-
dents, in a move common throughout American higher education, had
begun to acquire more of their textbooks in ways other than simple pur-
chase of the books in the college bookstore. In a 2016 report Nielsen found
that only 34 percent of students used their college bookstore as a source
for course materials (Nielsen Insights, 2016). The college bookstore was
becoming more of a memorabilia store. As the college contemplated how
to satisfy students' continuing need to acquire required texts we consid-
ered following the students and moving all (print and digital) textbook
distribution online. Students would buy from outlets like Amazon and
402  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Chegg and have the books delivered to the campus post office. To han-
dle textbook adoption and the inevitable lag time, the college asked the
library to investigate maintaining a reserve textbook collection for stu-
dents. As many librarians who have maintained such collections have
found, this would be expensive (Beck, 2012), both to initially collect and
then to maintain. Encouraging the use of OER on campus was one way
to help lower this cost, both to students and to the library. Eventually, as
with so many such projects in higher education, the transformation of the
bookstore was downgraded to a simple move, but the library decided to
continue to the develop the idea of encouraging OER on campus.

The OER Grant Program2

Rollins has a popular grant program on campus that we thought could
form the basis for such a plan. For many years the College's IT department
has provided Faculty Instructional Technology Initiative (FITI) grants to
faculty to encourage them to incorporate technology into their teaching
and the classroom. These grants last for one year, provide a small stipend
to the faculty member, and fund the acquisition of the necessary technol-
ogy. Each grant costs the College approximately $2,500.

    The most important part of the FITI grant, however, was based on
the model provided by Hamilton College HILLGroup.3 In that model,
a faculty member seeking to incorporate technology into the classroom
worked with a team of both instructional technologists and librarians. At
Rollins, IT took that model and incorporated it into the FITI grants, pro-
viding each grantee with a team consisting of an instructional technolo-
gist, a librarian, and the Director of the Center for Teaching Effectiveness
to work with for the duration of the grant. This team model was popular
with faculty, well understood, and brought with it collateral benefits such
as deepening relationships between teaching faculty and a variety of acad-
emic support professionals.

application form can be found at: http://www.rollins.edu/library/
services/oer.html

3 The HILLGroup has since been superseded at Hamilton where the li-
brary and IT operations are now fully merged. For more details see:
https://www.hamilton.edu/offices/lits/research-instructional-design
Bringing OER to the Liberal Arts: An Innovative Grant Program  403

    Using the same team approach, we developed a set of three goals for
an OER grant program:

1. Significantly lower the cost of textbooks to students.
2. Maintain or improve student learning outcomes.
3. Contribute to the growing body of OER.

We decided that the program should be open to all faculty members at
Rollins. Unlike many grants, which are focused on full-time or tenure-
track faculty, this one explicitly includes adjuncts, so that the program
would be open to the many adjuncts teaching in the Holt School, where
we hoped we might be able to have an impact on students who were fi-
nancing their own education. We also decided that the grant would last
for three iterations of a course. At Rollins, courses can be taught as fre-
quently as every semester, so that three iterations would last for about a
year and a half, or as infrequently as once every two years, so that three
iterations would last for six years. We created this three-iteration struc-
ture because of what we had noticed about FITI grants: faculty members
with FITI grants put significant effort into incorporating technology into
a course and this tends to change the whole course. This is an enormous
amount of effort on the faculty member's part and, of course, not all tech-
nologies succeed in the classroom. It is not uncommon to find that the
effort is too much and the faculty member reverts to the way the course
has been taught in the past. By basing the grants on three iterations of
the course, discussed in more detail below, we hoped that the use of OER
would `stick' and we would also have more reliable assessment of the im-
pact of the OER. The three iterations are structured as follows. As a small
institution we can deviate from the standard structure if necessary.

1st Iteration
Teach the traditional course.

    Assess the impact of the traditional textbook.
    Select, or create, and organize OER materials for the course.
    Begin to develop an assessment mechanism for measuring the impact
of the OER.

2nd Iteration
Teach the course using OER materials.
404  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    Assess the impact of the OER.
    Compare that impact to the first year.

3rd Iteration
Make any revisions and teach the course using OER materials.

    Assess the impact of the OER and compare to first- and second-year
assessments.

    Publicize the results of the grant on campus and to a wider audience.
    File a report on the outcome of the grant with the Academic Dean.
    Upload any OER to the Digital Orange Grove or a comparable open
repository
    To keep the incentive for applicants in the same ballpark as FITI
grants, we decided we would award a $1,000 stipend to the successful
faculty applicant per course iteration, received after all work within that
iteration is complete. Thus, each applicant receives a total of $3,000 over
the course of the grant. Unlike the FITI grants, we decided to only award
one new grant per academic year. This would limit our financial exposure
to $3,000 per year, and more importantly, limit the workload for members
of their team: their liaison librarian, an instructional technologist, and the
Director of the Christian A. Johnson Center for Teaching Effectiveness.
    The obvious shortcoming of limiting the program to a single award
per year is that it would take us centuries to convert the whole faculty to
OER. But we do not expect OER to be appropriate for all faculty members
or all courses at Rollins. The grant program has a multiplier effect by rais-
ing awareness of OER. This happens in several ways. First, some faculty
who have been using openly available resources (although not all always
meeting the strict definition of OER) in their courses come to realize that
they are inadvertently part of a wider movement. Secondly, some faculty
who apply but are not awarded the OER grant continue to explore the use
of OER in their courses, and finally the requirement that the successful
grantee present in a faculty forum on their project spreads the word about
OER, as does the normal everyday faculty and departmental conversation
about teaching on campus. In these ways, the small OER grant is a catalyst
for wider action and discussion.

Review Criteria
We based our review criteria on a common set of criteria for grants on

campus and added some that are specific to OER. Each application is re-
viewed on the following criteria.

· The completeness of the application. Applicants are encouraged to
    consult with librarians, instructional technologists, and the pedagogy
    expert in the Center for Teaching Effectiveness early and often while
    drafting their application.

· The total cost to each student of the traditional textbook(s) in the
    course.

· The average enrollment in the course and the frequency with which
    it is taught. The multiplication of these three criteria (textbook cost,
    enrollment, and frequency) equals the total costs saved in that course,
    if we can entirely replace the textbook(s). The larger the number, the
    greater weight the reviewers give to the application.

· The availability of suitable OER in major repositories, such as: MER-
    LOT (the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online
    Teaching),4 Florida's Digital Orange Grove,5 OER Commons,6 etc.
    Note that this is not an exclusive list. Interested faculty are encouraged
    to search these and other sources of existing OER. Interested faculty
    are also encouraged to work with a librarian to search for existing
    OER prior to submitting their application. The list also needs to be
    regularly updated.

· The likelihood that the applicant can and will complete the work. This
    is a somewhat subjective criterion. But Rollins is a small campus and
    librarians and instructional technologists have close relationships with
    teaching faculty. The $1,000 annual stipend is tempting and we are in-
    vesting a lot in providing a team. We want to maximize the potential
    for success by also considering an applicant's previous track record in
    terms of grant project completion and using our experience and ex-
    pertise to make a call on the feasibility of the project.

406  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Even though these grants are financed by the library's budget and involve
considerable effort from team members in different departments, the for-
mal review and awarding of the grants is administered by the Faculty
Affairs Committee (FAC). This is a standing governance committee of
the faculty and one of its duties is to award and oversee various grants
to the faculty. Both OER and FITI grant applications first undergo an ex-
pert review by a group consisting of the Chief Information Officer, the
Head of Instructional Design & Technology, the Library Director, and the
Director of the CAJ Center for Teaching Effectiveness. This group rec-
ommends applicants to the FAC, which formally votes to accept, revise, or
reject that recommendation. Although this cedes control to a faculty com-
mittee, it gives both grant programs the imprimatur of the faculty, uses
existing shared governance procedures and thus increases the confidence
of the faculty in the process, and raises the visibility of both grant pro-
grams.

Experience
As I write this, the FAC has just awarded our third OER grant. The first
awardee, Dr. Mackenzie Moon Ryan of the Art & Art History Depart-
ment, is beginning her third and final iteration of the course and the OER
grant. The second awardee, Dr. Julia Maskivker of the Political Science
Department, is beginning her second iteration of the course and the grant,
and at the end of the spring semester we awarded our third OER grant
to Dr. Whitney Coyle of the Physics Department. The remainder of this
chapter will draw out specific lessons learned from the experience of each
awardee.

    Dr. Ryan applied to bring OER to her 200-level art history course, In-
troduction to Global Art. In an interview with the author she noted that she
had felt obliged to adopt a textbook when teaching such a broad subject,
but had also felt constrained by the textbook. It had an authoritative voice
without argument or criticism. It did not encourage students to develop
the habit of questioning where the information came from. She sought
more flexibility in choosing the artworks to focus upon and in selecting
differing voices. She was dissatisfied by both the cost of the books to her
students, the quality of the production, and that the publisher released
new editions every couple of years (Miller, 2015b). In her application she
Bringing OER to the Liberal Arts: An Innovative Grant Program  407

identified digital resources from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York and OER resources from the Digital Orange Grove and from Saylor
Academy. She noted that she would need to:

      augment [OER] with case studies utilizing peer-reviewed ar-
      ticles from scholarly journals. Many open-access resources are
      very introductory and it is crucial that students are also in-
      troduced to the sustained arguments and depth of research in
      scholarly sources. It will take some time to locate, evaluate,
      and implement select scholarly sources so as not to over-
      whelm students but also to convey the utility and necessity of
      peer-reviewed sources. (M. Ryan, personal communication,
      May 12, 2015)

It was clear from her application that she would not be able to move
completely to OER in this course. The Metropolitan Museum's (the Met)
digital content is very high quality, but it is made available under a some-
what restrictive license (Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.d.) that would
enable us to link to the content, but not download or create and publish
derivative works from that content. Obviously, this means that any OER
works we created including Met content would need to simply link to that
content, which means that we cannot be confident that those links will al-
ways work over the long term. We would also be depending on the future
direction of the Met, which is already changing (Pogrebin, 2017).

    Further, the peer-reviewed sources that Dr. Ryan planned to use
would largely come from the full-text licensed scholarly journals available
to the Rollins community. These would be free to Rollins students, ful-
filling our first goal of lowering the cost to students, but not our third of
adding to the body of open resources. Again, we would have to simply cite
articles that future non-Rollins users might, or might not, be able to access.

    Despite these limitations we decided to award Dr. Ryan the grant. We
were excited by her topic and knew her as a dependable and enthusias-
tic teacher. The traditional textbooks she had adopted were, in her words,
"really expensive" (Miller, 2015b) and she taught this course annually. If
we could not reduce to the cost to zero, we could replace much of the re-
quired course materials with more open resources. She was also excited to
work with a team (Miller, 2015b).
408  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    We were probably too excited. As Dr. Ryan has progressed through
two iterations of the course within the grant, her gallant efforts and those
of her team have not resulted in the assembly or production of any OER
that meet the strict definition of the term.7 There is a reason why art
history textbooks are so expensive; the rights management and reproduc-
tion of large numbers of high-quality images is expensive and difficult to
manage, and the synthesis of complex and diverse scholarship into appro-
priately written prose is a specialist activity for which authors expect to be
rewarded.

    We have learned from the experience. Perhaps most importantly we
have learned not to bite off more than we can chew, and this is reflected
in subsequent grant awards. We also learned that researching and under-
standing the rights and permissions attached to any particular resource
that a faculty member is considering is a complex workload in and of itself.
During the development of the application, assuming the faculty member
consults with the library (where copyright expertise resides at Rollins) and
certainly at the point of expert review, we must take time to delve into the
rights and permissions of ostensibly "open" resources and insert the find-
ings into the review process.

    Finally, we gained experience in assessment. Dr. Ryan worked with
our then Director of the Center for Effective Teaching, Dr. James Zim-
merman. As Dr. Zimmerman noted in an interview, it is very difficult to
isolate the impact of a single variable, like a textbook, on student learn-
ing, "but all hope is not lost" (Miller, 2015a). In the assessment of the first
two iterations of the course, the team decided to use group interviews
with students conducted by Dr. Zimmerman during class times with Dr.
Ryan not present. Dr. Zimmerman found that most students found the
traditional textbook valuable. He found that, not surprisingly, the students
preferred the online open resources for the course to be clearly orga-
nized and that students preferred a combination of text and image rather
than podcast and image. Dr. Zimmerman also noted that his discussion

7 UNESCO defines OER as, "teaching, learning and research materials in
any medium that reside in the public domain and have been released un-
der an open license that permits access, use, repurposing, reuse and
redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions." (UNESCO,
2011, p. v).
Bringing OER to the Liberal Arts: An Innovative Grant Program  409

with Dr. Ryan suggested that instructors needed to have taught the course
multiple times before they embark on the OER grant and that the OER
transformation will take at least three years.

    In the second year of the grant program we took Dr. Ryan's expe-
rience to heart and selected what we hope to be a far less ambitious
application: Dr. Julia Maskivker, of the Political Science Department, and
her course Problems in Political Thought. This is a course in which students
are introduced to some of the classics of western political philosophy:
Plato, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. The course is taught every semester
to approximately 25 students, so the impact of introducing OER could be
quite large even though the cost of textbooks for the course was relatively
low. The cost of textbooks is low because editions and translations of
these classic texts exist in the public domain and they can be purchased in
inexpensive paperback editions. The public domain status of these works
also meant that they had already been digitized in Project Gutenberg and
released with a very liberal license (Project Gutenberg, 2014).

    The interesting aspects of Dr. Maskivker's application were less about
creating or organizing OER, since her team planned to create simple epub
editions, and more about how students would use these ebooks in the
course. Rollins does not require students to use a particular computer or
operating system. We provide access to both Macs and PCs on campus
and while the current generation of students tend to favor Macs, we have
to plan on delivering content via a wide range of hardware and software.
Studying how students navigate through open ebooks would inform the
Library and Instructional Design & Technology's wider understanding of
students' evolving use of ebooks.

    Of even greater interest however, is Dr. Maskivker's intention to in-
corporate the ethics of intellectual property, and OER, into the course, as
she wrote in her application:

      I will culminate the experiment with an invited lecturer that
      will speak to my class on issues of intellectual property law--its
      philosophical underpinnings and its policy implications. I be-
      lieve this activity is a wonderful way to make the class more
      fun and interesting by linking issues of classical theory like
      private property and state power to a practical discussion on
410  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

      the policy implications and every-day-consequences of intel-
      lectual property law. In a fascinating way, "open source" means
      that the traditional barriers of intellectual property law are (at
      least temporarily or with permission) brought down. How-
      ever, the concept exists in the background of a whole legal and
      philosophical apparatus, and I want my students to get a quick
      panoramic view of what that is and where it is moving. (J.
      Maskivker, personal communication, March 2, 2016)

The first iteration of Dr. Maskivker's course was delayed to accommodate
her sabbatical, so the team is currently working on assembling the OER
versions of her readings and on developing assessment. Dr. Maskivker has
required students to write responses to readings and her plan is to com-
pare those responses from the traditional iteration of the course to those
from the OER version of the course and to combine this assessment with
measures of student satisfaction with the ebook experience.

    The third grant was awarded to Dr. Whitney Coyle of the physics
department. The physics department recently purchased a number of IO-
Lab carts. These `carts' (each about the size of a mobile phone) have,
"built in sensors [that] measure force, acceleration, velocity, displacement,
magnetic field, rotation, light, sound, temperature, pressure, and volt-
ages ... Expansion connectors provide access to over a dozen user control-
lable digital and analog inputs and outputs" (IOLab, 2016).

    According to Dr. Coyle, each of these devices replaces a shelf of equip-
ment that students have used in introductory physics courses. They are a
relatively recent innovation and the initial development was funded by a
Kickstarter campaign. The manufacturers note that, "sophisticated open-
source software controls the device, acquires and displays data in real time,
and provides a suite of analysis and data manipulation features" (IOLab,
2016). The devices are so new that no one has developed lab manuals for
introductory physics courses using the carts. This is what Dr. Coyle plans
to do for the PHY130 and 131 courses with the help of her OER grant.

    Dr. Coyle also wrote in her application that, "for many years the
Physics faculty have mapped out a skills tree that details scaffolded, by
year, goals for student learning--skills that we expect our students to learn
in each lab course we teach" (W. Coyle, personal communication, Feb-
Bringing OER to the Liberal Arts: An Innovative Grant Program  411

ruary 24, 2017). Her plan is to write a full OER lab manual that guides
students through a unified learning experience using the IOLab carts. The
skills Rollins faculty teach in this introductory sequence of courses are
common in American college-level physics curricula and we anticipate
that writing this lab manual, based around the IOLab carts, will be of
use to many other physics professors using the carts. It also builds upon
the open way in which these devices have been developed, with crowd-
sourced funding and open source software. Dr. Coyle has reached out to
the device developers. They are not developing such lab manuals and are
supportive of her doing so.

    How Dr. Coyle and her team will assess the impact of the OER lab
manual on student learning is yet to be determined, but she is interested in
measuring student perceptions of their own skill level and on work with
her colleagues in more advanced courses to see how the skills students de-
velop in the course are exhibited in more advanced physics courses.

Conclusion
This innovative grant program has taught us that OER do have a place
in liberal arts colleges. Our commitment to open scholarship and learning
can go beyond advocacy and support for open access publishing. The fo-
cused and nuanced attention faculty at liberal arts colleges have always
paid to the required readings and content they bring into the classroom
and their courses is a good fit with the OER movement and with OER
development. Selecting a traditional textbook can sometimes be a case of
"take it or leave it." Developing OER requires carefully thinking about the
details of what is included, or not, in the final resource. This fits well with
the traditional care and attention faculty who are attracted to liberal arts
education have always paid to the classroom experience.

    These three very different projects have taught us a number of things.
First, don't be too ambitious. Secondly, as we suspected, the impact of
one variable (the textbook or required course materials) on something as
complex as student learning is very difficult to assess, but staying focused
on assessment is constructive anyway. Finally, that such relatively small
project-based grants, especially when combined with a focused team of
academic support professionals, can have an outsized impact on the strate-
gic success of the library.
412  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

    The current iteration of the library's strategic plan is to "become even
more thoroughly integrated into the teaching and learning of the Col-
lege. While continuing to provide solutions to information problems,
the library staff and librarians go beyond this to be partners with faculty
and students throughout the learning and research process" (Olin Library,
2014). This OER grant program enables librarians (and instructional tech-
nologists) to partner with faculty at a new point in the teaching cycle, at
the point of creation and adoption of the textbook, or its OER equivalent.
This is much earlier than has traditionally been the case and means we
are working with faculty as they develop the course. We remain deeply
connected to the course as it is taught over three iterations (and hope-
fully beyond). We can use these grants to build partnerships around a
number of topics throughout the learning and teaching processes. Includ-
ing issues of information literacy, intellectual property, and research data
management. For instance, Dr. Ryan teaches her students to question
where information comes from and saw her team as helping that process.
Teams also help faculty understand the intellectual property (IP) land-
scape of textbooks and OER, and how they can make their own decisions
about the copyright status of their own works, but also--as is the case in
Dr. Maskivker's course--help students begin to understand the nuances of
IP. Finally, Dr. Coyle's IOLab carts require students to collect and manage
many more data points than would be the case in more traditional intro-
ductory physics courses, which raise issues of research data management.

    We still have a long way to go, but all this is a very long way from
where we began; wondering if we could sustain a collection of textbooks
behind the circulation desk.

Defining the Problem
Challenges abound to both the adoption of existing open textbooks and
the creation of new open textbooks. Key challenges identified by faculty
are issues of quality, availability of content, and the time it takes to adopt
or create open educational resources (OER), particularly open textbooks.
Solutions to these challenges are being explored through a collaborative
pilot project involving the Open Textbook Network, the Rebus Foun-
dation, and several universities. This case study describes how, with the
support of a Friends of the Libraries Grant, staff and faculty at the Univer-
sity of Washington (UW) participated in an Open Textbook Pilot Project
to create new open textbooks within the Rebus Community platform. Al-
though this pilot is ongoing, it has already begun to address some of the
challenges to OER creation and adoption.

    Despite the continued increase in the availability of existing open
educational materials and the growth of the open education movement,
awareness of OER is still a challenge, with 58 percent of faculty reporting
that they were "generally unaware of OER" in a recent national survey.
In this survey, only 6.6 percent of faculty reported that they were "very
aware" of OER, with around three times that many (19%) saying that they
were "aware" (Allen & Seaman, 2016). The same study found that the bar-
riers to adopting OER most often cited by faculty who are aware of the
existence of OER are: "there are not enough resources for my subject"
(49%), it is "too hard to find what I need" (48%) and "there is no compre-
hensive catalog of resources" (45%) (Allen & Seaman, 2016).

    UW faculty primarily have concerns about quality of content and the
amount of time it takes to convert a course from a commercial textbook
416  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

to an open one. This is consistent with a finding by Martin, Belikov,
Hilton, Wiley, and Fischer that "while an overwhelming majority (90%)
of respondents were open to the notion of using open resources, it was
contingent upon the OER being `suitable', or at least equal in quality to
what they were currently using" (Martin et al., 2017). The Babson survey
similarly found that quality concerns were present among faculty mem-
bers (28% in comparison with other barriers), and also found that faculty
who are aware of OER are more concerned about the quality of OER
offerings than those who were not aware of OER prior to taking the
survey (Allen & Seaman, 2016). The question of what is `suitable' for a
course can depend on many factors, as is demonstrated by reading reviews
in the Open Textbook Library, which include criteria such as accuracy,
comprehensiveness, relevance/longevity, clarity, consistency, grammati-
cal errors, cultural relevance, and others. In one example, a UW faculty
member states that the OpenStax biology textbook is "unusable" due to
"topic(s) completely missing or coverage is so poor" on several topics that
she goes on to list (Doherty, 2016). In another example, a Bemidji State
University faculty member notes that a lack of ancillary materials is the
primary reason his department would not adopt a financial accounting
text (Joyce, 2015).

    One of the advantages of using open textbooks is the fact that their
licenses allow for adaptation. In a case such as the OpenStax biology ex-
ample above, an instructor could remix and revise the book, adding their
own content or creating assignments that require students to create new
content for the book. Alternately, an instructor could supplement the
book with other open resources or library-licensed content. However,
when the topic of adapting existing open textbooks has been discussed in
OER meetings and workshops at UW, faculty attendees have consistently
responded that they lack the time to do so. Time emerged as a major bar-
rier in a report by Chae and Jenkins who found that "Lack of time for
course redesign in current college employment contexts emerged clearly
in our study as a primary barrier to performing the often time-inten-
sive work of finding, adapting and creating OER" (Chae & Jenkins, 2015).
Faculty reported in this study that they had gained time for this work
via sabbaticals and course releases. In an institutional environment where
those options are not offered, time can be an insurmountable barrier to
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  417

OER adoption or creation. Activities related to open textbook adoption,
including creation of new content, creation of ancillary materials, course
and assignment redesign and pedagogical innovation are time-consuming.
Any program that offers support for OER adoption or creation must take
these challenges into consideration.

UW Open Textbook Pilot Project Background
The genesis of the UW Open Textbook Pilot Project was contingent upon
what seemed to be a fortuitous coming together of several elements: 1)
the Open Textbook Network was hearing an increasing demand from its
members for support for publishing new open textbooks, 2) the Rebus
Foundation was forming, with the specific intent of providing support of
that nature, 3) the UW Libraries, a new member of the Open Textbook
Network, had formed an OER Steering Committee that was exploring
ways to support OER and 4) the Friends of the UW Libraries was accept-
ing grant proposals for the 2016-17 academic year.

Open Textbook Network
The Open Textbook Network (OTN) launched in April 2012 with the
goal of increasing the use of open textbooks in higher education. The
Open Textbook Library was created to address the barriers to OER adop-
tion cited above, particularly the lack of a comprehensive catalog and
concerns about quality. In April 2017, the Open Textbook Network an-
nounced that their catalog contained over 385 books in 14 broad subject
areas and that they had recently uploaded their 1000th faculty review of
a textbook. These faculty reviews serve two purposes--one is to address
the quality issue through peer review, the other is to raise awareness of
the textbooks themselves in the process of soliciting peer reviews. When
an institution joins the OTN, experts from the Network visit the institu-
tion to provide workshops to faculty, librarians, and staff. The workshops
build understanding of OER for all who attend, and faculty are invited to
write a review of a textbook in the Open Textbook Library. Faculty are
provided a small stipend in compensation for attending the workshop and
writing a review. Since its formation, this model has proven successful.
The OTN has reported $3.1 million in savings to students by nine early
members.

Rebus Foundation
The Rebus Foundation was founded by Hugh McGuire, an innovator
with a passion for equity of access to information. McGuire had previ-
ously worked on two projects that uniquely prepared him to conceptualize
and implement Rebus. The first was LibriVox, an online community that
began in 2005 with the objective "To make all books in the public domain
available, for free, in audio format on the internet" ("Objective LibriVox",
n.d.). Twelve years later, LibriVox is a massive online community with
over 10,000 completed projects. The second was Pressbooks, an open
source software product that supports creation of ebooks. Pressbooks
provides a user-friendly interface and simple publishing templates that to-
gether make it relatively easy to create a book and publish it online in
multiple formats, including epub, mobi, and PDF. The Rebus Foundation
brings together the best of both former projects to support the creation of
open textbooks in a community-based setting. Taking the forum structure
from LibriVox and using Pressbooks as the publishing platform, Rebus
provides all the tools needed for textbook authors and contributors to
work together to create new open textbooks.

UW Open Educational Resources Steering Committee
The UW Open Educational Resources Steering Committee (UW
OERSC) was formed in January 2016 by the UW Libraries. The commit-
tee is co-chaired by John Danneker, Director of Odegaard Library and
Chelle Batchelor, Director of Access Services. The charge of the commit-
tee is to bring together stakeholders from the UW community to advocate
for and support OER efforts. Membership includes representation from
UW faculty, Associated Students of the University of Washington, UW
Book Store, University Press, Libraries, Undergraduate Academic Af-
fairs, Disability Resources for Students, Teaching and Learning Center,
and UW-IT Learning Technologies. Chelle Batchelor led the UW Open
Textbook Pilot Project and drew from the expertise of other committee
members on several occasions.

UW Friends of the Libraries
The Friends of the Libraries is an organization that was established in
1991 to provide support to the university libraries by promoting aware-
ness of the libraries within the community and by stimulating financial
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  419

support for the UW Libraries (Friends of the Libraries, n.d.). Funding for
innovative projects in the Libraries is provided by the Friends by award-
ing grants of up to $5,000 per project. Grants are proposed and awarded
once per year, and any member of the Libraries staff can apply for a grant.
Projects are evaluated on how well they support the Libraries' four key
strategic visions of research and scholarship, teaching and learning, en-
gagement, and sustainability. Projects are more likely to be accepted if
they benefit the Libraries and their users through imaginative and useful
approaches to practice, research, teaching, and learning, and if they reflect
the Libraries' values of collaboration, diversity, excellence, innovation, in-
tegrity, and responsiveness.

Case Study: The UW Open Textbook Publishing Pilot
The UW Libraries joined the Open Textbook Network in May 2015 and
subsequently hosted Sarah Cohen, David Ernst, and Rajiv Jhangiani for a
series of Open Textbook Workshops that were held in January 2016. The
outline of the day included a workshop for staff and librarians, a workshop
for faculty, and a mid-day open discussion to which staff and faculty from
all academic units were invited. The open discussion drew a diverse group
of attendees, including faculty and staff from the Center for Teaching and
Learning, University Press, UW Book Store, UW Libraries, and Disability
Resources for Students. Seeing the level of interest and engagement in the
topic of OER and the already established collaboration between academic
units, Sarah Cohen from the OTN invited UW to join the Open Textbook
Publishing Pilot as one of the first participating institutions.

    The idea of participating in the Open Textbook Publishing Pilot was
attractive because several UW faculty had expressed interest in creating
and publishing their own open textbooks when UW OERSC members
spoke with them during their OER advocacy efforts between May 2015
and January 2016. The pilot had the potential to fill a need for the faculty,
and it seemed likely that participants were readily available. However, suc-
cessful programs to encourage the adoption and creation of OER offer
incentives to faculty for their participation. Seeking advice from Karen
Brooks, the Manager of University Libraries Grant Services, UW OERSC
co-chair Chelle Batchelor learned about the Friends of the Libraries
Grant, which was approaching the beginning of its 2016 application cycle.
420  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Reviewing past grant proposals, she found that they were very focused on
library collections, with examples ranging from purchase of video games
to digitization of rare audio materials. However, the Open Textbook Pub-
lishing Pilot did fit within the grant criteria, so she worked with her
co-chair John Danneker and another UW Libraries staff member, Steve
Weber, to apply. The Friends of the Libraries approved the proposal
with maximum grant funding, providing $5,000 to offer three stipends of
$1,500 per open textbook, plus an additional $5,00 to fund student em-
ployee hours to assist with the project.

    After receiving the grant funding, Batchelor sent a call for interest in
the project to all UW faculty who had expressed interest in OER in the
past. This included all faculty who attended the OTN's Open Textbook
Workshop as well as several others. Although this was a relatively small
group of faculty, the call for interest elicited three responses. The projects
proposed were an introductory text for the digital humanities, a financial
management textbook, and an interactive introduction to neuro science
textbook. After an initial project kickoff meeting with Hugh McGuire that
included a demonstration of Pressbooks, two authors decided to move
forward with their projects and one, the person who proposed the in-
teractive textbook project, decided the platform would not support his
needs. Going forward, the pilot project participants were Chelle Batchelor
(UW project coordinator), Justin Marlowe (lead author), Sharon Kioko
(contributor), Sarah Ketchley (lead author), and Emily Thompson (con-
tributor).

    As a next step, individual meetings were held between the OTN Di-
rector of Publishing and Collections Karen Lauristen, Rebus staff, and the
authors for each project. Batchelor attended those meetings as the UW
project coordinator. Rebus staff made it clear in these early meetings that
the projects would need to be licensed under a CC-BY license, and the au-
thors agreed. One author had originally intended to license her work as
CC-BY-NC, but was convinced by the Rebus philosophy:

      CC-BY is the most open of the Creative Commons licenses,
      which means that society at large can build upon content li-
      censed this way in the easiest, freest and most effective ways.
      We are trying to help build an open information ecosystem,
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  421

      where not only can any student get access to textbooks for free,
      but further, anyone--another professor, a university, an app
      maker, or an artist--can build new value, new content and new
      services on top of this base layer of "public good," the Open
      Textbook. ("Licensing", n.d.)

After establishing that the Pressbooks platform would meet their needs
and determining that they would license their textbooks as CC-BY, the
authors embarked on their projects. Batchelor joined a few more meetings
between the authors and Rebus staff, but the authors soon began to work
very independently, with minimal assistance from the Libraries. The stu-
dent employee wages that were paid for by the Friends Grant were used to
provide one author with assistance with entering content into Pressbooks.
That student, Emily Thompson, became a volunteer collaborator on the
textbook after the funding was expended. The other authors requested no
support from the Libraries.

    An open textbook project being supported by the Rebus Community
will typically go through the following phases.

1. Lead author(s) identified;
2. Lead author submits project proposal to Rebus staff;
3. If accepted, Rebus staff post project proposal to the Rebus Commu-

    nity forum;
4. Content collaborators are identified (optional);
5. Content is created in, or imported into, Rebus Pressbooks;
6. Peer reviewers are identified by author(s);
7. Peer review is coordinated by Rebus staff;
8. Publishing is coordinated by Rebus staff;
9. Marketing takes place via multiple community channels (Rebus com-

    munity, Rebus staff, peer reviewers, Open Textbook Network, etc.).

The UW Open Textbook Publishing Pilot authors entered the pilot in
very different phases of textbook development. Marlowe and Kioko were
about halfway finished with a draft version of their Financial Strategy for
Public Managers textbook, with a large amount of content already written
and compiled. These authors did not foresee needing any collaborators
to create content--they would write the remaining content themselves.
422  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Ketchley and Thompson had an outline for their textbook and a small
amount of content was already written.

    From July 2016, when the Friends Grant was received, until Novem-
ber 2016, the participating authors began to work on their textbooks in
Pressbooks while the Rebus Foundation began hiring staff and working
on software development for the Rebus Community and Rebus Press-
books. In November 2016, Rebus launched. From that point on, Rebus
staff took over the bulk of the project management for both textbooks
and the authors began meeting with Rebus staff periodically as the pro-
jects evolved. By May 2017 (when this book chapter was being written),
the Planning and Implementing a Digital Humanities Project textbook had a
table of contents and chapter placeholders in Pressbooks, as well as some
introductory content. The project was still being worked on by the au-
thors, but was somewhat stalled because the UW course it was originally
being created for had been cancelled and both authors had moved on to
new positions at UW. The Financial Strategy for Public Managers textbook
was complete and was being used in classes by Marlowe and Kioko, and
Rebus staff had identified five people who were interested in providing
peer review for the text.

    Because the Financial Strategy for Public Managers textbook was one of
the first in the Rebus platform to reach completion, it was a perfect can-
didate to be the test case for another goal of the Rebus Foundation--to
develop good accessibility practices throughout the open textbook pub-
lishing process. Krista Greear, Assistant Director of UW Disability Re-
sources for Students and UW OERSC member, joined a team of people
who reviewed Marlowe and Kioko's text, collaborated with the authors
to remediate any accessibility issues with it, and worked to create rec-
ommendations for building accessibility best practices into the authoring
process.

Pilot Outcomes
As is well evidenced in the literature on OER as well as in other chapters
of this book, financial savings to students is one of the most compelling
outcomes of OER adoption. Justin Marlowe and Sharon Kioko have thus
far used their book in three sections of PUBPOL 522, which enrolls 60
students per section and is the core budgeting and finance course that all
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  423

UW Masters of Public Administration students take in their first year.
According to the OTN formula for counting savings to students, their
book has already saved students $27,000. Each time this course is offered
in the future, another $6,000 will be added to that figure. Therefore, this
textbook has the potential to save UW students almost $100,000 over
a five-year period. If faculty at other institutions decide to adopt this
textbook, the total savings to students from this one book could grow ex-
ponentially.

    However, savings to students is only one of the benefits of this open
textbook. When Chelle Batchelor spoke with Justin Marlowe in their first
meeting to explore Justin's possible participation in the pilot, he spoke
of how the existing commercial textbooks were not a good fit for his
course. Those textbooks looked at financial strategy through a different
lens, more geared toward business and marketing than public policy. The
number of programs that teach financial strategy from this lens is very
small, so there likely is not a sufficient market for a commercial textbook
to be successful. Therefore, creation of an open textbook was a perfect so-
lution.

    After they began to use the textbook in their course, Marlowe and
Kioko discovered that they were able to adopt open pedagogical practices
that were directly tied to the learning objectives for their course. For ex-
ample, one assignment requires students to apply an analytical framework
to a problem, and the authors have incorporated some of the students'
analyses into the textbook as additional examples and practice problems.
They have also asked students for feedback on an exercise in the book
and have revised it based on that input. Although the authors did not
embark on the project with any specific plans to start utilizing open ped-
agogical models, they have naturally begun to do so and have found it to
be beneficial because it allows them "to respond, almost in real time, to
students' concerns and interests" (J. Marlowe, personal communication,
April 8, 2018).

    Faculty who have involved their students in this type of open peda-
gogical practice have noted that the ability for students to contribute to
the resource they are learning from is an advantage of OER over commer-
cial textbooks. Robin DeRosa articulates this on her blog, stating that her
students "immediately seemed invested in the project" to co-create a text-
424  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

book with her and "seemed more connected to the textbook itself, more
willing to engage with it." She concludes, "Open textbooks save money,
which matters deeply to our students. But they can also create a new re-
lationship between learners and course content, and if teachers choose
to acknowledge and enable this, it can have a profound effect on the
whole fabric of the course" (DeRosa, 2016). In their study of K-12 teach-
ers' perceptions of the role of OER, de los Arcos, Farrow, Pitt, Weller,
and McAndrew similarly report, "in response to how OER affect learn-
ing, teachers stress better engaged, more independent students" (2016).
Marlowe has found this to be true in his own students' response to the Fi-
nancial Strategy for Public Managers textbook. Because they have provided
a combination of editorial input as well as case studies for inclusion in the
text, Marlowe has found that they have been more engaged with the text
knowing that their feedback will be used to improve it.

    Another outcome that seems to be developing out of our Open Text-
book Publishing Pilot and merits continuing investigation is the possible
formation of a community of users of and contributors to the Financial
Strategy for Public Managers textbook. Marlowe had an opportunity to
speak with a group of colleagues about his textbook at a meeting he at-
tended when it was in the first draft phase. Several of those colleagues
expressed interest in the textbook because they too had struggled with
the lack of a commercial textbook that met the needs of their courses.
When Rebus staff sent a call for participation in the peer review process
to the same group of colleagues, Rebus was overwhelmed by the positive
response. They received more than twice as many volunteers as they ex-
pected, so they restructured their peer review process to include chapter
reviewers as well as book reviewers. If these colleagues who are now
reviewing the textbook subsequently adopt it and possibly adapt it or
provide updated content for inclusion in future editions, we will be wit-
nessing the genesis of a Rebus Community approach to creating textbooks
that involves faculty and students across multiple institutions. This would
be incredibly exciting, given the potential of such an approach to resolve
issues around the sustainability of open textbooks over time.

    One certain outcome of the pilot is that the process of soliciting and
securing peer reviewers created a built-in opportunity for promoting the
new open textbook. Several faculty in the discipline within which the
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  425

textbook is being taught are now aware of it, and are probably more aware
of OER and the opportunities open licensing presents than they were
previously. This awareness-building occurred as a natural outgrowth of
Marlowe's peer-to-peer networking, seeking input into the work he was
creating, and exploring whether colleagues in his discipline would benefit
from it. As was previously discussed in this chapter, awareness of OER is
one of the significant barriers to adoption. This outcome of the UW Open
Textbook Pilot Project has shown that the Rebus model has the potential
to break down that barrier.

    Another barrier that was discussed previously is the issue of open
textbook quality and comprehensiveness. Because the Financial Strategy
for Public Managers textbook is just entering the peer review phase, it re-
mains to be seen whether this barrier will be addressed. However, the
review process will provide an opportunity for the textbook to be cri-
tiqued and improved upon by five experts in the field, ensuring a high
likelihood of success.

    The barrier of time is still a major factor, and not one that has yet been
solved by the UW Open Textbook Pilot Project. Creation, adaptation, and
even adoption of open textbooks requires time and effort on the part of
one or more faculty members, for whom time is a precious resource. Fac-
ulty have many demands on their time, so work in OER must present
them with other benefits that will outweigh the cost of time. For some,
the cost benefit to their students may be enough. For others, the benefits
of open pedagogy might be the influencing factor. In this pilot, the Friends
Grant, though small, proved to be an important incentive. When asked
what role the grant played for them (i.e. funding for editing, proofreading,
or other role), the textbook authors responded that it acted as an incentive
for them to contribute their time as textbook authors.

Pilot Success Factors
In addition to the outcomes described above, the UW Open Textbook
Publishing Pilot surfaced numerous success factors that will be considered
in future iterations of the pilot.

Factor 1: Departmental Support
Of the two open textbook projects from the 2016-17 pilot, one textbook
was at a much more advanced stage of development by the end of the
426  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

pilot period. This textbook was written by faculty who were teaching a
course in a well-established program and who had full departmental sup-
port for their project. The other textbook was to be taught in a course
that was grant-supported. When the grant funding for the course ran
out, the department in which the course was being taught chose not to
fund the continuation of the course. Therefore, the course the textbook
was being developed for ceased to be taught. The authors will continue
work on the textbook, but with no departmental support, any work they
do on the book will be on their own time. Also, when completed, the
textbook will not have a course at UW where it can be used, tested, re-
vised, and enhanced.

    Ensuring future success: request a statement of departmental support
as part of the project proposal process.

Factor 2: Project Management
Project management is a key success factor in any open textbook project.
One advantage of working with the Rebus Foundation has been the avail-
ability of Rebus staff to provide project management support. Once a text-
book project is launched, Rebus staff will periodically check in with authors
on their progress, particularly if a task has yet to be completed. In retro-
spect, it would also have been helpful to have an established timeline and
benchmarks at the outset of the project. This would be particularly useful
for projects for which content creation is part of the project. The Marlowe
and Kioko textbook was successful despite the lack of an established project
timeline, but the Ketchley and Thompson textbook was less successful and
likely would have benefited from a more structured approach.

    Ensuring future success: create a timeline and benchmarks during
the project initiation phase. Check on progress periodically throughout
the project.

Factor 3: Authorship Plan
Another way to increase success would be to establish clear expectations
for authors at the outset of the project. In a Rebus Open Textbook project,
authors can take on a variety of roles. For example, one project might have
a lead author who creates an outline of their proposed textbook and co-
ordinates co-authors to contribute content, while another project might
have one or two primary authors who contribute all the content and only
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  427

reach out to collaborators for peer review. Other models might require
the authors to outsource other work such as graphic design or proof-
reading, either through the Rebus Community or via other channels. By
creating an authorship plan at the beginning of a project, one can ensure
that authors understand what is expected of them and that the plan will fit
within their own capacity to do the necessary work of the project within
the established project timeline.

    Ensuring future success: create an authorship plan during the project
initiation phase.

Factor 4: Ready Content
Another factor that appeared to be a predictor of success in this iteration
of the pilot was the existence of content that was already written and
ready to load into Pressbooks. Marlowe and Koiko had at least half of the
chapters written when they began their project, and all they needed was a
publishing platform to make their open textbook concept a reality. For the
Ketchley and Thompson project, very little content was already written
and ready to input into Pressbooks when they began. This was certainly a
factor in the more rapid completion of the Marlowe and Kioko project.

    Ensuring future success: include a question on future application
forms asking how much content has been written.

Factor 5: Platform Ease of Use
Pressbooks, the publishing platform being used by the Rebus Community,
is so easy to use it almost became an "invisible" factor in the UW Open
Textbook Publishing Pilot. The authors quickly adapted to Pressbooks,
had very few questions about how to use it, and provided generally posi-
tive feedback on the platform. It is notable, however, that neither of these
projects necessitated mathematical equations, embedded videos or inter-
active elements. Both projects were text-based: the Marlowe and Kioko
project included graphs and images, while the Ketchley and Thompson
project included hyperlinks that necessitated a plan for creating stable
links to web content.

    Ensuring future success: continue to use Rebus Pressbooks for text-
based projects.
428  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Factor 6: Network of Peers
Marlowe was easily able to identify peer reviewers for his open textbook
and the Rebus project team was surprised by how many of his colleagues
volunteered. If this had not been the case, the project could have stalled in
the peer review phase. In embarking on future projects, it would be wise
to identify a mechanism for finding peer reviewers at the outset of the
project, if not the potential reviewers themselves.

    Ensuring future success: add a question on future application forms
asking how peer reviewers will be identified.

Factor 7: Incentive Grant
A goal of the Rebus Community is to support the entire publishing
process, from writing and design to review and marketing of the open
textbook. Therefore, any funding that is secured to support the open
textbook project can be offered purely as an incentive to the author(s).
Numerous grant-funded OER projects across the country have shown that
even a relatively small grant can act as an incentive for faculty to engage
in OER work, including open textbook creation. In our case, the Friends
of the Libraries Grant of $1,500 per project was a successful incentive.

    Ensuring future success: continue to offer incentive grants for open
textbook projects.

Current and Future Directions
The UW Open Textbook Pilot entered a second phase in April 2018,
after the pilot coordinators applied for and were awarded $10,000 from
the UW Libraries Kenneth S. and Faye G. Allen Endowment to explore
the role of open textbooks in library collections. A request for proposals
to create or significantly adapt an open textbook went out to all faculty
across the three UW campuses. Proposals will be reviewed in late April
and award recipients will be notified in May. This second phase pilot will
not require authors to participate in the Rebus Community, but will sup-
port participation if an appropriate project emerges.

    At the same time, the Rebus Foundation is in the process of launching
a new platform for the Rebus Community. The new platform is intended
to "enable global open textbook creators to collaborate on open textbook
projects" (Rebus Community, 2018). The launch is anticipated to occur
in May of 2018, and individuals who are interested in continued devel-
Transforming Publishing with a Little Help From Our Friends  429

opments are encouraged to explore the Rebus Community website and
attend or view Rebus Office Hours. More information and opportuni-
ties to get involved in Rebus are available on the community website,
https://about.rebus.community/.

Reflections on the UW Open Textbook Pilot Project
The UW Open Textbook Pilot Project scratched the surface of the excit-
ing potential for the Rebus approach to textbook publishing to transform
higher education. Imagine the future: an open textbook is created by a
community of faculty who all teach similar classes across the world. The
textbook creation project itself acts as a catalyst for faculty collabora-
tion across institutions. The community of co-creators for each textbook
is formed and stays connected through the Rebus Community. Open
textbooks are hosted by institutional networks or library consortia that
are connected into a larger Rebus Pressbooks network. Peer-reviewed,
published editions are available for printing or download through multi-
ple vendors and platforms. The publishing platform being developed by
Rebus is free to use, so in order to make the Rebus staffing model sustain-
able, students might have to pay a small amount for access to a textbook
(i.e. $10 to download; $35 to print). However, they will then have in-
definite access to that edition, as well as free, open access to an online
version. New models of teaching with textbooks emerge--faculty use open
pedagogical practices to engage their students with the textbook, either
adapting it to create new versions or iteratively updating the original text-
book. In this way, student course output is used to further future student
learning instead of going into disposable homework assignments. The
textbook itself continues to evolve, drawing new content from the experts
and learners who use it.

    Academic librarians have an important role to play in this evolving
open textbook ecosystem. In the current formative phase of the Rebus
Community, librarians can be crucial catalysts and connectors. Advance-
ment offices in academic libraries often have funds like the UW Friends
of the Libraries Grant that can be leveraged to catalyze a new open text-
book creation project. The support provided by Rebus staff removes much
of the onus of project management from the librarian, making the project
more feasible for a person who has many other competing responsibilities.
430  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

Librarians can also act as catalysts by providing general OER education
and advocacy on their campuses, generating enthusiasm for and interest
in OER among faculty and librarian colleagues. Also, liaison librarians are
naturally connected to faculty in the subject areas they represent, so li-
brarians are well positioned to reach out to potential project collaborators.
Over time, open textbooks might gain a place in academic library collec-
tions that commercial textbooks traditionally have not had, given their
disposable, multi-edition nature. What might it look like for an academic
library to collect, or even publish, a textbook that is ever-evolving and
openly available online? These questions and others will surface as more
open textbooks are created and need to be curated, so academic librarians
must continue to be engaged and involved in the open textbook move-
ment as it progresses.

It has been 10 years since a group of visionaries published the Cape Town
Open Education Declaration, an international call to action that begins
with the words, "We are on the cusp of a global revolution in teaching and
learning."1 The Declaration outlines a powerful vision of a world where
everyone, everywhere, has access to a wealth of educational opportunities,
and where teachers and learners work to shape knowledge together. Over
the last decade, this vision has spread from a small group of innovators to
a worldwide movement to make education better through open content
and practices. In North American higher education, it is difficult to imag-
ine what the movement would look like without the inspired, dedicated
work of academic libraries.

Librarians as Leaders
Reflecting on this collection of case studies and my own decade-long ex-
perience as an open educational resources (OER) advocate, I'm struck by
just how rapidly academic libraries have become a pillar in the open edu-
cation movement. I first intersected with the library community in 2009,
as a panelist at a SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources
Coalition)/ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries) forum
on OER. I was leading a national student campaign at the time, and admit-
tedly had not given any thought to the potential role libraries could play
in open education. Based on the discussion at the forum, neither had most
of the librarians in the room. While most seemed aware of the high cost

1 For the full text of the Declaration, see:
http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/
434  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

of textbooks--students had been lining up at the reference desk seeking
relief for years--textbooks were considered outside the domain of the li-
brary, and a tangent to open access in a research context.

    This begun to change quickly. Seeds planted during these early discus-
sions grew into some of the first prominent library-led OER initiatives,
including those at Temple University and the University of Massachusetts
Amherst, which were quickly replicated elsewhere (Allen, Bell, & Billings
2014). Concurrently, the explosion of interest in the idea of MOOCs
(massive open online courses) and launch of e-textbook platforms by
major publishers drew libraries--which had been navigating the issues
surrounding digital content licensing for years--into institutional conver-
sations about course materials in a significant way for the first time.

    Library interest in OER seemed to hit an inflection point in 2014,
when the Open Education Conference--the North American OER com-
munity's largest annual event--introduced a track focused on the role of
libraries in advancing OER. Just a few short years later, academic libraries
are now one of the primary forces driving the open education movement
and lead some of the most vibrant, successful OER initiatives across North
America. I often describe libraries as the "missing link" in that they have
truly helped the rubber hit the road for open education on campus.

Building a Movement
As evidenced throughout this book, academic libraries interface with OER
in myriad ways. As experts on finding and curating information resources,
librarians help faculty and students locate high-quality OER that meet
their needs. Academic technology and publishing divisions within the li-
brary provide support for publishing and adapting resources. Scholarly
communication and copyright librarians help navigate open licensing and
fair use. Repository specialists assist with archiving, version control,
preservation, and delivery to students. Teaching and learning staff pro-
vide professional development support for faculty, including how to bring
OER to life through open pedagogy.

    Libraries also occupy a unique position at the crossroads of campus,
and thus can serve as powerful conveners of campus-wide activities. They
are the key point of intersection between academic departments and in-
terface regularly with students, faculty, and staff alike. While the specific
Closing Reflections  435

capacities and activities vary from institution to institution, academic li-
braries are increasingly the keystone to successful OER initiatives.

    Multiple case studies presented in this book underscore the impor-
tance of cultivating allies among campus constituencies. Chief among
them is faculty, where identifying champions and early adopters who
can influence their peers is often the first critical step. OER grant pro-
grams in particular have proved an effective strategy for bringing in
faculty, whether at a larger scale like the case of the University of Ok-
lahoma or a smaller one as presented by Rollins College. Students too
are essential allies as the ultimate beneficiaries of OER. Students can tell
compelling personal stories that motivate faculty, as illustrated by the
University of Texas San Antonio's use of student testimonials in OER
workshops. Student leaders can also be influential partners in spreading
the word and convincing decision-makers, as shown by the University
of Saskatchewan's advocacy work. Other important stakeholders include
the bookstore, academic technology, and disability services, each of which
make vital contributions to a campus-wide movement.

    Raising awareness of OER is another critical step. A number of chap-
ters cite Allen and Seaman's 2016 finding that about a quarter of U.S.
faculty are aware of OER. This tends to be presented from a glass half
empty perspective--that most faculty remain unaware of OER--but it can
also be viewed as a sign of considerable progress, given that the move-
ment was built from the ground up and continues to grow. Yet, Geoffrey
A. Moore's theory of the technology adoption life cycle reminds us that
the most difficult part of scaling innovation is "crossing the chasm" be-
tween early adopters and the mainstream (Moore, 1999). The kinds of
messages and incentives that brought in early adopters may not resonate
with a broader audience the same way, so it is essential that OER efforts
continue to adapt. Academic librarians can help make the case for OER
to a mainstream audience by focusing on the important ends that OER
achieves, whether that is better student outcomes, greater ownership over
course content, or expanding access to knowledge.

Sustaining Progress
A common thread throughout this book is a sense of both having come
a long way and also having a long way to go. Having achieved significant
436  OER: A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS

outcomes in terms of student savings and access to course materials, li-
braries are now grappling with next steps to sustain and scale these efforts
long-term. Some challenges are more local, including access to funding
and staff time, and some are more global, such as how to build--and gov-
ern--infrastructure to support collaboration, discovery, and sharing both
within and across institutions.

    Models for publishing and curating OER are a key area of focus as aca-
demic libraries look to the future. This book contains several examples of
successful pilots, including the University of Washington's open textbook
publishing program. While these efforts tend to be resource-intensive at
first, there are potential efficiencies to be gained through cross-institu-
tional collaboration, communities of practice, and support services. The
Rebus Foundation and the community of practice discussed by Hare et
al. take promising steps in this direction. OER creation ties into broader
conversations around library publishing, institutional repositories, and
changes to incentive structures to support open practices. Much can be
learned from advances in the scholarly publishing space, although educa-
tion publishing comes with its own unique set of challenges. For OER,
important considerations for libraries will include accessibility, adaptation
and version control, and the availability of ancillary materials.

    Another frontier is how to institutionalize OER efforts on campus,
starting within the library organization itself. Thus far, libraries have
taken different pathways to incorporating open education into library
staff responsibilities, whether it is adding it to the scope of scholarly
communications, appointing an open education coordinator, or build-
ing open education into the duties of liaison and reference staff. There
is also the question of what kind of training and professional devel-
opment is needed to build this capacity. SPARC's own contribution to
this space is our newly launched Open Education Leadership Program,2
which recognizes that a large part of open education librarianship is
becoming an advocate and convener. Many of the core skills and capac-
ities needed to support open education already exist within the library
and elsewhere on campus, and the key is establishing the library as a

locus of expertise that can connect and guide the various pieces into a
greater whole.

Evolving into the Future
Ten years ago the drafters of the Cape Town Declaration expressed a feel-
ing of being on the cusp of radical change. Looking back, the process has
been less of a revolution and more of an evolution--small experiments grow-
ing into larger ones that build on learning and best practices toward a
more open future. To that end, we must remember that open is a process,
not an endpoint. Openness is not an end in itself but rather a means to
improve teaching and learning practices, to instill the values of inclusivity
and access, and to achieve broader societal benefits that flow from ad-
vanced technology and an improved educational system. Libraries are well
positioned to be the engine for this change within education and research
institutions, moving toward systems that are open by default.
