YOUR MOST IMPACTFUL
CLASS

Why Business Communication Matters

STORY

The Risk That Paid Off

"When people ask me, `What was the most impactful class you took during your MBA?' they are often
surprised by my answer," wrote Alex Galbraith, now a brand manager at Hershey. "To improve my business
writing skills, I made the difficult decision to enroll in an undergraduate business communications class. I
was the lone MBA among undergraduates, seemingly learning grammar for the first time, and lacking the
crutch of the MBA grading curve. But that decision created lasting impacts that extend well beyond the
classroom as I now apply those principles each day."
Alex's story is not about grammar drills or academic humility. It's about transformation. Business
communication is not just a set of skills--it's the foundation for leadership, career acceleration, and lifelong
influence.

MAIN IDEA

The Currency of Success

Business communication is the currency of success. The ability to think clearly, write concisely, and speak
persuasively is what transforms technical competence into leadership. This course is not a hoop. It's a hinge
--one that can open doors for the rest of your life.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Why communication matters more than ever in the AI economy
      What employers and leaders expect from strong communicators
      How this course can enhance your career, leadership, and relationships
      What it means to be a top hire, an effective leader, and a relationship builder

REASONS

Why Communication Is a Career
Advantage

1. Communication Is a Career Multiplier

Nina Legath, Head of Internal Global Communications at Adidas, explains that knowing information isn't
enough. Today's business leaders must inspire, connect, and lead through communication. In a world where

                                                                                                                                                                7
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

automation accelerates, human expression becomes more valuable.

2. You'll Be More Employable

McKinsey's global study on the future of work in the AI economy identified communication and critical
thinking as key cognitive capabilities for success. Likewise, the National Association of Colleges and
Employers (NACE) ranks written and verbal communication among the top five skills employers seek.
Even in an AI-powered world, clear writing demonstrates clear thinking. Employers aren't just skimming
résumés--they're assessing your communication skills through interviews, emails, reports, and team
dynamics.

3. Communication Makes You a Leader

Zenger and Folkman, authors of The Extraordinary Leader, found that powerful communicators also score
highly in other leadership competencies--even in unrelated areas like technical proficiency. Communication
doesn't just complement leadership--it unlocks it.
Dr. Susan Madsen of Utah State University reminds us: leadership can be developed. If you want to lead, start
by learning to communicate well.

4. Communication Builds Relationships That Matter

From pitching ideas to resolving conflict, from mentoring a peer to managing a team, your ability to connect
with others will shape your success and well-being. Communication is not just professional--it's profoundly
personal. The same skills that help you lead a project will help you strengthen a community, encourage a
friend, or advocate for a cause.
As Noreena Hertz explains in The Lonely Century, meaningful human connection is becoming rare--and
more valuable than ever.

TASK

What You'll Practice in This Course

      Analyze business problems and write clear, actionable recommendations
      Deliver oral presentations that inspire action and demonstrate credibility
      Collaborate professionally in teams using modern communication tools
      Use generative AI ethically and effectively to improve your work
      Develop a portfolio of communication artifacts that reflect your growth
Whether you're an undergraduate preparing for your first job or a graduate student like Alex Galbraith
aiming to sharpen your edge, this class is your invitation to master the skill that amplifies all others.

                                                                                                                                                                8
BRAND

Build Your Reputation

STORY

Personal Brand and Crisis Leadership

In March 2020, as COVID-19 brought global travel to a standstill, Marriott hotels faced an overnight collapse in
bookings and growing uncertainty among thousands of employees. Investors were anxious. Workers were
scared. The world was watching how corporate leaders would respond.
Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson released a video message
that set a tone of resilience and transparency. Visibly
fatigued from recent cancer treatment, he delivered
sobering news with grace and transparency: massive
revenue losses, halted hiring, executive pay cuts--
including his own.
He didn't sugarcoat. He didn't spin. And in doing so, he
modeled what a resilient, trusted leader looks like under
pressure.

    "This is the most challenging
    crisis we have ever faced... But
    we will get through it
    together--and we will come out of it stronger."

His personal brand was grounded in humanity, steadiness, and clear-eyed optimism.

MAIN IDEA

Your Brand Is the Story People Tell
About You

You already have a personal brand. It's not your major or your resume--it's the impression you leave behind
in class discussions, group projects, emails, job interviews, and social media posts. A strong brand opens
doors. It builds trust, generates opportunities, and helps others remember you for the right reasons.
Deliberately building and enhancing your brand is worth the effort. In today's challenging job market,
employers aren't just hiring skillsets--they're hiring reputations and potential. That means your online
presence, your relationships, and your ability to articulate your values matter.

                                                                                                                                                                9
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Perhaps most importantly, doing the work to determine and build your brand helps you become a valued
leader at home and in your community, not just your workplace.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Discover and define your personal brand.
      Align your online presence with that brand.
      Build a brand through relationships and service.
      Use your brand to stand out in the job search.
      Stay ready and keep growing.

REASONS

How to Build a Brand That Works for
You

1. Discover Your Brand

What are your natural strengths? These could be technical skills like data analysis or writing, or soft skills like
empathy and attention to detail. The CliftonStrengths Assessment can help identify your top talents, but
informal feedback is just as valuable. Ask a few trusted friends or mentors: What three words would you use
to describe me?

Then, get clear about your core values. Is service important to you? Creativity? Responsibility? Social
psychologist Amy Cuddy notes that affirming your values boosts your self-esteem and lowers stress. When
you act from your values, you tap into the power to influence others.

When you identify and live your core values--like Sorenson's steadiness and responsibility--you're not just
preparing for a job; you are preparing to lead.

2. Align Your Online Presence

Your brand is more than your digital footprint--but your digital presence still matters. In fact, it might be
your only chance to make a first impression. Employers and recruiters will likely Google you before an
interview, and what they find should support your brand. Try this: open a private or incognito browser
window and search your name. What do you see?

So in this competitive job market--especially for recent graduates--proactively manage your online
presence. Employers are not only looking for reasons to eliminate candidates but also for positive indicators
that support hiring decisions. A well-curated online profile can enhance your employability, and negative
elements may eliminate you from consideration.

3. Build Relationships That Reinforce Your Brand

A brand grows through consistent action and by building relationships. Think of networking as giving, not
asking. Attend events. Join clubs. Sit next to someone new. Ask questions. Find mentors. Help put away
chairs. According to Harvard economist Arthur C. Brooks, the act of helping others not only builds goodwill, it
actually makes you happier.

As you take these steps to connect, remember that relationships are reciprocal. Your professors, coworkers,
and community leaders are often eager to help. But before you seek guidance, clearly articulate your
strengths, interests, and goals. When others see your potential, they're more likely to invest in it.

Trusted leaders like Sorensen didn't build their brand alone. He built credibility by investing in people,
listening deeply, and staying visible-long before he became CEO. You are doing the same when you ask
good questions, show up prepared, and treat every team member with respect. People remember those
qualities.

4. Use Your Brand in the Job Hunt

                                                                                                                                                              10
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Strong brands stand out. When you know who you are and what you bring to the table, you can more easily
craft an elevator pitch, tailor your resume, and write a persuasive cover letter. Don't just list past tasks--
highlight the sometimes obscure details that reflect your interests and values. Volunteering as a Little
League coach or running problem-solving retreats shows, rather than tells, who you are.
Use platforms like Handshake, a career platform focused on college students and recent graduates, to
connect with employers seeking students and alumni. Also, build and maintain a profile on LinkedIn, the
world's largest professional network, to reach a broader, career-minded audience.
When Sorenson spoke during the crisis, his credibility made people listen. As a student, you can start
building that credibility by properly framing your experiences--clearly, humbly, and confidently.

5. Stay Ready and
Keep Growing

Your brand isn't static. As you gain
experience, refine your skills, and expand
your network, your brand should evolve
too. One way to express that evolving
story is through a short, memorable
introduction--an elevator pitch. Practice
this 30-45 second summary of who you
are, what you're working on, and what
you're aiming for until it sounds natural,
not rehearsed.
Augment your practice by using Big
Interview or StandOut to prepare for
interviews where you should not only tell
but also show who you are. And most
importantly, keep showing up and
contributing. Your brand becomes
stronger every time you act in alignment
with it.

TASK

Define and Live Your Brand Now

You are not a Fortune 500 CEO--yet. But you are someone with a brand. Like Sorenson, your defining
moments will reveal what kind of leader you are becoming.

    "You are always communicating your brand--whether
    you mean to or not."

Your personal brand is your most valuable career asset. Define your values, polish your presence, build
relationships through service, and tell your story with confidence. When the spotlight turns your way-
whether in a job interview, a team conflict, or a chance to lead-your brand will enable you to succeed.

                                                                                                                                                              11

Use the Tool; Keep the Human

 STORY

JP Morgan Chase's Real-World
Advantage

  In 2024, JPMorgan Chase gave over 200,000 employees access to a proprietary generative AI platform
  called IndexGPT. But the goal wasn't to replace employees--it was to empower them. Marketing and
  operations professionals began using the tool to organize client reports, simplify regulatory updates, and
  sharpen client-facing messaging.
  As one executive shared in an interview, "This isn't about cutting headcount. It's about helping people
  work smarter, faster, and with more clarity."
  The results? Increased productivity, faster internal reviews, and clearer communication with
  stakeholders. Professionals who adopted the tool early began standing out--not because AI replaced
  their skills, but because they used it to amplify their work.

 MAIN IDEA

                                                                                                                                                              13

AI Can Enhance Your Writing--But it
Can't Think for You

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot are changing the way people write. They
can help brainstorm, rephrase, summarize, and revise. But they don't replace the need to understand the
task and formulate a clear message.
This chapter helps you use AI as a business tool--one that boosts productivity without replacing your
judgment.

    "Generative AI won't take your job--but someone who
    knows how to use it better than you will."

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Use AI to enhance your business writing
      Write effective prompts using chain-of-thought reasoning
      Collaborate with AI on storytelling while avoiding generic traps
      Stay ethical and protect your voice and credibility

REASONS

Getting the Best from AI Without
Losing Your Voice

1. Use AI to Enhance Your Writing

Do the work to become absolutely clear on your message before you engage with AI. This ensures that
you are driving the creative process. Once clear, use AI to assist with idea generation, structure, tone-
checking, or revising.

Use AI for productivity. Rely on your brain for clarity, tone, and accuracy.

      Drafting a complicated professional email or memo
      Condensing something verbose

                                                                                                                                                            14

      Adjusting your draft to a more appropriate tone
But if you let it do all the work, your writing will sound generic. Worse, you won't develop the
communication skills real employers value most.

2. Master the Art of Prompting

Prompting is giving instructions to an AI model. But highly effective prompts are precise, specific, and
well-structured.
Example 1: Weak Prompt"Write an email to reschedule
a meeting with a client."

Example 2: Strong Prompt

"Act as a sales team lead writing to a client who
missed a meeting. Write a friendly, professional
email that reschedules the meeting and reaffirms
our interest in working together. Keep it under 150
words."
Practice building prompts like a manager assigning
a task. Clear instructions with adequate context and
step-by-step directions yield better results. For
complicated projects, use chain-of-thought prompting.

Example 1: Brain-dump Prompt

"Summarize this article, write an email about it, make it sound professional, fix the tone, and also suggest
some catchy subject lines."

Example 2: Chain-of-thought Prompt

"We're going to prepare a summary for Global Reach, an important
new client.

      Step 1: Summarize the article I'll upload into three bullet points for
      a business audience.
      Step 2: Based on that summary, write a short email that explains
      the key points to a supply chain client of ours, highlighting how
      our services can help them.
      Step 3: Suggest three possible subject lines for the email.
At this point, upload the article you referred to in your prompt.

3. Storytelling with Generative AI

AI's training on fiction makes it prone to produce dramatic, over-the-top intros--like "Imagine you're a sea
captain navigating stormy waters..." Avoid the `Sea Captain' Trap. You're writing business insights, not movie
trailers.

Better approach: Collaborate with AI. Don't let it lead.

      "Give me real-world examples of companies solving this problem in the last two years."
      "Here's a true story about our client. Help me frame it around opportunity cost."
      "Suggest three ways to introduce a business case without sounding fictional."

Use AI to structure or expand your story--but supply the substance yourself.

    "AI can help tell the story--but only you know what's
    worth telling."

4. Stay Ethical--and Be Wise

Generative AI isn't magic. It's trained on public data, which means

Use your judgment. If you use AI to help write something:

                                                                                                                                                              16
                              MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Watch out for the following:

Also, don't upload private or confidential info into certain AI systems--your data may be stored or used for
training.

Someday our use of AI will be assumed, but during this transition period, cite your use of AI transparently to

TASK

Use AI Wisely

As you prepare a research-based business article or write professional messages, try this:
      Use AI to help you brainstorm or revise one of your writing assignments. Then reflect:
      What did the AI get right?
      What did you need to change?
      What did you gain from using AI? What did you lose?
      Did using AI make your thinking better, or just faster?

Just like JPMorgan's analysts, your edge isn't in replacing your writing with AI--it's in using it well to create
clearer, more strategic business communication.
As you practice writing, think of AI as a tool in your toolbox. But the architect? That's still you.

 STORY

Who's Your Audience?

  Duolingo didn't start out as a viral sensation. It was just another language-learning app until it found its
  stride on TikTok by speaking the language of its users and meeting their needs expertly. By turning its
  green owl mascot, Duo, into a chaotic, funny, and deeply relatable character, Duolingo connected with
  millions of Gen Z users.
  They didn't go viral by guessing--they got curious. They watched how their audience talked, laughed,
  and learned. Then they adjusted everything--tone, timing, visuals, even their mascot--to match.

     "What they [Duolingo] really do well is motivation,"
     says Kirsty Gibson. "Ultimately learning a language is
     learning a language--it's not like you're reinventing
     the different words that people have to learn, but
     they're reimagining the way in which you're engaging
     people."

         Learn your audience's preferences, quirks, concerns, and interests.
         Craft your message to address those, either explicitly or implicitly.
         Draw a clear connection between your request and a benefit to your audience.

                                                                                                                                                              19

Good Communication Is Always
the Audience

You might be the one creating the message, but your audience is the
one interpreting it. Success isn't about how hard you worked on it--it's
about whether they understand it, care about it, and know what to do
next.

Your ideas can be powerful, but only if they land with your audience. If
you don't understand their knowledge, expectations, and reactions,
your message might fall flat--or misfire entirely.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Identify your primary and secondary audiences
      Understand what your audience knows, feels, and needs to do
      Craft messages that make saying yes easy

REASONS

How to Know & Reach Your Audience

1. Who's in the Room (or Inbox)?

Every message has at least one primary audience--the main person or group you're targeting. Most
messages also have secondary audiences: colleagues who are copied on communication, e.g.,
stakeholders who hear the presentation later, or customers who view a summary slide.

Do some background research to determine the most effective audience for your message. Asking that
nice guy in accounting to approve your budget may be most comfortable, but if only Karen can actually
approve it, write to Karen.

Digital and public communication is rarely private. If it's recorded, forwarded, or posted, others may
encounter it. So plan for that wider reach.
The Duolingo team didn't just target language learners--they targeted language learners on TikTok. They
knew the platform's users weren't looking for grammar tips--they were looking for laughs, trends, and
relatable chaos. That meant rethinking everything about their tone and delivery.

                                                                                                                                                              20

2. What Does Your Audience Know / Feel / Do?

KNOW

Don't assume your audience shares your context or vocabulary. If you use acronyms or jargon your audience
doesn't understand, or omit crucial details, they may feel confused or annoyed and tune out. This
phenomenon, The Curse of Knowledge--asserts that once we know something, we forget what it's like not to
know it.
Imagine if Duolingo had launched with educational jargon instead of memes. "Interactive lexical scaffolding"
wouldn't have gone viral. Duo threatening to eat your family if you skip your Spanish lesson? That did. They
dropped the academic language and spoke like humans.

 TIP

     Try to remember what it felt like your first day on the job, or
     how it feels to receive a confusing request. You might find it
     easier to say no than to hunt down the required information.
     Only use technical language you're sure your audience
     shares.
     Examples, comparisons, and visuals are very powerful. AI can
     create tailored analogies for any audience.

Jargon Example

 TIP

   The False Consensus Effect

   We're deeply in our own heads and often believe that others
   think like we do. That assumption can create serious
   communication misfires.

     Am I taking for granted that they agree with me?
     Do I need to explain my reasoning more clearly?
     Would someone outside my team understand this?

 ACTIVITY

  Try Warren Buffett's trick: When writing Berkshire Hathaway's
  annual report, he imagines he's explaining it to his sisters. That
  mental picture keeps his language accessible and sincere--
  even when the content is complex.

FEEL

Is your audience skeptical, stressed, enthusiastic, distracted? Emotions influence how people receive your
message. If you anticipate resistance, address concerns openly and with empathy. Attention and
compassion can make you a powerful leader.

If you're delivering bad news, acknowledge the audience's frustration and seek to mitigate harm with
compassion, offers of reasonable help, or links to resources. If you're making a request, show how it benefits
them and the organization. If you know your audience has constrained resources, acknowledge that and
show appreciation for their efforts despite challenges. Meet emotion with respect.

Duolingo brilliantly tapped into emotion--not by being earnest, but by being hilarious. Their brand became a
release valve for the stress of language learning. They didn't just teach--they entertained. And the result?
Millions kept coming back.

People want to feel positive and optimistic about the future. Instead of complaining about challenges,
propose specific solutions. Paint a picture of a better future and show how your plan gets them there.
Position yourself as a partner in progress, not a drain on resources. Applying this concept, known as framing,
will help your audiences see how your communication benefits them.

DO

Some messages aim to motivate or convince. Others simply aim to inform, direct, or clarify. In both cases,
your audience still needs to know what to do next. A meeting recap might ask participants to update a
shared doc. A report might tell readers where to find more data. A policy update might remind staff to log
into a training module. These aren't pitches or pleas--they're instructions that make action possible. Even
the clearest information falls flat if the audience doesn't know what to do with it.

Duolingo's calls to action are audience-smart. Their TikToks don't beg people to download the app--they
make people laugh so they go looking for it. When your audience feels understood,

3. Make Saying Yes Easy

How you craft your message can make saying yes hard or easy. Strategically provide everything your
audience needs to decide in your favor. Sure, they can think through the benefits and risks of your proposal
or do a quick web search to get the information they need, but why should they?

Duolingo didn't expect people to be curious--they made curiosity effortless. Their short videos deliver
punchlines, not pitches. The humor builds affinity, and that affinity makes it easy to say yes to opening the
app, subscribing, or sticking with a streak.

If you make saying yes easy, audiences will want to engage--even without being asked directly. The table
below provides a few examples for you to follow.

TASK

Take Five Before You Communicate

      Who is my main audience?
      What do they already know?
      How might they feel?
      What do I want them to do?
      What would make it easy for them?

Every message is a chance to show your audience that you see them. Like Duolingo, your success lies in
being relevant. That's what makes communication powerful--and human.

Know Your Purpose

STORY

Microsoft's Big Decision

In early 2019, Microsoft found itself falling behind in artificial intelligence. Its internal tools couldn't compete
with emerging innovations from smaller players--especially a nonprofit lab called OpenAI. After testing
OpenAI's models and benchmarking them against in-house efforts, Microsoft made a bold decision. Rather
than build or buy, they partnered.
They carefully evaluated four paths: keep building, acquire another company, partner with OpenAI, or do
nothing. Using a structured analysis based on speed to market, strategic fit with Azure, technical capability,
and risk, Microsoft chose to invest a whopping $1 billion in OpenAI in July 2019. Over the next four years, they
deepened the partnership, ultimately investing over $10 billion by 2023.
This structured, careful decision paid off: Microsoft leapfrogged competitors, integrated GPT models into
Office products, and saw its market cap soar.

MAIN IDEA

Good Communication Is Always About
the Audience

In business, your message can inform, persuade, or recommend. But if you choose the wrong strategy, even
great ideas won't land. Knowing your purpose--and your audience's needs--is the key to being clear,
credible, and effective.

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Inform others clearly, concisely, and objectively
      Persuade others using trust, emotion, and logic
      Recommend credible business solutions based on evidence and structure

REASONS

Match the Strategy to the Situation

1. Inform: Communicate Clearly, Concisely, and
Objectively

When your audience needs to understand something--data, updates, policies--you're informing. Be neutral,
factual, and specific. Avoid loaded language or framing that pushes an agenda.

      Use plain language and audience-focused explanations.
      Provide context ("To put that in perspective...").
      Simplify complex numbers with analogies. Ask AI to create a helpful analogy for your specific audience.
Stanford business professor and author Chip Heath, in his book Making Numbers Count, encourages
communicators to "translate everything." When sharing numbers, look for ways to say, "That means..." or
"Think of it this way..." so your audience stays grounded in meaning, not math.

When You Deliver Bad News

Delivering bad news is one of the hardest tasks in professional communication. It's uncomfortable.
Employees often fear hurting someone's feelings or sounding cold--and sometimes delay or sugarcoat the
message so much that it causes more confusion or stress.
Here are some guidelines to help:

      Be direct--but respectful. Don't hide the bad news behind vague language. Use a clear subject line or
      opening sentence.
      Use the right tone. Avoid over-apologizing or sounding overly casual. Aim for empathy and
      professionalism.
      Choose your medium wisely. Sensitive or high-impact news should not be delivered over Slack or text.
      Often, a short meeting or phone call is best.

Contrast Example

To a customer: "We're reaching out to let you know that your delivery, originally scheduled for Friday, will now
arrive Monday due to unexpected supply chain disruptions. We understand this delay may cause
inconvenience, and we're working to ensure timely service going forward. Thank you for your patience."

                                                                                                                                                              26
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

To a vendor: "After a thorough review of our vendor partnerships, we've decided not to renew our contract at
the end of this quarter. We appreciate your partnership and thank you for your work with us this year. Please
feel free to reach out if you need transition assistance."

Bad news handled well builds trust and relationships--even when it's difficult.

Like Microsoft did when evaluating OpenAI's performance, informing begins with clearly presenting data,
context, and comparisons-without pushing an agenda. The goal is clarity, not influence.

Once the audience understands the information, your next goal may be to move them toward an agreement
or action. That's where persuasion begins.

2. Persuade: Use Emotion, Credibility, and Logic

Just as Microsoft had to persuade internal stakeholders to pursue a bold new partnership, you'll often need to win
support for a single idea. To do that effectively, construct persuasive messages that rely on three tools: emotion,
credibility, and logic.

To persuade effectively, use:

      Pathos (emotion): Connect through stories, tone, and visual design. Harvard researcher Jennifer S. Lerner
      and her colleagues demonstrated that although we think we make rational decisions, most of us
      evaluate alternatives with our gut and emotions.
      Ethos (credibility): Although audiences generally decide based on pathos, the persuasion becomes
      stronger with ethos, which uses trustworthy information to persuade.Show your own expertise and cite
      trustworthy sources.
      Logos (logic): Provide clear reasoning and relevant evidence to support your argument, but beware
      common logical fallacies.

Knowing the tools--emotion, credibility, and logic--isn't enough. To persuade effectively, you need to use
them together. Emotion grabs attention and motivates action. Credibility builds trust. Logic justifies the
decision. On their own, each tool falls short--but combined, they reinforce one another. The most
compelling messages don't just appeal to the head or the heart--they do both, and they do it from a
trustworthy source.

That balance matters because, in reality, we don't make decisions the way we think we do.

We like to believe we're logical creatures, carefully weighing facts and making reasoned choices. But
research--and experience--tell a different story: our guts often make the call before our brains catch up. A
persuasive message might include airtight reasoning, but if it doesn't feel right--or come from someone we
trust--it's unlikely to land. The most effective communicators design their messages to resonate emotionally,
hold up logically, and come from a credible place.

Use the examples below to see how persuasive messages work best when they blend emotion, credibility, and
logic--not rely on just one. Notice how each element plays a different role in strengthening the message.

The same tools that build trust and inspire action can also be misused to manipulate or mislead. A story can
stir emotion without offering facts. A confident tone can fake credibility. A flawed argument can sound
logical if dressed up with jargon or data. That's why effective communicators don't just use these tools--they
also watch for misuse, in their own messages and others'.

Watch for manipulation: Persuasion isn't about pressure--it's about alignment.

To be truly persuasive--and ethical--you must recognize the difference between influence and
manipulation. That starts with learning how to spot common logical fallacies and credibility tricks that make
bad ideas sound good.

Persuasion helps your audience see and agree with your ideas. But persuasive messages typically present
one proposed solution. When multiple viable options exist--and a decision must be made--recommendation
becomes the better strategy. Recommendation guides your audience through a structured comparison and
leads them to the best choice through structured analysis.

                                                                                                                28

3. Recommend: Offer Structured, Evidence-Based
Solutions

Microsoft's high-level AI investment decision mirrored the same process you can use on a smaller scale.
Whether choosing software or proposing a new strategy, the principles remain the same.
When you recommend a course of action, your job is to guide decision-making. Usually, you're responding to
a request and offering a recommended solution based on structured analysis.
A strong objective recommendation accomplishes the following:

                                                                                                                                                              29
                    MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

      Defines the problem
      Presents multiple options
      Uses stakeholder-focused weighted criteria to compare alternatives
      Supports a final choice with data
      Articulates an implementation plan
      Identifies and mitigates risk

When you're recommending a course of action--especially when there's more than one good option--your
message must show how you made the decision. That's where a framework helps. One of the simplest and most
effective tools is a decision matrix: a table that helps you compare options using weighted criteria.

This kind of structured comparison is common in business. It doesn't just help you choose--it helps your
audience understand why your recommendation makes sense. You're not just saying "here's what I think"--
you're showing your reasoning in a transparent, logical way.

Sample Decision Matrix: Where Should
We Hold the Conference?

Try This: Create a decision matrix with 3 options and 3-5 criteria. Score each option and multiply by weighted
importance. The math won't decide for you--but it will clarify your thinking.

                                                                                                                30
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320
When multiple options exist, recommendation is often the best strategy. It's not just about what you think--
it's about how you got there. Use a framework like a decision matrix to show your thinking.

TASK

Use the Right Tool for the Job

Next time you prepare a message--email, presentation, proposal, or video--ask yourself:
      Am I informing? Be clear and neutral.
      Am I persuading? Blend emotion, logic, and credibility.
      Am I recommending? Offer structured analysis and evidence.

Strategic communicators don't just write--they decide. When you choose your approach with purpose, you
sharpen your thinking, clarify your message, and lead others toward action that matters.

                                                                                                                                                              31
RESEARCH

Find and Use Credible Sources

STORY

The Case of the Phantom Citations

In 2023, a lawyer representing a man injured by an airline submitted a 10-page legal brief citing several court
decisions in support of his case. The citations looked professional, the arguments sounded logical, and the
formatting was textbook perfect.
But there was a problem: none of the cited court cases existed. Every one of them had been made up--
hallucinated--by ChatGPT. The lawyer had relied on AI to generate the content, never checking the facts.
When the truth came out, the judge fined him, and his reputation took a hit. It wasn't just a legal failure--it
was a credibility collapse.
The lesson? In business, just like in law, your credibility is your currency.
And your credibility depends on using accurate, verifiable information.

MAIN IDEA

Research Strengthens Your Message

Smart communicators don't just have opinions--they have evidence. Research isn't just about finding facts;
it's about building trust, backing up your claims, and avoiding embarrassing (or costly) mistakes.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Search smarter--using surface and deep web tools

      Use AI tools wisely and responsibly
      Integrate, cite, and summarize evidence like a pro

REASONS

Build Research Skills That Strengthen
Your Voice

1. Where Should You Search?

There's more to research than Googling. Strong research pulls from both the surface web (free and accessible)
and the deep web (subscription databases and behind-the-scenes sources). (FYI: the dark web is the illegal
unsavory layer.)

                                                                                                                                                              32
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Primary research: Conducted firsthand (e.g., surveys, interviews, performance reports)
Secondary research: Based on existing data (e.g., journal articles, government reports)
Surface Web Tools: Google, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, corporate blogs, online news, podcasts
Deep Web Tools: Library databases like ProQuest, Business Source Premier, IBISWorld, Statista, Mintel, JSTOR
Use layered searching. Start with a broad Google query like "employee retention trends site:hbr.org" to get
familiar with the topic. Then move to ProQuest or IBISWorld to find data or whitepapers with deeper
authority. If you are unfamiliar with these terms, your university business librarians are certainly happy to
help you.

  TIP
   Search government and nonprofit sites for free, credible data:
   BLS.gov, census.gov, data.gov, FRED.stlouisfed.org, Pew
   Research, World Bank.

2. Evaluate Sources with the SIFT Method

You've found sources--now how do you know if they're good? The Phantom Citation lawyer skipped this
step. You won't.
Developed by University of Washington researcher Mike Caulfield, the SIFT method is a fast, modern way to
vet information.

      S - Stop: Ask if this is a good source--current, credible, and relevant.
      I - Investigate the source: Who's behind it?
      F - Find better coverage: Can you verify this elsewhere?
      T - Trace claims: Go back to the original source.

Example: Before quoting a viral LinkedIn post, trace it to the original source, evaluate its credibility, and seek
corroborating evidence--or don't use it.

3. Responsible AI Research

Used thoughtfully, AI tools can be a powerful part of your research workflow. You can ask them to summarize
a dense report, suggest better search terms, or even locate new sources. But they're only as reliable as the
data they were trained on--and they can make confident mistakes. Use AI to spark ideas, but always verify
facts through credible sources.

The lawyer who submitted a brief created by ChatGPT sincerely wished he'd followed this practice.

Before citing anything from an AI tool, ask and answer the following questions:

"AI can generate content--but it can't generate

                                                                                                                                                       36

    credibility."

4. Integrate, Summarize, and Cite Like a Pro

In business communication, integrating evidence is about credibility, not just citations. Strong
communicators present evidence clearly, accurately, and ethically.

Use signal phrases to build ethos.

"According to a 2024 McKinsey report on workplace retention..."
"Harvard Business Review's analysis of remote work trends shows..."

Use paraphrasing to simplify expert language.

Original: "Organizations adopting hybrid models experienced an uptick in mid-level manager burnout,
according to an internal IBM whitepaper."
Paraphrase: IBM found that hybrid teams saw more burnout among mid-level managers.

Use summaries for long content.

Summary: A Gartner survey found that over 60% of managers believe hybrid teams are less innovative.
Before you present any quote, statistic, or paraphrase, your audience needs to understand where it's coming
from and why it matters. The best communicators follow a simple three-step method: Introduce, Insert, and
Interpret.

Example: Introduce, Insert, Interpret

                                                                  Introduce: According to a 2024 McKinsey report on

                                                                  Insert: Companies that offer flextime saw a 33% drop in
                                                                  mid-level turnover.

                                                                  Interpret: This suggests that flexibility isn't just a perk--
                                                                  it's a retention strategy.

 attention.         and context.

Cite Ethically and Clearly.

Once you've selected strong sources and summarized them well, your next step is to clearly credit where
your information came from--and do it in a way your audience can easily follow. The formality, type, and
location of your citations depends on the message.

Format       How to Cite

White paper  Include formal endnotes or hyperlinks.
Slide deck   Embed source titles in small hyperlinked tags beneath visuals or stats.
Handout      Include a references page or list of clickable URLs.

Avoid Plagiarism--Even Accidentally. Rewording someone else's ideas without citation is plagiarism.

If you use AI tools in your research or writing process, include a citation such as: "Drafted in collaboration with
ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024)" or cite a specific output using a description and timestamp (e.g., ChatGPT
conversation, May 2025).

For formal citations, use Purdue OWL and your library's citation guides to correctly follow APA, MLA, or CMS
styles.

Use a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to provide persistent links on the changing web.

Don't let great research go to waste--or worse, get you into trouble. Ethical citation is about clarity, not just
compliance.

TASK

Research That Builds Trust

Before you share a stat, story, or claim in your next message, ask yourself:

      Who produced this information?
      Can I verify it with supplementary sources?

                                                                                                                     38
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

      Have I accurately cited or credited it?
Whether you're writing a white paper, pitch deck, or performance report, good research builds your
credibility. But--as with the lazy attorney letting ChatGPT prepare his brief--poor research can destroy it.

Show What Matters

STORY

The Solar System That Explained a City

In 2014, the Bay Area Bike Share program had six months of user data--but no clear insight into how to
improve their system. That changed when researcher and data designer Bjorn Vermeersch turned the data
into a visual powerhouse.
Vermeersch created a solar system-style graphic where each bike station was a planet, its size representing
trip volume and its orbit representing trip duration. The visualization revealed commuting patterns, system
bottlenecks, and underused docks--all at a glance.
City planners used it to make data-backed decisions that improved service, station locations, and system
efficiency.

Data doesn't speak for itself. Vermeersch made it make sense.

MAIN IDEA

Don't Just Show Data--Show What It
Means

In business, you're surrounded by data. But your job isn't just to present numbers--it's to help people
understand them.

                                                                                                                                                              41
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Visuals that clarify data are increasingly powerful tools to persuade and inspire action, and clarity is more
important than complexity.

Whether you're recommending a strategic change or reporting results, your credibility hinges on your ability
to interpret and communicate data clearly. You'll be expected to translate spreadsheets into insight and
guide decisions using visual storytelling.

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

In this chapter, you'll build the data literacy skills that help you inform and influence.

How to Visualize and Interpret Data

Why Data Literacy Matters

Every click, swipe, sensor, and sale creates data. But only people with data literacy--the ability to interpret
and communicate data--can turn it into insights that matter.

According to a Tableau/Forrester study, 87% of employees say data skills are critical for their jobs. But most
also say they don't feel confident using data.

Your career advantage? Learn to turn numbers into meaning.

From Solar Systems to Skill Sets

Vermeersch's visualization didn't just look good--it worked because he knew what kind of data he had, how
to interpret it, and how to clearly communicate it. You'll need those same skills. Let's start by understanding
the data you're working with.

Get to Know Data

Before you visualize or interpret data, you need to understand what kind of data you're working with. Think
of this stage like scouting a landscape before you draw a map. By taking time to understand your data's
structure, source, and purpose, you'll make stronger, more ethical decisions about how to use it.

Data Types

      Quantitative data is numerical (e.g., sales revenue, bounce rate, age).
      Qualitative data is descriptive and not numeric (e.g., customer reviews, interview transcripts, brand
      sentiment).
      Structured data fits neatly in rows and columns--think spreadsheets and databases.
      Unstructured data is messier--think video content, emails, or social media posts.
      Semi-structured data falls somewhere in between (e.g., JSON or XML files that have consistent markers
      but flexible content).

Where to Find the Data

Depending on your goals, data might come from the following:

      Government, nonprofit, or public sources: FRED, BLS, Census, Pew Research
      Business and financial sites: Yahoo! Finance, Statista
      Research platforms: Google Dataset Search, IPUMS

Collection Methods

Understanding how data was gathered helps determine its trustworthiness and relevance. For instance, if
you're writing about how calories affect body weight, you simply cannot make the same claims using data

                                                                                                                                                              42
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

you acquired from a self-report survey (since individuals tend to underreport their weight and intake) and
those from a tightly controlled scientific study.

      Surveys collect self-reported data from large groups
      Interviews provide in-depth, qualitative insights
      Experiments test hypotheses under controlled conditions
      Observational studies track behavior without interference
      Social listening pulls patterns from social media and online interactions
You don't need to be a data scientist--but you do need to understand what your data can (and can't) say.

Understand Your Data -- Vet Before You Plot

      Trace the source (first!): Who collected it, when, and why? If you can't answer, keep digging or choose a
      different dataset.
      Check fit: Ask, "Does this dataset answer the specific question my article must address?" If it's
      tangential, pass.
      Spot limits early: Note sampling gaps, outdated figures, or proxy variables so you can disclose them up-
      front rather than scramble later.

Interpret Before You Visualize -- Decide on the
Takeaway

      Write a one-sentence headline (talking title): Do this before opening any charting tool. If you can't state the
      insight plainly, you're not ready to visualize.
      Link to purpose: Ask, "How will this visual move my argument forward?" If the answer is "It won't," don't
      include it.
      Flag caveats: Plan a brief footnote or caption line that clarifies limitations--ethical transparency beats
      glossy perfection.

Make Meaning with Interpretation

Knowing the data, however, is not enough. Raw data does not tell your audience what the data means.
That's your job. Take the data you find and make it meaningful.
When interpreting data, ask questions that will help you understand the best way to use it (or indicate you
shouldn't use it):

      Who collected it--and why?
      Is the sample truly random or was it biased by convenience, quota, or purpose?
      What does the data imply that my reader should do?
      Do hidden assumptions or missing context affect this interpretation?
      What does my reader need to know to trust and act?

  TIP

                                                                                                                                                              43

           Understanding limitations = communicating ethically.

Show It Well: Data Visualization Best Practices

Now that you can ask the right questions, it's time to answer them visually. But not all charts clarify. In fact,
poorly designed visuals confuse or even deceive.

Good visuals do one job: they make data easier to understand. Study the best practices for displaying data by
observing what seems credible to you as you navigate information online, identifying the elements of
excellent data viz, and completing short courses.

Bjorn Vermeersch's satellite visualization of bike rentals in San Francisco wasn't just pretty; it accurately
mapped size and range onto a familiar planetary diagram, helping stakeholders make informed decisions
and improving the system for everybody.

Here are some data visual design basics:

Choose the right format. Although hundreds of creative chart types exist, three basics do most of the heavy
lifting. Use a bar chart for comparison, a line chart for change over time, and a donut chart for parts of a
whole. (Avoid pie charts, which are not good at displaying comparative volume.)

Learn the Tools

Learn the tools that create great visuals: Excel, Tableau, Canva, Datawrapper, Google Charts, Power BI, and
Piktochart are standards. Ask which tools will be most helpful in your industry and proactively learn the basics
with online tutorials.

   "If there's a conclusion you want your audience to
   reach, say it out loud. Don't assume they'll see what
   you see." --Cole Knaflic, data visualist

Introduce, Insert, and Interpret

Even the best visual won't speak for itself. You must introduce it with text, position it well, and correctly
interpret it. Don't drop a flashy visual in your text and walk away. Follow these steps:

                                        Introduce it. "Figure 1, shows that customer satisfaction rose 20% after the
                                        support overhaul." Use a talking title, not a topic title. The title of the graphic
                                        should convey not only the "what" but also the "so what."

                                                                              Insert it. Place it near the related text. Add a
                                                                        talking title: "Customer Satisfaction Improved
                                                                        20%"

       Interpret it.Explain what it means. Why does this  matter? What should your reader do? Do not
                                                                   confusing graphic. Instead, guide the

audience                                          through the graphic so it complements the main

                                          point.

In their book Making Numbers Count , authors Chip Heath and Karla Starr remind us
that numbers don't make people care--meaning does. Business audiences don't
automatically grasp data just because you present it clearly. To be persuasive, you
must connect the numbers to something your audience already understands or
values.

Their key insight? Anchor your numbers in the familiar. Translate abstract figures into concrete comparisons,
relatable images, or memorable metaphors.

In presentations or reports, that means:

Don't just drop in a chart--frame it with context your audience understands.
Use simple, story-driven interpretations rather than jargon-heavy explanations.
Make the visual a step in your narrative, not an interruption.

When you insert a chart, your job is not just to show it--it's to walk the audience through what it means and
why it matters, just like you'd walk them through a story.

You're not just visualizing data. You're making meaning visible.

"Good visuals clarify. Great visuals persuade. But only
when you connect them to the story."

TASK

VISUALS THAT ADD VALUE

Before you design your next data visualization, ask the following:

      What's the one insight my audience needs?
      Am I making that insight easy to see?
      Have I cited this data correctly so my audience can check my insights?

Like Vermeersch's solar system bike map, your job is to make data not just visible--but understandable. The
best visuals don't show everything. They show what matters most.

"The best visuals don't show everything--they show what matters most."

                                                                                                               47

Outline to Understand and Be Understood

STORY

Elon Musk's Email That Cut Through the
Noise

In April 2018, Elon Musk sent a company-wide email to Tesla employees as the company struggled to meet
its Model 3 production goals. The message wasn't flashy. It didn't rely on bullet points or design. Instead, it
followed a clear structure: each section was short, sequenced logically, and ended with a concrete
recommendation. The subject? Productivity.
Musk's message cut through the chaos. Rather than a vague call to work harder, it provided clear
expectations and a framework for making decisions. Teams responded. Waste was reduced. Communication
sped up. Within weeks, Tesla began to recover its production targets.
The lesson? Structure doesn't just clarify your message. It drives action.

MAIN IDEA

Structure Earns You Credibility

Strong ideas only have power if they're easy to follow. In business, structure makes your message easier to
remember, more persuasive, and more actionable. Without it, even accurate content can backfire.
Like Elon Musk, you may one day need to cut through noise and deliver a difficult or high-stakes message.
This chapter helps you avoid confusion by showing how to structure your ideas before you speak or send.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn

      Organize ideas using outlining methods that fit your project
      Use bottom-up outlining to clarify complexity
      Apply the SMART structure to professional messages
Like Elon Musk, you may one day need to cut through noise and deliver a difficult or high-stakes message.
This chapter helps you avoid confusion by showing how to structure your ideas before you speak or send.

REASONS

From Idea Chaos to Message Clarity

1. Starting with a Pile of Ideas? That's Normal.

                                                                                                                                                              48
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Even skilled communicators start with messy notes, half-formed ideas, and scattered thoughts. The
difference? They organize.
Outlining helps you think. It sharpens your message, reveals logical gaps, and gives you a roadmap.
Imagine if Musk had written a stream-of-consciousness email instead of outlining his points. The urgency
would have been lost in the noise.
"You don't need more ideas--you need to organize the ones you already have."

2. Choose an Outlining Method That Fits

Top-Down Outlining
Start with your main idea, then list supporting points.
Works well for standard formats or when your conclusion is clear.
Example: An annual report or executive summary.
Mind-Mapping
Start with a core idea and branch outward.
Great for creative brainstorming or solving complex problems.
Example: Developing an employee wellness initiative.
Bottom-Up Outlining
Most useful when you have a flood of information and need clarity.

                    Brainstorm -

                       List all your points.

                    Cluster -

                       Group related ideas.

                   Sequence -

                   Order the clusters logically.

                   Let's revisit Musk's email. Here's how bottom-up outlining shaped it:

Brainstorm:        Cluster:             Sequence:
                     Immediate impacts    Confirm the
  Who is impacted    (who, when, how)     decision
  Layoff timeline

                                                                                                          49

Follow-up steps    Next steps (benefits          Clarify next steps
                   access, final day)

3. Use the SMART Structure for Clarity and Flow

Once you've outlined your content, SMART helps you organize it into a
flow your audience can follow:

Element            Purpose
S - Story          Hook attention with a narrative or example
M - Main Idea      State the core message clearly
A - Agenda         Preview the structure of your message
R - Reasons        Provide evidence and supporting points
T - Task           Close with a takeaway or next step

SMART works in presentations, memos, reports, and even some emails.

Let's rewrite Better.com's memo using SMART:

       S: "Today's message is difficult, but it's important."
       M: "We are announcing staff reductions that will affect 9% of our
       workforce."
       A: "We'll explain who is impacted, why this decision was made, and
       how we're supporting our people."
       R: Specifics on roles, timing, support resources, and next steps
       T: "If you are affected, please read the FAQ and contact HR. We're
       here to support you."

Compare that to the vague, reactive message they sent. Structure doesn't
just convey information--it builds trust.

TIP

Many students assume "Story" must be a personal anecdote or
character-driven tale. That's not the case--especially in
business communication. More often, the "Story" is simply a

                                                                           50

   powerful opener: something that grabs attention, establishes
   relevance, and sets the tone.

1. Quote: Use a relevant quote that offers insight, authority, or surprise.
"Design is the silent ambassador of your brand." --Paul Rand
2. Metaphor: Use a short metaphor or analogy to help your audience visualize an abstract idea.
Formatting is to communication what plate presentation is to food. No matter how delicious the content,
poor presentation can make people push it aside.
3. Image or Visual: Use a side-by-side comparison, illustration, or screenshot that shows a problem or contrast.
Two résumés: one is a gray block of text; the other has headings, bullet points, and breathing room. Same
content--very different impact.
4. Stat or Study: Open with a specific data point or research finding to establish urgency or credibility.

   "Readers take only 7 seconds to decide whether to
   keep reading your document--or move on." (Nielsen
   Norman Group)

TASK

Organize Before You Write

Don't jump into writing. Start with a structure. Use bottom-up outlining when you're buried in research or
details. Use SMART when you need a polished message your audience can follow.
Elon Musk didn't inspire change through urgency alone. He outlined, sequenced, and structured his
message to cut through chaos.
Your message may not be life-altering like a layoff notice. But every business message is a chance to build or
break trust.
Plan it. Structure it. Then send it.

DRAFT FOR IMPACT

The Pre-write Pay-off

STORY

When a Blog Post Undermines Trust:
Tesla on Autopilot

In 2016, a driver died while using Tesla's Autopilot. Tesla responded with a blog post--not a press release--that
opened with technical safety statistics and buried news of the fatality several paragraphs in.
The post was factually accurate, but it read as cold and overly technical. There was no expression of sympathy,
and it lacked a clear structure. The backlash was swift. Critics said the message downplayed the loss of life,
confused readers, and damaged public trust.
The problem wasn't the facts. It was the way they were written. Better drafting would have avoided the
structure and tone misfires that undercut the message.

MAIN IDEA

Drafting Makes the Message Work

Drafting is when you translate your ideas into written form. It's not about perfection--it's about progress. The
goal is to get your thoughts down clearly and coherently so they can later be refined. Strong drafting is the
bridge between raw ideas and final impact.
First drafts don't need to be polished--they need to be purposeful.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      How to overcome perfectionism and start writing
      How to draft unified, coherent, and well-developed paragraphs
      How to use tone that strengthens your message

REASONS

How to Draft Messages That Matter

Drafting Comes First

Before you refine sentences or analyze tone, you need to get the ideas on the page. Drafting is the process of
moving from scattered thoughts to structured communication. It's where you begin shaping your ideas into
organized paragraphs your reader can follow.

                                                                                                                                                              52
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Don't aim for perfection yet--aim for clarity. Your first draft is where you build logic and structure. The
revising stage will come later.
Think of drafting as construction, not decoration. You're putting up the framework. Polishing comes after.

Try Freewriting

Try freewriting--writing quickly without stopping to edit. This technique helps accomplish these goals:
     Silence your inner critic
     Capture raw ideas before you forget them
     Increase fluency and reduce writer's block

You can always revise later. Right now, your job is to write.

  TIP

   Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop. Don't worry about
   grammar or structure--just get your ideas down.

Overcome Perfectionism with Freewriting

Good drafting is about generating material--not polishing as you go. Many writers fall into the trap of editing
too early, which slows thinking and kills creativity.

Before you draft polished paragraphs, consider warming up with a few minutes of freewriting. It helps you
think clearly before you write purposefully.

Build Paragraphs That Make Sense

Tesla's blog post wasn't just poorly toned--it was disorganized. It buried the lead, used inconsistent structure,
and shifted focus without transitions.

A good paragraph should be unified (focused on one idea), coherent (logically sequenced), organized
(follows a pattern), and developed (supported with examples or reasoning). Drafting strong paragraphs gives
your writing structure that your audience can follow.

  TIP

    Start with a topic sentence. Support it with detail. End with a transition.

When drafting, apply structure intentionally:
     Open with a clear topic sentence
     Group related ideas logically
     Use signal words and transitions like "for example," "in contrast," or "as a result"
     Avoid cramming multiple unrelated ideas into one paragraph
     End with a transition or wrap-up that connects to what's next

Use the Right Tone

Even accurate writing can cause problems if the tone is off. Tesla's post offered real data--but sounded
defensive, impersonal, and distant. In business writing, tone affects how your audience feels about your
message and about you.

                                                                                                                                                              54

Tone is more than style--it's strategy. Every word sends a signal about your values and professionalism.

TASK

Practice Drafting for Credibility

Before you finalize your next business message:

      Use free writing to overcome perfectionism and get started
      Draft short, well-structured paragraphs with clear topic sentences
      Make sure each paragraph supports one key idea
      Use transitions to create flow between paragraphs
      Adjust your tone to reflect the audience and purpose

                                                                                                          55

DESIGN AND FORMAT

Make Your Message Look as Good as It Sounds

STORY

The Solar System That Explained a City

According to a 2023 Nielsen Norman Group UX study, users decide whether to stay on a page within 10
seconds--and formatting is a primary factor in that decision. Because readers first scan to decide whether
they'll read, dense or disorganized documents simply don't get attention. Beautifully designed documents,
however, reach not only their intended audience, but are often shared with others, too. That's power.

In business, how your message looks shapes how it's received. Great content deserves great formatting.

MAIN IDEA

Format Shapes First Impressions

Because readers judge whether a document is worth reading in seconds, good design helps your message
get read, understood, and remembered.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      Structure your message with titles, headings, and hierarchy
      Design for readability using font, color, and emphasis
      Use layout and spacing to guide attention and reduce clutter

                                                                                                                                                              57
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

REASONS

Design Tools That Serve the Message

1. Titles and Headings: Build a Scannable
Information Hierarchy

Well-designed documents give readers structure at a glance. Titles and headings are your navigation system
--they help the reader skim first, then decide where to dive deeper. When done right, they create an
information hierarchy that reflects your message's priorities and structure.

      Start with a strong title. This is your headline--it should be specific, relevant, and a little punchy if
      appropriate.
      Add a subtitle if helpful. Subtitles can clarify context or preview your main argument.
      Use headings to chunk content. Each major section should have a clear heading that previews what's
      coming. Use subheadings to break complex sections into manageable pieces.

Example of a Scannable Hierarchy:

      Title: Fixing Customer Retention Problems
      Subtitle: How We Lost Customers--and How We'll Win Them Back
      Heading 1: Why Customers Leave

              Poor Onboarding
              Delayed Response Times
              Unmet Expectations
      Heading 2: What We've Tried Already
              Customer Surveys
              Staff Training
              Improved Help Desk Tools
      Heading 3: The New Three-Part Plan
              Improve Onboarding
              Proactive Support
              Feedback Loops

A nice by-product of writing titles and headings is that the process helps you understand your own message
better. You will often make significant structural improvements after you clarify the sections of your
message.

Use Parallel Structure

Make sure your headings match grammatically and structurally. This reinforces the flow of your message.

     Not Parallel:

           Launching the New App
           Why Our Beta Failed
           Fix the Bugs
    These headings don't follow the same grammatical pattern--one is a gerund phrase, one is a question,
    and one is an imperative verb. That lack of consistency disrupts flow and makes the structure harder
    to follow.

     Parallel:

                                                                                                                                                              58
                                 MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

      Launch the New App
      Analyze the Beta Failures
      Fix the Bugs

Now each heading starts with a verb in command form (imperative), creating a clear, scannable
rhythm. To achieve grammatical parallelism, pick a structure and apply it consistently across headings
at the same level.

Choose Between Talking and Topic Headings

Talking headings are short statements or questions that preview your main idea. They cue your reader to
receive your message.

Example: "Why Customer Retention Matters More Than Growth"
Topic headings are short labels. These work in formal documents or dashboards but are less engaging.

Example: "Customer Retention"

Choose one style and apply it consistently throughout the document. Talking headings usually make your
content easier to understand and remember.

Design for Readability Using Font, Color, and
Emphasis

    CHOOSE FONTS THAT MATCH YOUR MESSAGE

Fonts act as the "voice" of your document. Use them intentionally. Here's a snapshot of some basics:

Typeface          Voice

Georgia (italic)  Comfortable

Helvetica (bold)  Stable

Franklin Gothic   Objective

Century Gothic    Modern

Baskerville       Reliable

Use no more than two fonts in a document--usually one for headings and one for body text. Check your
organization's style guide or visit FontPair for well-matched combinations.

Apply Contrast and Color with Purpose

                  SIZE MATTERS

                                                                                                         59
                  MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Usage             Font Size

Title             25-35 pt

Subtitle          Mid-size

Headings          14-16 pt
Subheadings       13-14 pt

Body Text         11-14 pt

Captions/credits  7-9 pt

Color is Powerful

      Use at least one color, but no more than 2-3 colors per document
      Select colors from your org's palette or from Coolors.co
      Choose high-contrast colors for accessibility--check with the Coolors Contrast Checker
      Remember that grays are colors. Dark gray text can look more sophisticated than black

Use Emphasis Wisely

        Use bold to highlight key ideas
        Example: This is urgent, so please sign this contract today.

      Use italics to add emphasis
      Example: This strategy is not sustainable long term.
      Use color to show categories or highlight
      Example: red for an overdue items column header, green for completed tasks.

   Use  emoji strategically, depending on the formality of the document
   Example: Let's keep brainstorming possible taglines 

  TIP

     Do not underline either for emphasis or headings.
     Underlined text indicates a hyperlink.

Use Layout and Spacing to Guide Attention

                                                                                              60

   "Great design doesn't call attention to itself--it calls
   attention to your message."

TASK

Format Like a Pro

So try these formatting tips to break through the 10-second scan limit. Before you send that final draft:
      Add clear headings and subheadings
      Choose consistent fonts and sizes
      Use color, alignment, and emphasis strategically
      Leave visual breathing space

                                                                                                                                                              61

REVISE

Sharpen Your Message

STORY

Revision Is the Chisel That Sets Your
Message Free

Michelangelo didn't just create beauty--he revealed it. He once said, "I saw the angel in the marble and
carved until I set him free." That's what revision does for your writing.
Your first draft is the block of marble--rough, bulky, full of potential but not quite there. Like Michelangelo,
you need to see what's essential, then chip away the extra words, smooth the transitions, and shape the tone
until the message shines through with clarity and purpose.In business communication, the masterpiece is a
message that lands cleanly with your audience. Your chisel? Revision.

MAIN IDEA

Revision Clarifies and Earns Trust

Writing is thinking--but revision is where your thinking sharpens. By revising, you align your message with
your audience's needs, fix what's unclear, and elevate your credibility. You don't just clean up your draft--you
make it effective and trustworthy.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      How to revise for clarity, concision, and concreteness
      How to spot tone misfires and fix them
      How to use peer feedback to strengthen your writing

REASONS

Why You Should Revise

1. Improve Clarity, Concision, and Concreteness

Your first draft gets the ideas down. Revision ensures those ideas make sense to others. Readers trust writing
that is clear, concise, and concrete.

                                                                                                                                                              63

Clarity       Sentences that confuse or wander  Break long ideas into short sentences
Concision     Redundant phrases, extra words    Eliminate clutter and repetition
Concreteness  Vague or abstract terms           Replace with specific, vivid language

Original: Our team will be collaborating to facilitate optimal outcomes.
Revised: Our team will work together to improve results.

Original: There are many options available for resolving this issue.
Revised: You can call, email, or chat with support to resolve the issue.

Original: In regards to the upcoming quarterly meeting, please be advised that the agenda items are
presently being finalized.
Revised: We're finalizing the agenda for next quarter's meeting and will share it by Friday.

  TIP

   Remove unnecessary prepositions to make a message more
   concise.
   Original: In light of the information that was provided during
   the course of the meeting, we have decided to move forward
   with the plan.
   Revised: After the meeting we decided to proceed.

Revising is the difference between leaving your ideas buried in stone or shaping them into something sharp,
clear, and persuasive.

                                                                                                             64

2. Evaluate and Adjust Tone

Even well-organized messages can fail if the tone is wrong. A revision pass is the time to check whether your
voice sounds appropriate, respectful, and professional. Your audience determines your tone, so do the work
to understand them.

Quick Tone Review Checklist

   Does your tone match the context (formal/informal)?
   Is your word choice respectful and constructive?
   Are you confident without sounding arrogant?

Original:"You clearly didn't read the manual."
Revised:"Let's review the manual together to find the issue."

Tone Matters: Word Choice Builds--or Breaks--Trust.

3. Use Peer Feedback to Improve the Message

You can't revise well in isolation. A second set of eyes can catch what you miss--especially tone, assumptions,
or unclear language.

Ask a Peer to Help You Spot:

      Sentences that feel confusing or too long
      Words that feel defensive, arrogant, or insincere
      Areas that need more clarity or specificity
Ask your reviewer to narrate their reactions as they read your work out loud, indicating what they liked,
where they got confused, or where additional information would be useful. Take notes and make changes
where needed.

TASK

Practice Strategic Revision

  Read it out loud to spot awkward phrasing or long
sentences

                                                                                                                                                              65
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

  Highlight vague words and replace them with
specifics

  Cut unnecessary words and repetitions
  Review your tone--is it confident, courteous, and
respectful?
  Ask a peer for feedback

   "Choose your words carefully--especially the second
   time."

Remember Michelangelo. Your ideas are already there--you just have to carve away what's unnecessary. In
moments of routine communication or high-stakes delivery, revision is how you free your message and
shape it to resonate.

COLLABORATE

Lead Unified Teams

STORY

Mission-Ready Collaboration

In 2006, NASA awarded a contract to a relatively unproven company--SpaceX--to help deliver cargo to the
International Space Station. The partnership was high stakes. Failure would not only cost billions but also
derail national space objectives.
How did this risky collaboration succeed? NASA and SpaceX had radically different cultures, but they
invested heavily in communication protocols, mutual respect, and iterative feedback. NASA brought process
discipline; SpaceX brought speed and innovation. They succeeded together because they defined their roles,
resolved friction quickly, and aligned around a shared mission.

   "This was a partnership built on rigorous review and
   respectful pushback--not blind agreement." --Lori
   Garver, former Deputy Administrator, NASA

MAIN IDEA

Effective Collaboration Drives
Innovation and Engagement

Whether you lead a project or participate in one, your ability to collaborate directly affects your team's
success and your credibility. An oft-cited study published by Salesforce found that 86% of employees and
executives cite lack of collaboration or ineffective communication as the reason for workplace failures. Yet
organizations that prioritize collaborationoutperform their peers significantly in productivity.
The difference isn't luck--it's strategy. Clear roles, shared goals, and purposeful tools make collaboration not
just smoother, but more impactful.

AGENDA

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      How teams develop and why communication matters at each stage
      How to manage conflict and encourage inclusive dialogue
      How to lead and contribute to meetings that matter
      How to use digital collaboration tools with professionalism

                                                                                                                                                              68
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

That same principle applies to your work. Whether in student teams or corporate projects, your ability to
collaborate begins with clarity--of purpose, process, and people.

REASONS

Begin With Clarity-of Purpose, Process,
and People

1. Understand How Teams Develop

Just like the NASA-SpaceX team did, work teams often experience the stages described by psychologist
Bruce Tuckman:

            Forming: People get to know each other.
            Storming: Differences surface. Conflict may arise.
            Norming: Group roles, expectations, and trust begin to form.
            Performing: The team works smoothly and effectively.

Understanding these stages helps you normalize conflict, manage expectations, and work productively with
others. A team charter outlining team roles, goals, and communication preferences can help align everyone
from the start.

   TIP
   At the beginning of a new project, create a collaborative doc
   recording your team's decisions about responsibilities, due
   dates, and communication norms. Treat it like your team's
   playbook.

The success of the NASA-SpaceX partnership didn't begin with the launch pad--it began with aligned
expectations and clear communication. From the first proposal to final execution, both teams understood
what they needed to deliver and how they'd collaborate across distinct organizational cultures.

2. Navigate Conflict with Empathy and Structure

Conflict isn't failure--it's a normal part of team life. The key is navigating it productively.
            Focus on facts, not personalities
            Reinforce shared goals

                                                                                                                                                              69
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

            Use active listening to clarify disagreements
            Avoid side conversations and triangulation
            Document decisions to avoid future confusion
NASA and SpaceX had to negotiate crucial differences--from timelines and testing protocols to media
messaging. Without respectful conflict resolution, the partnership could have derailed under pressure.

   "The best teams don't agree on everything. They
   agree on how to work through it."

3. Run Meetings That Matter

Poorly run meetings waste time and breed resentment. Good meetings create momentum.

Meeting Tips:

            Share an editable agenda in advance
            Appoint roles: timekeeper, facilitator, etc.
            Use an AI notetaker like Fireflies.ai to automatically produce transcripts, summaries, and action lists
            Stick to start/end times
            Use "parking lots" for off-topic items

Virtual Meeting Tips:

            Institute a cameras-on policy for at least part of every meeting
            Mute when not speaking
            Use chat to encourage quieter voices
            Share screens for visual clarity

  TIP

   If you're leading a quick team update, set the agenda: "We
   have three agenda items. Let's aim to finish in 25 minutes so
   we all get a break."

4. Use Collaboration Tools to Strengthen--not
Stress--Your Team

Workplace tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Trello, and Google Docs are only helpful when used well.

Tips:

            Set response-time expectations for different channels
           Avoid vague comments like "Can someone do this?"
            Tag only relevant people
            Use threads or folders to keep things organized

  TIP

                                                                                                                                                              70

STORY

Amy Cuddy and the Science of
Presence

When Amy Cuddy was a college student, a traumatic brain injury from a car accident left her doubting her
ability to succeed. Doctors told her she wouldn't finish her degree. But she did--and more. She earned a
doctorate, became a Harvard professor, and gave one of the most-watched TED Talks of all time. In it, she
shared her research on how body language--not just words--can shape how we feel and how others see us.
Cuddy didn't become a powerful speaker through natural charisma. She practiced presence: standing tall,
pausing deliberately, speaking with clarity, and focusing on her audience. Her story shows that presentation
skills are learned--and they matter.

   "Don't fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become
   it." --Amy Cuddy

MAIN IDEA

Presence--Not Slides--Drives Success

Business presentations are not performances for entertainment. They are purposeful conversations
designed to inform, persuade, or clarify in high-stakes environments. Strong delivery--not flashy slides--
builds credibility. Your audience responds to your presence, preparation, and clarity more than your visuals.
According to Forbes, 70% of employed Americans who give presentations agree that presentation skills are
critical to their success. Yet 20% say they'd rather pretend to be sick than give a presentation. Practicing your
presence will prepare you for those moments when your manager turns and says, "Why don't you take 10
minutes and explain those numbers to us?"

                                                                                                                                                              72

What You'll Learn in This Chapter

      How to prepare strategically for high-stakes presentations
      How to project presence through body, voice, and eye contact
      How to practice effectively with feedback and purpose
      How to design simple, consistent, visual slide decks
      How to troubleshoot common presentation challenges

REASONS

Develop and Deliver World-Class
Business Presentations

1. Prepare Strategically: Plan Like a Pro

Cuddy's TED Talk wasn't spontaneous. It was strategic. She knew her message, shaped it around her
audience's needs, and supported it with clear evidence.
Good business presenters ask: Who is my audience? What do they need to know, do, or feel? What's my
main message? What structure will guide them through the content?
Your success doesn't begin at the podium. It begins in the planning room.

2. Deliver with Presence: Use Body, Voice, and
Focus

Cuddy's research showed that people who adopt an open, powerful posture before speaking report feeling
more confident. That confidence shows in voice, gestures, and eye contact.
In business, presence doesn't mean theatricality. It means calm confidence.

     Stand tall. Plant your feet shoulder-width apart.
     Use gestures intentionally to reinforce structure.
     Vary your pitch, pace, and volume to emphasize key points.
     Pause to let ideas land. Silence is a powerful tool.
     Make direct eye contact to turn a boring monologue into a compelling conversation.
When Cuddy stepped onto that TED stage, she didn't perform--she connected. The same is true in a
business boardroom.

                                                                                                                                                              73
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

3. Practice with Purpose: Don't Memorize--
Internalize

Cuddy didn't script her every word. Memorizing a presentation word-for-word makes presenters brittle. You
may fall apart if you can't think of the next word. Cuddy practiced talking about ideas, not saying lines.
Repetition helped her sound fluent and natural.
Take these steps to prepare:

     Rehearse out loud at least three times.
     Record yourself and look for distracting filler words or nervous tics.
     Practice in front of a colleague or mirror.
     Focus on transitions, pacing, and vocal energy.
Confidence is earned, not inherited.

4. Visual Aids: Support the Message--Don't Distract
from It

YOU are the presentation. Slides are the support.
Cuddy used simple slides with clear visuals. Her presence--not her PowerPoint--carried the message.

Follow these three slide design principles:

     Be Simple: Each slide should focus on one idea in a short title or visual. Avoid bullet lists and paragraphs.
     Your audience should grasp the point of the slide in five seconds--and then turn their attention back to
     you. Use talking lead lines instead of topic headings, and use visual triggers to draw the audience's eye to
     important points on the slide.
     Be Consistent: Match fonts, colors, and layouts across all slides. Use the same design logic for titles,
     captions, and charts. Inconsistency distracts and undermines credibility.
     Be Visual: Replace text with images, charts, or icons wherever possible. Visuals should highlight, not
     overwhelm. For data-heavy slides, use animation or layering to walk the audience through each point.
Bad slides can ruin a good message. Distracting animations, mismatched fonts, and overloaded screens
make it hard for your audience to follow. Design your slides like billboards: if someone glanced for five
seconds, would they understand the point?
Cuddy's slides passed that test. Sparse, visual, clear. But even more important--she never relied on them.
She spoke with confidence whether the clicker worked or not.

  TIP

   Test your slides in the actual space or platform where you'll
   present. Walk to the back of the room. Are they readable? If
   not, revise.

                                                                                                                                                              74

   Charts. Both offer free downloads.

5. Troubleshoot Like a Pro: Stay Calm and Adapt

Technology fails. Time runs out. Tough questions arise. Presence prepares you to handle it all.
Cuddy teaches that presence is not pretending. It's showing up grounded and ready.

     If you blank, pause, breathe, glance at your slide or notes, and continue.
     If interrupted, thank the person and steer back to your point.
     If a group starts a distracting side chat, move toward them as you talk. They'll stop when you get close.
     If time is cut short, summarize the key takeaway and finish with a strong action statement.
Presence turns panic into poise.

Key Reminder: You don't need to be perfect. You need to be present.

Strategies and Best Practices

STORY

Email Still Rules

In 2024, Forbes reported that despite Slack threads, Teams chats, and project management dashboards,
workers overwhelmingly preferred email as their main mode of business communication. Even in hybrid and
remote environments, employees chose email for its clarity, traceability, and professional tone.
Andrew Brodsky, in his 2024 book Ping: The Secrets of Successful Virtual Communication, confirms this
trend. While workers may prefer chat for speed, they still turn to email when they want to document
decisions, maintain professionalism, or convey a more thoughtful message. Email, Brodsky writes, is the
default for high-responsibility communication--and knowing how to write it well creates career advantage.

MAIN IDEA

Email Remains the Cornerstone of
Professional Communication

Despite a growing number of workplace communication tools, email is still the most widely used and
preferred method. Writing clear, professional emails is a vital skill for effective business communication and
leadership.
"Email is still how business gets done. Learn to write it well."

      Insights from Ping on when (and how) to use email effectively

REASONS

Why Good Email Writing Matters

1. Configure Your Email for Professionalism

Your display name and signature block are part of your brand. Brodsky reminds us that first impressions in
virtual communication often happen before the message is read--through the sender's name, formatting,
and tone.

  TIPS

       Use a clear name-based display (not initials or student IDs).
       Include a professional signature block with your name, title,
       organization, and LinkedIn.
       Use school-affiliated email while in college and brand-
       aligned personal email after graduation.

     Use a clear name-based display (not initials or student IDs).
     Include a professional signature block with your name, title, organization, and LinkedIn.
     Use school-affiliated email while in college and brand-aligned personal email after graduation.

2. Write Clear, Specific Subject Lines

Subject lines are headlines. They determine whether your message gets opened. Brodsky emphasizes that
vague subject lines signal disorganization and lower urgency.

Vague        Better

"Hi"         "Strategy Meeting Confirmed for July 5 at 2 p.m."
"Important"  "Action Required: Q4 Budget Approvals Needed"

TIP

If you're requesting action, say so in the subject line. If you're
just informing, signal that too. People scan their inbox by
intent.

                                                                                                            78
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

3. Be Concise and Easy to Read

Avoid TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read). Use bullet points, bolded subheadings, and white space. According to
Brodsky, long paragraphs decrease perceived urgency and make your audience more likely to delay
responding.

Quick Wins:

     Put the main point in the first sentence.
     Break long messages into scannable chunks.
     Bold important deadlines or action items.

4. Use Professional Etiquette and Tone

Tone doesn't travel well digitally. Brodsky notes that email is often interpreted more negatively than
intended. Always revise for clarity and warmth.

Do:

     Use greetings and sign-offs
     Match tone to audience and context
     Avoid sarcasm, ambiguous jokes, or excessive emojis

Don't:

     Use ALL CAPS (shouting)
     Skip names or closings on first contact
"With no tone of voice or facial expressions, words carry more emotional weight. Choose them carefully." --
Ping

5. Be Timely and Set Expectations

Email isn't instant messaging. Brodsky advises communicating your response rhythm: "I'll reply to this by
tomorrow" sets expectations and eases anxiety.

  TIPS

       Respond within 24 hours
       Use out-of-office replies when away
       Don't train others to expect immediate responses unless
       that's your job

6. Manage Threads Thoughtfully

Email threads can become messy fast. Use subject lines that reflect
updated context. Start a new thread when the topic shifts.

Use CC to:

     Inform stakeholders
     Maintain transparency
     Invite feedback from secondary recipients

Use BCC to:

                                                                                                                                                              79
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

     Protect privacy in mass emails
     Avoid reply-all clutter

Avoid Reply-All unless:

     Everyone truly needs the update

  TIP

   When in doubt, reply to just the sender. Fewer recipients = less
   cognitive load.

7. Handle Attachments Professionally

Brodsky notes that poorly managed attachments can derail productivity. Always reference them in the
message body and provide context.

Best Practices:

     Use PDFs for final documents
     Link to cloud storage for large files
     Mention the attachment in the body of the message
     Confirm the recipient before sending sensitive info

TASK

Write, Reflect, Improve

Take one of your recent or upcoming assignments and practice:
     Write an email version of your message.
     Ask AI to revise it for clarity and tone.
     Edit again, adding personalization and adjusting for your audience.

Then ask:
     What did the AI help with?
     What did you have to fix?
     How did you tailor the message to your professional context?

Remember: Good email is not about flair. It's about clarity, consideration, and getting things done--exactly
what professionals notice.

GRAMMAR

The Path to Proofreading Proficiency

Good grammar is essential for students who actively engage in job searching. It serves as a key factor in
creating polished and professional resumes, cover letters, and communication with potential employers,
ultimately influencing their chances of securing employment opportunities. Take the words of Cathleen
Smalls, an experienced editor and business owner.
"Grammar matters because without it you get cringeworthy errors," she explains.
"But my more serious answer is that using proper grammar in your communications sets you apart from the
rest. Even if the person reading your correspondence doesn't actively think, `Wow, nice use of grammar!' they
certainly notice.

       If two people with similar qualifications submit a résumé and cover letter for an open job, and one
       has a flawless cover letter while the other one has some grammatical errors, I guarantee the error-
       free, grammatically correct one will get the first call."
Avoid obstacles by polishing your grammar skills. You should certainly use a spell check, grammar check,
and even AI, but those tools are not a substitute for knowing the rules. Knowing grammar rules may

If you were blessed with a natural gift for language or an amazing English teacher, grammar may come
easily. If it does not come easily, you'll have to work harder. If English is not your native language, you may
need additional help and tutoring. This chapter briefly explains 18 common grammar errors. We want to help
you avoid these common pitfalls.

SYNTAX AND WORD CHOICE

1. Write complete sentences

Competent writers understand the difference between phrases and clauses and between independent and
dependent clauses. A clause contains both a subject and its verb. A dependent clause cannot stand alone,
but an independent clause can stand alone because it is a complete sentence. A phrase is a group of words
that does not contain a subject. A phrase may contain nouns and verbs but not a subject and its associated
verb.
Take a look at the example below.
Dependent clause: When she speaks without hesitation
Independent clause: She speaks without hesitation.
Phrase: Speaking without hesitation

2. Mind your modifiers

                                                                                                                                                              89
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Adjectives and adverbs modify (describe) other words, phrases, and clauses. Adjectives modify nouns and
pronouns while adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. You cannot use them interchangeably.
Additionally, always be aware of misplaced modifiers. They cause confusion because they are separated from
the words, phrases, or clauses they describe or modify.
Take a look at the example below.
Incorrect: ProQuest published the article, which provides innovative research to the public.
Correct: ProQuest, which provides innovative research to the public, published the article.

3. Correctly use pronouns

Using the correct pronoun starts with identifying the point of view, case, number, and gender. Be aware that
the case of the sentence strongly changes the type of pronoun you're using.
Take a look at the sentences provided below, and observe how, despite consistently employing a first-person
point of view, the pronoun used is altered depending on the case.
Subject: Devon and I are going to the barbecue.
Object: Please come to the company barbecue with Devon and me.
Possessive: The car you saw in the parking lot is mine.
Reflexive/Intense: I plan to study for the exam myself.

4. Agree with antecedents

Pronouns must agree with their antecedent--the noun they are replacing. The pronoun must match the
antecedent in number, singular or plural, and gender, male or female. Sometimes you might be confused if
a noun is singular or plural. Take the word team. In business, a team is composed of a number of individuals.
However, because the team is an entity distinct from its individual members, use a singular pronoun and
verb when referring to the team as a whole.
For example:
Incorrect: The sales team achieved their target.
Correct: The sales team achieved its target.

5. Avoid ambiguous pronoun references

Pronouns must not only agree with their antecedents in gender and number but also refer to only one
antecedent.
Take a look at the example below.
Ambiguous reference: John's manager said he wasn't allowed to go.
Clear Pronoun Reference: John's manager said John was not allowed to go.

6. Create parallel expressions

Parallelism means using the same word patterns--the same syntax--for similar parts of a sentence. When
these similar elements aren't parallel, they sound awkward and out of place. Writers most often violate the
parallelism principle in three situations: a list or series, vertical lists, and parallel connectives.
Take a look at this example below.
Items in a series.
Not parallel: Our exhibition booth will feature product giveaways, instructional videos, and we'll be especially
pleased to raffle off a Hawaiian vacation.
Parallel: Our exhibition booth will feature product giveaways, instructional videos, and a Hawaiian vacation
raffle.

7. Choose the right word

                                                                                                                                                              90
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Have you ever been confused about whether to use affect or effect? If so, you are in good company. Many
words are commonly confused. Take, for example, the words every day and everyday. Every day means daily.
Everyday means commonplace.
Incorrect: For my new exercise regimen, I do yoga everyday.
Correct: For the company picnic, I wore my everyday jeans.
If you don't understand the difference between any of the pairs, review this alphabetized list of common
word-use errors: Easily Confused Words.

PUNCTUATION AND MECHANICS

8. Confidently place commas

Remember to place commas around nonessential (restrictive) words or phrases, e.g. "Helga Karlsson, who is
from Denmark, has been hired as a financial advisor."
Use commas after introductory words, phrases, and clauses, e.g. "When selecting an organization to donate
to, CEO Kent uses a personalized vetting model."
Also, use the Oxford comma to separate all items in a series--a list that contains three or more items.

9. Follow three rules for using semicolons

1. Punctuate independent clauses. For example, "Travis's expertise is local government; Dave's is finance."
2. Separate series that contain internal commas. For example, "Irwin visited Vienna, Austria; Paris, France; and
Prague, Czech Republic."
3. Punctuate independent clauses joined by conjunctive adverbs. For example, "The Testing Center closes at
9 p.m.; however, you may take the online exam until midnight."

10. Use colons only after complete sentences

A colon introduces a list or series, example, quotation, or subtitle. It also separates time expressed in narrative
writing.
Take a look at the example below.
The company's profits are trending in a positive direction:a 10% year-over-year increase for five years.

11. Differentiate Dashes from hyphens

Dashes (--) are not hyphens (-).
Hyphens express standalone fractions, join compound adjectives that appear before the noun, and connect
prefixes to their root words. For more help with hyphens, check out this site: How to Use a Hyphen.
Dashes are split into two main groups: em dash (--) and en dash (-). The em dash indicates a break in
thought, emphasizes a point, or separates parenthetical information from the sentence; the en dash
indicates a range or connection between items like numbers, dates, times, or locations.

12. Master apostrophes and quotation marks

Apostrophes indicate contractions (e.g., it's) and possession (e.g., the CEO's leadership).
Use quotation marks to indicate someone is speaking, to enclose a direct quote from a secondary source, or
to indicate titles of short works.
Correctly place punctuation marks inside or outside quotation marks. For example, semicolons always
appear outside quotation marks, while question marks appear outside the quotation marks when the
quotation is not a question.

                                                                                                                                                              91
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

13. Capitalize correctly

For the most part, capitalization rules apply across languages: capitalize the first word of every sentence and
capitalize proper nouns. Difficulty arises when writers are trying to determine whether a noun is proper or
common. Take the example of educational degrees. The common rule is to capitalize the formal title of a
degree but not the general reference.
Take a look at the example below.
Cary Lewis is earning a Master of Public Administration (MPA).
Camila Antivilo is working on a degree in business administration.

14. Know your numbers

The following basic rules are consistent with the Chicago Manual of Style, but you should consult your
company's style guide to learn the differences. Generally, spell out single-digit numbers one through nine.
Express large numbers--larger than one million--with a combination of decimals and verbal descriptors. For
example, use 2.9 billion, instead of 2,943,000,000. Generally, use the cardinal--1, 2, 3--number to express
dates in writing. Ordinal numbers--1st, 2nd, 3rd--are allowable only if the date precedes the month.

VERB TENSES AND MOODS

15. Make subjects and verbs agree

In a sentence, the subject is the actor and the verb is the action or state of being. Proficient English speakers
often claim they instinctively know the correct verb form to use because it sounds right. However,
intervening prepositional phrases can cause confusion. Intervening means the phrase comes between the
subject and the verb. To avoid this common mistake, make sure the verb agrees with its subject.
Take a look at the example below.
Incorrect: The range of skill requirements provide for upward growth potential.
Correct: The range of skill requirements provides for upward growth potential.
The subject, range, is singular, so the verb should be singular.

16. Match indefinite pronouns and verbs

The Syntax and Word Choice section discusses indefinite pronouns in their function as pronoun
antecedents. A similar issue arises when choosing whether to use a singular or plural verb with indefinite
pronouns. For example, these indefinite pronouns always take a singular verb: anybody, anyone, everyone,
everybody, someone, somebody, and nobody.
However, indefinite pronouns can also take a plural verb, e.g. both, few, several, or many. Here's a handy tip: If
the quantity is countable, then the indefinite pronoun takes a plural verb; if the quantity is not countable, use
the singular verb.

17. Use the right verb tense

Make sure that you reduce double auxiliary words. Writers occasionally reference an event that could have
happened in the past but didn't, so they use the phrase would have followed by another verb. Consider this
example:
I would have liked to have seen the movie.
However, that sentence uses double auxiliary verbs--have liked and have seen.
The second have is unnecessary. Changing it to the infinitive--the base verb plus to--more clearly and
concisely conveys the same meaning:
I would have liked to see the movie.

                                                                                                                                                              92
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

18. Use the correct mood

Verbs can express a variety of moods, which indicate whether the writer is stating a fact, issuing a direct
command, expressing a condition, implying uncertainty or doubt, or giving a subtle command. The most
common English verb moods are indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional. If you can differentiate
the moods from each other, it will be easier for you to consider the level of formality, the power dynamics,
and the desired tone of the communication and be aware of the social and cultural norms that may
influence the choice of language in a given context.

IN CONCLUSION

Awareness is the first step toward mastery. This section covered 18 syntax and word choice, punctuation and
mechanics, and verb tenses and mood rules. If you struggle with any of these errors, keep studying,
practicing, and getting feedback. Your writing and speaking will continue to improve until these
fundamentals become second nature to you.

1. Write Complete Sentences

In informal conversation, we often speak in partial sentences, as in Holly's response below:
Randall: Holly, why were you late for today's meeting?
Holly: Because of traffic on I-215.
Although acceptable in colloquial speech, this reply in writing becomes a sentence fragment. Eliminate
sentence fragments from your formal business writing.
Watch this video to review the three fundamental parts of a sentence:

          Sentence Structure

The video identifies three sentence building blocks:

Subjects--the noun actors in the sentence; they either do, are, or have something
Verbs--express the noun's action, having, or being
Complements--words that add meaning to the sentence by completing or giving more information about--
modifying--the subject or the verb.

These elements collaborate to form meaningful sentence structure. Depending on the complexity of a
sentence, it may contain multiple subjects, verbs, objects, and modifiers. A sentence may contain phrases
and dependent clauses, but without an independent clause, no complete sentence exists. Click on the table
below for examples of phrases, dependent clauses, and independent clauses.

Competent writers understand the difference between phrases and clauses and between independent and
dependent clauses. This video clarifies the differences:

PUNCTUATION: Is It a Phrase or Clause?

When expressed alone or with a dependent clause(s) only, a phrase is a fragment.

A clause contains both a subject and its verb. A dependent clause cannot stand alone, but an independent
clause can stand alone because it is a complete sentence. A phrase is a group of words that does not contain
a subject.

2. Mind your Modifiers

2.1 Adjectives and adverbs modify (describe) other
words, phrases, and clauses.

Adjectives modify nouns and pronouns. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.

Adjectives and adverbs do not function interchangeably. Do not use an adverb where you need an adjective, and
do not use an adjective where you need an adverb. Click on the table below for examples of adjectives and
adverbs.

modifiers cause reader confusion because they are separated from the words, phrases, or clauses they
describe or modify. Click on the table below for examples of how to correct misplaced modifiers.

2.3 Avoid dangling modifiers.

A dangling modifier is a word or phrase that is neither clearly nor logically related to the word(s) it modifies.
Unlike misplaced modifiers, dangling modifiers cannot be corrected by simply moving them to a different
place in the sentence. Click on the table below for examples of how to correct dangling modifier errors.

2.4 Avoid squinting modifiers.

Squinting modifiers--words or phrases that could modify the words before or after them--create ambiguity
and confusion. Click on the table below for examples of how to resolve squinting modifiers.

2.5 Watch out for tricky exclusionary modifiers. The
words only and just are especially tricky modifiers.

They are tricky because they can function as adjectives or adverbs. This duality can cause great confusion. To
avoid misinterpretation, think carefully about where to place only and just; they belong directly next to the
word or words they modify. Click on the table below for examples of how to translate only and just.

None of the examples are incorrect, depending on the meaning the writer wants to convey. Therefore,
carefully place only and just in a sentence. Errors typically occur when these words appear between the
subject and the verb. Speakers get away with inserting only and just between the subject and the verb
because vocal intonation clarifies meaning. In writing, however, place these words exactly where they
belong: immediately before the word(s) you intend to modify.

3. Correctly Use Pronouns

Pronouns stand in for nouns. To understand how pronouns are useful, consider the following two sentences:

LIFE WITHOUT PRONOUNS

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc., says that Elon Musk will drive electric cars for the rest of Elon Musk's life.
Reading that sentence is confusing. Pronouns clarify and make the sentence easier to understand.

LIFE WITH PRONOUNS

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc., says that he will drive electric cars for the rest of his life.
Some situations require repeating pronouns because the reader can't tell what the pronoun refers to. Rule
#5 below (avoid ambiguous pronoun references) discusses these situations.

3.1 Learn how pronouns function.

Using the correct pronoun starts with identifying the point of view, case, number, and gender.

Point of view refers to whether the pronoun is in first, second, or third
person.

First-person point of view indicates an "I/we/us" perspective. Second-person point of view indicates a "you"
perspective. Third-person point of view indicates a "he/she/it/they/them" perspective.

Pronoun case refers to how the pronoun is being used in the sentence.

Subjects do the action in a sentence. Objects either receive the action in the sentence or come after a
preposition. Possessives indicate ownership. If they are used before a noun, they become adjectives.
Reflexives or Intensives reflect on the subject or emphasize or intensify nouns.

Pronouns can be singular or plural.
Some pronouns are assigned a gender.

Some pronouns indicate masculine or feminine gender; some are gender-neutral. Some pronouns are
masculine. Others are feminine. Others are not assigned gender. Romance, Germanic, Slavic, Semitic, and
Indo-Aryan languages assign gender to nouns, not just pronouns. English, however, assigns gender to only
certain pronouns, like she, her, herself, he, him, and himself.

                                                                                                                                                              98

Compound Pronoun Tip

If you get confused about which pronoun to use when it
comes as part of a compound, use this helpful tip:

                                                                                                             99

In your mind, omit "Devon and" from the pair:
"My team leader is going with Devon and me/Devon and I to the
company barbecue."
Removing "Devon and "simplifies the process so writers easily
choose the correct pronoun.
My team leader is going with me to the company barbecue.

3.2 Correctly emphasize pronouns.

To emphasize a subject or object, add the corresponding pronoun in the correct case. The table below shows
a few examples. If you can make your point without using the emphatic pronoun, be concise: leave it. Click
on the table below to view examples of emphatic pronouns.

3.3 Correctly use relative pronouns.

When used to introduce relative adjective clauses, the relative pronouns--that, which, who, and whoever--
introduce relative adjective clauses. Named because they relate the clause with the noun they modify,
relative clauses answer these questions: Which one? What kind? How many? Click on the table below for
examples of how to use relative adjective clauses.

Table 3.1.1 Use relative pronouns to start relative adjective clauses (click here)

                            Which one?                                          What kind?

How do you know whether to use that, which, or who? When referring to objects or groups--including
families or teams--use that or which. Using that indicates a clause essential or restrictive to the meaning of
the sentence. Using which indicates a clause nonessential or nonrestrictive to the meaning of the sentence.
Notice that commas set off nonessential clauses (more to come in the punctuation section). When referring
to people, use who. Click on the table below for examples of this rule.

4. Agree with Antecedents

4.1 Pronouns must agree with their antecedents.

Pronouns must agree with their antecedent--the noun they are replacing. The pronoun must agree with the
antecedent in number (singular or plural) and in gender (male or female). Click on the table below to see

Pointing to other nouns in the sentence, the demonstrative pronouns this, that, these, and those indicate
number and proximity. This and that are singular. These and those are plural. This and these refer to
proximally close items. That and those refer to items that are far away. If the physical distance is ambiguous,
consider the context. Assess physical proximity, emphasis, and intended meaning to choose the most
suitable demonstrative pronoun. Click on the table below for examples of how to use demonstrative

   Why We Use "All" or "Y'all" Instead of Adding "His or Her" With
   Indefinite Pronouns Like Each or Every

   When using always-singular indefinite pronouns like each,
   every, or anyone, maintain agreement with the singular form.
   While a gender-neutral option, "his or her" can become
   cumbersome in longer sentences. To avoid this problem,
   consider rephrasing the sentence with a plural alternative.
   Consider the below examples, which ensure clarity while
   respecting gender neutrality.
   Original: Each student should submit his or her assignment by
   midnight on the due date.
   Alternative: All students should submit their assignments by
   midnight on the due date.
   Also concerning is the plural masculine reference "you guys,"
   which traditionally refers to mixed-gender groups. Because
   the phrase carries non-inclusive gendered references, consider
   using a centuries-old phrase from the American South: "y'all" is
   a popular choice for addressing groups without relying on
   gendered terms. If you're comfortable with it, "y'all" can be a
   great replacement for "you guys" in both tone and function.
   Original: You guys should submit your assignments by
   midnight on the due date.
   Alternative: Y'all should submit your assignments by midnight
   on the due date.

5. Avoid Ambiguous Pronoun References

Pronouns must not only agree with their antecedents in gender and number but also refer to only one
antecedent. For more information, watch the following video that contains advice on keeping your pronoun
references straight.
Take note--antecedents must be nouns or pronouns. Verb phrases, adjectives, and adverbs are not allowed to be
antecedents.
The following video explains pronoun references:

                                                                                                                                                            103

6. Create Parallel Expressions

Parallelism means using the same word patterns--the same syntax--for similar parts of a sentence. When
these similar elements aren't parallel, they sound awkward and out of place.

Writers most often violate the parallelism principle in three situations:

   1. When stating items in a list or series
   2. When expressing vertical lists
   3. When connecting items with parallel connectors

Click on the table below for examples of how to create parallel expressions.

7. Choose the Right Word

Have you ever been confused about whether to use affect or effect? If so, you are in good company. Many
words are commonly confused. Take, for example, the words every day and everyday. Every day means daily.
Everyday means commonplace.

INCORRECT: For my new exercise regimen, I do yoga everyday.

CORRECT: For the company picnic, I wore my everyday jeans.

IN CONCLUSION

Awareness is the first step toward mastery. This section covered seven types of sentence structure and word-
choice errors. If you struggle with any of these errors, keep studying, practicing, and getting feedback. Your
writing and speaking will continue to improve until these seven fundamentals become second nature to
you.

Consider putting your writing through an AI grammar checker. Do you notice whether it finds your grammar
errors?

8. Confidently Place Commas

Originating from Greek and Latin texts, commas have evolved to become indispensable tools of clarity and
precision. In modern writing, commas serve as signposts, creating rhythm and flow, highlighting pauses,
separating ideas, and ensuring coherence.

Table 8.1 Use commas around nonessential (restrictive) words or phrases (click here)

That vs. Which

In summary, never use commas around a that clause. Always use commas around a which clause.
Depending on its meaning, a who clause can go either way.

8.2 Use commas after introductory words, phrases, and
clauses.

Commas prevent the intro act from stealing the show from the main act. Table 8.2 below highlights
introductory words, phrases, and dependent clauses. Note that if the dependent clause comes after the
independent clause, you should not use a comma.

8.3 Use commas to punctuate independent clauses joined
by FANBOYS conjunctions.

Separate independent clauses that are joined by coordinating conjunctions--FANBOYS. The FANBOYS are
for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so.

  Table 8.3.1 Use commas to separate independent clauses joined by FANBOYS
  conjunctions (click here)

8.4 Use commas between items in a series--a list that
contains three or more items. Use the Oxford comma before
the last item in a series.

Use commas to separate all the items, including the last one.

The first example does not clarify whether Shanna and Miranda are on the team. Using the Oxford comma to
clarify meaning.

Many style guides (including Associated Press (AP), the most common journalistic style guide) do not require
the Oxford comma. Chances are your school newspaper intentionally omits the Oxford comma. This
textbook, however, follows Patricia O'Connor's advice: "[The Oxford comma] doesn't hurt and it creates clarity,
so leave it in."

8.5 Use commas to separate adjacent coordinate
adjectives.

Place a comma between coordinate adjectives--two adjacent adjectives that equally modify a noun:

To test whether you need a comma, insert the word and between the adjectives. If it makes sense, insert a

comma between them.

8.6 Where to avoid commas

The previous rules showed you where to correctly place commas. This rule shows you places where you
should never (well almost never) place commas.

With few exceptions, avoid commas in the following situations:

      Between a subject and its verb
      Between compound subjects, verbs, and objects (including correlative conjunctions)
      Between transitive verbs and their objects

Rule                Incorrect Example                           Correct Example

Between a subject   The classes Joy enjoys the most, are        The classes Joy enjoys the most are

9. Follow Three Rules for Using Semicolons

Semicolons have three specific uses: punctuating independent clauses not joined by FANBOYS conjunctions,
separating series that contain internal commas, and punctuating independent clauses joined by conjunctive
adverbs--words like therefore, however, nevertheless, moreover, and notwithstanding.

  Table 9.1 Correctly use semicolons (click here)

Punctuate independent clauses  Herta's customer service ratings are her highest yet; she worked
not joined by FANBOYS          tirelessly this quarter to exceed her clients' expectations.

10. **Use Colons Only After Complete Sentences

A colon introduces a list or series, example, quotation, or subtitle. It also separates time expressed in narrative
writing.

Table 10 Correctly use colons (click here)

Introduce a series Please bring the following items: a pen, a notepad, and a laptop.

                   The information literacy conference will focus on the following competencies:

**Introduce a      Making Numbers Count: The Art and Science of Communicating Numbers

**Indicate time Please arrive at the train station no later than 8:45 a.m.

**In these two cases, the colon does not need to be preceded by an independent clause (a complete
sentence).

13. Capitalize Correctly

For the most part, capitalization rules apply across languages: capitalize the first word of every sentence and
capitalize proper nouns. The difficulty arises when determining whether a noun is proper or common.

13.1 Capitalize specific proper nouns, but do not
capitalize common nouns.

Explore the difference in Table 13.1 below.

  Table 13.1 Capitalize specific proper nouns (click here)

Capitalized Nouns                           Not Capitalized

I love Mom's crazy jokes.                   My mom is late--is your mom coming?

I need a Kleenex. (Kleenex is a trademark.) Please get me a tissue.

Introduce him to President Bannerjee.       Introduce him to the president of the company.

Lola is studying the US Constitution.       Lola is studying constitutional law.

14. Know your numbers

The following basic rules are consistent with the Chicago Manual of Style, but you should consult your
company's style guide to learn the differences.

14.1 Generally, spell out single-digit numbers one
through nine.

                                                                                                         117
                                     MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Use numerals for double-digit numbers 10 and higher, percentages, measurements, statistics, and page and
chapter numbers. In sentences that contain numbers over and under 10, maintain consistency by using
numerals.

  Table 14.1 Correctly express numbers (click here)

Rule                                          Example

$4,200,000 last year.                            million last year.

14.3 Express dates.

Generally, use the cardinal--1, 2, 3--number to express dates in writing. Ordinal numbers--1st, 2nd, 3rd--are
allowable only if the date precedes the month. Although cardinal and ordinal forms are interchangeable in
conversation, follow this rule in writing.

14.4 Express currency and time.

Use the currency sign with no decimals for whole numbers--$20. For fractions of dollars or other currency,
use the decimal expression--$20.56. Use the correct symbol for the currency you are expressing (not all
monetary units are dollars).

                                                                                                                  118
           MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 320

Use whole numbers to express time--5 PM--but use the colon to express fractions of hours--5:30 PM. To
maintain parallelism in sentences that contain multiple time expressions, use the colon even if only one item
contains a fraction of an hour. Both uppercase and lowercase notations--AM or a.m. and PM or p.m.--are
acceptable expressions for morning and afternoon/evening. However, avoid using o'clock in business writing.

                                                  p.m.

14.5 Express fractions.

Express standalone fractions--numbers greater than zero but less than one--as hyphenated words. In
business writing, replace fractions with percentages or decimals whenever possible.

Table 14.5 shows examples of how to express fractions and decimals, but you should follow your company's
style guide.

IN CONCLUSION

Punctuation and mechanics can be puzzling for business writers. Use AI checkers but remember they will
not catch all your mistakes and they will falsely indicate mistakes. The best rule of thumb is to familiarize
yourself with the rules and keep trusted resources bookmarked in your favorite browser.

VERB TENSES AND MOODS

This section focuses on verbs, which enliven your writing, propel action,
and capture emotion and moods, which indicate the way the action or
condition is presented.

Animate your writing by choosing concrete, vivid verbs that convey action, intensity, or a specific quality. Go
beyond basic or generic verbs to add depth, nuance, and clarity to a sentence. Capture your reader's
attention and enhance the overall richness of your writing--even your business writing. Make the language
come alive and engage your reader's senses.

Follow the Goldilocks principle of verbs: Use vigorous language but don't
go overboard:

Not enough             Someone gave a presentation.
(bland/vague)

Too much               Someone delivered a meticulously curated presentation replete with data points
(wordy/confusing)      that showcased the unprecedented and unequivocal surge in customer
                       satisfaction indices.

Just right (vigorous)  Our customer service manager, Juan, delivered an engaging, data-driven
                       presentation on this quarter's skyrocketing customer service ratings.

The verbs section discusses subject-verb agreement, indefinite pronouns and verb agreement, and verb
tenses. The mood section discusses indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional moods.

15. make subjects and verbs agree

In a sentence, the subject is the actor and the verb is the action or state of being. Proficient English speakers
often claim they instinctively know the correct verb form to use because it sounds right. However, three
situations can cause confusion:

             Intervening prepositional phrases (by far the biggest offender)
             Intervening relative clauses
             Intervening phrases other than prepositional phrases

15.1 Identify intervening prepositional phrases.

Intervening means the phrase comes between the subject and the verb.

Which of the following sentences sounds correct?

Sentence 1: Only one of Alex's friends studies accounting at BYU Marriott School.

Sentence 2: Only one of Alex's friends study accounting at BYU Marriott School.

They both sound okay. In fact, Sentence 2 may sound better because the intervening prepositional phrase of
Alex's friends contains the plural noun friends.

If the sentence confuses you, revise it, moving the intervening phrase to the start of the sentence, creating
an introductory phrase:

REVISED SENTENCE 1: Of Alex's friends, only one studies accounting at BYU Marriott School.

                                                                                                                   120

15.2 Identify intervening relative clauses.

As you learned in the Syntax and Word Choice lesson, relative clauses are adjectives, so they must go right
next to the noun they modify. Remember that a clause has a subject and a verb that agrees with the subject.
If the relative clause modifies a singular noun, then the verb of the relative clause must be singular. If the
relative clause modifies a plural noun, then the verb of the relative clause must be plural.

15.3 Identify other intervening elements.

Intervening phrases like as well as, along with, and together with do not create compound or plural subjects,
so they take singular, not plural, verbs. These phrases are connectors that add extra information, but they do
not create a plural subject. The word and creates a compound plural subject.

Phrases likeas well asplace unequal emphasis on two
expressions--the expression precedingas well ascarries
stronger emphasis than the expression following it. So if you
want to emphasize both expressions, join them with the
strong coordinating conjunctionand.

16. Match indefinite pronouns and verbs

The Syntax and Word Choice section discusses indefinite pronouns in their function as pronoun
antecedents. A similar issue arises when choosing whether to use a singular or plural verb with indefinite
pronouns.

Table 16.2 below shows a few examples. When both nouns are singular or plural, the agreement is simple.
However, if one noun is singular and one is plural, place the plural noun second and make the verb plural.
Although grammatically correct, the sentence sounds awkward if the singular noun comes second.

                                                   The verb is plural because files are countable.

Here's a handy tip: If the quantity is countable, then the indefinite pronoun takes a plural verb; if the
quantity is not countable, use the singular verb.

17. Use the right verb tense

Verb tenses indicate the time of an action or event--present, past, or future. When did the action happen?
When will it happen? Is it still happening? Did it happen before something else also happened? Using the
correct verb tense clarifies the timeframe of the action.

17.1 Understand verb tenses.

Verb tense refers to the form of the verb that indicates the time of an action or event. It conveys whether the
action is in the present, past, or future. The main verb tenses are present, past, and future. Present, past, and
future all have conjugations that indicate specific temporal information that accurately expresses the timing
of actions or events.

17.2 Reduce double auxiliary verbs.

Writers occasionally reference an event that could have happened in the past but didn't, so they use the
phrase would have followed by another verb. Consider this example:

                                                                                                                   123

"I would have liked to have seen the movie."
The sentence uses double auxiliary verbs--have liked and have seen.
Changing the second have (have seen) to the infinitive--the base verb plus to--more clearly and concisely
conveys the same meaning:
I would have liked to see the movie.
Applying this rule simplifies construction.

17.3 Use the present tense to express a permanent
truth or condition.

Suppose someone says to you, "What did you say your name was?"

Though the person might have been introduced to you last week, your name is likely the same today as it
was last week, so the question should be phrased as follows: "What did you say your name is?" or "What is
your name?"

18. Use the correct mood

A sentence's verb can express a variety of moods, which indicate whether the writer is stating a fact, issuing a
direct command, expressing a condition, implying uncertainty or doubt, or giving a subtle command. The
most common English verb moods are indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional.

18.1 The English language uses four moods.

Table 18.1.1 below illustrates the four moods in the English language: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and
conditional.

Conditional Expresses actions or situations dependent on a           I would buy a car if I could earn
              condition or hypothetical circumstance.                a little more money.

Even if they know the definitions, writers can easily confuse the conditional and subjunctive moods.

.................

Conditional Mood

The conditional mood is typically used to express hypothetical or conditional situations that depend on a
certain condition being met. It expresses possibilities, preferences, or outcomes based on a specific condition
or specific events.

Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood expresses wishes, doubts, recommendations, or unreal or hypothetical situations that
may not be based on a specific condition. Use subjunctive when you discuss something that may not be
true or certain.

18.2 Sometimes use plural past tense to form the
subjunctive.

In some cases, the subjunctive mood uses the plural past tense of the verb instead of the normal
conjugation used in the indicative mood. Why?

The subjunctive mood sometimes uses the plural, past-tense form, like were, instead of the singular, past-
tense form was, even when the writer is referencing herself or other singular subjects. This construction
might seem odd, but it's an English language convention.

The reason for using the plural, past-tense form is historical. English used to have a clearer distinction
between different moods, including the subjunctive. The plural, past-tense form was used in subjunctive
constructions; over time, this convention stuck.

Today, using the plural past tense in the subjunctive doesn't necessarily mean more than one subject is
involved. It's just a way to signal that we're discussing something hypothetical, unreal, or uncertain. It helps
writers express ideas like wishes, possibilities, recommendations, or desires that may not be true or certain.

In simple terms, using the plural, past-tense form in the subjunctive is a grammar rule that shows events
that might not actually exist or happen, expressing certain thoughts and possibilities.

18.3 Use the polite conditional.

Writers sometimes use the polite conditional when they could use the indicative or imperative instead.

When choosing between the polite conditional and the imperative, consider the level of formality, the power
dynamics, and the desired tone of the communication, and be aware of the social and cultural norms that
may influence the choice of language in a given context.
