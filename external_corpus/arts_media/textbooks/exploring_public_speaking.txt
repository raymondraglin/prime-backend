Version 4.2

             Introduction to

             Edition 4.2 (2023) of

             Exploring Public Speaking

             Exploring Public Speaking: The Open Educational Resource College
             Public Speaking Textbook began as the brainchild of Dr. Kris Barton,
             former Chair of the Department of Communication at Dalton State College
             in Dalton, Georgia. It also was made possible through a generous Textbook
             Transformation Grant in 2015 from Affordable Learning Georgia (ALG), a
             highly successful program of the University System of Georgia. We have
             already been able to save hundreds of thousands of dollars for students at
             our institution with this text, and millions of dollars have been saved for
             students through the Affordable Learning Georgia program.

             In applying for the first grant, Dr. Barton asked me to help him author/
             compile the text. The original goal of our creation of Exploring Public
             Speaking was to provide a high-quality, usable, accessible, and low-cost
             textbook for the hundreds of students who take COMM 1110 at Dalton State
             College every year. This course is required of all degree-seeking students at
             our institution.

             Dr. Barton and I worked on creating the textbook from July 2015 until May
             2016, with the goal of going live with the text in Summer of 2016. Tragically,
             Dr. Barton passed away in early May 2016. He has been greatly missed as a
             friend, colleague, father, scholar, teacher, and mentor.

             However, the launch of the book proceeded. In Summer 2017 I took on
             a significant revision and update, which I named the Second Edition. In
             that edition, I included information on college student success in the
             appendices for institutional reasons, and we have chosen to continue
             including those. In January 2018, colleague Matthew LeHew and I won
             a grant from the University System to create the ancillaries and improve
             the format for more accessibility. In April 2019, we were awarded another
             mini-grant to further revise the text and create a website for it. For the
             fourth edition and succeeding ones, we have removed "Dalton State" from
             the title and most examples for wider appeal. An appendix on library
             research retains the information for specific use of Roberts Library on our
             campus.

             We felt these changes were needed in the fourth and following editions
             because, unexpectedly and happily, the text has also been downloaded
             hundreds of thousands of times from the University System of Georgia
             site, from our website (https://www.exploringpublicspeaking.com), and
             from other sites by readers all over the world as of May 2022. It is used
Exploring Public Speaking  v

Version 4.2

on six continents and has been adopted at over 300 institutions (to our
knowledge), including state universities, well-known private universities,
community and technical colleges, liberal arts colleges, training programs,
and dual enrollment programs. Faculty users are welcome to contact me
at the email address on the copyright page for access to the ancillaries, or
through the textbook's official website.

Over 90% of the book was created by Dr. Barton, me, or other colleagues at
Dalton State College. Some parts, specifically from Chapters 9, 10, and 15,
are adapted from another open resource public speaking text whose author
prefers not to be cited.

In Exploring Public Speaking, especially in its second through current
editions, we have attempted to create a usable, zero-cost textbook for basic
public speaking courses or courses that include basic public speaking skills
as one of their primary learning outcomes. The free, open nature of the
text means that instructors are able to use all or part of it, and add their
own materials. We have also ensured that it meets ADA requirements for
accessibility.

We believe this text addresses all the subjects that traditional publishers'
books would address in an appropriate writing style and with appropriate
college-level learning theory in mind. The appendices address some
additional topics that might be excluded from most texts, but that we
believe add to the experience: learning theory, plagiarism, speaking online,
speaking to diverse audiences, and humor in public speaking. In the
third and fourth editions we have added "case study" examples and some
different outline samples.

We think this book is especially useful in coverage of PowerPoint, audience
analysis and responsiveness, ethics in public speaking, persuasion, special
occasion speeches, and structure of speeches. Because it was written by
communication professors with decades of experience in the classroom, we
are aware of the needs of basic public speaking students. Currently, slide
decks and test banks for the 15 main chapters are available.

Two editorial notes: As per the American Collegiate Dictionary (2016), in
most cases we use the pronoun "they" when the antecedent is an indefinite
pronoun, whether singular or plural, to avoid the awkward he/she/him/
her/his/her combinations in most cases. Second, we admit to some
redundancy in the textbook. Because it is an open educational resource,
some users do not access the whole text. For clarity, sometimes a concept
explained in a preceding chapter is re-explained.

Finally, this edition was completed during the events of 2022 in the United
States. These events include contentious politics; protests; inflation; a war
in Eastern Europe as well as other parts of the world; and of course, our
attempts to reconstruct "normal" after an unprecedented (in our lives)
global pandemic. At the risk of being obtuse, the authors have chosen not
Exploring Public Speaking  vi

Version 4.2

             to include many references to those events in this text for a few reasons.
             The events are ongoing and by the time students and instructors use the
             book, the situations that plague us now may be very different; the book
             is used all over the world, not just the U.S.; and we believe writing about
             those events would distract from the basic goal of the text. There have been
             requests to address more political issues, such as power and equity, in the
             text. While we are very sensitive to these concerns, we believe these matters
             are outside our expertise and better addressed in other venues. However,
             as communication scholars and teachers, we have faith in the power of
             good communication to address these issues.

             Due to transitions in the lives of the main authors, 4.2 (2023) may be
             the last revision of Exploring Public Speaking. However, as an open
             educational resource, it belongs to everyone and those who follow the
             Creative Commons guidelines are free to adapt and revise as fits their
             needs.

             Thank you for downloading Exploring Public Speaking, Edition 4.2, and
             the co-authors and I truly wish you happy teaching and learning with it. We
             welcome input. If you choose to use it, let us know at btucker@daltonstate.
             edu. We keep a database of those who contact us about the book so that we
             can contact you about the text.

             Sincerely,

Version 4.2

1.1 - What is Public Speaking?

What is your mental picture when you think about "public speaking?" The
President of the United States delivering an inaugural address? A sales
representative seeking to persuade clients in a board room? Your minister,
priest, or rabbi presenting a sermon at a worship service? Your professor
lecturing? A dramatic courtroom scene, probably from Law & Order?
Politicians debating before an election? A comedian doing stand-up at a
night club?

All of these and more are instances of public speaking. Be assured that
public speaking takes many forms every day in our country and across the
world. Now let's get personal: Do you see yourself as a public speaker? And
when you do, do you see yourself as confident, prepared, and effective? Or
do you see a person who is nervous, unsure of what to say, and feeling as if
they are failing to get their message across?

You find yourself in this basic public speaking course and probably have
mixed emotions. More than likely, it is required for graduation in your
major. Perhaps you have taken a formal public speaking course before.
Although they are not as common in secondary education as in colleges
(Education Commission of the States, 2015), public speaking instruction
may have been part of your high school experience. Maybe you competed
in debate or individual speaking events or you have acted in plays. These
activities can help you in this course, especially in terms of confidence and
delivery.

On the other hand, it might be that the only public speaking experience
you have had felt like a failure and therefore left you embarrassed, wanting
to forget it, and planning to stay far away from public speaking. It might
have been years ago, but the feeling still stays with you. This class is not
something you have been looking forward to, and you may have put it off.
Maybe your attitude is, "Let's just get it over with." You might think that
it's just another course you have to "get through" in order to study your
major--what really interests you--and start a career in your field.

These are all understandable emotions because, as you have probably
heard or read, polls indicate public speaking is one of the things
Americans fear the most. As Jerry Seinfeld has said in his stand-up
comedy routine,

         According to most studies, people's number one fear is public
         speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does
         that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to
         a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
         (Garber, 2018)
Exploring Public Speaking  3  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Note: this passage is quoted by many and found all over the Internet,             Public speaking
but we will cite R. I. Garber (2018) here because he actually takes issue
with Seinfeld's statement as it is often quoted. Garber cites the original     an organized, face-
study, the Bruskin-Goldring Research Report from 1993. That report             to-face, prepared,
placed "speaking before a group" as the number one fear of 45% of the          intentional
1000 subjects. Therefore, while it is a stretch to think that most people      (purposeful) attempt
fear death less than giving a short speech, aversion toward public speaking    to inform, entertain,
situations and tasks is common.                                                or persuade a group of
                                                                               people (usually five or
Before we go any further, though, what do we mean by "public speaking?"        more) through words,
The most obvious answer is "talking in front of a group of people." For        physical delivery, and
the purposes of this class and this book, public speaking is more formal       (at times) visual or
than that. Public speaking is an organized, face-to-face, prepared,            audio aids.
intentional (purposeful) attempt to inform, entertain, or persuade a group
of people (usually five or more) through words, physical delivery, and (at
times) visual or audio aids. In almost all cases, the speaker is the focus of
attention for a specific amount of time. There still may be some back-and-
forth interaction, such as questions and answers with the audience, but the
speaker usually holds the responsibility to direct that interaction either
during or after the prepared speech has concluded.

Garber (2010) cites two scholars of public speaking from the early 20th
century, Edwin Du Bois Shurter and James Albert Winans, who wrote
of public speaking as an "enlarged conversation," and as such it has
some similarities to conversations but some major differences, too. As a
conversation, it has elements of:

     awareness of and sensitivity toward your audience (in this case, more
       than one person);

     an exchange of explicit messages about content (facts, ideas,
       information) and less explicit ones about relationship (how you
       relate to one another, such as trust, liking, respect);[this content/
       relationship dichotomy will come up again in this book and is
       characteristic of all communication];

     a dependence on feedback to know if you are successful in being
       understood (usually nonverbal in public speaking, but still present);

     the fact that the public speaking communication is (almost always)
       face-to-face rather than mediated (through a computer, telephone,
       mass media, or writing).

As an "enlarged conversation" public speaking needs to be more
purposeful (to entertain, inform, or persuade); highly organized with
certain formal elements (introduction and clear main points, for example);
and usually dependent on resources outside of your personal experience
(research to support your ideas).

Of course, the delivery would have to be "enlarged" or "projected" as well--
louder, more fluid, and more energetic, depending on the size and type of
room in which you are speaking--and you will be more conscious of the
Exploring Public Speaking  4  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

                         correctness and formality of your language. You might say, "That sucks"
                         in a conversation but are less likely to do so in front of a large audience in
                         certain situations. If you can keep in mind the basic principle that public
                         speaking is formalized communication with an audience designed to
                         achieve mutual understanding for mutual benefit (like a conversation),
                         rather than a "performance," you will be able to relate to your audience on
                         the human and personal level.

    Glossophobia         1.2 - Anxiety and Public Speaking

a severe fear of public  Why are so many people afraid of public speaking? This is a complex
speaking                 question, and the answer is tied to many personal and psychological
                         factors such as self-efficacy, self-confidence, past experience, training,
                         culture, and context. The term "glossophobia," combining the two Greek
                         words for "tongue" and "fear or dread," has been coined to refer to

                                 ...a severe fear of public speaking. People who suffer from
                                  glossophobia tend to freeze in front of any audience, even a
                                  couple of people. They find their mouth dries up, their voice is
                                  weak, and their body starts shaking. They may even sweat, go
                                  red, and feel their heart thumping rapidly. ("Do You Suffer From
                                  Glossophobia?," 2015)

                         This fear may arise in situations such as responding to a professor in class,
                         participating in a job interview, or having to interact with a stranger, not
                         just giving formal speeches.

                         For many people, fear of public speaking or being interviewed for a job
                         does not rise to the level of a true "phobia" in psychological terms. A
                         phobia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV as a
                         state where someone experiences "significant and persistent fear when
                         in the presence of, or anticipating the presence of, the object of fear,
                         which may be an object, place or situation" (Grohol, 2013). They are
                         just uncomfortable in public speaking situations and need strategies for
                         addressing the task.

                         Why Anxiety and Public Speaking?

                         Scholars at the University of Wisconsin-Stout ("Public Speaking Anxiety,"
                         2015) explain that anxiety in public speaking can result from one of several
                         misperceptions:

                              "all or nothing" thinking--a mindset that if your speech falls short
                                of "perfection" (an unrealistic standard), then you are a failure as a
                                public speaker;

                              overgeneralization--believing that a single event (such as failing at a
                                task) is a universal or "always" event; and
Exploring Public Speaking  5  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

     fortune telling--the tendency to anticipate that things will turn out
      badly, no matter how much practice or rehearsal is done.

Likewise, many new college students operate under the false belief that
intelligence and skill are "fixed." In their minds, a person is either smart or
skilled in something, or they are not. Some students apply this false belief
to math and science subjects, saying things like "I'm just no good at math
and I never will be," or even worse, "I guess I am just not smart enough to
be in college." As you can tell, these beliefs can sabotage someone's college
career. Also unfortunately, the same kind of false beliefs are applied to
public speaking, and people conclude that because public speaking is hard,
they are just not "naturally good" at it and have no inborn skill. They give
up on improving and avoid public speaking at all costs.

Modern research by Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck (2007)
and others shows that intelligence and related skills are "malleable,"
meaning that they are open to change and growth. Understanding and
accepting that your intelligence and skill in different areas is not fixed
or "stuck," but open to growth, will have a significant influence on your
success in life. It will also help you see that just because learning a
subject or task is hard does not mean you are not or cannot be good at
it. Obstacles and barriers that make learning hard are opportunities for
growth, not "getting off places."

There is more to Dr. Dweck's research. We would recommend her book
Mindset. Many students enter a public speaking class thinking "I'm just no
good at this and never will be," just like some students feel about college
algebra or science. Dr. Dweck and other learning psychologists show that
learning a new skill might be hard work, but the difficulty is not a sign that
learning is impossible.

Along with the wrong way of thinking about one's learning and growth,
two other fears contribute to anxiety in public speaking. The first is fear
Exploring Public Speaking  6  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

of failure. This fear can result from several sources: real or perceived bad
experiences involving public speaking in the past, lack of preparation,
lack of knowledge about public speaking, not knowing the context, and
uncertainty about one's task as a public speaker (such as being thrown into
a situation at the last minute).

It is not the goal of this book to belittle that fear. It is real and justified to
some extent because you might lack understanding of the public speaking
task or lack good speaking experiences upon which to build. One of the
goals and fringe benefits of this course is that you are not just going to
learn about public speaking, but you are going to do it--at least four or five
times--with a real audience. Even better, you will do so in a community
of learners and be able to see each others' growth and improvement. You
will overcome some of your fears and feel that you have accomplished
something of personal benefit.

The second fear is fear of rejection of one's self or one's ideas. This one is
more serious in some respects. You may feel rejection because of fear of
failure, or you may feel that the audience will reject your ideas, or worse,
you as a person. Knowing how to approach the public speaking task and
explain your ideas can help. However, you should ask yourself deep and
probing questions as to why you believe that your audience will reject
you because this fear is rooted in a belief. You should ask yourself what
possibly false belief is causing your anxiety.

One of the core attitudes an effective and ethical public speaker must
have is respect for and empathy with the audience. Your audience in this
class is your peers who want to learn and want to get through the class
successfully (just like you do). Your audience also includes your instructor
who wants to see you succeed in the course as well. Believe me, public
speaking teachers get a lot of pleasure from hearing successful student
speeches! Your audience wants you to succeed if for no other reason than
a good speech is much easier and pleasant to listen to than a poor one.
Again, gaining practice in this class with a real, live audience can help you
work through the roots of your fear of rejection.

Beyond dealing with the root fears that may cause you to have a "fright or
flight" response when it comes to public speaking, there are some practical
answers to dealing with fears about public speaking. Of course, fear
responses can be reduced if you know how public speaking works, as you
will see throughout this textbook. But there are some other strategies, and
most of them have to do with preparation.
Exploring Public Speaking  7  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Addressing Public Speaking Anxiety

Mental Preparation

If your neighbor's house were on fire, getting to the phone to call the
fire department would be your main concern. You would want to get the
address right and express the urgency. That is admittedly an extreme
example, but the point is about focus. To mentally prepare, you want
to put your focus where it belongs, on the audience and the message.
Mindfulness and full attention to the task are vital to successful public
speaking. If you are concerned about a big exam or something personal
going on in your life, your mind will be divided, and that division will add
to your stress.

The main questions to ask yourself are "Why am I so anxiety-ridden
about giving a presentation?" and "What is the worst that can happen?"
For example, you probably won't know most of your classmates at the
beginning of the course, adding to your anxiety. By midterm, you should
be developing relationships with them and be able to find friendly faces
in the audience. However, very often we make situations far worse in
our minds than they actually are, and we can lose perspective. One of the
authors tells her students, "Some of you have been through childbirth and
even through military service in a combat zone. That is much worse than
public speaking!" Your instructor will probably try to help you get to know
your classmates and minimize the "unknowns" that can cause you worry.

Physical preparation

The first step in physical preparation is adequate sleep and rest. You might
be thinking such a thing is impossible in college, where sleep deprivation
and late nights come with the territory. However, research shows the
extreme effects a lifestyle of limited sleep can have, far beyond yawning or
dozing off in class (Mitru, Millrood, & Mateika, 2002; Walker, 2017). As
far as public speaking is concerned, your energy level and ability to be alert
and aware during the speech will be affected by lack of sleep.

Secondly, you would be better off to eat something that is protein-based
rather than processed sugar-based before speaking. In other words, cheese
or peanut butter on whole grain toast, Greek yogurt, or eggs for breakfast
rather than a donut and soft drink. Some traditionalists also discourage
the drinking of milk because it is believed to stimulate mucus production,
but this has not been scientifically proven (Lai & Kardos, 2013).

A third suggestion is to wear clothes that you know you look good in
and are comfortable but also meet the context's requirements (that is,
your instructor may have a dress code for speech days). Especially, wear
comfortable shoes that give you a firm base for your posture. Flip- flops
and really high heels may not fit these categories.
Exploring Public Speaking  8  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

A final suggestion for physical preparation is to utilize some stretching or
relaxation techniques that will loosen your limbs or throat. Essentially,
your emotions want you to run away, but the social situation says you must
stay, so all that energy for running must go somewhere. The energy might
go to your legs, hands, stomach, sweat glands, or skin, with undesirable
physical consequences. Tightening and stretching your hands, arms, legs,
and throat (through intentional, wide yawns) for a few seconds before
speaking can help release some of the tension. Your instructor may be able
to help you with these exercises, or you can find some on the Internet. We
have included some in Chapter 11.

Contextual preparation

The more you can know about the venue where you will be speaking, the
better. For this class, of course, it will be your classroom, but for other
situations where you might experience "communication apprehension,"
you should check out the space beforehand or get as much information as
possible. For example, if you were required to give a short talk for a job
interview, you would want to know what the room will be like, if there is
equipment for projection, how large the audience will be, and the seating
arrangements. If possible, you will want to practice your presentation in a
room that is similar to the actual space where you will deliver it.

The best advice for contextual preparation is to be on time, even early.
If you have to rush in at the last minute, as so many students do, you
will not be mindful, focused, or calm for the speech. Even more, if you
are early, you can make sure equipment is working, and can converse
with the audience as they enter. Professional speakers often do this to
relax themselves, build credibility, and gain knowledge to adapt their
presentations to the audience. Even if you don't want to "schmooze"
beforehand, being on time will help you create a good first impression and
thus enhance your credibility before the actual speech.
Exploring Public Speaking  9  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Speech preparation

Procrastination, like lack of sleep, seems to just be part of the college
life. Sometimes we feel that we just don't get the best ideas until the
last minute. Writing that essay for literature class at 3:00 a.m. just may
work for you. However, when it comes to public speaking, there are some
definite reasons you would not want to do that. First, of course, if you are
finishing up your outline at 3:00 a.m. and have a 9:00 speech, you are
going to be tired and unable to focus. Second, your instructor may require
you to turn in your outline several days ahead of the speech date. However,
the main reason is that public speaking requires active, oral, repeated
practice before the actual delivery.

You do not want the first time that you say the words to be when you are
in front of your audience. Practicing is the only way that you will feel
confident, fluent, and in control of the words you speak. Practicing (and
timing yourself) repeatedly is also the only way that you will be assured
that your speech meets the assignment's time limits, and speaking within
the expected time limits is a fundamental rule of public speaking. You may
think your speech is five minutes long but it may end up being ten minutes
the first time you practice it--or only two minutes!

Your practicing should be out loud, standing up, with shoes on, with
someone to listen, if possible (other than your dog or cat), and with your
visual aids. If you can record yourself and watch it, that is even better. If
you do record yourself, make sure you record yourself from the feet up--
or at least the hips up--so you can see your body language. The need for
oral practice will be emphasized over and over in this book and probably
by your instructor. As you progress as a speaker, you will always need to
practice but perhaps not to the extent you do as a novice speaker.

As hard as it is to believe,

YOU NEVER LOOK AS NERVOUS AS YOU FEEL.

You may feel that your anxiety is at level seventeen on a scale of one to ten,
but the audience does not perceive it the same way. They may perceive it
at a three or four or even less. That's not to say they won't see any signs of
your anxiety and that you don't want to learn to control it, only that what
you are feeling inside is not as visible as you might think. This principle
relates back to focus. If you know you don't look as nervous as you feel,
you can focus and be mindful of the message and audience rather than
your own emotions.

Also, you will probably find that your anxiety decreases throughout the
class (Finn, Sawyer, & Schrodt, 2009). In her Ted Talk video, Harvard
Business School social psychologist Amy Cuddy discusses nonverbal
communication and suggests that instead of "faking it until you make it,"
that you can, and should, "fake it until you become it." She shares research
Exploring Public Speaking  10  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

                     that shows how our behavior affects our mindsets, not just the other way
                     around. Therefore, the act of giving the speech and "getting through it"
                     will help you gain confidence. Interestingly, Dr. Cuddy directs listeners to
                     strike a "power pose" of strong posture, feet apart, and hands on hips or
                     stretched over head to enhance confidence.

                     Final Note: If you are an audience member, you can help the speaker with
                     his/her anxiety, at least a little bit. Mainly, be an engaged listener from
                     beginning to end. You can imagine that a speaker is going to be more
                     nervous if the audience looks bored from the start. A speaker with less
                     anxiety is going to do a better job and be more interesting. Of course, do
                     not walk into class during your classmates' speeches, or get up and leave.
                     In addition to being rude, it pulls their minds away from their message
                     and distracts the audience. Your instructor will probably have a policy on
                     this behavior, too, as well as a dress code and other expectations on speech
                     days. There are good reasons for these policies, so respect them.

   Communication     1.3 - Understanding the Process of Public

sharing meaning      Speaking
between two or more
people               Earlier it was stated that public speaking is like an enlarged or projected
                     conversation. Conversation and public speaking are two forms of human
                     communication, of which there are also small group communication,
                     organizational communication, mass communication, and intercultural
                     communication. All human communication is a process composed of
                     certain necessary elements:

                          People (often referred to as senders and receivers);
                          context;
                          message;
                          channel;
                          noise;
                          feedback; and
                          outcome.
                     With all these elements working together, the act of communication can
                     be very complex. The famous German philosopher Johann Goethe said
                     something to the effect that (and we paraphrase here) if we understood
                     how complex communication really is, we probably would not attempt it!
                     (One translation has it, "No one would talk much in society if they knew
                     how often they misunderstood others.") Perhaps here we can demystify
                     some of it. Communication is a process, not a singular event. Later we will
                     look at models of communication, which can be helpful for understanding
                     communication but are basically snapshots because a model cannot
                     capture the dynamic process of communication. A simple, basic definition
                     of communication is "sharing meaning between two or more people."
Exploring Public Speaking  11  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Beyond a definition, we can break it down into its part or components and                Culture
examine each.
                                                                                the system of learned
Human communication first involves people. That is pretty obvious, but          and shared symbols,
we do not want to be so focused on the message or channel that we forget        language, values, and
that people are at the center of communication. In public speaking it is        norms that distinguish

the "receiver(s)," but in the real world it is not always as simple as that.    from another
Sometimes the speaker initiates the message, but other times the speaker
is responding to the audience's initiation. It is enough to say that sender
and receiver exchange roles sometimes and both are as necessary as the
other to the communication process.

Human communication and public speaking secondly requires context.
Context has many levels, and there are several "contexts" going on at the
same time in any communication act. These contexts can include:

     Historical, or what has gone on between the sender(s) and receiver(s)
      before the speech. The historical elements can be positive or negative,
      recent or further back in time. In later chapters we will see that these
      past events can influence the speaker's credibility with the audience,
      as well as their understanding.

     Cultural, which sometimes refers to the country where someone was
      born and raised but can also include ethnic, racial, religious, and
      regional cultures or co-cultures. Culture is defined (Floyd, 2017) as
      "the system of learned and shared symbols, language, values, and
      norms that distinguish one group of people from another."

     Social, or what kind of relationship the sender(s) and receiver(s) are
      involved in, such as teacher-student, co-workers, employer-employee,
      or members of the same civic organization, faith, profession, or
      community.

     Physical, which involves where the communication is taking place
      and the attributes of that location. The physical context can have
      cultural meaning (a famous shrine or monument) that influences the
      form and purpose of the communication, or attributes that influence
      audience attention (temperature, seating arrangements, or external
      noise).

Each one of these aspects of context bears upon how we behave as a                       Channel
communicator and specifically a public speaker.
                                                                                the means through

to talk to and be pleasant. On the other hand, it might be very formal,
intentional, and planned, such as a commencement address or a speech in
this course. In this textbook all the chapters will be devoted to the creation

                       other elements of the communication process. The message is a product of
direct or indirect     all of them.
messages sent from an
audience (receivers)   Fourth, public speaking, like all communication, requires a channel.
back to the original   We think of channel in terms of television or something like a waterway
sender of the message  (The English Channel). Channel is how the message gets from sender
                       to receiver. In interpersonal human communication, we see each other
                       and hear each other, in the same place and time. In mediated or mass
                       communication, some sort of machine or technology (tool) comes
                       between the people--phone, radio, television, printing press and paper, or
                       computer.

                       Recently we have all become more attuned to mediated communication
                       through teleconferencing software, but we also have become aware of its
                       limitations as a communication channel. Communication scholars make
                       the distinction between "rich" and "lean" communication channels (Floyd,
                       2017). Essentially, the more verbal and nonverbal messages sent in a
                       channel during an interaction, the richer the channel or media. So, face-
                       to-face public speaking, small group meetings, or interviews are "richer"
                       rather than "leaner." The face-to-face channel adds to the immediacy and
                       urgency of public speaking, but it also means that physical appearance and
                       delivery can affect the receiver(s) positively and negatively. It also means
                       that public speaking is linear in time and we do not always get a "redo" or
                       "do-over." This element of channel influences structure, transitions, and
                       language choices, which are discussed later in the book.

                       The fifth element of human communication is feedback, which in public
                       speaking is usually nonverbal, such as head movement, facial expressions,
                       laughter, eye contact, posture, and other behaviors that we use to judge
                       audience involvement, understanding, and approval. These types of
                       feedback can be positive (nodding, sitting up, leaning forward, smiling) or
                       less than positive (tapping fingers, fidgeting, lack of eye contact, checking
                       devices).

                       Can you think of some others that would indicate the audience is either not
                       engaged in, confused about, or disapproving of the message or speaker?
                       Feedback is important because we use it in all communication encounters
                       to evaluate our effectiveness and to decide the next step to take in the
                       specific communication interaction. For example, a quizzical expression
                       may mean we should explain ourselves again. Someone's turning away
                       from us is interpreted as disapproval, avoidance, or dismissal.

                                                                                the communication

These examples are all of nonverbal feedback, which is most common in
public speaking. There are times when verbal feedback from the audience
is appropriate. You may stop and entertain questions about your content,
or the audience may fill out a comment card at the end of the speech.
You should stay in control of the verbal feedback, however, so that the
audience does not feel as if they can interrupt you during the speech.

The sixth element of human communication is noise, which might be
considered interruptions or interference. Some amount of noise is almost
always present due to the complexity of human behavior and context.
There are just so many things that can come into the communication
process to obscure the messages being sent. Some of the ways that noise
can be classified include:

     Contextual - something in the room or physical environment keeps
       them from attending to or understanding a message

     Physical - the receiver(s)' health affects their understanding of the
       message, or the sender's physical state affects her ability to be clear
       and have good delivery.

     Psychological - the receiver(s) or sender(s) have stress, anxiety, past
       experience, personal concerns, or some other psychological issue that
       prevents the audience from receiving an intended message.

     Semantic - the meanings the audience attaches to words, phrases,
       graphics, and other symbols are different from that intended by the
       speaker.

This short list of types of noise is not exhaustive, but it is enough to
point out that many things can "go wrong" in a public speaking situation,
enough to make us agree with Mr. Philosopher Goethe. However, the
reason for studying public speaking is to become aware of the potential
for these limitations or "noise" factors, to determine if they could happen

individually              putting his/her thoughts and feelings into words or other symbols. Models
                          also use the word decode to express the process of the listener or receiver
                          understanding those words and symbols and making meaning of them
                          for themselves personally. Models of communication attempt to show the
                          interplay of the many elements that take place in the communication act.

                          Em Griffin (1987), a long-time professor of communication at Wheaton
                          College and author of several textbooks, compares the communication
                          process to three games, dependent on one's theory of how it works. Some
                          think of communication like bowling, where the speaker throws a message
                          at an audience in order to knock them down. The audience does not really
                          respond or have very much to say about the act; they only react. Some
                          think of communication like table tennis (ping-pong); there is back and
                          forth between the participants, but the goal is to win. Griffin says the
                          better game metaphor is charades, or Pictionary, where a team together
Exploring Public Speaking  15  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

tries to understand meaning and one player has to make many attempts
to get the team to guess the right answer. It is collaborative and involves
trial and error. Models of communication that show the value of feedback
in recalibrating the message are like the games of charades. An ethical
speaker sees public speaking as more than attacking the audience and
more than winning.

Additionally, communication is referred to a symbolic process. In this
context, a symbol is a word, icon, picture, object, or number that is used
to stand for or represent a concept, thing, or experience. Symbols almost
always have more than one specific meaning or concept they represent.
A flag, for example, is a symbol of a country or political unit, but it also
represents the history, culture, and feelings that people in that country
experience about various aspects of the culture.

The word "car" or "automobile" represents a machine with four tires,
windows, metal body, internal combustion engine, and so on, but it also
represents personal, individual experiences and associations with cars. We
call this difference denotative (the objective or literal meaning shared
by most people using the word) and the connotative (the subjective,
cultural, or personal meaning the word evokes in people together or
individually). One of the authors and her husband recently visited the
National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Nothing like a car
museum shows that "car" has deep and broad cultural meanings beyond
metal, rubber, and glass.

Now that we have looked at the process of communication, let's apply it to
public speaking. The speaker originates and creates a structured message
and sends it through the visual/oral channel using symbols and nonverbal
means to the audience members as a group, who provide (mostly
nonverbal) feedback. The speaker and audience may or may not be aware
of the types of interference or noise that exist, and the speaker may try to
deal with them. As a result of the public speaking, the audience's minds,
emotions, and/or actions are affected, and possibly the speaker's as well.

Humans have been aware and using public speaking for purposes of
persuasion, religious instruction, and community-building for millennia.
Corax, Tisias, Plato, Isocrates, and Aristotle studied or wrote books about
rhetoric in the Hellenistic Age of Greek Civilization (third and fourth
centuries BCE). As scholars have widened their view, they found that
India and China had conceptualizations of rhetoric through Buddha and
Confucius, and Han Fei Tzu (Kennedy, 1980), as did Egyptians (Hutto,
2002). Public speaking as an art form and a social force has been around a
long time.

Marcus Cicero (106-43 B.C. E.) was a renowned politician, orator, and
advocate of rhetoric in the late Roman Republic. For centuries he was
Exploring Public Speaking  16  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

considered the role model for aspiring public speakers. He discussed the
process of public speaking in a unique way, proposing that a speaker go
through the "canons (laws) of rhetoric" to create a speech. These steps are:

    1. invention (creating content and arguments),
    2. disposition (organization and logic of arguments),
    3. style (choosing the right level and quality of vocabulary),
    4. memory (actually, memorizing famous speeches to learn good public

        speaking technique), and
    5. delivery (nonverbal communication).

This book will take this same basic approach as the canons of rhetoric in
helping you walk through the process of constructing a presentation.

1.4 - The Value of Public Speaking in Your Life

Despite the long history of public speaking, dating back to at least 500
BCE, it is not unusual for students to question why this course is included
in the curriculum of their major. You might have put it off or be taking it
in your first semester. You might believe that it will have little use in your
future career. The actual experience of completing the course may change
your mind, and we would encourage you to do some research on our own
about the question of how public speaking fits into your career. Perhaps
you could talk to some professionals in your future career field, or perhaps
your instructor will discuss this in class or assign a short speech about it.

However, here are three reasons why you can benefit from this course.
First, public speaking is one of the major communication skills desired by
employers. Employers are frequently polled regarding the skills they most
want employees to possess, and communication is almost always in the
top three (Smith, 2022). Of course, "communication skills" is a broad term
and involves a number of abilities such as team leadership, clear writing in
business formats, conflict resolution, interviewing, and listening. However,
public speaking is one of those sought-after skills, even in fields where the
entry-level workers may not do much formal public speaking. Nurses give
training presentations to parents of newborn babies; accountants advocate
for new software in their organizations; managers lead team meetings.

If you are taking this class at the beginning of your college career, you
will benefit in your other future classes from the research, organizational,
and presentational skills learned here. College freshmen enter with many
expectations of college life and learning that they need to "un-learn,"
and one of those is the expectation that they will not have to give oral
presentations in classes. However, that is wishful thinking. Different kinds
of presentations will be common in your upcoming classes. Research done
at the authors' college involving 341 graduating seniors' perceptions of
the basic public speaking course showed that 72% of respondents agreed
Exploring Public Speaking  17  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

with the statement, "I feel that I used what I learned in the course in other
courses I took towards my degree" (Tucker, Kinkead, & Self, 2019).

Another reason for taking a public speaking course is the harder-to-
measure but valuable personal benefits. As an article on the USAToday
College website states, a public speaking course can help you be a better,
more informed and critical listener; it can "encourage you to voice
your ideas and take advantage of the influence you have;" and it gives
you an opportunity to face a major fear you might have in a controlled
environment (Massengale, 2014).

Finally, the course can attune you to the power of public speaking to
change the world. Presentations that lead to changes in laws, policies,
leadership, and culture happen every day, all over the world. This last
reason needs our exploration and emphasis because it may be a reason
readers of this textbook do not consider. The vast majority of people, of
various ages, who attend college in the early 21st century do so for income
and career advancements. Although many reliable sources could be cited
here to make the same point, we will use the Strada-Gallup Education
Consumer Survey conducted in 2017, "with a random sample of 86,935
respondents aged 18 to 65, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of
Columbia" (2018, p. 14). Fifty-eight percent of respondents said their main
reason for attending college was "good job or career," and the next highest
response was at 23%, "learning and knowledge" (p. 3). Interestingly, the
highest ranked reason for choosing one's specific college or institution was
location.

All this is understandable because college is a huge investment of time,
energy, and resources. However, looking back at the history of public
speaking, from the beginning it was prized and taught so that individuals
could influence their communities. We the authors hope that you do
not see this class as something just to "get over" for a grade and move
on to the "important stuff." Using communication skills to relate to
others, speak out for important issues, and improve your community is
the "important stuff," as well as earning and advancing in that career you
desire, where public speaking skills will contribute greatly. (And by the
way, you're likely to change careers, so communication skills will transfer
when you do!) It might be speaking at a school board, PTA, or city council,
or advocating for health and wellness at your work place, or motivating
co-members to raise funds for a civic group. You might not see yourself
as political, but the great benefit of a public speaking class is that you can
"find your voice"--your confidence, your passion, and your message--and
get excited about sharing it. You can also learn, as was also prized by the
ancient Romans and Greeks, the artistic nature and beauty of a well-
prepared and well-delivered public message, `one that serves to bring
more light and less heat to public discourse.'"

1.5 - Getting Started in Public Speaking

To finish this first chapter, let's close with some foundational principles
about public speaking, which apply no matter the context, audience, topic,
or purpose.

Timing is everything

We often hear this about acting or humor. In this case, it has to do
with keeping within the time limits. As mentioned before, you can only
know that you are within time limits by practicing and timing yourself;
being within time limits also shows preparation and forethought. More
importantly, being on time (or early) for the presentation and within
time limits shows respect for your audience. Finally, if you are allotted
ten minutes to speak, you can't assume the audience will gladly give you
fifteen just because you did not prepare.

Public speaking requires muscle memory

If you have ever learned a new sport, especially in your teen or adult years,
you know that you must consciously put your body through some training
to get it used to the physical activity of the sport. An example is golf. A
golf swing, unlike swinging a baseball bat, is not a natural movement
and requires a great deal of practice, over and over, to get right. Pick up
any golf magazine and there will be at least one article on "perfecting the
swing." In fact, when done incorrectly, the swing can cause severe back
and knee problems over time (Duvall, 2019).

Public speaking is a physical activity as well. You are standing and
sometimes moving around; your voice, eye contact, face, and hands are
involved. You will expend physical energy, and after the speech you may
be tired. Even more, your audience's understanding and acceptance of
your message may depend somewhat on how energetic, controlled, and
fluid is your physical delivery. Your credibility as a speaker hinges to some
extent on these matters. Consequently, learning public speaking means
you must train your body to be comfortable in front of an audience and to
move in predictable and effective ways.

Public speaking involves a content and relationship dimension

You may have heard the old saying, "People don't care how much you
know until they know how much you care." According to Watzlawick,
Beavin, and Jackson (1967), all human communication has two elements
going on at the same time: content and relationship. There are statements
about ideas, facts, and information, and there are messages communicated
about the relationship between the communication partners, past and
present. These relationship messages have to do with trust, respect, and
Exploring Public Speaking  19  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

credibility, and are conveyed through evidence, appeals, wording (and
what the speaker does not say) as well as nonverbal communication.

That said, public speaking is not a good way to provide a lot of facts and
data to your audience. In fact, there are limits to how much information
you can pile on your audience before listening is too difficult for them.
However, public speaking is a good way to make the information
meaningful for your audience--to help them see its relevance to them
and what they can do with it. You can use a search engine with the term
"Death by PowerPoint" and find lots of humorous, and too true, cartoons
of audiences overwhelmed by charts, graphs, and slides full of text. In
the case, less is more. This "less as more" principle will be re-emphasized
throughout this textbook.

Emulation is the sincerest form of flattery

Learn from those who do public speaking well, but find what works best
for you. Emulation is not imitation or copying someone; it is following a
general model. Notice what other speakers do well in a speech and try to
incorporate those strategies. An example is humor. Some of us excel at
using humor, or some types of it. Some of us do not, or do not believe we
do, no matter how hard we try. In that case, you may have to find other
strengths to becoming an effective speaker.

Know your strengths and weaknesses

Reliable personality inventories, such as the Myers Briggs or the
Clifton StrengthsQuest tests, can be helpful in knowing your strengths,
weaknessess, and personality trait. One such area is whether you are an
extravert or introvert. Introverts, estimated by one source as up to 50%
of the population (Buettner, 2012), get their psychological energy from
being alone while extraverts tend to get it from being around others. This
is a very basic distinction and there is more to the two categories, but you
can see how an extravert may have an advantage with public speaking.
However, the extravert may be tempted not to prepare and practice
as much because they have so much fun in front of an audience, while
the introvert may overprepare but still feel uncomfortable. Your public
speaking abilities will benefit from increased self-awareness about such
characteristics and your strengths. (For an online self-inventory about
introversion and extraversion, go to http://www.quietrev.com/the-
introvert-test/)

Remember the Power of Story

Stories and storytelling, in the form of anecdotes and narrative
illustrations, are your most powerful tool as a public speaker. For better
or worse, audiences are likely to remember anecdotes and narratives long
Exploring Public Speaking  20  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

after a speech's statistics are forgotten. Your instructor may assign you to
do a personal narrative speech, or require you to write an introduction or
conclusion for one of your speeches that includes a story. This does not
mean that other types of proof are unimportant and that you want just to
tell stories in your speech, but human beings love stories and often will
walk away from a speech moved by or remembering a powerful story or
example more than anything.

Conclusion

This chapter has been designed to be informative but also serve as a
bit of a pep talk. Many students face this course with trepidation, for
various reasons. However, as studies have shown over the years, a certain
amount of tension when preparing to speak in public can be good for
motivation. A strong course in public speaking should be grounded in the
communication research, the wisdom of those who have taught it over the
last 2,400 years, and reflecting on your own experience.

John Dewey (1916), the twentieth century education scholar, is noted for
saying, "Education does not come just from experience, but from reflecting
on the experience." As you finish this chapter and look toward your first
presentation in class, be sure to give yourself time after the experience
to reflect, whether by talking to another person, journaling, or sitting
quietly and thinking, about how the experience can benefit the next speech
encounter. Doing so will get you on the road to becoming more confident
in this endeavor of public speaking. (And avoid focusing only on the "what
I did wrongs." You did some things well!)
Exploring Public Speaking  21  Chapter 1: The Basics of Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Something to Think About

Investigate some other communication models on the Internet. What
do they have in common? How are they different? Which ones seem to
explain communication best to you?

Who are some public speakers you admire? Why? (Avoid naming deceased
historical figures whom you have not heard personally or face-to-face.)

When this class is over, what specific skills do you want to develop as a
communicator?

What behavior done by public speakers "drives you nuts," that is, creates
"noise" for you in listening to them?

When you experience communication anxiety, what happens in your body
and mind?

2.1 - The Importance of Audience Analysis                                      Audience analysis

One of the advantages of studying public speaking and improving your          examining and looking
own skills is that you become much more aware of what other speakers do.      at your audience first
In one respect, we are able to look for ways to emulate what they do--for     by its demographic
example, how they might seamlessly incorporate stories or examples into       characteristics and
their speaking, or how they might use transitions to help audiences follow    then by their internal
the speech's logic. In another respect, we become aware of how a speaker      psychological traits
might use dramatic delivery or emotional appeals to hide a lack of facts or
logic. A course in public speaking should include ways to improve one's            Demographic

This chapter will look at the audience from both sides of the lectern, so     the outward
to speak. First it will examine how a presenter can fully understand the      characteristics of the
audience, which will aid the speaker in constructing the approach and         audience
content of the speech. Secondly, this chapter will examine the public
speaker as audience member and how to get the most out of a speech,                Stereotyping
even if the topic to which they are listening does not seem immediately
interesting.                                                                  generalizing about
                                                                              a group of people

is commonly known as audience analysis. Their concept about content           them do
and relationship dimension will guide this chapter. You are not using
the speech to dump a large amount of content on the audience; you are
making that content important, meaningful, and applicable to them.
Additionally, the way the audience perceives you and your connection
to them--such as whether there is mutual trust and respect--will largely
determine your success with the audience. The speaker must respect the
audience as well and the audience should trust the speaker.

2.2 - Demographic Characteristics

When we use the term audience analysis, we mean looking at the
audience first by its demographic characteristics and then by their internal
psychological traits. "Demo-" comes the Greek root word demos meaning
"people," and "-graphic" means description or drawing. Demographic
characteristics describe the outward characteristics of the audience.
This textbook will discuss eleven of them below, although you might
see longer or shorter lists in other sources. Some of them are obvious
and some not as much. But before we get into the specific demographic
characteristics, let's look at three principles.

First, be careful not to stereotype on the basis of a demographic
characteristic. Stereotyping is generalizing about a group of people and
Exploring Public Speaking  24  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                               Listening

       Totalizing        assuming that because a few persons in that group have a characteristic,
                         all of them do. If someone were sitting near campus and saw two students
taking one               drive by in pickup trucks and said, "All students at that college drive
characteristic of        pickup trucks," that would be both stereotyping and the logical fallacy
a group or person        of hasty generalization (see Chapter 14). At the same time, one should
and making that the      not totalize about a person or group of persons. Totalizing is taking
"totality" or sum total  one characteristic of a group or person and making that the "totality" or
of what that person or   sum total of what that person or group is. Totalizing often happens to
group is                 persons with disabilities, for example; the disability is seen as the totality
                         of that person, or all that person is about. Totalizing can be harmful to
                         the relationship and ineffective as a means of communicating, as well
                         as insensitive and unethical. If a speaker before a group of professional
                         women totalizes and concludes that some perception of "women's issues"
                         is all they care about, the speaker will be less effective and dismissed as a
                         source of information.

                         Avoiding stereotyping and totalizing is important because you cannot
                         assume everything about an audience based on just one demographic
                         characteristic. Only two or three might be important, but in other cases,
                         several demographic characteristics matter. The age of a group will be
                         important in how they think about investing their money, but so will
                         the socio-economic level, career or profession, and even where they live.
                         Even their religious beliefs may come into it, since many religious groups
                         have teachings about how much income should be spent, invested, or
                         given to charity. A good speaker will be aware of more than one or two
                         characteristics of the audience.

                         Second, in terms of thinking about demographic characteristics, not
                         all of them are created equal, and not all of them are important in
                         every situation. When parents come to a PTA meeting, they are mainly
                         concerned about their children and playing the important role of "parent,"
                         rather than being concerned about their profession. When senior citizens
                         are thinking about how they will pay for their homes in retirement years,
                         their ethnicity might have less to do with it than their age and socio-
                         economic level.

                         Third, there are two ways to think about demographic characteristics:
                         positively and negatively. In a positive sense, the demographic
                         characteristics tell you what might motivate or interest the audience or
                         even bind them together as a group. In a negative sense, the demographic
                         characteristic might tell you what subjects or approaches to avoid.
                         Understanding your audience is not a game of defensive tic-tac-toe, but a
                         means of relating to them.

                         For example, a common example is given about audiences of the Roman
                         Catholic faith. Speakers are warned not to "offend" them by talking about
                         abortion, since official Roman Catholic teaching is against abortion.
                         However, this analysis misses three points. First, even if most Roman
Exploring Public Speaking  25  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                                  Listening

Catholics take a pro-life position, they are aware of the issues and are
adults who can listen and think about topics. Additionally, not all Roman
Catholics agree with the official church stance, and it is a complex issue.
Second, Roman Catholics are not the only people who hold views against
abortion. Third, and most important, if all the speaker thinks about
Roman Catholics is that they are against something, the speaker might
miss all the things the audience is for and what motivates them. Think
about how the demographic characteristics inform what to talk about and
how, not just what to avoid talking about.

There is one more point to be made about demographic characteristics
before they are listed and explained. In a country of increasing diversity,
demographic characteristics are dynamic. People change as the country
changes. What was true about demographic characteristics--and even
what was considered a demographic characteristic--has changed in
the last fifty years. For example, the number of Internet users in 1980
was minuscule (mostly military personnel). Another change is that the
percentage of the population living in the Great Lakes areas has dropped
as the population has either aged or moved southward. Even harder is to
associate particular beliefs to political party affiliation, as those are fluid,
too.

What follows is a listing of eleven of the more common demographic
characteristics that you might use in understanding your audience and
shaping your speech to adapt to your audience.

Age

The first demographic characteristic on most list is age. In American
culture, we have traditionally ascribed certain roles, behaviors,
motivations, interests, and concerns to people of certain ages. Young
people are concerned about career choices; people over 60 are concerned
about retirement. People go to college from the age of 18 to about 24.
Persons older than 50 have usually raised their children and are "empty
nesters. These neat categories still exist for many, but in some respects
they are outdated.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (2019), over
37% of college students are over 25 years old. Some women and men wait
until their late thirties to have children, and thus at 50 have preteens
and teenagers in the home. More and more grandparents are raising
grandchildren, and some people foster or adopt children in their middle
years. Combining the longer lives Americans are living with the economic
recession of 2008 and following, 65 is no longer a feasible age for
retirement for many.

Therefore, knowing that your audience is 18, 30, 55, or 70 is important,
but it is just one of many factors. In your classroom audience, for example,
Exploring Public Speaking  26  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                               Listening

you may find 30-year-old returning, nontraditional college students, young
entrepreneurs, 17-year-old dual enrollment students, and veterans who
have done three or four tours in the Middle East as well as 18- or 19-year-
old traditional college students. This diversity will often be the case with
other audiences you will encounter.

Gender

For the sake of discussion of societal norms with respect to gender, this
section discusses gender in "binary" terms. However, as gender comes
to be understood in terms of its social construction, more people openly
identify as a gender other than traditionally male or female. Even those
who identify as strictly male or female may not follow the traditional
gender roles ascribed by society. This is an area for growing sensitivity.
Therefore, while we reference some of the most common perceptions
related to gender, it should be noted that the purpose, subject, and
context of your speech will influence how and whether you address this
demographic characteristic.

The gender demographic is open to misunderstanding as much as any
other. Despite stereotypes, not all women have fifty pairs of shoes with
stiletto heels in their closets, and not all men love football. In almost all
cases you will be speaking to a "mixed" audience of men and women, so
you will have to keep both groups in mind. If you are speaking to a group
of all men or all women and you are of the same gender as the audience,
you might be able to use some appropriate common experiences to connect
with the audience. However, if you are a woman speaking to an all-male
audience or a man speaking to an all-female audience, those are situations
in which to be aware of overall gender differences in communication.

Like all demographic traits, gender is associated with differences in
communication styles. Importantly, many of these differences may
be learned through socialization as opposed to inherited biologically.
According to Deborah Tannen (2007), a scholar of linguistics and a
well-known author, men and women in the United States do tend to
utilize divergent communication styles. She is quick to point out neither
is all good or all bad, nor do they apply to every single person. The
two communication styles are just different, and not recognizing the
differences can cause "noise" in communication. Although she normally
applies these principles to family, marital, and work relationships, they
can be applied to public speaking.

According to Tannen, women tend to communicate more inductively;
they prefer to give lots of details and then move toward a conclusion.
Other research on differences in gender communication indicate that
women listen better, interrupt less, and collaborate more, although there
is research to indicate this is not always the case. (Keep in mind these
are generalized tendencies, not necessarily true of every single woman or
Exploring Public Speaking  27  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                              Listening

man.) Women tend to be less direct, to ask more questions, to use "hedges"
and qualifiers ("it seems to me," "I may be wrong, but...") and to apologize
more, often unnecessarily. Other research indicates women praise
more, consequently expecting more praise, and interpret lack of praise
differently from how men do (Floyd, 2017).

This pattern of less direct communication ascribed to many women may
not sound the same to men as it does to women. To men it may seem
that a female speaker is unsure or lacks confidence, whereas the female
speaker is doing it out of habit or because she thinks it sounds open-
minded and diplomatic; possibly, the strategy has worked before and/
or in most cases. Tannen calls women's style of communication "rapport"
style, whereas she labels male communication as more of a "report" style.
Some communication scholars call these differences "expressive" (women)
vs. informational (men) (Floyd 2017).

Male speakers, on the other hand, are perceived to be more deductive and
direct; they state their point, give limited details to back it up, and then
move on. Men may be less inclined to ask questions and qualify what they
say; they might not see any reason to add unnecessary fillers. Men also
may tend toward basic facts, giving some the impression they are less
"emotional" in their communication, which is a broad stereotype. Finally,
men are socialized to "fix" things and may give advice to women when it is
not really needed or wanted.

These generalized differences in communication by gender have led to
much material for comedians and YouTube videos and much discussion
and soul-searching about the observed tendency of women to habitually
Exploring Public Speaking  28  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2

                          not follow the habit of starting sentences with "I don't know if this is 100%
                          correct, but..." or even worse, the habitual "I'm sorry, but..." Men are often
                          perceived as abrupt when talking to women, and much research supports
                          the conclusion that men talk more than women in groups and interrupt
                          more. So, male speakers should allow time for questions and work hard at
                          listening.

                          Age and gender are the two main ways we categorize people: a teenaged
                          boy, an elderly lady, a middle-aged man; a young mother. However, there
                          are several other demographic characteristics.

                          Race, Ethnicity, and Culture

                          Race, ethnicity, and culture are often lumped together; at the same time,
                          these categorizations can be controversial. We will consider race, ethnicity,
                          and culture in one section because of their interrelationship even though
                          they are distinct categories

                          We might think in terms of a few racial groups in the world: Caucasian,
                          African, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Native American. Each one of these
                          has many ethnicities. Caucasian has ethnicities of Northern European,
                          Arab, some South Asian people groups, Mediterranean, etc. Then each
                          ethnicity has cultures. Mediterranean ethnicities include Greek, Italian,
                          Spanish, etc., and then each of these has subcultures, and so on. It should
                          be noted that many social scientists today reject the idea of race as a
                          biological reality altogether and see it as a social construct. This means it
                          is a view of human social groups that has arisen over time and affects our
                          thinking about others.

                          Unfortunately, dividing these categories and groups is not that easy, and
                          these categories are almost always clouded by complicated political and
                          personal concerns, which we do not have time or space to address here.
                          Most audiences will be heterogeneous, or a mixture of different types of
                          people and demographic characteristics, as opposed to homogeneous,
                          very similar in many characteristics (a group of single, 20-year-old, white
                          female nursing students at your college). Therefore, be sensitive to your
                          audience members' identification with a culture. Anglos are often guilty of

Version 4.2
                                                                                Listening

confusing Hispanic (a language category) with cultures (a more regional or
historical category), and overlooking that Mexican is not Puerto Rican is
not Cuban is not Colombian. In the same way for Caucasians, a Canadian
is not an Australian is not an American is not a Scot, just because their last
names, basic looks, and language seem almost the same (well, sort of!).
"American" itself is a problematic term since "American" can refer to every
country in the Western Hemisphere.

As mentioned in a previous example, focus as much on the positives--what
that culture values--rather than what the culture does not like or value.
Now we turn to an even more complicated category, religion.

Religion

Religion, casually defined as beliefs and practices about the transcendent,
deity, and the meaning of life, can be thought of as an affiliation and as
a life commitment. According to polls, due to either family or choice, a
majority of Americans (although the percentage is shrinking) have some
kind of religious affiliation, identity, or connection. It may simply be where
they were christened as an infant, but it is a connection--"I'm in that
group." About 23% of Americans are being called "nones" because they do
not claim a formal religious affiliation (Pew Research, 2015).

On the other hand, a person may have an affiliation with a religious group
but have no real commitment to it. The teaching and practices of the
group, such as a denomination, may not affect the member's personal
daily life. Likewise, someone who has an affiliation may develop his or her
own variations of beliefs that do not match the established organization's
doctrines. Unless the audience is brought together because of common
faith concerns or the group shares the same affiliation or commitment,
religious faith may not be relevant to your topic and not a central factor in
the audience analysis. As with other categories, be careful not to assume or
stereotype about religious groups.

Religion, like ethnicity and culture, is an area where you should be
conscious of the diversity of your audience. Not everyone worships in
a "church," and not everyone attends a house of worship on Sunday. Not
everyone celebrates Christmas the way your family does, and some do not
celebrate it at all. Inclusive language, which will be discussed in Chapter
10, will be helpful in these situations.

Group Affiliation

Without getting into a sociological discussion, we can note that one
demographic characteristic and source of identity for some is group
affiliation. To what groups do the audience members' predominantly
belong? Sometimes it will be useful to know if the group is mostly
Republican, Democrat, members of a union, members of a professional
Exploring Public Speaking  30  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                               Listening

organization, and so on. In many cases, your reason for being the speaker
is connected to the group identity. Again, be mindful of what the group
values and what binds the audience together.

Region

Region, another demographic characteristic, relates to where the audience
members live. We can think of this in two ways. We live in regions of
the country: Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Rocky Mountain region,
Northwest, or West Coast. These regions can be broken down even more,
such as coastal Southeastern states. Americans, especially in the East, are
very conscious of their state or region and identify with it a great deal.

The second way to think about region is as "residence" or whether the
audience lives in an urban area, the suburbs, or a rural area. If you live
in the city, you probably do not think about being without cell phone
or Internet service, but many people in rural areas do not take those for
granted. The clubs that students in rural high schools belong to might be
very different from what a student in a city would join.

Occupation

Occupation may be a demographic characteristic that is central to your
presentation. For the most part in the U.S., we choose our occupations
because they reflect our values, interests, and abilities, and as we associate
with colleagues in that occupation, those values, interests, abilities, and
ties are strengthened. You are probably in college to enter a specific career
that you believe will be economically beneficial and personally fulfilling.
We sometimes spend more time at work than any other activity, except
sleeping. Messages that acknowledge the importance, diversity, and
reasons for occupations will be more effective. At the same time, if you are
speaking to an audience with different occupations, do not use jargon from
one specific occupation. This concept is addressed more in Chapter 10.

Education

The next demographic characteristic is education, which is closely tied
to occupation and is often, though not always, a matter of choice. In the
United States, education tends to reflect what kind of information and
training a person has been exposed to, rather than being any measure
of intelligence. An individual with a bachelor's degree in physics or
computer science will probably know a great deal more about those
fields than someone with a Ph.D. in English. Having a certain credential
is supposed to be a guarantee of having learned a set of knowledge or
attained certain skills. Some persons, especially employers, tend to see
achieving a credential such as a college degree as the person's "grit" to
finish an academic program (Duckworth, 2016). We are also proud of our
Exploring Public Speaking  31  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                              Listening

educational achievements, so they should not be disregarded. Education
will have an effect in demographic audience analysis in terms of shared
experience and knowledge as well as group affiliation.

Socio-economic Level

Socio-economic level, another demographic characteristic, is also tied
to occupation and education in many cases. We expect certain levels of
education or certain occupations to make more money. While you cannot
know the exact pay of your audience members, you should be careful about
references that would portray your own socio-economic level as superior
to their own. Saying, "When I bought my BMW 7 Series" (a car that retails
at over $80,000) would not make a good impression on someone in the
audience who is struggling to make a car payment on her used, five-year-
old subcompact. One time an attorney for a state agency was talking to
a group of college professors on our campus about how she negotiated
her salary. She mentioned that she was able to get her salary raised by an
amount that was more than the annual salary of the audience members.
Her message, which was a good one about women's empowerment, was
lost in this case because the speaker lacked awareness about the audience.

Sexual Orientation

The next few demographic characteristics are more personal and may
not seem important to your speech topic, but then again, they may be the
most important for your audience. Sexual orientation, usually referred to
by the letters LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans-gendered, Queer/
Questioning), is a characteristic not listed in speech textbooks forty years
ago. As acceptance of people of various sexual orientations becomes more
common, we can expect that these differences will lead to people feeling
free to express who they are and not be confined to traditional gender roles
or stereotypes. For this reason, it is useful to employ inclusive language,
such as "partner" or "spouse."

Family Status

Family status, such as whether the audience members are married, single,
divorced, or have children or grandchildren may be very important to the
concerns and values of your audience and even the reason the audience
is brought together. For example, young parents could be gathered to
listen to a speaker because they are concerned about health and safety of
children in the community. Getting married and/or having a child often
creates a major shift in how persons view the world, responsibilities, and
priorities. A speaker should be aware if she is talking to single, married,
divorced, or widowed persons and if the audience members are parents or
guardians with children at home.

    Psychographic       Wrap Up on Demographics
   Characteristics
                        Of course, there are other demographic characteristics that may be
the inner               considered. Disability is one. Not all disabilities are immediately visible
characteristics of the  to persons without disabilities. Diversity is a complex subject. While we
audience; beliefs,      commonly think of diversity in terms of categories such as race, class,
attitudes, needs, and   ethnicity, or gender, there are many other ways to consider it. For example,
values                  neurodiversity addresses those with alternative processing methods and
                        those on the autism spectrum ("How to Talk," n.d.). It is very important
                        with all audiences to use inclusive, sensitive language.

                        Does this section on demographic characteristics leave you wondering,
                        "With all this diversity, how can we even think about an audience?" If
                        so, do not feel alone in that thought. As diversity increases, audience
                        understanding and adaptation becomes more difficult. To address this
                        concern, you should keep in mind the primary reason the audience is
                        together and the demographic characteristics they have in common--
                        their common bonds. For example, your classmates may be diverse in
                        terms of age, ethnicity, or religion, but they have in common profession
                        (all students) and region (living near or on the campus), group identity
                        (campus organizations or major) as well as, possibly, other characteristics.

                        Perhaps your instructor will do an exercise in class that helps you explore
                        the demographic characteristics displayed in your class audience. You
                        might find that most live with their parents, or that 60% of them are
                        planning to enter a health profession, or that one-third of them have
                        children at home. Knowing these facts will help you find ways to choose
                        topics, select approaches and sources for those topics, know when you
                        should explain an idea in more detail, avoid strategies that would become
                        barriers to communicating with the audience, and/or include personal
                        examples to which the audience members can relate.

                        2.3 - Psychographic Characteristics

                        Whereas demographic characteristics describe the "facts" about the
                        people in your audience and are focused on the external, psychographic
                        characteristics explain their inner qualities. Although there are many
                        ways to think about this topic, here the ones relevant to a speech will be
                        explored: beliefs, attitudes, needs, and values.
Exploring Public Speaking  33  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                                 Listening

Beliefs                                                                                    Beliefs

Daryl Bem (1970) defined beliefs as "statements we hold to be true."             statements we hold to
Notice this definition does not say the beliefs are true, only that we hold      be true
them to be true and as such they determine how we respond to the world
around us. Stereotypes are a kind of belief: we believe all the people in a
certain group are "like that" or share a trait. Beliefs are not confined to the
religious realm but touch all aspects of our experience. Sports fans believe
certain things about their favorite teams. Republicans and Democrats
believe certain, usually different, principles about how the government
should be run.

Beliefs, according to Bem, come essentially from our experience and from
sources we trust. For example, a person may believe everyone should take
public speaking because in their own experience the course helped them
be successful in college and a career. Another person may believe that
some punishment is good for children because their own parents-whom
they love and trust-spanked them after their misbehavior.

Therefore, beliefs are hard to change--not impossible, just difficult. Beliefs
are harder to change based on their level of each of these characteristics of
belief:

     stability--the longer we hold them, the more stable or entrenched
      they are;

     centrality--they are in the middle of our identity, self-concept, or
      "who we are";

     saliency--we think about them a great deal; and
     strength--we have a great deal of intellectual or experiential support

      for the belief or we engage in activities that strengthen the beliefs.
Beliefs can have varying levels of stability, centrality, salience, and
strength. An educator's beliefs about the educational process and
importance of education would be strong (support from everyday
experience and reading sources of information), central (how he makes his
living and defines his work), salient (he spends every day thinking about
Exploring Public Speaking  34  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and

         Attitude         it), and stable (especially if he has been an educator a long time). Beliefs

person, idea, object, or
policy                    Attitudes

          Values          The next psychographic characteristic, attitude, is sometimes a direct
goals we strive for       effect of belief. Attitude is defined as a stable positive or negative
and what we consider      response to a person, idea, object, or policy (Bem, 1970). More specifically,
important and             Myers (2012) defines it as "a favorable or unfavorable evaluative reaction
desirable                 toward someone or something, exhibited in one's beliefs, feelings, or
                          intended behavior" (p. 36). How do you respond when you hear the name
                          of a certain singer, movie star, political leader, sports team, or law in your
                          state? Your response will be either positive or negative, or maybe neutral if
                          you are not familiar with the object of the attitude. Where did that attitude
                          come from? Psychologists and communication scholars study attitude
                          formation and change probably as much as any other subject, and have
                          found that attitude comes from experiences, peer groups, beliefs, rewards,
                          and punishments, as well as other factors.

                          Do not confuse attitude with "mood." Attitudes are stable; if you respond
                          negatively to Brussels sprouts today, you probably will a week from now.
                          That does not mean they are unchangeable, only that, like beliefs, they
                          change slowly and in response to certain experiences, information, or
                          strategies. As with beliefs, this book will examine how to change attitudes
                          in the chapter on persuasion. Changing attitudes is a primary task of
                          public speakers because attitudes are the most determining factor in
                          what people actually do. In other words, attitudes lead to actions, and
                          interestingly, actions leads to and strengthen attitudes.

                          We may hold a belief that regular daily exercise is a healthy activity, but
                          that does not mean we will have a positive attitude toward it. There may
                          be other attitudes that compete with the belief, such as "I do not like to
                          sweat," or "I don't like exercising alone." Also, we may not act upon a
                          belief because we do not feel there is a direct, immediate benefit from it or
                          we may not believe we have time right now in college. If we have a positive
                          personal attitude toward exercise, we will more likely engage in it than if
                          we only believe it is generally healthy.

                          Values

                          As you can see, attitude and belief are somewhat complex "constructs,"
                          but fortunately the next two are more straightforward. (A construct is "a
                          tool used in psychology to facilitate understanding of human behavior;
                          a label for a cluster of related but co-varying behaviors" [Rogelberg,
                          2007].) Values are goals we strive for and what we consider important
                          and desirable. However, values are not just basic wants. A person may
                          want a vintage sports car from the 1960s, and may value it because of the
Exploring Public Speaking  35  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                                Listening

amount of money it costs, but the vintage sports car itself is not a value; it            Needs
represents a value of either
                                                                                important deficiencies
     nostalgia (the person's parents owned one in the 1960s and it             that we are motivated
       reminds him of good times),                                              to fulfill

     display (the person wants to show it off and get "oohs" and "ahs"),
     materialism (the person believes the quip that "the one who dies with

       the most toys wins"),
     aesthetics and beauty (the person admires the look of the car and

       enjoys maintaining the sleek appearance),
     prestige (the person has earned enough money to enjoy and show off

       this kind of vehicle), or
     physical pleasure (the driver likes the feel of driving a sports car on

       the open road).
Therefore we can engage in the same behavior but for different values; one
person may participate in a river cleanup because she values the future
of the planet; another may value the appearance of the community in
which she lives; another just because friends are involved and she values
relationships. A few years ago political pundits coined the term "values
voters," usually referring to social conservatives, but this is a misnomer
because almost everyone votes and otherwise acts upon their values--what
is important to the individual.

Needs

The fourth psychographic characteristic is needs, which are important
deficiencies that we are motivated to fulfill. You may already be familiar
with the well-known diagram known as Maslow's Hierarchy of needs
(Maslow, 1943). It is commonly discussed in the fields of management,
psychology, and health professions. A version of it is shown in Figure 2.1.
Some recent versions show it with eight levels. It is one way to think about
needs. In trying to understand human motivation, Maslow theorized that
as our needs represented at the base of the pyramid are fulfilled, we move
up the hierarchy to fulfill other types of need (McLeod, 2014).

According to Maslow's theory, our most basic physiological or survival
needs must be met before we move to the second level, which is safety and
security. When our needs for safety and security are met, we move up to
relationship or connection needs, often called "love and belongingness."
The fourth level up is esteem needs, which could be thought of as
achievement, accomplishment, or self-confidence. The highest level, self-
actualization, is achieved by those who are satisfied and secure enough
in the lower four that they can make sacrifices for others. Self-actualized
persons are usually thought of as altruistic or charitable. Maslow also
believed that studying motivation was best done by understanding
psychologically healthy individuals, and he also used child development to
Exploring Public Speaking  36  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                               Listening

construct his model. (Despite the prevalence of Maslow's model, it is not
without its critics; see Neher, 1991).

                          Figure 2.1 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

In another course you might go into more depth about Maslow's
philosophy and theory, but the key point to remember here is that your
audience members are experiencing both "felt" and "real" needs. They may
not even be aware of their needs. In a persuasive speech one of your tasks
is to show the audience that needs exist that they might not know about.
For example, gasoline sold in most of the U.S. has ethanol, a plant-based
product, added to it, usually about 10%. Is this beneficial or detrimental
for the planet, the engine of the car, or consumers' wallets? Your audience
may not even be aware of the ethanol, its origins, its benefits, why it is
added to gasoline, and the problems it can cause.

A "felt" need is another way to think about strong "wants" that the person
believes will fulfill or satisfy them even if the item is not necessary for
survival. For example, one humorous depiction of the Maslow's hierarchy
of needs has the words "wifi" scribbled at the bottom of the pyramid.
Another meme has "coffee" scribbled at the bottom of the hierarchy. As
great as wifi and coffee are, they are not crucial to human survival, either
individually or collectively, but we do want them so strongly that they
operate like needs.

So, how do these psychographic characteristics operate in preparing a
speech? They are most applicable to a persuasive speech, but they do apply
to other types of speeches. What are your audience's informational needs?

What beliefs or attitudes do they have that could influence your choice of
topic, sources, or examples? How can you make them interested in the
speech by appealing to their values? The classroom speeches you give will
allow you a place to practice audience analysis based on demographic
and psychographic characteristics, and that practice will aid you in future
presentations in the work place and community.

2.4 - Contextual Factors of Audience Analysis

The "facts about" and "inner qualities" (demographic and psychographic
characteristics) of the audience influence your approach to any
presentation. The context (place and time) of the speech does also. What
follows are some questions to consider when planning your presentation.

    1. How much time do I have for the presentation? As mentioned in
        Chapter 1, we must respect the given or assigned time limits of a
        speech. In most cases you will have little control over the time limits.
        In class the instructor assigns a five- to six-minute speech; at work,
        there may be an understood twenty-minute presentation rule in the
        organization, since attention can diminish after a certain length. You
        might be asked to speak to a community group for your company
        and be told that you have thirty minutes--that seems like a long time,
        but if you are really passionate about the subject, that time can go
        quickly.

        Knowing the time limit for a speech does three things for the
        speaker. First, it lets them know how much of a given topic can
        realistically be covered. Secondly, the speaker must practice to be
        sure that the content actually fits in the time given, so the practice
        leads to a better speech. Third, time limits impose a discipline and
        focus on the speaker.

        In reference to practice, which we will address in detail in Chapter
       11, this might be a good place to dispel the "practice makes perfect"
        myth. It is possible to practice incorrectly, so in that case, practice
        will make permanent, not perfect. There is a right way and a
        wrong way to practice a speech, musical instrument, or sport.

    2. What time of the day is the presentation? An audience at 8:00 in
        the morning is not the same as at 2:00 p.m. An audience at Monday
        at 10:00 a.m. is not the same as at 3:00 Friday afternoon. The time
        of your presentation may tell you a great deal about how to prepare.
        For example, if the audience is likely to be tired, you might want to
        get them physically active or talking to each other in a part of the
        speech, especially if it is a longer presentation.

    3. Why is the audience gathered? In the case of your speech class,
        everyone is there, of course, because they are students at the college
Exploring Public Speaking  38  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                               Listening

        and because they want a grade. However, they also have career
        and educational goals and probably are at a certain stage in their
        education. In other contexts, the audience is there because of a
        common interest, commitment, or responsibility. What is it? Your
        approach in the speech should be relevant to that reason for their
        presence.

    4. What is the physical space like? Straightforward, with the audience
        in rows and hard seats, as in a classroom? A typical boardroom
       with a long table and a dozen or more chairs around it? Big sofas
        and armchairs, where the audience might get too comfortable
        and drowsy? Can the speaker walk around and get closer to the
        audience? Does the speaker have to stay behind a lectern or on
        a platform? Is there audiovisual equipment? Is the room well-
        lit? Sometimes you will have no control over the physical space,
        especially in the speech classroom, but you should try to exert all the
        control you possibly can in other situations. Even the temperature of
        the room or outside noise can affect your speech's effectiveness. Just
        closing the door can make a world of difference in the physical space
        and its effect on the audience.

    5. Related to number 4 is "How large will the audience be?" Ten people
        or one hundred? This factor will probably affect your delivery the
        most. You may need to increase your volume and energy level in a
       venue with a large audience, or you might have to use a microphone,
       which could limit your walking around and getting close to the
        group. On the other hand, you might want to directly interact with
        the audience if it is a smaller, more intimate number of people. The
        size of the audience will also affect your choice of visual aids.

    6. What does the audience expect? Why were you asked to speak to
        them? Again, in the class you will have certain specifications for the
        presentations, such as type of speech, length, kinds of sources used,
        and presentation aids or lack of them. In other contexts, you will
        need to ask many questions to know the context fully.

Knowing these details about the audience can greatly impact how
successful you are as a speaker, and not knowing them can potentially
have adverse effects. One of the textbook authors was asked to speak to the
faculty of another college about 120 miles away on the subject of research
about teaching college students. Because the campus she was visiting was
a branch campus, she assumed (always dangerous) that only the faculty
on that small branch campus would be present. Actually, the faculty of the
whole college--over 400 instructors in a college of over 21,000 students--
showed up. Although the speaker was very conscious of time limits (30
minutes), subject matter, needs of the audience, and expectations, the
change in the size of the expected audience was a shock.
Exploring Public Speaking  39  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                            Listening

It all went well because she was an experienced speaker, but she was                 Hearing

                         With this understanding of how listening differs from other forms of
                         message reception, we can think of public speaking as "linear in time." It

does not allow you to loop back, as in reading. For that reason, a speaker
must make listening easier for the audience. The main way speakers
achieve this is through planned redundancy. Planned redundancy
refers to purposeful ways of repeating and restating parts of the speech to
help the audience listen, understand, and retain the content.

The speaker uses a relevant introduction to emphasize the interest and
importance of the subject, uses a preview of the main points to forecast the
plan of the speech, uses connective statements between points to remind
the audience of the plan and re-emphasize the content, and then uses an
overall summary in the conclusion to help the audience remember or do
something with the information. As mentioned before, you might not be
able to "cover" or "dump" a great deal of information in a speech, but you
can make the information meaningful through the planned redundancy as
well as through examples, stories, support, and appeals.

A speaker can also help the audience's listening abilities by using visual
aids (discussed in Chapter 9), stories and examples (discussed in Chapter
7), audience interaction or movement at key points in the speech (if
appropriate and if your instructor approves it), and specific attention-
getting techniques (also discussed in Chapter 7).

In short, listening is hard work, but you can meet your audience half
way by using certain strategies and material to make listening easier for
them. At the same time, an audience member has a responsibility to pay
attention and listen well. In the next section, we will look at how you
can improve your listening ability in public speaking situations. We will
not look at listening in private, group, or interpersonal communication
settings. Those often require other skills such as empathy and
paraphrasing in order to understand your communication partner fully
and to meet their emotional needs. If a friend comes to you with a problem,
he or she may be more interested in your concern than that you can recall
back the content of what was shared or that you can give them advice.

Barriers to Listening

Since hearing is a physiological response to auditory stimuli, you hear
things whether you want to or not. Just ask anyone who has tried to go to
sleep with the neighbor's dog barking all night. However, listening, really
listening, is intentional and hard work. Several hundred years ago we lived
in an aural world where most people took in information solely through
hearing. That is why you will often hear stories of great speakers who
orated for two or three hours, which was considered acceptable. It does
not mean everyone stayed awake all the time, but it does mean that the
majority did not find it unusual or impossible to listen for that long.

A famous historical example is that of the Gettysburg Address, that
wonderful, concise speech by Abraham Lincoln given in November of

                               Listening

preconceptions        Western humans in the modern world just do not have the listening
                      power we used to. Perhaps we do not need it, or due to neuroplasticity
                      ("Definition of neuroplasticity," 2015) our brains have adapted to other
                      means of efficiently taking in information.

                      In addition, as mentioned earlier, some people are not strong aural
                      learners. In that case, listening may not be a personal strength. However,
                      that does not make listening improvement unimportant or something
                      we should disregard. Therefore, the first barrier to listening is our lack
                      of capacity for it or a mindset that we do not listen well, whether from
                      societal expectation or personal psychological preferences. Equally, not
                      considering listening important and valuable is a barrier to listening itself.

                      Another barrier to listening is the noisiness and constant distractions
                      of our lives, something that you might not even be aware of if you have
                      always lived in the world of Internet, cell phones, iPods, tablets, and 24/7
                      news channels. We are dependent on and constantly wired to the Internet.
                      Focus is difficult. Not only do electronic distractions hurt our listening, but
                      life concerns can distract us as well. An ill family member, a huge exam
                      next period, your car in the shop, deciding on next semester's classes--the
                      list is endless. Hunger and fatigue hurt listening ability as well.

                      A fourth barrier to listening not often considered is that our minds can
                      usually process much faster than a speaker can speak clearly. We may
                      be able to listen, when really trying, at 200 words per minute, but few
                      speakers can articulate that many words clearly; an average rate for
                      normal speech is around 100-120 (Foulke, 1968; Barnard, 2018). That
                      leaves a great deal of time when the mind needs to pull itself back into
                      focus. During those gaps, you might find it more enjoyable to think of
                      lunch, the person you are dating, or your vacation at the beach.

                      Another barrier is distraction from the people around you. Perhaps the
                      scent of their soap or shampoo is unpleasant to you. Perhaps they cannot
                      put their cell phones down or perhaps they are whispering to each other
                      and impeding your ability to hear the speaker clearly. Finally, the physical
                      environment may make listening to a public speaker difficult.

                      Additionally, confirmation bias is a barrier to listening. This term
                      means "a tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that
                      confirms one's preconceptions" (Nickerson, 1998). Although the concept
                      has been around a long time, we are more aware of confirmation bias
                      today. It leads us to listen to news outlets and Internet sources that
Exploring Public Speaking  43  Chapter 2: Audience Analysis and
Version 4.2
                                                                                Listening

confirm what we believe already rather than being challenged to new
ways of thinking by reading or listening to other sources of information.
It can cause us to discount, reject, or re-interpret information to fit our
preconceptions.

Related to this barrier of confirmation bias is simply prejudging a speaker
from opening remarks, dismissing their topic or position at the outset
due to perceived disagreement, or turning them off due to appearance
or nonverbal behavior. This is not to discount that the importance of the
introduction and delivery of a speech, only to say that prejudgment is
a counterproductive behavior and determines a great deal of our poor
listening.

Other possible obstacles to listening include entering the listening
situation with no purpose; we are just there physically but have no
plans for listening. We go in unprepared. We are tired and mentally and
physically unready to listen well. We do not sit in a comfortable position
to listen. We do not bring proper tools to listen, specifically to take notes.
There is actually research to indicate that we listen better and learn/retain
more when we take notes with a pen and paper than when we type them
on a computer or tablet (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014). Add to this
the ample research that shows how distracting open laptops are to other
students. This research has led some professors to bar laptops from their
classrooms (Patterson & Patterson, 2017; Carter, Greenberg, & Walker,
2017; Awwad & Awwad, 2013; Sana, Weston, & Cepeda, 2013).

All this does not even mention that the skill of the speaker influences your
listening ability. We end up seeing Mr. Goethe's point from Chapter 1.
Communicating can be so difficult that we wonder how we can overcome
all these obstacles. So what can we do about it?

What Can Be Done to Improve Listening?

The previous section explains barriers to good listening behavior and in a
sense gives us the solutions. The key is to personalize this information and
decide which of it relates to you. Your own barrier might be not coming
prepared, being quick to prejudge, or allowing gadgets to distract you.
Obviously, recognizing the cause of your poor listening is the first step to
becoming a better listener. Here are some steps, in summary:

     Believe that good listening in specific situations and improving your
       own listening behavior are important. You would not want to be
       called upon in a meeting at work when you were daydreaming or
       distracted by a cell phone. Consider listening in class and to your
       classmates' speeches in the same way.

     Since it is so easy to react to a speaker's ideas with confirmation
       bias, go into listening knowing that you might disagree and that the

                               Listening

                             automatic "turn off" tendency is a possibility. In other words, tell
                             yourself to keep an open mind.

                            Be prepared to listen. This means putting away mobile devices,
                             having a pen and paper, and situating yourself physically to listen
                             (not slouching or slumping). Have a purpose in listening. In your
                             speech class, one of your purposes should be mutual support of your
                             classmates; you are all in this together. Your instructor might also
                             require you to write responses to your classmates' speeches. By the
                             way, in all your college classes, consider sitting close to the front.
                             There will be fewer distractions from other students, among other
                             benefits.

                            When taking notes, keep yourself mentally engaged by writing
                             questions that arise, especially if your instructor does not take
                             questions until a break, and you might forget. This behavior will fill
                             in the gaps when your mind could wander and create more of an
                             interaction with the speaker. However, taking notes does not mean
                            "transcribing" the speech or lecture. Whether in class or in a different
                             listening situation, do not (try to) write everything the speaker says
                             down. One, it's not possible unless you know Gregg Shorthand or
                             type really fast, and two, you will disengage your critical thinking
                             and get too involved in typing rather than thinking. Instead, start
                             with looking for overall purpose and structure, then for pertinent
                             examples of each main point. Repetition and planned redundancy by
                             a speaker usually indicate you should write something down.

                            For your own sake and that of your co-listeners, avoid temptations to
                             talk to those sitting next to you. It is far more distracting to both the
                             speaker and your co-listeners than you might think. Write down the
                             questions for asking later. Our use of cellular devices in an audience
                             can also be more of a distraction to others than we realize. There is
                             a good reason the movie theaters play those announcements about
                             turning your phone off before the feature!

Conclusion

This chapter has looked at the psychological and physical processes going
on inside the audience during a speech and how to navigate them. Being
audience-centered and adapting to your audience involves knowing as
much as is reasonably possible about them. Addressing a diverse audience
is a challenge, and audiences are, in general, becoming more diverse and
more aware of their diversity in the U.S. While diversity is a challenge, it is
also an opportunity.

Something to Think About

    1. Can you think of some ways that knowing the psychographic
        characteristics of your audience can influence your speech
       preparation on these topics? What values, needs, beliefs, and
       attitudes of your classmates should you consider?

       You want to give a persuasive speech to your classroom audience to
        encourage them to take a study abroad trip.

       You want you audience to consider buying a MacBook Pro rather
       than a PC as their next laptop.

       You want to persuade them that sponsoring a child in a poor country
       is a way to bring the child out of poverty.

       You want them to volunteer in the next Special Olympics in your
        community.

    2. Create a demographic characteristics list to analyze your audience by
       printing out this chart.

       After completing this chart, discuss the types of topics and
       approaches to those topics you might consider based on this
       information.

Communication and Public Speaking                                               the branch of
                                                                                philosophy
As discussed in Chapter 1, there are many reasons to take a public speaking     that involves
course. Among its numerous benefits, a public speaking course will create       determinations of what
more self-confidence; the creation of good arguments will build your            is right and moral
critical thinking and research skills; and you will meet new people in your
class in a different way and be exposed to their ideas. Also, the course will
prepare you for presentations you will be expected to give in later classes
(and believe us, there will be many), in your civic and personal life, and for
your eventual career.

Another very important reason to take a public speaking course such as
this one goes beyond these immediate personal benefits. Public speaking,
or "rhetoric" as it was originally called, has long been considered a method
in Western culture of building community, facilitating self-government,
sharing important ideas, and creating policies. In fact, these are the
reasons the ancient Athenian Greeks emphasized that all citizens should
be educated in rhetoric: so that they could take part in civil society.
Aristotle said that if a man was expected to defend himself physically,
he should also be able to defend his ideas rhetorically, that is, through
persuasive public speaking:

         It is absurd to hold that a man ought to be ashamed of being
         unable to defend himself with his limbs, but not of being unable to
         defend himself with speech and reason, when the use of rational
         speech is more distinctive of a human being than the use of his
         limbs. (Rhetoric, Book I, p. 6).

Therefore, public speaking has a social, societal,and personal purpose
and function. For that reason, the ethics of public speaking and
communication in general should be addressed in any study of public
speaking. A public speaker, whether delivering a speech in a classroom,
board room, civic meeting, or in any other venue must uphold certain
ethical standards. These standards will allow the audience to make
informed choices, to uphold credibility as a source of information, and to
avoid repercussions of bad ethical choices.

To this end, this chapter will deal with the subject of ethics. Ethics refers
to the branch of philosophy that involves determinations of what is right
and moral. On a personal level, it is your own standard of what you should
and should not do in the various situations or in all situations. Although
ethics are based on personal decisions and values, they are also influenced
by factors outside of you. Over the next few pages, we will look at various
ways ethics, particularly ethics related to speech, have been thought about.
In reading, you should seek to determine how you would explain your own
ethical standard for communication. Along with being able to articulate
Exploring Public Speaking  48  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

what you would not do, you should have an appreciation for why doing the
right thing is important to you.

One of "right things" and most important ways that we speak ethically is
to use material from others correctly. Occasionally we hear in the news
media about a political speaker who uses the words of other speakers
without attribution or of scholars who use pages out of another scholar's
work without consent or citation. Usually the discussion of plagiarism
stays within the community where it occurred, but there is still damage
done to the "borrower's" reputation as an ethical person and scholar.

Why does it matter if a speaker or writer commits plagiarism? Why
and how do we judge a speaker as ethical? Why, for example, do we
value originality and correct citation of sources in public life as well
as the academic world, especially in the United States? These are not
new questions, and some of the answers lie in age-old philosophies of
communication.

Legal Origins of Ethics in Public Speaking

The First Amendment to the Constitution is one of the most cherished
and debated in the Bill of Rights. "Congress shall make no law abridging
freedom of speech . . . or of the press" has been discussed in many
contexts for over two hundred and thirty years. Thomas Emerson (1970),
a Constitutional scholar and Yale Law Professor, asserted that freedom of
expression is more than just a right. It is a necessity for having the kind of
society we want as Americans. Although we think of "freedom of the press"
today as referring to mass media and journalism, "press" here refers to
publishing of books, magazines, pamphlets, and Internet sites by anyone.

One of the bases of the First Amendment is an essay written by John
Milton in the 1600s, Aereopagitica. This essay on freedom of speech is
where the phrases "free marketplace of ideas" and "truth will arise from
debate of all ideas" originated. Milton lived in a time when the King of
England or Parliament could "censor" published material or speakers,
either by keeping it from being published and distributed (later called
"prior restraint"), by destroying the publications afterward, or by punishing
the producers of the content, sometimes harshly.

In the twentieth century, "freedom of speech" has been generalized
into a freedom of expression. This was especially true in the important
Supreme Court cases on the First Amendment in the 1930s through
1970s. According to Emerson (1970), such expression is important to our
development as human beings individually and in a democracy. Thanks
to these historical precedents, we can express ourselves freely in our
communities and classrooms, keeping in mind ethical responsibilities to
present serious, honest, factual, and well-supported messages as a matter
of respect to your listeners. Additionally, although the First Amendment
Exploring Public Speaking  49  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

to the Constitution is usually interpreted by the Supreme Court and lower     Defamatory Speech
courts to mean almost no restrictions on freedom of expression, there are
a few instances in which the government is held to have a "compelling         a false statement of
interest" in controlling, stopping, or preventing certain types of free       fact that damages a
expression.                                                                   person's character,
                                                                              fame, or reputation
One of these instances has to do with threats on the life of the President
of the United States, although threats of physical harm against anyone
might also result in penalties. Another instance of restrictions on freedom
of expression is in those cases where the speaker has the opportunity,
means, and likelihood of inciting an audience to violence (this is the old
"yelling `fire' in a crowded theatre" example). The government has also
allowed local governments to have reasonable requirements to avoid mobs
or public danger or to uphold community standards, such as permits for
parades or limiting how many people can meet in a certain size of building.
"Reasonable" is sometimes a matter of debate, as the extensive history of
Supreme Court cases on the First Amendment shows.

Another type of restriction on freedom of speech is defamatory speech,
which is defined in the United States as:

         a false statement of fact that damages a person's character, fame
         or reputation. It must be a false statement of fact; statements of
         opinion, however insulting they may be, cannot be defamation
         under U.S. law. Under U.S. defamation law, there are different
         standards for public officials [and public figures] and private
         individuals. (U.S. Department of State, 2013)

With the Internet and social media, these issues become more complicated,
of course. In the past someone could express himself or herself only in
limited ways: standing on a street corner, attending a public meeting,
putting the words on paper and distributing them, or maybe getting on
radio or television (if allowed or if wealthy). Today, almost anyone with
a laptop, a webcam, an ISP, and technical know-how can be as powerful
in getting a message to the masses as someone owning a newspaper one
hundred years ago. While most people use technology and the Internet for
fun, profit, or self-expression, some use it for hurt--bullying, defamation,
even spreading terrorism. The judicial system is trying to keep up with
the challenges that the digital age brings to protecting free expression
while sheltering us from the negative consequences of some forms of free
expression.

Cultural and Religious Origins of Ethics in Communication

It is hard to separate life aspects such as legal, cultural, religious, and
social. Many Americans would say they hold to the Golden Rule: "Do
unto others as you would have them do to you." The Golden Rule is seen
as a positive expression of fairness, equity, and trust. Even if there is
Exploring Public Speaking  50  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

no legal ruling hanging over us, we expect honest communication and
return it. The Golden Rule is related to and a step beyond the "Law of
Reciprocity" that determines so much of our social interaction. We also
value straightforwardness; respect for the individual's freedom of choice;
getting access to full information; consistency between action and words;
taking responsibility for one's own mistakes (sometimes necessitating an
apology and accepting consequences); and protection of privacy. We fear
public humiliation and do not want to violate community norms. We also
want to see ourselves as honest and ethical people.

Most religions teach the value of truthfulness and that lying intentionally
is wrong. The Book of Proverbs, the Ten Commandments, the Mosaic
Law, and the teaching of Jesus Christ and the Apostles all point to the
immorality of lying and the destruction lying brings personally and
communally. Quranic teaching condemns lying, and Buddhism teaches
that followers should not deliberately lie. Individuals internalize the
norms of their cultures and religions and make them work for themselves.
Sometimes we try to find justification when we are untruthful, such
as to smooth over relationships and say things that serve as "social
lubrication" (Floyd, 2017). Upbringing and family teachings, religious
values, experiences, peers, and just plain old "gut reaction" as well as
understanding of the First Amendment contribute to our ethical behavior.

Philosophers and Communication Ethics

Philosophers throughout history have also written on the subject of
communication and public speaking ethics. In fact, one of the first
philosophers, Plato, objected to the way rhetoric was practiced in his
day, because "it made the worse case appear the better." In other words,
the professional public speakers, who could be hired to defend someone
in court or the assembly, knew and used techniques that could deceive
audiences and turn them from truth. Aristotle responded to this concern
from his teacher Plato in his work, Rhetoric. Later, Quintilian, a Roman
teacher of rhetoric, wrote that rhetoric was "the good man speaking well,"
meaning the speaker must meet the Roman Republic's definition of a
virtuous man.

In more modern times, English philosophers John Stuart Mill (1806-
1873) and Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) introduced utilitarianism, which
presents the ethic of "The greatest good for the greatest number;" that
is, whatever benefits the most people is right. A related philosophy,
pragmatism, was first discussed by Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914).
Pragmatists judge actions by their practical consequences. Some ethicists
would differ with the pragmatic position, claiming it supports an "ends
justify the means" philosophy. When we use the phrase "the ends justify
the means," we are saying that a generally unethical action (intentional
misstatement of truth, withholding information, or taking any someone's
Exploring Public Speaking  51  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

freedom of choice) is ethical as long as something good comes from it.
Many scholars of ethical communication would disagree with the "ends
justify the means" philosophy.

The philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) proposed what was been
called the Categorical Imperative: "Act only according to that maxim
by which you can at the same time will that it would become a universal
law." To paraphrase, any behavior we engage in should be what we think
everyone else on the planet should do ethically. In the twentieth century,
Jean-Paul Sartre and others called "existentialists" emphasized that the
ability and necessity to freely choose our actions is what makes us human,
but we are accountable for all our choices. Jurgen Habermas, a more
recent scholar, emphasizes the "equal opportunity for participation" of the
communication partners (Johannessen, Valde, & Whedbe, 2008).

This very brief overview of ethics in general and in communication
specifically is designed to let you know that the best minds have grappled
with what is right and wrong when it comes to expression. But what is the
practical application? We believe it is adherence to the factual truth and
respect for your audience: in this case, your classmates, peers, and your
instructor. An individual might be guided by the Categorical Imperative
approach, the pragmatic philosophy, the Judeo-Christian view of "thou
shalt not lie" and "speaking the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15), the Golden
Rule, freedom with accountability, or some other view. However, respect
for your audience means that you will do your best to present factual, well-
documented information designed to improve their lives and help them
make informed, intelligent decisions with it.

In addition to respect for the humanity, intelligence, and dignity of your
audience, you should be conscious of two other aspects related to ethics of
communication: credibility and plagiarism.

3.2 - Credibility and Ethics

When Aristotle used the term ethos in the 4th century B.C.E. to describe
one of the means of persuasion, he defined it as the "wisdom, sagacity, and
character of the rhetor" (see Chapter 13 for more coverage of ethos and
Aristotle's other artistic proofs). Modern scholars of communication and
persuasion speak more about "credibility" as an attitude the audience has
toward the speaker, based on both reality and perception, rather than an
innate trait of the speaker. Audience members trust the speaker to varying
degrees, based on the evidence and knowledge they have about the speaker
and how that lines up with certain factors:

     Similarity: does the speaker have experiences, values, and beliefs in
       common with the audience? Can the audience relate to and trust the
       speaker because of these commonalities?
Exploring Public Speaking  52  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

     Character: does the speaker, in word and action, in the speech and in
      everyday life, show honesty and integrity?

     Competence: does the speaker show that he/she has expertise and
       sound knowledge about the topic, especially through firsthand
      experience? And does the speaker show competence in his/her ability
      to communicate that expertise?

     Good will: does the audience perceive the speaker to have ethical
      intentions toward the audience?

In addition to these key areas will be the audience's perceptions, or even
gut feelings, about more intangible characteristics of the speaker, such as
physical appearance, friendliness, use of humor, likability, poise, perceived
open-mindedness, perceived strength of conviction (commitment to
message), and communication ability. Many of these traits are conveyed
through nonverbal aspects, such as facial expression, eye contact, good
posture, and appropriate gestures (see Chapter 11 on Delivery).

Understandably, the same speaker will have a different level of credibility
with different audiences. For example, in regard to presidential campaigns,
it is interesting to listen to how different people respond to and "trust"
different candidates. We need only look at the last ten years of presidential
politics to see variations in audience perceptions of credibility. When
trying to develop your own credibility as a speaker with an audience,
you have to keep in mind all four of the bulleted factors listed above. To
portray oneself as "similar" to the audience but to do so deceptively will
not contribute to credibility in the long run. To only pretend to have good
will and want the best for the audience will also have a short-term effect.
And to intentionally misrepresent your background, such as experience
and credentials, is clearly unethical.

Not only does a speaker's level of credibility change or vary from audience
to audience, it is also likely to change even during the presentation.
These changes in credibility have been labeled as initial, derived, and
terminal credibility (McCroskey, 2006).
Exploring Public Speaking  53  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Initial credibility is, as you would imagine, the speaker's credibility             Initial Credibility
at the beginning of or even before the speech. There are a number of
factors that would contribute to the initial credibility, even such matters       A speaker's credibility
as the "recommendation" of the person who introduces the speaker to               at the beginning of or
the audience. Any knowledge the audience has of the speaker prior to the          even before the speech
speech adds to the initial credibility. The initial credibility is important, of
course, because it will influence the receptivity of the audience or how well     Derived Credibility
they will listen and be open to the speaker's ideas. Initial credibility can
be influenced also by the perception that the speaker is not well dressed,        a speaker's credibility
prepared, or confident at the very beginning. Initial credibility is why          and trustworthiness
how you walk to the lectern and give your introduction matter. Often, the         (as judged by the
person introducing a keynote speaker will attempt to build the credibility        audience members)
of the keynote (see Chapter 15).                                                  throughout the process
                                                                                  of the speech, which
Derived credibility is how the audience members judge the speaker's               also can range from
credibility and trustworthiness throughout the process of the speech,             point to point in the
which also can range from point to point in the speech. Perhaps you               speech
have seen those videos on a news program that show a political speaker
on one pane of the video and a graph of the audience's response in real                   Terminal
time to the speaker's message, usually noted as "approval rating" as the                 Credibility
politician speaks. This could be based on the perception of the speaker's
presentation style (delivery), language, specific opinions or viewpoints on       a speaker's credibility
subjects, open-mindedness, honesty, and other factors. The point of the           at the end of the
derived credibility is that credibility is an active concept that is always       speech
changing.

Finally, terminal credibility is, as you would think, credibility at the
end of the speech. The obvious importance of terminal credibility is that
it would factor into the audience's final decision about what to do with the
information, arguments, or appeals of the speaker - in other words, their
persuasiveness. It would also determine whether the audience would listen
to the speaker again in the future. The terminal credibility can be seen as a
result of the initial and derived credibility.

Terminal credibility may end up being lower than the initial credibility,
but the goal of any speaker should be to have higher terminal credibility.
From an ethics standpoint, of course, credibility should not be enhanced
by being untruthful with an audience, by misrepresenting one's viewpoint
to please an audience, or by "pandering" to an audience (flattering
them). One of the primary attributes of credibility at any stage should be
transparency and honesty with the audience.

In conclusion, speaker credibility does not exist alone. It is supported
by a number of factors, including Aristotle's other two traditional forms
of persuasion, logos (logic, evidence, good reasoning, lack of fallacious
arguments) and pathos (personal and emotional appeals).

       Plagiarism        3.3 - Plagiarism

the act of using         Although there are many ways that you could undermine your ethical
another person's words   stance before an audience, the one that stands out and is committed most
or ideas without giving  commonly in academic contexts is plagiarism. A dictionary definition
credit to that person    of plagiarism would be "the act of using another person's words or ideas
                         without giving credit to that person" (Merriam-Webster, 2015). According
                         to the student help website Plagiarism.org, sponsored by WriteCheck,
                         plagiarism is often thought of as "copying another's work or borrowing
                         someone else's original ideas" ("What is Plagiarism?", 2014). However,
                         this source goes on to say that the common definition may mislead some
                         people. Plagiarism also includes:

                              Turning in someone else's work as your own;
                              Copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit;
                              Failing to put quotation marks around an exact quotation correctly;
                              Giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation;
                              Changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source

                                without giving credit;
                              Copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the

                                majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.

                         Plagiarism exists outside of the classroom and is a temptation in
                         business, creative endeavors, and politics. However, in the classroom,
                         your instructor will probably take the most immediate action if he or she
                         discovers your plagiarism either from personal experience or through
                         using plagiarism detection (or what is also called "originality checking")
                         software. Many learning management systems, perhaps such as the
Exploring Public Speaking  55  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

one used at your institution, now have a plagiarism detection program
embedded in the function where you submit assignments. (One of the
authors once had a student give a speech that the author had read in the
local newspapers two days before!)

In the business or professional world, plagiarism is never tolerated
because using original work without permission (which usually includes
paying fees to the author or artist) can end in serious legal action. The
Internet has made plagiarism easier and thus increased the student's
responsibility to know how to cite and use source material correctly. For
more information on the subject of copyright and fair use, you can access
Stanford University Libraries' site on Copyright and Fair Use.

Types of Plagiarism

In our long experience of teaching, we have encountered many instances
of students presenting work they claim to be original and their own when
it is not. We have also seen that students often do not intend to plagiarize
but, due to poor training in high school, still are committing an act that
could result in a failing grade or worse. Generally, there are three levels
of plagiarism: stealing, sneaking, and borrowing. Sometimes these types
of plagiarism are intentional, and sometimes they occur unintentionally
(you may not know you are plagiarizing). However, as everyone knows,
"Ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking it." So let's familiarize
you with how plagiarism occurs in order to prevent it from happening.

Stealing

There is a saying in academia: "If you steal from one source, that is
plagiarism; if you steal from twelve, that is scholarship." Whoever
originated this saying may have intended for it to be humorous, but it is a
misrepresentation of both plagiarism and scholarship.

No one wants to be the victim of theft; if it has ever happened to you,
you know how awful it feels. When a student takes an essay, research
paper, speech, or outline completely from another source, whether it is
a classmate who submitted it for another instructor, from some sort of
online essay mill, or from elsewhere, this is an act of theft no better or
worse than going into a store and shoplifting. The wrongness of the act
is compounded by the fact that then the student lies about it being his or
her own. If you are tempted to do this, run the other way. Your instructor
will probably have no mercy on you, and probably neither will the student
conduct council.
Exploring Public Speaking  56  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

Most colleges and universities have a policy that penalizes or forbids
"self-plagiarism." This means that you can't use a paper or outline that
you presented in another class a second time. You may think, "How can
this be plagiarism or wrong if I wrote both and in my work I cited sources
correctly?" The main reason is that by submitting it to your instructor,
you are still claiming it is original, first-time work for the assignment in
that particular class. Your instructor may not mind if you use some of the
same sources from the first time it was submitted, but he or she expects
you to follow the instructions for the assignment and prepare an original
assignment. In a sense, this situation is also a case of unfairness, since the
other students do not have the advantage of having written the paper or
outline already.

Another issue that often comes up with students happens when two or
more students, perhaps in the same section or different sections of the
same course or even the same instructor, submit the same assignment.
When confronted, the student say, "We worked on it together." If your
instructor wants you to work collaboratively, they will make that clear.
Otherwise, do not do this-the situation usually ends quite badly for
students.

Sneaking

In "sneaking plagiarism," instead of taking work as a whole from another
source, the student will copy two out of every three sentences and mix
them up so they don't appear in the same order as in the original work.
Perhaps the student will add a fresh introduction, a personal example or
Exploring Public Speaking  57  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

two, and an original conclusion. This "sneaky" plagiarism is easy today due
to the Internet and the word processing functions of cutting and pasting.

In fact, many students do not see this as the same thing as stealing because
they think "I did some research, I looked some stuff up, and I added some
of my own work." Unfortunately, this approach is only marginally better
than stealing and will probably end up in the same penalties as the first
type of plagiarism. Why? Because no source has been credited, and the
student has "misappropriated" the expression of the ideas as well as the
ideas themselves. This type of plagiarism can lead to copyright violation if
the work with the plagiarism is published.

Most of the time students do not have to worry about copyright violation
when they correctly use and cite material from a source. This is because in
academic environments, "fair use" is the rule. In short, you are not making
any money from using the copyrighted material, such as from a published
book. You are only using it for learning purposes and not to make money,
so "quoting" (using verbatim) a small amount of the material with proper
citation is acceptable for a college class.

If, however, you were going to try to publish and sell an article or book
and "borrowed" a large section of material without specifically obtaining
permission from the original author, you would be guilty of copyright
violation and by extension make your organization or company also guilty.
When you enter your career field, the "fair use" principle no longer applies
and you will need to obtain permission from the copyright holder and pay
fees to use all or portions of a work. For more information on this very
important and often misunderstood subject, visit the Creative Commons
website, the Library of Congress, and the Stanford University site given
earlier.

One area in speeches where students are not careful about citing is on
their presentational slides. If a graphic or photo is borrowed from a
website (that is, you did not design it), there should be a citation in small
letters on the slide. The same would be true of borrowed quotations, data,
and ideas. Students also like to put their "works cited" or "references" on
the last slide, but this really does not help the audience or get around the
possibility of plagiarism.

Borrowing

The third type of plagiarism is "borrowing." In this case, the student is
not stealing wholesale. They may actually even give credit for the material,
either correctly or incorrectly. He might say, "According to the official
website of . . ." or "As found in an article in the Journal of Psychology,
Dr. John Smith wrote . . ." Sounds good, right? Well, yes and no. It
depends on whether the student has borrowed in a "sneaky way" (cutting
and pasting passages together but this time indicating where the sections
Exploring Public Speaking  58  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

came from) or if the student is using the ideas but not the exact wording.
In other words, has the student adequately, correctly, and honestly
paraphrased or summarized the borrowed material, or just "strung the
sources together" with some "according to's"?

Students often are puzzled about what and when to cite borrowed material
from sources. At this point, your instructor may have specific instructions,
and you should always follow those first. However, in most cases you can
go by the "repeated information" rule. If you are doing research and access
ten sources, and over half of them have the same piece of information
(usually a historical or scientific fact, such as a date), you can assume
this is "common knowledge." That is, it is common to anyone who knows
anything about the subject, and then you do not have to have a citation. If
you find a piece of information in one source only, it probably represents
the original research or viewpoint of that writer, and should be cited
clearly. On the other hand, there are exceptions. An often-cited or used
piece of information has an original source, such as a government agency,
and you would be better off to find the original source and cite that.
Secondly, citing sources adds to your credibility as a prepared speaker.
Again, your instructor's directions on what and how much your cite bear
upon this advice. Generally, it is better to err on the side of citing more
than less.

Ethically Crediting Sources

In using source material correctly, a speaker does three things:

    1. They clearly cite the source of the information. It is here that the
        oral mode of communication differs from the written mode. In
        a paper, such as for literature, you would only need to include a
        parenthetical citation such as (Jones 78) for Modern Language
       Association (MLA) format, indicating that a writer named Jones
        contributed this idea on page 78 of a source that the reader can find
        on the Works Cited Page. In a paper for a class in the social sciences,
        an American Psychological Association (APA) format citation would
        be (Jones, 2012) or (Jones, 2012, p. 78). The first would be used if
        you summarized or paraphrased information from the source, and
        second (with the page number) is used to indicate the words were
        quoted exactly from a source. Obviously, in that case, quotation
        marks are used around the quoted material. In both cases, if the
        reader wants more information, it can be found on the References
        Page (APA) or Works Cited Page (MLA).

        (Note: This text and its examples use APA because the
        Communication discipline is considered a social science. As advised
        elsewhere, use the format your instructor directs you to use.)

        A speech is quite different. Saying "According to Jones, p. 78," really
Exploring Public Speaking  59  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

   does very little for the audience. They can't turn to the back of the
   paper. They don't have a way, other than oral communication, to
   understand the type of information being cited, how recent it is, the
   credibility of the author you are citing and why you think he or she
   is a valid source, or the title of the work. It is necessary in a speech
   to give more complete information that would help the audience
   understand its value and origin. The page number, the publishing
   company, and city it was published in are probably not important,
   but what is important is whether it is a website, a scholarly article,
   or a book; whether it was written in 1950 or 2010; and what is the
   position, background, or credentials of the source.

   So, instead of "According to Jones, p. 78," a better approach would
   be,

   "According to Dr. Samuel Jones, Head of Cardiology at Vanderbilt
   University, in a 2017 article in a prestigious medical journal..."

   Or

   "In her 2012 book, The Iraq War in Context, historian Mary Smith
   of the University of Georgia states that..."

   Or

   "In consulting the website for the American Humane Society, I
   found these statistics about animal abuse compiled by the Society in
   2018..."

   This approach shows more clearly that you have done proper
   research to support your ideas and arguments. It also allows
   your audience to find the material if they want more information.
   Notice that in all three examples the citation precedes the fact or
   information being cited. This order allows the audience to recognize
   the borrowed material better. The use of a clear citation up-front
   makes it more noticeable as well as more credible to the audience.

2. The speaker should take special care to use information that is in
   context and relevant. This step takes more critical thinking skills.
   For example, it is often easy to misinterpret statistical information
   (more on that in Chapter 7), or to take a quotation from an expert
   in one field and apply it to another field. It is also important to label
   facts as facts and opinions as opinions, especially when dealing
   with controversial subjects. In addition, be sure you understand
   the material you are citing before using it. If you are unsure of
   any words, look their definitions up so you are sure to be using
   the material as it is intended. Finally, it is important that you
   understand the type of publication or source you are using, for
   example, a scholarly publication in contrast to a journalistic one.
Exploring Public Speaking  60  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

    3. The speaker should phrase or summarize the ideas of the source
        into his or her own words. Paraphrasing, which is putting the words
        and ideas of others into one's own authentic or personal language,
        is often misunderstood by students. Your instructor may walk you
        through an exercise to help your class understand that paraphrasing
        is not changing 10% of the words in a long quotation (such as two
        or three out of twenty) but still keeping most of the vocabulary and
        word order (called syntax) of the source. You should compose the
        information in your own "voice" or way of expressing yourself.

        In fact, you would be better off to think in terms of summarizing
        your source material rather than paraphrasing. For one thing, you
        will be less likely to use too much of the original and therefore skirt
        the edge of plagiarism. Secondly, you will usually want to put the
        main arguments of a source in your own words to make it shorter.
        Keep in mind in this section we are discussing oral citation, not
        citation in written documents. For example, direct quotations is
        not frequently used in APA, whereas in MLA, because literature is
        the subject, direct quotation is more common. Other rules apply to
        written uses of the formats.

Here is an example of an original source and three possible ways to deal
with it.

         Original information, posted on CNN.com website,
         October 31, 2015:

        "The biggest federal inmate release on record will take place this
         weekend. About 6,600 inmates will be released, with 16,500
         expected to get out the first year. More than 40,000 federal
         felons could be released early over the next several years, the U.S.
         Sentencing Commission said. The sentencing commission decided
         a year ago to lower maximum sentences for nonviolent drug
         offenders and to make the change retro-active, with the inmate
         releases effective November 1, 2015. Sentences were reduced
         an average of 18%, the commission said. Early release will be
         a challenge for the inmates as well as the judicial bureaucracy"
         (Casarez, 2015).

With that as our original source, which of the following is truly
paraphrasing?

         The CNN News website says the federal government is releasing
        40,000 felons from prison in the next few years.

        According to a report posted on CNN's website on October 31
         of 2015, the federal government's Sentencing Commission is
         beginning to release prisoners in November based on a decision
         made in 2014. That decision was to make maximum sentences
Exploring Public Speaking  61  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

         for nonviolent drug offenders shorter by an average of 18%. Over
         the next several years over 40,000 federal felons could be let go.
         However, this policy change to early release will not be easy for
         the justice system or those released.

         The largest release ever of federal inmates will take place in early
         November. At first 6,600 inmates will be released, and then over
        16,000 over the first year. The U.S. Sentencing Commission says
         it could release over 40,000 federal felons over the upcoming
         years because the sentencing commission decided a year ago to
         lessen maximum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and to
         make this happen for those already in jail. When the Sentencing
         Commission says that when it made that decision, the sentences
         were reduced an average of 18%. Early release will be a challenge
         for the felons as well as the judicial system. This came from a story
         on CNN News website in later October 2015.

If you chose the second citation, you would be correct. The first version
does not really interpret the original statement correctly, and the third
choice imitates the original almost entirely. Choice 2, on the other
hand, is in completely different language and identifies the source of the
information clearly and at the beginning.

This exercise may raise the question, "Should I always paraphrase or
summarize rather than directly quote a source?" There are times when it
is appropriate to use a source's exact wording, but quoting a source exactly
should be done sparingly--sort of like using hot sauce! You should have a
good reason for it, such as that the source is highly respected, has said the
idea in a compelling way, or the material is well known and others would
recognize it. If you do, you should make it clear you are quoting them
exactly by the way you introduce and end the borrowed material.

Ethics of Communication, Civil Discourse, and Venues

Throughout history in free societies, and sometimes not-so-free ones,
leaders in politics and communication have devised ways of structuring
rhetorical discourse. These various structures or venues have used rules to
allow equality of time, fairness, civility, and different ways of addressing
problems and issues under discussion. Sometimes these structures have
worked against everyone having an equal voice, have silenced voices, or
insisted that everyone speak according to the predominant or majority
mode of discourse (Dillard-Knox, 2014). Working under the principle
that time and mediums of communication are limited, even in our recent
history powerful groups could find ways to push some discourse out of
the mainstream. The advent of the Internet changed a great deal of those
practices.
Exploring Public Speaking  62  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

An example from the world of mass media was the "fairness doctrine" that
was used in the 1960s and 1970s in broadcasting. If a television or radio
station licensed by the Federal Communication Commission (which all
were required to be) allowed a speaker of one political party or viewpoint
airtime, their opponent for office or someone on the other side of the
debate could petition for equal airtime from the station and expect to
get it. Of course, stations found ways to get around the FCC policy, and
the stations could schedule the opposing voice at an "inconvenient" or
less costly time (in terms of what the station could charge for advertising
revenue because they had a larger audience). But there is evidence that
even presidents used this doctrine to keep their opponents from getting
equal exposure on the networks (Matzko, 2020). Remember, at that time,
there were really only four television networks for most people: ABC, NBC,
CBS, and PBS. (Exceptions existed, of course, but the vast majority of
Americans viewed those networks.)

Nowadays the concept of equal time makes no sense, and the FCC repealed
the fairness doctrine in 1987. We all know of radio stations that play
nothing but conservative talk radio; there are hundreds of podcasts on any
side of the political spectrum; we can watch "television" programming on
any number of platforms; and the Internet, despite attempts to control
it, is still the Wild West. Unfortunately, this panoply of ways to send
messages has had other effects on our public discourse, or at least has
led many critics to believe our public discourse has become weakened,
coarsened, and less effective. Whether this is entirely true is a subject
of debate; we can find many examples in the past of some pretty ugly
accusations and slurs thrown at political opponents. What is different
today is that more people have access to more communication channels
not just as consumers but also as creators, and the mechanisms for control
are less evident or powerful (but still there). Everyone can have a blog
today, and no one is really going to edit or censor it.

Therefore, in the past formats for discourse have been developed to
expedite civility, quality, and equality in the speech of its participants.
Here are a few:

Debate. The run-up to Election Year 2020 saw over twenty Democratic
candidates, at least at one point, running for president; 2016 saw a large
number of Republican candidates. Putting all these candidates on a stage
to have what was called a "debate" proved challenging. No one was really
happy with these arrangements; some candidates got excluded because
of lack of support in the polls or amount of funds raised; some critics of
the debates complained that candidates did not really receive equal time.
In this writer's opinions, the television media has evolved to a point that
it values and privileges "zingers," "gotchas," and sound bites rather than
explained arguments for a position that everyone can understand. The
Exploring Public Speaking  63  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

moderators, usually high-profile journalists, ask pre-established questions
which may or may not elicit relevant responses.

All this is opposite of real debate. Real debate involves two speakers (or
two teams of two speakers in academic or scholastic debate) who argue
for or against the truth of a proposition--one statement of fact, definition,
value, or policy (see chapter 13). In some cases, the "con" or "negative"
debater need only prove why the affirmative or "pro" debater's arguments
are wrong, not the opposite of the proposition. (This is similar to a
defense lawyer not having to prove a defendant's innocence, only that the
prosecuting lawyer's arguments are wrong or the case unproven.) Each
debater is allowed strict time limits for their opening arguments and for
rebuttals. On college debate teams, for instance, the format is as follows:

     First Affirmative Constructive 8 minutes
     First Negative Constructive 8 minutes
     Second Affirmative Constructive 8 minutes
     Second Negative Constructive 8 minutes
     First Negative Rebuttal 4 minutes
     First Affirmative Rebuttal 4 minutes
     Second Negative Rebuttal 4 minutes
     Second Affirmative Rebuttal 4 minutes
In each speech, there are specific functions the debater must play.

While this format may not seem like it would lead to very entertaining
debates, the point is that it is eminently fair, based on evidence and
logic, and unlikely to encourage "zingers," "bad faith arguments," or ad
hominem arguments (personal attacks). Also, the judge of the debate
does not base her decision on whom she agrees with more, but which
one presented arguments, answered their opponents' points (thoroughly
and not dropping or ignoring any of them), and used relevant facts and
support. Therefore, the next time you watch a political debate, you might
do well to ask not, "Who do I agree with more because they say what I
believe (an example of confirmation bias)" but "Who stays on the topic or
question and who provides real facts from a source?"

One of the most disheartening results of the noisy, open media world
today (including social media) is that many have come to believe that
"winning" a debate means shouting over others or shouting them out,
"canceling" dissenting viewpoints, personal attacks that have nothing to
do with the topic being discussed (even about personal appearance or
background), or misplaced and insulting humor. None of these have a
place in civil discourse, which in this context means speaking and listening
with civility. Civility in discourse is more than just simple politeness,
although that would be a good place to start. True civil discourse values
logic and evidence, critical thinking and listening, relevance of response,
respect for the personhood of those with whom one disagrees, and
Exploring Public Speaking  64  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

recognition as Thomas Emerson wrote, that freedom of expression is not
just a good idea in our democratic republic, but the bedrock of it.

Town Hall Meetings. This type of discourse format originally meant
a place for politicians, usually representatives of the population in a
city, county, or district, to meet with their constituents (the people they
represent) for questions and answers, often starting the meeting with a
short public address. In real practice, the governmental leaders do not
have to be elected; during the development of its new strategic plan in
2019, officials from the University System of Georgia met with citizens
in different parts of the state to garner input and feedback and answer
questions about what the citizens would like the colleges and universities
of Georgia to achieve. However, the term has been adopted by the business
community to refer to "a meeting between managers and employees where
developments in the business are discussed in a relaxed and informal
atmosphere" (MacMillan Dictionary, 2017). These developments might
involve personnel or leadership changes, restructuring, or mission/vision
statement.

Town hall meetings are places for government representatives to engage
with the public. They do not have to take place in "town halls," but they
are held in public spaces (libraries, auditoriums, churches, theaters) and
they can take place electronically or even over the telephone. Votes are
not taken at town halls; they are not like city or county council meetings.
Because representatives are usually serving their constituents in a city
in another part of the state or in Washington, D.C., town halls give the
politicians a way to connect with voters in a local area where they may or
may not actually live. Specific formats of town hall meetings can vary, but
the expectation is one of civil discourse and that one person or group will
not capture or co-opt the meeting for their own purposes.

Public Forums. This term is a broad name for events and spaces such
as town hall meetings, debates, or discussions where freedom of speech
is protected and active for the exchange of ideas. The Legal Information
Institute of Cornell Law School (n.d.) explains that in Perry Education
Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 (1983) the
Supreme Court "divided public forums into three types: traditional
public forums, designated forums, and nonpublic forums." You can read
about the distinctions between these three at this site. First Amendment
protections are the background of these designations, so that the citizenry
can have ample opportunity to use their freedom of expression to engage
others about important matters.

Panels and Symposia. These two types of formats are similar. Panels
are groups of "experts," perhaps three to seven, who discuss a topic with
the help of a moderator in front of an audience. Questions may or may not
be taken from an audience. Panelists may make an opening statement. but
the bulk of the panelists' time is in answering prepared questions from the
Exploring Public Speaking  65  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

moderator, and each panelists' time is limited. In some cases, the panelists
might be responding to another central presentation. Roundtable is
another version of a panel, the difference being the order of panelists goes
"around the table."

In a symposium, the experts each give prepared, separate speeches
of some length on a different subtopic or aspect of a larger topic. The
larger topic might be "cancer treatments," the symposium members are
all physicians, and each speaks on a different type of aspect of cancer
treatment. At the end of the symposium, questions from the audience are
addressed. In most public symposia, the speakers are well known experts
or scholars whose reputations would attract an audience of either their
peers or interested observers.

This section was added to the textbook in 2020 in hope that students will
grow to appreciate rhetoric that is structured to improve the chances that
everyone gets a chance to speak; that is motivated by respect for others
with whom one disagrees rather than a desire to make points with zingers
and insults; and that is mindful of audience needs for substantive material.

Conclusion

As mentioned before, students often have not been trained to use source
material correctly and plagiarize unintentionally. But like the old saying
goes, "Ignorance of the law is no excuse." You will still be held accountable
whether you understand or not, so now, early in your college career, is the
time you should learn to cite source material correctly in oral and written
communication.

Something to Think About

In Appendix B, Part 7, you will find more information about plagiarism.

After reading about ethics in communication, what do you think the most
important consideration in ethical speaking? What is the second? The
third? Could the first, second, and third ever come into conflict?

Why do you think it is so hard for students to learn to cite sources
appropriately?

The following exercise might be helpful for you to develop an
understanding of orally citing your sources.

Choose one of your sources for an upcoming speech for this exercise. On a
sheet of paper, answer these 9 questions.

    1. Is this information you found in a unique source, or information that
        was repeated in all or most of your sources? (This may bear upon
        whether you need to cite the information or not.)

    2. Who is the original author or "speaker" of this quotation or material?

    3. What is the title of source?

    4. Is it a primary or secondary source? Is the writer quoting someone
        else (secondary) or is the author the one who discovered the
        knowledge/information (primary source; see Chapter 5 for more
        explanation of sources)? If the source is secondary, is the original
        source of the information provided?

    5. What do you know about the source of the citation? Are they an
        expert, such as a scientist, doctor, government official, college
        professor, etc.?

    6. Where did you find the article? In what journal or magazine, on what
        website, in what book?

    7. If a website, who sponsors the website (what organization,
        government, company)?

    8. When was this information published? What is the date on it?

    9. Are you repeating the source's words exactly or just abstracting
        (summarizing) what was said? Which would be better, in this case?

If you had to pick 5 of the 7 above to put in your speech, which would you
use, based on the three criteria of 1. Audience can find it 2. It makes you
look more credible, and 3. It is ethical? Put a star by them.

If you had to pick 4 of the 7, which one would you take out from the
previous question? (Cross it out)
Exploring Public Speaking  67  Chapter 3: Ethics in Public Speaking
Version 4.2

It is not necessary to say all of this information, but most of it should be
included in the oral citation. This is how a speech citation is different from
a paper. The audience does not have access to this information unless you
say it.

Now, write how you would cite this source in the speech. Some stem
phrases would be "According to . . ." "In the article. . ." "On a webpage
entitled . . ." "On the website for the . . . . organization. . ." "In my interview
with Dr. Sam Smith, who is . . . ."

Case study

Jennifer has an informative speech due for Dr. MacKenzie's class. It is
about why the gold standard is no longer used in American currency. She
chose the subject because she had to write a paper about it in American
history class. What should Jennifer consider in how she uses sources?

Jennifer's friend Beth approaches her about having to give an informative
speech for Professor Daniels' class. Beth confesses she has been having
personal problems and needs help, and she asks Jennifer to let her use
some of her outline for Dr. MacKenzie's class. What would be the best
course of action for Jennifer?

chapter we are going to get into the real meat of putting your speech
together.

Often when we get to the point of sitting down to prepare a speech, we
think about topics. That is understandable, but before we go any further,
let's recalibrate our minds to think also, or even more, about "purpose."
There are some benefits to considering purpose and topic simultaneously.
Doing so will help you focus your speech to a manageable amount of
content and become more audience-centered. Also you will be able
to make strategic decisions about other aspects of the speech, such as
organization, supporting evidence, and visual aids.

Speeches have traditionally been seen to have one of three broad purposes:
to inform, to persuade, and--well, to be honest, different words are used
for the third kind of speech purpose: to inspire, to amuse, to please, to
delight, or to entertain. We will just use "to entertain/inspire" as the
overall term here, understanding there are other applicable words. These
broad goals are commonly known as a speech's general purpose, since,
in general, you are trying to inform, persuade, or entertain/inspire your
audience without regard to specifically what the topic will be. Perhaps you
could think of them as appealing to the understanding of the audience
(informative), the will or action (persuasive), and the pleasure or emotion
(entertain/inspire).

Your instructor will most likely assign you an informative and a persuasive
speech, and perhaps one more. The third one might be a special occasion
speech, such as a tribute (commemorative), an after-dinner speech, a toast,
or a eulogy. These four types of speeches fit into the category of "to inspire"
or "to entertain." This book has chapters on and examples of all three
types (Chapters 12, 13, and 15).

It should be understood that these three purposes are not necessarily
exclusive of the others. A speech designed to be persuasive can also be
informative and entertaining, even if neither of those is the main purpose.

As we saw in Chapter 1, the concept of "the canons of rhetoric" is the
traditional way to explain the process of preparing a speech. That process
is still a practical guide for today. The first canon, invention, or inventio, is
discussed, at least in part, in this chapter. (Actually chapters 5, 7, 12, and
13 also deal with invention.) Although in modern times we tend to think of
invention as the creation of a new technology, invention basically means
"discovery" of what to say.

                               Speech

                         The scholars of rhetoric from the ancient times encouraged the use of
                         questions to "discover" the arguments and content of the speech. These
                         were called "topoi" and there were a couple of dozen of them; modern
                         scholars have reframed them as questions that can be used to develop
                         reasons and material. These can be helpful in many ways, but here we will
                         present just two basic questions you should consider for beginning your
                         speech:

                             1. What value, connection, or interest does my purpose/topic have for
                                 the audience? What needs do they meet? and

                             2. Why would the audience consider me, the speaker, a credible source
                                 on this purpose/topic?

                         We suggest that these two questions be in your mind as you develop your
                         speech. You should answer them, directly or indirectly, for your audience.
                         If your audience is unfamiliar with your topic, for instance, you d would
                         want to address the first one early in the speech. If your audience does not
                         know anything about you, you should mention (in an appropriate way)
                         your background in the subject area.

                         One of the authors has a core concept in her basic public speaking classes:
                         The most effective speeches are the ones that answer the questions in
                         the minds of the audience. She uses that to change the students' focus
                         from speaking just to express themselves to being audience-centered.
                         She also uses the acronym "WIIFM." This is not a new radio station, but
                         the abbreviation for "What's In It For Me?" (see question 1 above). The
                         audience is asking this question, directly or indirectly, during a speech.
                         Keep the WIIFM acronym in mind as you start to think about your
                         speeches more and more from your audience's perspective.

                         Now that you know your general purpose (to inform, to persuade, or to

                                            Figure 4.1

In writing your specific purpose statement, you will take three contributing
elements that will come together to help you determine your specific
purpose. The diagram in Figure 4.1 shows those three elements. These
three elements are you (your interests, your background, past jobs,
experience, education, major), your audience (which you learned to
analyze in Chapter 2), and the context or setting (also discussed in
Chapter 2).

You

An old adage states, "Write about what you know." In many ways, that
is a great place to start with creating a speech, although you will need
to consult other sources as well. If you start with ideas that reflect your
interests, goals, and passions, that commitment will come across in your
speech, give you more credibility in the eyes of your audience, and make
your speech more interesting.

This would be a good place for you to do an inventory. You have much
more going on in your brain and background than you can be conscious of
at any one time. Being asked the right kinds of prompts can help you find
ideas. Figure 4.2 is a list of prompts for this inventory. To help generate

                                                                       Speech

some ideas for your speeches, complete the phrases and/or answer
the questions in Figure 4.2 to see if any ideas can be generated from
experiences or interests you may not have realized you had.

This inventory may seem long and intrusive, but digging a little deeper
may help you find ideas and directions that are unique to you. You want
to find this kind of subject matter and not the same topics others will
gravitate towards just because they saw a list on Google on informative
speech topics. Also, generating your list based on these questions and
prompts will get you excited about your topic and talking about it to
your classmates. For example, a very common persuasive speech topic is
organ donation. There is nothing wrong with that topic per se and it is an
important issue. However, if you ask yourself the right questions, you may
come up with something far more central to who you are and that might
interest and/or apply to the audience more.

Another approach that you might find helpful is to determine what you are
passionate about through two binary routes. First, you will obviously be
passionate about the things you love, so talk about those. Is The Simpsons
your favorite TV show? Then you can inform the listeners about the people
and vision of the team behind this highly popular and long-running TV
show. Do you feel that Big Brothers Big Sisters is a vital organization in
the way it helps young people? Then persuade the audience to volunteer
there. Conversely, you can also be passionate about things you don't love?.
Does it really annoy you when people don't use their turn signals or don't
know how to merge onto the highway? You could give a speech about safe
driving.

The Audience

Of course, what you love or hate may be in stark contrast to how your
audience feels, so it is important to keep them in mind as well, which
brings us to the next contributing factor. After you examine what you
know and are passionate about, you have to determine if and how the
topic has practical value or interest for others. It may be that it is a topic
the audience is not immediately interested in but needs to know about for
their own benefit. Then it becomes necessary for you to find that angle and
approach that will help them see the benefit of the topic and listen to you.
The more you know about your audience, the better you can achieve this
goal. Good speakers are very knowledgeable about their audiences.

The Context

Many aspects come into the context of a speech, but as mentioned in
Chapter 2, the main ones are the time, place, and reason(s) for the event
and the audience being there. Your classroom speeches have a fairly set
context: time limits, the classroom, assignment specifications. Other
speeches you will give in college, your career, or personal life will require
you to think more deeply about the context just as you would the audience.
Exploring Public Speaking  74  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                               Speech

Putting It Together

Keeping these three inputs in mind, you can begin to write a specific
purpose statement, which will be the foundation for everything you say in
the speech and a guide for what you do not say. Because of the timed and
linear nature of public speaking, adhering to one specific purpose is vital.
This formula will help you construct your specific purpose statement:

          Specific Communication Word (in infinitive phrase) (to
         inform, to explain, to demonstrate, to describe, to define, to
         persuade, to convince, to prove, to argue)

         Target Audience (my classmates, the members of the Social
         Work Club, my coworkers)

         The Content (how to bake brownies, that Macs are better than
         PCs)

Each of these parts of the specific purpose is important. The first two parts
make sure you are clear on your purpose and know specifically who will be
hearing your message. However, we will focus on the last part here.

The content part of the specific purposes statement must first be singular
and focused, and the content must match the purpose. The word "and"
really should not appear in the specific purpose statement since that would
make it seem that you have two purposes and two topics. Obviously, the
specific purpose statement's content must be very narrowly defined and,
well, specific. One mistake beginning speakers often make is to try to
"cover" too much material. They tend to speak about the whole alphabet,
A-Z on a subject, instead of just "T" or "L." This comes from an emphasis
on the topic more than the purpose, and from not keeping audience and
context in mind. In other words, go deep (specific), not broad. Examples in
this chapter will show what that means.

Second, the content must match the focus of the purpose word. A common
error is to match an informative purpose with a persuasive content clause
or phrase. For example,

         To explain to my classmates why term life insurance is a better
         option than whole life insurance policies.

         To inform my classmates about how the recent Supreme Court
         decision on police procedures during arrests is unconstitutional.

Sometimes it takes an unbiased second party to see where your content
and purpose may not match.

Third, the specific purpose statement should be relevant to the audience.
How does the purpose and its topic touch upon their lives, wallets,
relationships, careers, etc.? It is also a good idea to keep in mind what you
Exploring Public Speaking  75  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                                                                               Speech

want the audience to walk away with or what you want them to know, to be
able to do, to think, to act upon, or to respond to your topic--your ultimate
outcome or result.

To revisit an earlier example, "to explain to my classmates the history of
NASA" would be far too much material and the audience may be unsure
of its relevance. A more specific one such as "to inform my classmates
about the decline of the Shuttle program" would be more manageable
and closer to their experience. It would also reference two well-known
historical tragedies involving the Shuttle program, the Challenger Disaster
in 1986 and the Columbia Explosion in 2003. Here are several examples of
specific purposes statements. Notice how they meet the standards of being
singular, focused, relevant, and consistent.

         To inform my classmates of the origin of the hospice movement.

         To describe to my coworkers the steps to apply for retirement.

         To define for a group of new graduate students the term "academic
         freedom."

         To explain to the Lions Club members the problems faced by
         veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

         To persuade the members of the Greek society to take the spring
         break trip to Daytona Beach.

         To motivate my classmates to engage in the College's study abroad
         program.

         To convince my classroom audience that they need at least seven
         hours of sleep per night to do well in their studies.

Now that you understand the basic form and function of a specific purpose
statement, let's revisit the original diagram in Figure 4.1. The same topic
for a different audience will create a somewhat different specific purpose
statement. Public speaking is not a "one-size-fits-all" proposition. Let's
take the subject of participating in the study abroad program. How would
you change your approach if you were addressing first-semester freshmen
instead of first-semester juniors? Or if you were speaking to high school
students in one of the college's feeder high schools? Or if you were asked
to share your experiences with a local civic group that gave you a partial
scholarship to participate in the program? You would have slightly
different specific purpose statements although your experience and basic
information are all the same.

For another example, let's say that one of your family members has
benefitted from being in the Special Olympics and you have volunteered
two years at the local event. You could give a tribute (commemorative
speech) about the work of Special Olympics (with the purpose to inspire),
Exploring Public Speaking  76  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                               Speech

                       an informative speech on the scope or history of the Special Olympics, or
                       a persuasive speech on why audience members should volunteer at next
                       year's event. "Special Olympics" is a key word in every specific purpose,
                       but the statements would otherwise be different.

                       Despite all the information given about specific purpose statements so
                       far, the next thing you read will seem strange: Never start your speech by
                       saying your specific purpose to the audience. In a sense, it is just for you
                       and the instructor. For you, it's like a note you might tack on the mirror or
                       refrigerator to keep you on track. For the instructor, it's a way for him or
                       her to know you are accomplishing both the assignment and what you set
                       out to do.

                       Avoid the temptation to default to saying it at the beginning of your speech.
                       It will seem awkward and repetitive. In fact, from experience we can say it
                       is incredibly common for students to appear before the audience, realize
                       their nerves, and say, "Uh, my name is .... and my speech is about...." This
                       is one of the last things you want to do at the beginning of your speech
                       along with just saying your specific purpose statement.

     Central Idea      4.3 - Formulating a Central Idea Statement
       Statement
                       While you will not actually say your specific purpose statement during
a statement            your speech, you will need to clearly state what your focus and main
that contains or       points are going to be (preferably after using an introductory method such
summarizes a speech's  as those described in Chapter 8). The statement that reveals your main
main points            purpose, topics and/or sections is commonly known as the central idea
                       statement (or just the central idea).

                       Now, at this point we need to make a point about terminology. Your
                       instructor may call the central idea statement "the thesis" or "the thesis
                       statement." Your English composition instructor probably uses that
                       term in your essay writing. Another instructor may call it the "main idea
                       statement." All of these are basically synonymous and you should not let
                       the terms confuse you, but you should use the term your instructor does.

                       That said, is the central idea statement the very same thing as the thesis
                       sentence in an essay? Yes, in that both are letting the audience know
                       without a doubt your topic, purpose, direction, angle and/or point of view.
                       No, in that the rules for writing a "thesis" or central idea statement in a
                       speech are not as strict as in an essay. For example, it is acceptable in a
                       speech to announce the topic and purpose, although it is usually not the
                       most artful or effective way to do it, and your instructor may not consider
                       it the best way. You may say,

                               "In this speech I will try to motivate you to join me next month as a
                                volunteer at the regional Special Olympics."
Exploring Public Speaking  77  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                                                                             Speech

That would be followed by a preview statement of what the speech's
arguments or reasons for participating will be, such as,

        "You will see that it will benefit the community, the participants,
         and you individually."

However, another approach is to "capsulize" the purpose, topic, approach,
and preview in one succinct statement.

        "Your involvement as a volunteer in next month's regional Special
         Olympics will be a rewarding experience that will benefit the
         community, the participants, and you personally."

This second version is really the better approach and most likely the one
your instructor will prefer.

So, you don't want to just repeat your specific purpose in the central idea
statement, but you do want to provide complete information. Also, unlike
the formal thesis of your English essays, the central idea statement in a
speech can and should use personal language (I, me, we, us, you, your,
etc.) and should attempt to be attention-getting and audience-focused.
And importantly, just like a formal thesis sentence, it must be a complete,
grammatical sentence.

The point of your central idea statement in terms of your audience is to
reveal and clarify the ideas or assertions you will be addressing in your
speech, more commonly known as your main points, to fulfill your specific
purpose. However, as you are processing your ideas and approach, you
may still be working on them. Sometimes those main points will not
be clear to you immediately. As much as we would like these writing
processes to be straightforward, often we find that we have to revise our
original approach. This is why preparing a speech the night before you
are giving it is a really, really bad idea. You need lots of time for the
preparation and then the practice.

                               Speech

Sometimes you will hear the writing process referred to as "iterative."
This word means, among other things, that a speech or document is not
always written in the same order as the audience finally experiences it.
The process loops around and steps are repeated or readdressed. You
may have noticed that we have not said anything about the introduction
of your speech yet. Even though that is the first thing the audience hears,
it may be one of the last parts you actually compose. It is best to consider
your speech flexible as you work on it, and to be willing to edit and revise.
If your instructor asks you to turn the outline in before the speech, you
should be clear on how much you are allowed to revise the outline after
that. Otherwise, it helps to know that you can keep editing your speech
until you deliver it, especially while you practice.

Here are some examples of pairs of specific purpose statements and
central idea statements.

         Specific Purpose: To explain to my classmates the effects of losing
         a pet on the elderly.

         Central Idea: When elderly persons lose their animal companions,
         they can experience serious psychological, emotional, and physical
         effects.

         Specific Purpose: To demonstrate to my audience the correct
         method for cleaning a computer keyboard.

         Central Idea: Your computer keyboard needs regular cleaning to
         function well, and you can achieve that in four easy steps.

         Specific Purpose: To persuade my political science class that labor
         unions are no longer a vital political force in the U.S.

         Central Idea: Although for decades in the twentieth century labor
         unions influenced local and national elections, in this speech I will
         point to how their influence has declined in the last thirty years.

         Specific Purpose: To motivate my audience to oppose the policy of
         drug testing welfare recipients.

         Central Idea: Many voices are calling for welfare recipients to
         go through mandatory, regular drug testing, but this policy is
         unjust, impractical, and costly, and fair-minded Americans should
         actively oppose it.

         Specific Purpose: To explain to my fellow civic club members why
         I admire Representative John Lewis.

         Central Idea: John Lewis has my admiration for his sacrifices
         during the Civil Rights movement and his service to Georgia as a
         leader and U.S. Representative.
Exploring Public Speaking  79  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                                                                               Speech

         Specific Purpose: To describe how makeup is done for the TV show
        The Walking Dead.

         Central Idea: The wildly popular zombie show The Walking Dead
         achieves incredibly scary and believable makeup effects, and in
         the next few minutes I will tell you who does it, what they use, and
         how they do it.

Notice that in all of the above examples that neither the specific purpose
nor the central idea ever exceeds one sentence. You may divide your
central idea and the preview of main points into two sentences or three
sentences, depending on what your instructor directs. If your central idea
consists of more than three sentences, then you probably are including too
much information and taking up time that is needed for the body of the
speech. Additionally, you will have a speech trying to do too much and that
might mean going overtime.

4.4 - Problems to Avoid with Specific Purpose
and Central Idea Statements

The first problem many students have in writing their specific purpose
statement has already been mentioned: specific purpose statements
sometimes try to cover far too much and are too broad. For example:

         To explain to my classmates the history of ballet.

Aside from the fact that this subject may be difficult for everyone in your
audience to relate to, it is enough for a three-hour lecture, maybe even a
whole course. You will probably find that your first attempt at a specific
purpose statement will need refining. These examples are much more
specific and much more manageable given the limited amount of time you
will have.

         To explain to my classmates how ballet came to be performed and
         studied in the U.S.

         To explain to my classmates the difference between Russian and
         French ballet.

         To explain to my classmates how ballet developed as an art form
         in the Renaissance.

         To explain to my classmates the origin of the ballet dancers'
         clothing.

The second problem with specific purpose statements is the opposite of
being too broad, in that some specific purposes statements are so focused
Exploring Public Speaking  80  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                               Speech

that they might only be appropriate for people who are already extremely
interested in the topic or experts in a field:

         To inform my classmates of the life cycle of a new species of lima
         bean (botanists, agriculturalists).

         To inform my classmates about the Yellow 5 ingredient in
         Mountain Dew (chemists, nutritionists).

         To persuade my classmates that JIF Peanut Butter is better than
         Peter Pan. (professional chefs in large institutions)

The third problem happens when the "communication verb" in the specific
purpose does not match the content; for example, persuasive content is
paired with "to inform" or "to explain." If you resort to the word "why" in
the thesis, it is probably persuasive.

         To inform my audience why capital punishment is
         unconstitutional. (This cannot be informative since it is
         taking a side)

         To persuade my audience about the three types of individual
         retirement accounts. (This is not persuading the audience of
         anything, just informing)

         To inform my classmates that Universal Studios is a better theme
         park than Six Flags over Georgia. (This is clearly an opinion,
         hence persuasive)

The fourth problem exists when the content section of the specific purpose
statement has two parts and thus uses "and." A good speech follows the
KISS rule--Keep It Simple, Speaker. One specific purpose is enough. These
examples cover two different topics.

         To explain to my audience how to swing a golf club and choose the
         best golf shoes.

         To persuade my classmates to be involved in the Special Olympics
         and vote to fund better classes for the intellectually disabled.

To fix this problem, you will need to select one of the topics in these
examples and speak on just that:

         To explain to my audience how to swing a golf club.

         OR

         To explain to my audience how to choose the best golf shoes.

Of course, the value of this topic depends on your audience's interest in
golf and your own experience as a golfer.
Exploring Public Speaking  81  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                                                                                    Speech

The fifth problem with both specific purpose and central idea statements
is related to formatting. There are some general guidelines that need to be
followed in terms of how you write out these elements of your speech:

     Do not write either statement as a question.
     Always use complete sentences for central idea statements and

      infinitive phrases (that is, "to .....") for the specific purpose statement.
     Only use concrete language ("I admire Beyonc for being a talented

      performer and businesswoman"), and avoid subjective or slang terms
      ("My speech is about why I think Beyonc is the bomb") or jargon
      and acronyms ("PLA is better than CBE for adult learners.")
Finally, the sixth problem occurs when the speech just gets off track of
the specific purpose statement, in that it starts well but veers in another
direction. This problem relates to the challenge of developing coherent
main points, what might be called "the Roman numeral points" of the
speech. The specific purpose usually determines the main points and the
relevant structure. For example, if the specific purpose is:

         To inform my classmates of the five stages of grief as described by
         Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.

There is no place in this speech for a biography of Dr. Kubler-Ross,
arguments against this model of grief, therapies for those undergoing grief,
or steps for the audience to take to get counseling. All of those are different
specific purposes. The main points would have to be the five stages, in
order, as Dr. Kubler-Ross defined them.

There are also problems to avoid in writing the central idea statement. As
mentioned above, remember that:

     The specific purpose and central idea statements are not the same
      thing, although they are related.

     The central idea statement should be clear and not complicated or
      wordy; it should "stand out" to the audience. As you practice delivery,
      you should emphasize it with your voice.

     The central idea statement should not be the first thing you say, but
       should follow the steps of a good introduction as outlined in Chapter
      8. Those steps include
           1. getting the audience's attention,
           2. revealing the topic,
           3. revealing the central idea and main points,
           4. establishing your credibility, and
           5. establishing rapport with your audience.

One last word. You will notice that we have said nothing about titles of
your speeches so far. A title is a good thing and serves purposes. Your
instructor may or may not emphasize the title of your speech. This
textbook chooses to focus on the purpose and central idea as the basis, or
Exploring Public Speaking  82  Chapter 4: Developing Topics for Your
Version 4.2
                               Speech

the spine of the speech. A good source on titles can be found here: How to
write good speech titles.

Conclusion

You should be aware that all aspects of your speech are constantly going to
change as you move toward actually giving your speech. The exact wording
of your central idea may change and you can experiment with different
versions for effectiveness. However, your specific purpose statement
should not change unless there is a really good reason, and in some
cases, your instructor will either discourage that, forbid it, or expect to be
notified. There are many aspects to consider in the seemingly simple task
of writing a specific purpose statement and its companion, the central idea
statement. Writing good ones at the beginning will save you some trouble
later in the speech preparation process.

Something to Think About

What if your informative speech has the specific purpose statement:
To explain the biological and lifestyle causes of Type II diabetes. The
assignment is a seven-minute speech, and when you practice it the first
time, it is thirteen minutes long. Should you adjust the specific purpose
statement? How?

Case Studies in Specific Purposes and Central Idea Statements

Case Study One: Mitchell is taking a Fundamentals of Speech course
in his second year of college. As a member of the college's tennis team,
he wants to speak on his favorite subject, tennis. He is assigned an
informative speech that should be seven minutes long and use four
external sources (other than his own experience). He realizes off the bat
that he knows a great deal about the subject as far as how to play and be
good at it, but not much about the history or origins or the international
impact of the sport. He brainstorms a list of topics, as his instructor tells
him to: 1. Famous tennis players 2. Rules of tennis 3. How to start playing
tennis 4. How to buy or choose equipment for tennis 5. Why tennis is a
great sport 6. Tennis organizations 7. Where tennis came from 8. Dealing
with tennis injuries 9. Tennis and the Olympics 10. Famous tennis
tournaments--grand slam events

However, he also wants to be sure that his audience is not bored or
confused. His instructor gives him a chance to get in a small group and
have four of his classmates give him some ideas about the topics. He finds
out no one in his group has ever played tennis but they do have questions.
He knows that everyone in his class is 18-24 years old, single, no children,
enrolled in college, and all have part-time jobs.

Critique Mitch's brainstormed topics based on what you know. What
should he do? Can you come up with a good starting specific purpose?

Case Study Two: Bonita is required to give a 5- to 6-minute presentation
as part of a job interview. The interview is for a position as public relations
and social media director of a nonprofit organization that focuses on
nutrition in a five-county region near her home. There will be five people
in her audience: the president of the organization, two board members,
the office manager (who is also the Human Resources director), and a
volunteer. She has never met these people. Bonita has a college degree in
public relations, so she knows her subject. She does as much research on
the organization as she can and finds out about their use of social media
and the Internet for publicity, marketing, and public relations. It does
have a Facebook page but is not utilizing it well. It does not have any other
social media accounts.

What would you suggest for Bonita? Here are some questions to consider.
Should she be persuasive, informative, or inspiring? (General purpose).
What should be her specific content area? How can she answer the two
important questions of the value of her topic to the audience and why
would the audience think she is credible?

5.1 - Research

When preparing to write or speak about a topic, your first step is to gather
information. You will need to do research to ensure that you provide your
audience with sufficient background information and support your claims.

Doing research involves more than finding a few books or articles on a
topic; a researcher's job is to find useful, relevant, and reliable information,
which can be challenging. This chapter will help by providing an
introduction to research terminology and the research process.

Most researchers begin their work by evaluating the current information
that exists on their topic. They may look at a combination of primary and
secondary sources during this process. Their goal is to find out what is
currently known about a topic and where the research may be headed.
Students completing a research-based assignment will begin much the
same way.

academic journals, and
newspapers               The Library Catalog

                         The library catalog is a good place to begin searching. Since it will allow
                         you to search the library's collection of books, periodicals, and media, you
                         will have access to a lot of material that broadly covers your topic, and the
                         information you find will help you as you work to narrow the scope of your
                         research.

                         Many libraries have a unique or branded name for their catalog and
                         provide online search functionality. One helpful feature of the catalog's
                         search tool is the ability to sort and refine search results by date, format,
                         author, and other filter options.

                         Additionally, library catalogs allow users to link to electronic books, videos,
                         and other resources directly. These resources can be quite helpful, since
                         users do not need to come to the library building, nor are these resources
                         available only during library hours.

                         Databases

                         You're already familiar with using search engines (like Google), but did you
                         know that these tools only give you access to information that companies
                         and people have shared for free? The content freely available online only
                         represents a fraction of that which actually exists.

                         A lot of the information that isn't free is protected by paywalls. You may
                         have tried to read an article online, but weren't able to see the full text
                         because you were asked to pay. This can be frustrating when the content
                         is useful for research! Fortunately, you have access to online databases
                         through your library.

                         Library databases are available 24/7, and provide users with access to
                         the full text of eBooks and articles from periodicals, works that are
                         published on a regular, ongoing basis, such as magazines, academic
                         journals, and newspapers. The content in library databases is available
                         because libraries have paid to subscribe to the publications they offer. For
                         the library user, this information is free--but you will have to search the
                         library's databases to access it.

                         Note that if you are trying to use library databases remotely (not via a
                         wired connection to the library's actual network), such as from home or
                         on a business's free Wi-Fi network, you will probably be asked to log in to

(a periodical whose target audience is other experts in that disciplinary       and/or discipline
field).

Before the editor approves the publication of an article in their journal,
they send it to other scholars who are experts in the subject area. The other
scholars, peers of the original author, then read the articles and evaluate
them according to the standards of that discipline. Only after an article has
passed the peer review process can it be published in the academic journal.

Something you may have wondered is whether the terms "scholarly,"
"peer-reviewed," and "academic" have different meanings when used to
describe articles or the journals in which they are published. The answer is
no. These terms are used interchangeably.

Historically, academic journals were primarily available in print, but today
most readers access them online. When looking at a search results page, it
can be challenging to figure out which articles are from popular magazines
and which are from scholarly journals. Fortunately, most databases have
a filter that lets you limit your results by publication type. As you continue
to use the search function in databases, you will notice that it's possible to
put additional controls on the displayed results, allowing you to sort and
refine.

Filtering your results is just one way to ensure that you find the
information you need. Another option is to modify your search technique.
The easiest way to do this is to put search phrases in quotation marks.
If you're looking for information about attention deficit disorder, using
"attention deficit disorder" ensures that the three words stay together
in the order in which you have typed them. This can be very helpful to
optimize the relevance of your search results. Without the quotation
marks, the database will look for the words "attention," "deficit," and
"disorder." You can also combine search terms by using Boolean operators
(AND, OR, and NOT); try changing the search parameters by using
truncation (to find similar words with the same root, such as typing
medica* will give you results including medical, medically, medication,
medications, etc.); or searching with subject headings. An example of a
Exploring Public Speaking  88  Chapter 5: Researching Your Speeches

5.3 - Research on the Internet

Many of the techniques you use to improve your library searches can help
you online too. Keeping phrases together with quotation marks works on
many sites, and you can use the minus sign (-) to filter out search terms
you'd prefer not be included. Date range filters and other limiters are
available too, helping you narrow your search down even further. For
example, Advanced Search on Google (Google it!) will give you several
filters to narrow your search.

Finding information online is relatively simple, so the challenge
researchers face is determining what information is useful and whether it's
credible. A quick assessment is easy, and here are a few questions to guide
you:

     Is the information current relative to your needs?
      Information in a rapidly-changing field like science or medicine
       can quickly become outdated. Even social science research is time-
       sensitive. Laws and demographics can change quickly, and you'll
      want to be sure the information you're using is up-to-date.

     Does the information address your topic? You may not find
      any single source that directly addresses all facets of your approach to
      a topic. You can, however, use information from multiple sources to
       support different parts of your work.

     Who is the source of information? The advice of an expert in
      a subject may be more valuable than the opinion of a layperson. On
      the other hand, a salesperson may know a lot about their product,
      but their perspective is informed by their goal of making a sale. With
      this in mind, you may ask yourself why was this information
      created?

The trustworthiness of information you find on the Internet can be harder
yet to discern. While a source may have a current date listed, seem to
offer relevant information, and claim to be an expert, it's important to go
beyond the information they give about themselves and verify that you can
believe that they are honestly representing themselves and the information
they offer.

Some advice on how to effectively evaluate online information is offered
by Washington State University Professor Michael Caulfield, who suggests
doing the following:

     Check for previous work: Look around to see if someone else has
      already fact-checked the claim or provided a synthesis of research.
      Dubious claims can quickly be debunked with a Google search. Some
      websites that are dedicated to fact-checking include FactCheck.org,
      Politifact, and Snopes. The first two are focused on political claims,
      while the third addresses stories from various sources.
Exploring Public Speaking  90  Chapter 5: Researching Your Speeches
Version 4.2

     Go upstream to the source: Go "upstream" to the source of the
      claim. Most web content is not original. Get to the original source to
      understand the trustworthiness of the information. You can achieve
      this by identifying where the information originated. If an article is
      describing a scientific study, tracking down the original study may
      reveal that its significant findings weren't accurately represented.

     Read laterally: Once you get to the source of a claim, read what
      other people say about the source (publication, author, etc.). The
      truth is in the network. While some sources may claim to be experts
      in their subject areas, it may turn out that other experts in the field
      consider that source questionable.

     Circle back: If you get lost, hit dead ends, or find yourself going
      down an increasingly confusing rabbit hole, back up and start over
      knowing what you know now. You're likely to take a more informed
      path with different search terms and better decisions. If you feel that
      you are overwhelmed by the amount of information, or can't tell if
       sources are actually still relevant to your topic, it might be time to
       start over, or seek assistance.

There are many "tests" or "sets of criteria" that you can find in textbooks
and on websites for deciding if a website is reliable. Words and concepts
such as currency, authority, accessing only certain domain names (.org
or .edu as opposed to .com), and inclusion of a bibliography or references
section are common. Another is writing style: does the writing style show
bias (such as use of name-calling or loaded language) or poor grammar
and editing? These are all good signs that your site may have an agenda
beyond fair presentation of facts. However, your site may seem to pass
muster on first sight but not really provide what you need. That is why we
have included the advice from Dr. Caulfield here. For more information on
this topic, check out:

Source 3

One common source that many students have questions about using
is Wikipedia. Most of us use Wikipedia or similar sites to look up the
answers to pressing questions such as "Was Val Kilmer in the film Willow?"
or "When is the next solar eclipse?" However, it is unlikely that your
instructor will be satisfied with your using evidence from Wikipedia (or
other Wiki-type sites).

There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that Wikipedia is, like a
dictionary, a basic reference source. Like a printed encyclopedia, it is used
for basic or general information about a topic, but this means that it is not
Exploring Public Speaking  91  Chapter 5: Researching Your Speeches
Version 4.2

suitable for serious college-level research. Additionally, because anyone on
Wikipedia (or any Wiki site) can update information, there is no guarantee
that what you read will be up-to-date or correct. While Wikipedia and its
editors make every effort to maintain the accuracy of entries, with millions
of pages on the site, that isn't always possible. Sometimes Wikipedia pages
display inaccurate information, including hoax articles or prank edits.
These are typically corrected quickly by editors who notice a change has
been made and fact-check to verify whether the information is true.

When it comes down to it, Wikipedia is a good place to go to obtain
basic information or general knowledge about your subject. You can
use the references at the bottom of the page (if there are any) to look for
information elsewhere. But saying to an audience, "my source for the
information in this speech is Wikipedia" will probably do little to convince
your audience that you are knowledgeable and have done adequate
research for the speech.

Keeping in mind the considerations discussed in this section will help you
select online sources for use in your work. They will also help you as you
navigate the breadth of information on- and offline in your daily life.

5.4 - Conducting Your Own Research

Up to this point, we have discussed finding sources (both primary and
secondary) that have been published. It is also possible for you to use
some truly firsthand information in your speeches by conducting your own
primary research.

Surveys

One type of primary research you can use is surveys. Your instructor
may ask you to construct a short survey to learn something about your
audience before, for example, a persuasive speech. A survey can be helpful
if the questions are well-written and if the survey is not too long.

For the most part, a survey should use objective questions. That means
questions with a few predetermined answers for the survey-takers to
choose from, such as multiple-choice, true-false, I agree/Neutral/I
disagree, or yes-no. If the researcher wants to construct a multiple choice
question, he or she must try to provide all the reasonable options.

For example, if a student wanted to give a speech about why consumers
should not buy gas with ethanol, and used this question:

What grade of gas do you buy for your car? Regular Medium High Octane/
Premium
Exploring Public Speaking  92  Chapter 5: Researching Your Speeches
Version 4.2

The survey writer left out the option of diesel, and failed to account for
students who don't own or drive a car, who are unsure what grade of
gasoline they buy, or who buy more than one grade of gasoline.

Another misstep to avoid is asking open-ended questions. If you wanted
to know what grocery store in the area your audience patronized, this
question would not be ideal:

At which grocery store does your family shop?
_______________________

This alternate version would be more useful and easy to interpret:

At which of these grocery stores does your family shop?

     Food City
     Target
     Publix
     Kroger
     Save-a-Lot
     Walmart
     Shoprite
     Other: ______________________

Allowing the people taking your survey to select more than one of the
responses is best, since few people shop at just one store. Or you could
phrase the question, "At which of these grocery stores does your family
spend most of its money?" In that case, there would only be one answer,
and it would tell you more specific information.

The criteria for what constitutes a "short" survey are fluid, but five
questions would probably be enough to let you know what you need. A
survey taker might become tired of answering a long list of questions.
Other things to keep in mind when writing questions are to avoid using
too vague or too personal questions, because respondents may not know
how or may not want to answer. Furthermore, to get honest responses,
it helps to write questions in an unbiased way. "Do you favor raising the
minimum wage in our state to $15.00 per hour?" is more balanced than
"Do you believe that business owners in our state should be required to
treat their employees better by having to raise their minimum wage to a
more reasonable and fair $15.00 per hour?" You also would not want to
insult your survey takers with questions such as "Do you agree that all
math majors are antisocial?"

Finally, you will administer the survey. There are many free online tools
for surveys; two popular options are Survey Monkey and Google Forms.
These are easy to use and helpful for short surveys (you might need to pay
a fee for longer surveys, or to send surveys to a large group of people). You
can also conduct surveys in person, but that takes longer and would not be
Exploring Public Speaking  93  Chapter 5: Researching Your Speeches
Version 4.2

anonymous, meaning people may be less likely to answer honestly. Finally,
your instructor may ask you to make paper copies and pass them around
class.

You can use a variety of means to conduct surveys. Using surveys is
valuable because knowing your audience's level of knowledge and their
attitudes about your topic ahead of time can be helpful in creating an
audience-centered speech.

Interviews

You may also benefit from conducting an interview with a person who is
knowledgeable about your topic, such as a professional with educational
and career credentials in their field. Using a first-hand interview will add
a great deal of credibility to your speech, if done correctly. For example,
if you are going to give a speech about the effects of the No Child Left
Behind policy or the Common Core standards, it makes sense to talk to an
elementary school principal for their knowledge and expertise on the issue.

Here are some valuable tips:

    1. Do the interview after you have read some published sources on the
        topic, not before. You should have a good understanding of the basic
        issues involved.

    2. Choose the right person: someone who has first-hand knowledge of
        the topic, is available, and is willing to be interviewed.

    3. Make an appointment with the interviewee, and arrive on time.
    4. Assume that the person you are interviewing is busy and cannot give

        you lots of time. This assumption may be wrong, but it's better to go
        in with the expectation of limited time than to expect the person to
        speak with you for an hour.
    5. Prepare your questions in advance and have your questions in a
        logical order. Do not say, "I have to give a speech on ____. What
        can you tell me about it?"
    6. Ask the person for information you cannot get from other sources.
        The interviewee may not know national statistics off the top of their
        head. They will know about their daily experience with the topic.
    7. Be sure not to ask inappropriate, proprietary, or embarrassing
        questions. Your interviewee should know that it's okay for them to
        refuse to answer if they are not comfortable.
    8. Finally, write the person a thank you note or email afterward.
        They have done you a big favor, and expressing your gratitude is a
        courteous gesture. It is also valuable to networking. Someday, your
        interviewee may be in the position to offer you a job.

What to Do With All These Sources

Once you have found your sources, you will start by reading them. Taking
notes as you work will help you identify notable themes and make

6.1 - Why We Need Organization in Speeches

Have you had this experience? You have an instructor who is easy to take
notes from because they help you know the main ideas and gives you
cues as to what is most important to write down and study for the test.
And then you might have an instructor who tells interesting stories, says
provocative things, and leads engaging discussions, but you have a really
hard time following where the instruction is going. If so, you already know
that structure makes a difference for your own listening and learning. In
this chapter we will examine why that is true and how you can translate
that type of structure to your own speeches.

Significant psychological and communication research has been done
about how an audience needs and desires clear organization in a speech as
they listen. Sources on how audiences need organization are listed in the
references at the end of the book, but they are summarized here.

First, as we listen, we have limits as to how many categories of information
we can keep in mind. You have probably heard that this number of items
or categories is seven, or as one source says, "seven plus or minus two"
(Miller, 1956; Gabriel and Mayzner, 1963; Cowan, Chen, & Rouder, 2004).
In public speaking, to be on the safe side, the "minus two" is advised: in
other words, you should avoid having more than five main "points" (or
supporting sections) in a speech, and that would only be for a speech
of greater length where you could actually support, explain, or provide
sufficient evidence for five "points."

For most speeches that you would give in class, where you have about 5-7
minutes, three points is probably safe territory, although there could be
exceptions, of course. It is also acceptable for short speeches to just have
two main points, if doing so supports your specific purpose. That
last phrase is bolded for emphasis because ultimately, your organization
is going to depend on your specific purpose. As always, follow your
instructor's directions.

Secondly, because your audience will understand you better and perceive
you as competent, you will gain more credibility as a speaker if you are
organized, assuming you also have credible information and acceptable
delivery (Slagell, 2013; Sharp & McClung, 1966). Yun, Costantini, and
Billingsley (2012) also found a side benefit to learning to be an organized
public speaker: your writing skills will improve, specifically your
organization and sentence structure. This was no surprise to one of the
authors, whose students often comment that they were able to organize
their essays and papers for other classes much better after learning good
organization principles for speaking.

Finally, the categories of information should be distinct, different, and
clear. You might think about organization in public speaking as having
Exploring Public Speaking  97  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                                                               Your Speech

three steps. These steps are grouping, labeling, and ordering (putting into
a good order). We will return to the order of parts and labeling sections
of the speech later in the chapter. Before you can label your main points
clearly or put them in the right order, you have to group your information.

Grouping

Here we might use the analogy of having a yard sale at your home,
something you might have done or helped a family member to do. The
first step, before putting up signs or pricing items, is to go through your
closets and garage and creating "piles" of items: what you want to sell,
what should probably just be discarded, what you want to keep but store
elsewhere, what you might want to give away. Then you take the "sell"
pile and separate it into categories such as children's items, tools, kitchen
items, furniture, etc. This second phase of sorting items is so you can
put them outside on your lawn or driveway in a way people expect to see
items and would be more likely to buy. You would probably not sort items
by color or size, although you could. It's just that your customers are not
looking for "blue" items or "big" items as much as they are looking for
kitchen items, baby clothes, or furniture.

One of the authors frequently does the following exercise in class. She has
all the students take some object from their pocket, purse, or backpack
and place it on a table at the front of the room. (It's interesting what gets
put on the table!). Then she has the students gather around and look at the
items and "group them"-put them into categories, with each group having
at least two items and all items being put in some group. Afterward, she
records the different grouping schema on the whiteboard and discusses
them. Of course, most of the groups are "correct," even if based just on
color, size, or weight. However, she then asks, "If you had to communicate
to a classmate who is absent what is on the table, which schema or
grouping pattern would you use?" The point is that grouping can be done
on the basis of many characteristics or patterns, but some are clearer and
better for communicating. By the way, the "functionality" pattern (what
the items are used for) usually wins.

Researchers have found that "chunking" information, that is, the way it
is grouped, is vital to audience understanding, learning, and retention
of information (Beighly, 1954; Bodeia, Powers, & Fitch-Hauser, 2006;
Whitman & Timmis, 1975; Daniels & Whitman, 1981). How does this work
in practice? When you are doing your research, you look at the articles
and websites you read and say, "That information relates to what I read
over here" and "That statistic fits under the idea of . . ." You are looking
for similarities and patterns. That is exactly what you do when you group
anything, such as the items at a yard sale, where you group according
to customer interest and purpose of the items. Finally, if a piece of
Exploring Public Speaking  98  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                               Your Speech

information you found doesn't fit into a group as you do your research, it
may just not belong in the speech. It's what we would call "extraneous."

A good example of this principle is if you are doing a demonstration
speech. It may or may not be required in your class, but is the kind of
speech you may be called upon to do in your future work. For example,
a nurse may be teaching patients how to do self-care for diabetes, or a
computer trainer may be showing how to use software. The temptation
is to treat the procedure as a list of steps, which may number as many as
twenty or thirty steps.

There are very few times we can remember a list of twenty or thirty items.
Yes, you learned the alphabet of 26 letters when you were a child, or all the
state capitals, but you have probably forgotten how long it took. Plus, you
probably learned a song to help with the alphabet, and you also did not
understand the point of the alphabet; it was just something you did with
other children or to please your parents. In the case of the state capitals,
you probably used flashcards or memory aids.

Adult learning and listening is different. We need information "chunked"
or grouped into manageable categories. So, instead of listing twenty or
thirty discrete steps in the process you are demonstrating or explaining,
you would want to group the steps into three to five logical categories
to help the audience's reception and retention of the message, using the
separate minor steps as "subpoints."

6.2 - Patterns of Organization

At this point, then, you should see how much your audience needs
organization. You also know that as you do research, you will group
together similar pieces of information from different sources in your
research. As you group your research information, you will want to make
sure that your content is adhering to your specific purpose statement and
will look for ways that your information can be grouped together into
categories.

At this point we will address the third step of organization, ordering, and
return to labeling later. However, in actually composing your speech,
you would want to be sure that you name or label your groups of ideas
and content clearly for yourself and then even more clearly for your
audience. Labeling is an iterative process, which means you may "tweak"
how you label your main points for clarity as you progress in the speech
preparation..

Interestingly, there are some standard ways of organizing these categories,
which are called "patterns of organization." In each of the examples below,
you will see how the specific purpose gives shape to the organization of the
speech and how each one exemplifies one of the six main organizational
Exploring Public Speaking  99  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining

                                                                                 Your Speech

patterns. In each example, only the three to five main sections or "points"          Chronological

Chronological

Specific Purpose: To describe to my classmates the four stages of
rehabilitation in addiction recovery.

    I. The first stage is acknowledging the problem and entering
          treatment.

    II. The second stage is early abstinence, a difficult period in the
          rehabilitation facility.

    III. The third stage is maintaining abstinence after release from the
          rehab facility.

    IV. The fourth stage is advanced recovery after a period of several
          years.

The example above uses what is termed the chronological pattern
of organization. Chronological always refers to time order. Since the
specific purpose is about stages, it is necessary to put the four stages in the
right order. It would make no sense to put the fourth stage second and the
third stage first. However, chronological time can be long or short. If you
were giving a speech about the history of the Civil Rights Movement, that
period would cover several decades; if you were giving a speech about the
process of changing the oil in a car, that process takes less than an hour.
The process described in the speech example above would also be long-
term, that is, one taking several months or years. The commonality is the
order of the information.

In addition, chronological speeches that refer to processes can be given
for two reasons. First, they can be for understanding. The speech about
recovery is to explain what happens in the addiction recovery process,
but the actual process may never really happen to the audience members.
That understanding may also lead them to more empathy for someone in
recovery. Second, chronological or process speeches can be for action and
instruction. For a speech about changing the oil in a car, your purpose is
that the audience could actually change the oil in their cars after listening
to the speech.

One of the problems with chronological speeches is, as mentioned before,
that you would not want just a list of activities. It is important to "chunk"
the information into three to five groups so that the audience has a

   Spatial pattern       framework. For example, in a speech about the history of the Civil Rights
                         Movement, your "grouping" or "chunking" might be:

pattern for speeches in       I. The movement saw African-Americans struggling for legal

are arranged according
to movement in space          II. The movement was galvanized and motivated by the Montgomery
or direction                       Bus Boycott.

                              III. The movement saw many of its goals met in the Civil Rights Act of
                                   1965.

                         It would be easy in the case of the Civil Rights Movement to list the many
                         events that happened over more than two decades, but that could be
                         overwhelming for the audience. In this outline, the audience is focused on
                         the three events that pushed it forward, rather than the persons involved
                         in the movement. You could give a speech with a focus on people, but it
                         would be different and probably less chronological and more topical (see
                         below).

                         We should say here that, realistically, the example given above is still
                         too broad. It would be useful, perhaps, for an audience with almost no
                         knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement, but too basic and not really
                         informative for other audiences. Just one of the Roman numeral points
                         would probably be a more specific focus.

                         Spatial

                         You can see that chronological is a highly-used organizational structure,
                         since one of the ways our minds work is through time-orientation--past,
                         present, future. Another common thought process is movement in space or
                         direction, which is called the spatial pattern. For example:

                         Specific Purpose: To explain to my classmates the three regional cooking
                         styles of Italy.

                              I. In the mountainous region of the North, the food emphasizes
                                    cheese and meat.

                              II. In the middle region of Tuscany, the cuisine emphasizes grains and
                                    olives.

                              III. In the southern region and Sicily, the diet is based on fish and
                                    seafood.

                         In this example, the content is moving from northern to southern Italy,
                         as the word "regional" would indicate. Here is a good place to note that
                         grouping or "chunking" in a speech helps simplicity, and to meet the
                         principle of KISS (Keep It Simple, Speaker). If you were to actually study
                         Italian cooking in depth, sources will say there are twenty regions. But
                         "covering" twenty regions in a speech is not practical. While the regions
                         would be distinct for a "foodie" or connoisseur of Italian cooking, for a
                         beginner or general audience, three is a good place to start. You could
                         at the end of the speech note that more in-depth study would show the
Exploring Public Speaking  101  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                                                             Your Speech

twenty regions, but that in your speech you have used three regions
to show the similarities of the twenty regions rather than the smaller
differences.

For a more localized example:

Specific Purpose: To explain to my classmates the layout of the White
House.

    I. The East Wing includes the entrance ways and offices for the First
          Lady.

    II. The most well-known part of the White House is the West Wing.
    III. The residential part of the White House is on the second floor.
(The emphasis here is the movement a tour would go through.)

For an even more localized example:

Specific Purpose: To describe to my Anatomy and Physiology class the
three layers of the human skin.

    I. The outer layer is the epidermis, which is the outermost barrier of
          protection.

    II. The second layer beneath is the dermis.
    III. The third layer closest to the bone is the hypodermis, made of fat

          and connective tissue.
The key to spatial organization is to be logical in progression rather than
jumping around, as in this example:

    I. The Native Americans of Middle Georgia were primarily the Creek
          nation.

    II. The Native Americans of North Georgia were of the Cherokee tribe
          nation.

    III. The Native Americans of South Georgia were mostly of the Hitchiti
          and Oconee tribes.

It makes more sense to start at the top (north) of the state and move down
(south) or start at the bottom and move up rather than randomly discuss
unconnected areas.

Version 4.2
                                Your Speech

Topical/Parts of the Whole

The topical organizational pattern is probably the most all-purpose in
that many speech topics could use it. Many subjects will have main points
that naturally divide into "types of," "kinds of," "sorts of," or "categories
of." Other subjects naturally divide into "parts of the whole." However,
as mentioned previously, you want to keep your categories simple, clear,
distinct, and at five or fewer.

Specific Purpose: To explain to my freshmen students the concept of
SMART goals.

    I. SMART goals are specific and clear.
    II. SMART goals are measurable.
    III. SMART goals are attainable or achievable.
    IV. SMART goals are relevant and worth doing.
    V. SMART goals are time-bound and doable within a time period.
Specific Purpose: To explain the four characteristics of quality diamonds.

    I. Valuable diamonds have the characteristic of cut.
    II. Valuable diamonds have the characteristic of carat.
    III. Valuable diamonds have the characteristic of color.
    IV. Valuable diamonds have the characteristic of clarity.
Specific Purpose: To describe to my audience the four main chambers of a
human heart.

    I. The first chamber in the blood flow is the right atrium.
    II. The second chamber in the blood flow is the right ventricle.
    III. The third chamber in the blood flow is the left atrium.
    IV. The fourth chamber in the blood flow and then out to the body is

          the left ventricle.
Exploring Public Speaking  103  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                                                                  Your Speech

At this point in discussing organizational patterns and looking at these
examples, two points should be made about them and about speech
organization in general.

First, you might look at the example about the chambers of the heart
and say, "But couldn't that be chronological, too, since that's the order
of the blood flow procedure?" Yes, it could. There will be times when a
specific purpose could work with two different organizational patterns. In
this case, it's just a matter of emphasis. This speech is emphasizing the
anatomy of the heart; if the speech's specific purpose were "To explain to
my classmates the flow of blood through the chambers of the heart," the
organizational pattern would be chronological but very similar. However,
since the blood goes to the lungs to be oxygenated before coming back to
the left atrium, that might alter the pattern some.

Another principle of organization to think about when using topical
organization is "climax" organization. That means putting your strongest
argument or most important point last when applicable. For example:

Specific purpose: To defend before my classmates the proposition that
capital punishment should be abolished in the United States.

    I. Capital punishment does not save money for the justice system.
    II. Capital punishment does not deter crime in the United States

          historically.
    III. Capital punishment has resulted in many unjust executions.
In most people's minds, "unjust executions" is a bigger reason to end
a practice than the cost, since an unjust execution means the loss of an
innocent life and a violation of our principles of justice. If you believe Main
Point III is the strongest argument of the three, putting it last builds up to
a climax.

Cause/Effect Pattern

If the specific purpose mentions words such as "causes," "origins," "roots
of," "foundations," "basis," "grounds," or "source," it is a causal order; if it
mentions words such as "effects," "results," "outcomes," "consequences,"
or "products," it is effect order. If it mentions both, it would of course be
cause/effect order. This example shows a cause/effect pattern:

Specific Purpose: To explain to my classmates the causes and effects of
schizophrenia.

    I. Schizophrenia has genetic, social, and environmental causes.
    II. Schizophrenia has educational, relational, and medical effects.
It should be noted, however, that a specific purpose like this example is
very broad and probably not practical for your class speeches; it would
be better to focus on just causes or effects, or even just one type of cause
(such as genetic causes of schizophrenia) or one type of effect (relational or
Exploring Public Speaking  104  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                Your Speech

                           social). These next two examples show a speech that deals with causes only
                           and effects only, respectively.

Specific Purpose: To explain to my fellow Biology 1107 students the origin
of the Ebola epidemic in Africa in 2014.

    I. The outbreak began in March 2014 in Guinea with the death of
          one-year-old child who played in a tree with infected bats.

    II. The virus next spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.
    III. In Fall of 2014 it spread to the U.S. and Europe by travelers from

          Liberia.
Specific Purpose: To describe to my classmates the effects of a diagnosis of
autism on a child's life.

    I. An autism diagnosis will affect the child's educational plan.
    II. An autism diagnosis will affect the child's social existence.
    III. An autism diagnosis will affect the child's family relationships.

Problem-Solution Pattern

The problem-solution pattern will be explored in more depth in the
chapter on Persuasive Speaking because that is where it is used the most.
Then, we will see that there are variations on it. The principle behind
problem-solution pattern is that if you explain a problem to an audience,
Exploring Public Speaking  105  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                                                            Your Speech

you should not leave them hanging without solutions. Problems are
discussed for understanding and to do something about them.

Additionally, when you want to persuade someone to act, the first reason
is usually that something is wrong! Even if you wanted your friends to go
out to get some dinner, and they have recently eaten, you will probably be
less successful because there is no problem for them--they are not hungry.
Then you would have to come up with a new problem, such as you will
miss their presence while you eat, which they may or may not see as a
problem for them.

In another real-life example, let's say you want the members of the school
board to provide more funds for music at the three local high schools in
your county. What is missing because music or arts are not funded? What
is the problem?

Specific Purpose: To persuade the members of the school board to take
action to support the music program at the school.

    I. There is a problem with eliminating extracurricular music
          programs in high schools.
              A. Students who do not have extracurricular music in their
                    lives have lower SAT scores.
          1. Our county's students have lower SAT scores than students in
                Smith County to our north.
          2. Smith County has a K-12 music program.

  B. Schools that do not have extracurricular music programs have more
  gang violence and juvenile delinquency.

          1. Our county's rates of teen criminal activity are rising.
          2. Our county's rates of gang violence have risen.
    II. The solution is to provide $200,000 in the budget to sustain
          extracurricular music in our high schools.

              A. $120,000 would go to bands.
              B. $80,000 would go to choral programs.
Of course, this is a simple outline and you would need to provide evidence
to support the arguments, but it shows how problem-solution works.
Psychologically, it makes more sense to use problem-solution rather than
solution-problem. The audience will be more motivated to listen if you
address needs, deficiencies, or problems in their lives rather than giving
them solutions first because they will lack context.

Problem-Cause-Solution Pattern

A variation of the problem-solution pattern, and one that sometimes
requires more in-depth exploration of an issue, is the "problem-cause-
solution" pattern. If you were giving a speech on future extinction
of certain animal species, it would be insufficient to just explain that
numbers of species are about to become extinct. Your second point
Exploring Public Speaking  106  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                Your Speech

would logically have to explain the cause behind this happening. Is it due
to climate change, some type of pollution, encroachment on habitats,
disease, or some other reason? In many cases, you can't really solve a
problem without first identifying what caused the problem. This pattern is
similar to the organizational pattern called Monroe's Motivated Sequence
(German, Gronbeck, Ehninger & Monroe, 2012), which will be fully
explained in Chapter 13.

Specific Purpose: To persuade my audience that the age to obtain a
driver's license in the state of Georgia should be raised to 18.

    I. There is a problem in this country with young drivers getting into
          serious automobile accidents leading to many preventable deaths.

    II. One of the primary causes of this is younger drivers' immaturity.
              A. They have an inability to remain focused due to
                    distractions.
              B. They make bad decisions due to incomplete brain
                    development.

    III. One solution that will help reduce the number of young drivers
          involved in accidents would be to raise the age for obtaining a
          driver's license to 18.

Some Additional Principles of Organization

It is possible that you may use more than one of these organizational
patterns within a single speech. For example, the main points of your
speech could be one organizational pattern and the subpoints a different
one. In the spatial example above about the Native American nations
of Georgia, the subpoints might be chronological (emphasizing their
development over time), or they could be topical (explaining aspects of
their culture).

You should also note that in all of the examples to this point (which have
been kept simple for the purpose of explanation), each main point is
relatively equal in emphasis; therefore, the time spent on each should be
equal as well. While you are not obliged to spend exactly the same amount
of time on each main point, the time spent (and the importance of the
main point) should be about the same. You would not want your first Main
Point to be 30 seconds long, the second one to be 90 seconds, and the
third 3 minutes. For example:

Specific Purpose: To explain to my classmates the rules of baseball.

    I. Baseball has rules about equipment.
    II. Baseball has rules about numbers of players.
    III. Baseball has rules about play.
Main Point II is not really equal in importance to the other two. There is
a great deal you could say about the equipment and even more about the
rules of play, but the number of players would take you about ten seconds
Exploring Public Speaking  107  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                                                              Your Speech

to say. If Main Point II were "Baseball has rules about the positions on the        Parallelism
field," that would make more sense and be closer in level of importance to
the other two.                                                                the repetition of
                                                                              grammatical structures
To give another example, let's say you want to give a commemorative (or       that correspond in
tribute) speech about a local veteran whom you admire.                        sound, meter, and
                                                                              meaning
    I. James Owens is an admirable person because he earned the Silver
          Star in the Korean War.

    II. James Owens is an admirable person because he served our
          community as a councilman for 25 years.

    III. James Owens is an admirable person because he rescued five
          puppies that were abandoned in his backyard.

Although Main Point III is a good thing to do, it's really not equal to Main
Points I and II in importance or in the amount of time you would need to
spend on it.

Earlier in the chapter, we said that organizing a speech involves grouping,
labeling, and ordering. Let's address labeling here. You will also notice
that in most of the examples so far, the main points are phrased using
a similar sentence structure. For example, "The first chamber in the
blood flow is..." "The second chamber in the blood flow is..." This simple
repetition of sentence structure is called parallelism, a technique useful
for speakers and helpful for the audience in remembering information. It
is not absolutely necessary to use it and will not always be relevant, but
parallelism should be used when appropriate and effective.

In relation to the way each main point is written, notice that they are
full grammatical sentences, although sometimes short and simple. For
purposes of preparation, this is a good habit, and your instructor will
probably require you to write your main points in full sentences. Your
instructor may also expect you to write your subpoints in complete
sentences as well, but they will discuss that with you.

Finally, in the way you phrase the main points, be sure they are adequate
labeled and clearly explain your content. Students are often tempted to
write main points as directions to themselves, "Talking about the health
department" or "Mention the solution." This is not helpful for you, nor
will your instructor be able to tell what you mean by those phrases. "The
health department provides many services for low-income residents" says
something we can all understand.

We have included examples of outlines at the ends of chapters 12, 13,
and 15. We have tried to give examples of different kinds of formats in
Appendix I, but individual instructors prefer specific formats for outlines.
Your instructor should give you examples of how they want the outline to
be developed and formatted, and you should follow their directions.

      Connectives       6.3 - Connective Statements

a phrase or sentence    At this point, you may be thinking that preparing for public speaking
that connects various   does not always follow a completely linear process. In writing the specific
parts of a speech and   purpose statement, you might already have a predetermined structure,
shows the relationship  and if so, the central idea or thesis sentence flows simply from the specific
between them            purpose statement and structure. In other instances, the process may not
                        be as direct and you will need to think more deeply about the best way to
                        organize your speech and write your central idea. Some of the examples
                        shown above, such as the one about the chambers of the heart, fall into the
                        "easy-to-follow" category, but others, such as the development of the Civil
                        Rights movement, would be less easy to follow.

                        Also at this point, we have worked on the core of the speech: the purpose,
                        the main idea or thesis, and the key main points, also referred to as
                        "Roman numerals" because traditional outline format uses I. through V. for
                        them. You will notice that we have not addressed the introduction or the
                        conclusion. You will find that information in Chapter 8. That information
                        is in a separate chapter and placed later because it is important and needs
                        special emphasis, not because it is unimportant. Basically, you cannot
                        write an introduction if you do not know what you are introducing. For
                        that reason, even if you are tempted to write your introduction first, you
                        should probably wait until the "core" or "body" of your speech is fairly
                        solid in your mind. The same is true of the conclusion samples discussed
                        in Chapter 8.

                        However, there is one aspect beyond the introduction and conclusion
                        that you should prepare and not leave to chance or "ad lib" during the
                        speech. (In fact, you really should not leave anything to chance or "ad lib"
                        in this stage of your development as a public speaker.) That aspect is the
                        connective statements, the subject of the next section.

                        Connectives or "connective statements" are broad terms that encompass
                        several types of statements or phrases. They are generally designed to help
                        "connect" parts of your speech to make it easier for audience members to
                        follow. Connectives are tools that add to the planned redundancy, and they
                        are methods for helping the audience listen, retain information, and follow
                        your structure. In fact, it is one thing to have a well-organized speech. It
                        is another for the audience to be able to "consume" or understand that
                        organization.

                        Connectives in general perform a number of functions:

                             Remind the audience of what has come before
                             Remind the audience of the central focus or purpose of the speech
                             Forecast what is coming next
                             Help the audience have a sense of context in the speech; connectives

                               answer the question, "Where are we?"

the main ideas of your speech for the audience, but they have different
emphases and are useful for different types of speeches.

        Signposts        Transitions serve as bridges between seemingly disconnected (but

Finally
                         Signposts emphasize the physical movement through the speech content
                         and let the audience know exactly where they are. Signposting can be
                         as simple as "First," "Next," "Lastly" or using numbers such as "First,"
                         "Second," Third," and "Fourth." Signposts can also be lengthier, but in
                         general signposting is meant to be a brief way to let your audience know
                         where they are in the speech. It may help to think of these like the mile
                         markers you see along interstates that tell you where you are or like signs
                         letting you know how many more miles until you reach your destination.

psychologically to the
next part of a speech    There is no standard format for connectives. In any speech there would be
                         multiple ways to help the audience move with you, understand your logic,
                         keep their attention, and remind them of where they have been and where
                         they are going. However, there are a few pieces of advice to keep in mind
                         about connectives.
Exploring Public Speaking  111  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                                                                  Your Speech

First, connectives are for connecting. They are not for providing evidence.
Save statistics, stories, examples, or new factual information for the
supporting points of the main ideas of the speech. Use the connectives
for the purposes listed above (review, psychological emphasis, etc.) not to
provide new examples, facts, or support.

Second, remember that connectives in writing can be relatively short--a
word or phrase. In public speaking, connectives need to be a sentence or
two. When you first start preparing and practicing connectives, you may
feel that you are being too obvious with them and they are "clunky." Some
connectives may seem to be hitting the audience over the head with them
like a hammer. While it is possible to overdo connectives, and we have
heard speakers do so, it is less likely than you would think. The audience
will appreciate them, and as you listen to your classmates' speeches,
you will become aware of when they are present and when they are
absent. Lack of connectives results in hard-to-follow speeches where the
information seems to come up unexpectedly or the speaker seems to jump
to something new without warning or clarification.

The third piece of advice is that your instructor may want you to include
connectives on your outlines in some way to help you start thinking about
them. More experienced public speakers have developed the ability to
think of transitions, internal previews and summaries, and signposts on
the spot, but that skill can take many years to develop.

Fourth, you will also want to vary your connectives and not use the same
one all the time. A popular transitional method is the question, such as:

        "Now that you know what was in the first chamber of the King
         Tut's tomb, you are probably asking, what is in the second tomb? I
         am glad you asked."

While this method can occasionally be clever, usually it is not; it is just
annoying. The audience didn't ask, so you don't want to put words in their
mouths. Or this:

        "The first, outer layer of the skin is the epidermis, the protection for
         what lies beneath. But what does lie beneath the epidermis?"

You should also want to avoid the word "so" too much or repeatedly.

Fifth, as we will discuss in Chapter 9 on visual aids, novice speakers
tend to think that use of slides, such as PowerPoint, eliminates the need
for connectives. "The slide changed, so I don't need a transition" is the
thinking. Please do not get into this pattern. Just changing a slide is not a
transition and does not help the audience understand your flow of ideas.
You need oral connectives, too.

Finally, up to this point we have only discussed connectives between the
main points. In reality, you will want to think in terms of connectives
Exploring Public Speaking  112  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining
Version 4.2
                                Your Speech

between any list of subpoints. For example, going back to the example
Problem-Solution speech about music in the high schools, you would want
a shorter connecting phrase between Subpoint A and B under Main Point I.

        "Not only do students without band or choir have lower
         standardized college test scores, they get involved in more
         unhealthy activities."

Admittedly, preparing connectives between subpoints is more difficult, but
you also want to avoid jumping to the next idea without warning.

6.4 - Outlining

For the purposes of this class, there are two primary types of outlines that
we will discuss: preparation outlines and speaking outlines.

Preparation Outlines

Preparation outlines are comprehensive outlines that include all of the
information in your speech. This is also most likely the outline that you
will be required to turn in to your instructor on the days you give your
speeches or in some cases, several days before you give the speech in class.
Each instructor of public speaking has a slightly different method for
approaching outlining. The examples given here are variations, so please
attend to the exact specifications that your instructor may require.

Some instructors require students to label parts of the introduction,
for example with "Attention getter" and "Credibility," and some like
the introduction to have Roman numeral points. Some may want the
central idea statement underlined. Some versions of outlines consider
the introduction Main Point I, and the conclusion the last main point.
Some will expect all units to be full sentences, and some will require
full sentences in the main points only. However, there are some parts of
an extemporaneous speech outline that are always present: the specific
purpose, the introduction, the central idea statement and preview, the
speech body with clearly labeled units, the connectives, and the conclusion.

You may wonder, "What's the deal with outlines in speech class? Why can't
I just write out my speech in essay form?" There are good reasons for your
instructor's insistence on an outline, and your instructor may respond
negatively if you hand in an essay instead of an outline.

In Chapter 11, which is on delivery, we look at the concept of
extemporaneous speaking versus impromptu, manuscript, and memorized
speeches. Most public speaking instructors in the United States focus their
classes on extemporaneous speaking. Extemporaneous speaking requires
a well-prepared outline. The outline requires you to clearly designate each
part of the speech and use a system where the main ideas are distinct from
Exploring Public Speaking  113  Chapter 6: Organizing and Outlining

Version 4.2                                                                   Your Speech

the supporting, subordinate, or "smaller ideas." Usually this is done with

indentation to the left and certain symbols for each unit. If you have to

edit the speech for time or for a particular audience, it's much easier to

subtract or add when you know the relative importance of the idea.

You should think of the outline as the blueprint for your speech. It is not
the speech--that is what comes out of your mouth in front of the audience.
The outline helps you prepare it just as the blueprint guides the building
of the house. You do not live on a blueprint, but in a house built by a
blueprint.

Speaking Outlines

It should be clear by now that the preparation outline is something you
are moving away from as you practice your speech and get ready for the
delivery. As mentioned before and will be mentioned later, you must give
yourself adequate time to practice the delivery of your speech--which
is why procrastination is one of a public speaker's biggest enemies. As
you practice, you will be able to summarize the full preparation outline
down to more usable notes. You should create a set of abbreviated notes
for the actual delivery. The more materials you take up with you to the
lectern, the more you will be tempted to look at them rather than have eye
contact with the audience, and that will affect your grade as well as your
connection with the listeners.

Your speaking notes should be in far fewer words than the preparation,
in key phrases, and in larger letters than the preparation outline. Your
speaking outline should provide cues to yourself to "slow down," "pause,"
or "change slide." You may want to use 4X6 or 5X7 cards (3X5 might be
too small) but again, keep them to a minimum. Your authors have seen
many students get their stack of cards out of order and confuse themselves
and the audience. Except for any quotations that you want to say exactly
as the original, you will avoid long chunks of text in both the speaking and
preparation outlines. An example of speaking notes on 5X7 cards is found
in Figure 6.2. These three note cards would be relevant to the informative
speech outline on haunted places in Gettysburg found at the end of
Chapter 12.

Conclusion

The organization of your speech may not be the most interesting part to
think about, but without it, great ideas will seem jumbled and confusing to
your audience. Even more, good connectives will ensure your audience can
follow you and understand the logical connections you are making with
your main ideas.

Something to Think About

Listen to a speech by a professional speaker, such as a TED Talk, and see if
you can detect their structure and use of transitions. Then talk about how
they help (or don't) your understanding and retention of what they say.

Case study

Roberto is thinking about giving an informative speech on the status
of HIV-AIDS currently in the U.S. He has different ideas about how to
approach the speech. Here are his four main thoughts:

    1. pharmaceutical companies making drugs available in the developing
        world

    2. changes in attitudes toward HIV-AIDS and HIV-AIDS patients over
        the last three decades

    3. how HIV affects the body of a patient
    4. major breakthroughs in HIV-AIDS treatment
Assuming all of these subjects would be researchable and appropriate
for the audience, write specific purpose statements for each. What
organizational patterns would he probably use for each specific purpose?

7.1 - Why Supporting Materials are Needed

As mentioned in previous chapters, preparing to give a presentation is not
a totally linear process. It would be nice if the process was like following a
recipe, but it loops back and forth as you move toward crafting something
that will present your ideas and research effectively. Even as you practice,
you will make small changes to your basic outline, since the way something
looks on paper and the way it sounds are sometimes different. For
Exploring Public Speaking              117 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

example, long sentences may look intelligent on paper, but they are hard
to say in one breath and hard for the audience to understand. You will also
find it necessary to use more repetition or restatement in oral delivery.

Therefore, although this is the seventh chapter in the book, it deals with
some concepts that we have already been thinking about in Chapters 2-6.
Specifically, this chapter is about supporting materials: what they are,
what they do, and how to use them effectively. But you have already been
thinking about how to support your ideas when you were researching and
crafting a central idea and main points. Supporting material also relates
directly to Chapter 9, presentation aids. Whereas presentation aids are
visual or auditory supporting materials, this chapter will deal with verbal
supporting materials.

Using your supporting materials effectively is essential because we crave
detail and specifics. Let's say you are discussing going out to eat with a
friend. You suggest a certain restaurant, and your friend makes a comment
about the restaurant you have not heard before or don't accept at face
value, so you ask in some way for explanation, clarification, or proof. If
she says, "Their servers are really rude," you might ask, "What did they
do?" If she says, "Their food is delicious," you might ask what dish is good.
Likewise, if she says, "The place is nasty," you will want to know what
their health rating is or why she makes this statement. We want to know
specifics and are not satisfied with vagueness and generalities.

Supporting material can be thought of as the specifics that make your
ideas, arguments, assertions, points, or concepts real and concrete.
Sometimes supporting materials are referred to as the "meat" on the bones
of the outline, but we also like to think of them as pegs you create in the
audience's mind to hang the ideas on. Another even more useful idea is to
think of them as pillars or supports for a bridge (Figure 7.1). Without these
supports, the bridge would just be a piece of concrete that would not hold
up once cars start to cross it. Similarly, the points and arguments you are
making in your speech may not hold up without the material to "support"
what you are saying.

                           Figure 7.1
Exploring Public Speaking  118 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

Of course, as we will see in this chapter, all supporting materials are not
considered equal. Some are better at some functions or for some speeches
than others. In general, there are two basic ways to think about the role of
supporting materials. Either they

     1. clarify, explain, or provide specifics (and therefore understanding)
        for the audience, or

     2. prove and back up arguments and therefore persuade the audience.
        Of course, some can do both.

You might ask, how much supporting material is enough? The time you
are allowed or required to speak will largely determine that. Since the
supporting materials are found in the subpoints of your outline (A, B) and
sub-subpoints (1, 2, etc.), you can see clearly on the outline how much
you have and can omit one if time constraints demand that. However, in
our experience as public speaking instructors, we find that students often
struggle with having enough supporting materials. We often comment
in evaluating a student's speech that we wanted the student to answer
more of the "what, where, who, how, why, when," questions and add more
examples, description, proof, or evidence because their ideas were vague
or unsupported.

Students often struggle with the difference between "main idea" and
"supporting idea." For example, in this list, you will quickly recognize a
commonality.

         Chocolate

         Vanilla

         Strawberry

         Butter Pecan

Of course, they are popular flavors of ice cream. The main idea is
"Popular Flavors of Ice Cream" and the individual flavors are supporting
materials to clarify the main idea; they "hold" it up for understanding and
clarification. If the list were:

         Rocky Road

         Honey Jalapeno Pickle

         Banana Split

         Chocolate

         Wildberry Lavender

you would recognize two or three as ice cream flavors (not as popular)
but #2 and #5 do not seem to fit the list (Covington, 2013). But you still
Exploring Public Speaking  119 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

recognize them as types of something and infer from the list that they have
to do with ice cream flavors. "Ice cream flavors" is the general subject and
the flavors are the particulars.

Those examples were easy. Let's look at this one. One of the words in this
list is the general, and the rest are the particulars.

         Love

         Emotion

         Sadness

         Disgust

         Tolerance

Emotion is general category, and the list here shows specific emotions.
Here is another:

     Spaying helps prevent uterine infections and breast cancer.
     Pets who live in states with high rates of spaying/neutering live

       longer.
     Spaying or neutering your pet is good for its health.
     Spaying lessens the increased urge to roam.
     Male pets who are neutered eliminate their chances of getting

       testicular and prostate cancer.
Which one is the main point (the general idea), and which are the
supporting points that include evidence to prove the main point? You
should see that the third bullet point ("Your pet's health is positively
affected . . .") would be a main point or argument in a persuasive speech
on spaying or neutering your pet. The basic outline for the speech might
look something like this:

    I. Spaying or neutering your pet is good for public health.
    II. Spaying or neutering your pet is good for your pet's health.
    III. Spaying or neutering your pet is good for your family's life and

          budget.
Of course, each of the four supporting points in this example ("helps
uterine cancer in female pets, "etc.) cannot just be made up. The speaker
would need to refer to or cite reliable statistics or testimony from
veterinarians, researchers, public health organizations, and humane
societies. For that reason, here is the more specific support, which you
would use in a speech to be ethical and credible. Notice that the italicized
sections in this example Main Point use statistics and specific details to
support the claims being made and provides sources that are clearly given.

II. Spaying or neutering your pet is good for your pet's health.
              A. Spaying helps prevent uterine infections and breast cancer,
                    which is fatal in about 50 percent of dogs and 90 percent

                                   1. According to Natalie DiBlasio, writing for USA

                                         are neutered or spayed.

                                    2. She goes on to say that other issues affecting pet
                                         longevity have to do with climate, heartworm, and

                                August 2014 article, "Why You Should Spay/Neuter Your
                                Pet," which states that spaying lessens their urge to roam,
                                exposure to fights with other animals, getting struck by
                                cars, and other mishaps.

                           D. Also according to the same article, male pets who are
                                neutered eliminate their chances of getting testicular and

With all the sources available to you through reliable Internet and
published sources, finding information is not difficult. Recognizing the
difference between supporting information and the general idea you
are trying to support or prove is more difficult, as is providing adequate
citation.

Along with clarifying and proving, supporting materials, especially
narrative ones, also make your speech much more interesting and
attention-getting. Later in the chapter we will look at the various "factors
of attention" that are related to supporting material. Ultimately, you

will be perceived as a more credible speaker if you provide clarifying,                     Probative

Essentially, there are seven types of supporting materials: examples,               something; affording
narratives, definitions, descriptions, historical and scientific fact, statistics,  proof or evidence
and testimony. Each provides a different type of support, and you will
want to choose the supporting materials that best help you make the point
you want to get across to your audience.

Examples

This type of supporting material is the first and easiest to use but also
easy to forget. Examples are almost always short but concrete specific
instances to illuminate a concept. They are designed to give audiences a
reference point. If you were describing a type of architecture, you would
obviously show visual aids of it and give verbal descriptions of it, but you
could say, "You pass an example of this type of architecture every time you
go downtown--City Hall." An example must be quickly understandable,
something the audience can pull out of their memory or experience
quickly.

The key to effectively using examples in your speeches is this: what is
an example to you may not be an example to your audience, if they
have a different experience. One of the authors has been teaching four
decades and cannot use the same pop culture examples she used to use
in class. Television shows from twenty years ago are pretty meaningless
to audiences today. Time and age are not the only reasons an example
may not work with the audience. If you are a huge soccer fan speaking to
a group who barely knows soccer, using a well-known soccer player as an
example of perseverance or overcoming discrimination in the sports world
may not communicate. It may only leave the audience members confused.

Additionally, one good, appropriate example is worth several less apt
ones. Keep in mind that in the distinction between supporting materials
that prove, those that clarify, and those that do both, examples are used to
clarify.

Narratives

Earlier in this textbook the "power of story" was mentioned. Narratives,
stories, and anecdotes are useful in speeches to interest the audience and
clarify, dramatize, and emphasize ideas. They have, if done well, strong
emotional power. They can be used in the introduction, the body, and
the conclusion of the speech. They can be short, as anecdotes usually
are. Think of the stories you often see in Readers' Digest, human interest
Exploring Public Speaking  122 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

stories on the local news, or what you might post on Facebook about a
bad experience you had at the DMV. They could be longer, although they
should not comprise large portions of the speech.

Narratives can be personal, literary, historical, or hypothetical. Personal
narratives can be helpful in situations where you desire to:

     Relate to the audience on a human level, especially if they may see
      you as competent but not really similar or connected to them.

     Build your credibility by mentioning your experience with a topic.
Of course, personal narratives must be true. They must also not portray
you as more competent, experienced, brave, intelligent, etc., than you are;
in other words, along with being truthful in using personal narratives, you
should be reasonably humble.

An example of a literary narrative might be one of Aesop's fables, a short
story by O'Henry, or an appropriate tale from another culture. Keep in
mind that because of their power, stories tend to be remembered more
than other parts of the speech. Do you want the story to overshadow
your content? Scenes from films would be another example of a literary
narrative, but as with examples, you must consider the audience's frame of
reference and if they will have seen the film.

Historical narratives (sometimes called documented narratives) have
power because they can also prove an idea as well as clarify one. In
using these, you should treat them as fact and therefore give a citation
as to where you found the historical narrative. By "historical" we do not
mean the story refers to something that happened many years ago, only
that it has happened in the past and there were witnesses to validate its
happening.

If you were trying to argue for the end to the death penalty because it leads
to unjust executions, one good example of a person who was executed and
then found innocent afterward would be both emotional and probative.
Here, be careful of using theatrical movies as your source of historical
narrative. Hollywood likes to change history to make the story they want.
For example, many people think Braveheart is historically accurate, but
it is off on many key points--even the kilts, which were not worn by the
Scots until the 1600s.
Exploring Public Speaking  123 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

Hypothetical narratives are ones that could happen but have not yet.                  Hypothetical
To be effective, they should be based on reality. Here are two examples:                narratives

         Picture this incident: You are standing in line at the grocery          a story of something
         checkout, reading the headlines on the Star and National                that could happen but
         Enquirer for a laugh, checking your phone. Then, the middle-aged        has not happened yet
         man in front of you grabs his shoulder and falls to the ground,
         unconscious. What would you do in a situation like this? While
         it has probably never happened to you, people have medical
         emergencies in public many times a day. Would you know how to
         respond?

         Imagine yourself in this situation. It is 3:00 in the morning. You
         are awakened from a pretty good sleep by a dog barking loudly
         in the neighborhood. You get up and see green lights coming into
         your house from the back yard. You go in the direction of the
         lights and unlock your back door and there, right beside your
         deck, is an alien spaceship. The door opens and visitors from
         another planet come out and invite you in, and for the next hour
         you tour their ship. You can somehow understand them because
         their communication abilities are far advanced. Now, back to
         reality. If you were in a foreign country, you would not be able to
         understand a foreign language unless you had studied it. That is
         why you should learn a foreign language in college.

Obviously, the second is so "off-the-wall" that the audience would be
wondering about the connection, although it definitely does attract
attention. If using a hypothetical narrative, be sure that it is clear that the
Exploring Public Speaking  124 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

                         narrative is hypothetical, not factual. Because of their attention-getting
                         nature, hypothetical narratives are often used in introductions.

                         Definitions

                         When we use the term "definition" here as a supporting material, we are
                         not talking about something you can easily find from the dictionary or
                         from the first thing that comes up on Google, such as shown in Figure 7.2.

                         and/or how you will use it. We know there are denotative and connotative
                         definitions or meanings for words, which we usually think of as objective
                         and subjective responses to words. You only need to define words that
                         would be unfamiliar to the audience or words that you want to use in a
                         specialized way.

                         For example, terms used in specialized fields, often called "jargon," (see
                         Chapter 10) need to be defined and explained. These words may be in
                         medicine, law, the military, technology, or the arts. Some of these words
                         may be in foreign languages, such as Latin (habeas corpus, quid pro quo).

particular issues that are being debated today between progressives and
conservatives." This is a helpful technique and makes sure your audience
understands you, but you would only want to do this for terms that have
confusing or controversial meanings for some.

Although we tend to think of the dictionary definition as the standard, that
is only one way of defining something. The dictionary tends to define with
synonyms, or other words that are close in meaning. Many of us have
had the experience of looking up a word and finding a definition that uses
another word we do not know! Synonyms are one way to define, but there
are some others.

Classification and differentiation

This is a fancy way of saying "X is a type of Y, but it is different from the
other Ys in that . . ." "A bicycle is type of vehicle that has two wheels,
handlebars instead of a steering wheel, and is powered by the feet of the
driver." Obviously you know what a bicycle is and it does not need defining,
so here are some better examples:

         Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a (type of)
         surgical procedure that (how different) involves the placement
         of an adjustable silicone belt around the upper portion of the
         stomach using a laparoscope. The band can be tightened by
         adding saline to fill the band like blowing air into a doughnut-
         shaped balloon. The band is connected to a port that is placed
         under the skin of the abdomen. This port is used to introduce or
         remove saline into the band.

         Gestational diabetes is a (type of) diabetic condition (how
         different) that appears during pregnancy and usually goes away
         after the birth of the baby.

         Social publishing platforms are a (type of) social medium where
         (how different) long and short-form written content can be

feelings or issues     like in real life?" rather than using synonyms to define.
related to the inner
workings of the body   Definition by Contrast or Comparison

                       You can define a term or concept by telling what it is similar to or different
                       from. This method requires the audience to have an understanding of
                       whatever you are using as the point of contrast or comparison. When
                       defining by contrast, you are pointing how a concept or term is distinct
                       from another more familiar one. For example, "pop culture" is defined as
                       different from "high culture" in that, traditionally, popular culture has
                       been associated with people of lower socioeconomic status (i.e. less wealth
                       or education). High culture, on the other hand, is associated with as the
                       "official" culture of the more highly educated within the upper classes.
                       Here, the definition of popular culture is clarified by highlighting the
                       differences between it and high culture.

                       A similar form of definition by contrast is defining by negation, which is
                       stipulating what something is not. This famous quotation from Nelson
                       Mandela is an example: "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear,
                       but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid,
                       but he who conquers that fear." Here, Mandela is helping us draw limits
                       around a concept by saying what it is not.

                       Descriptions

                       The key to description is to think in terms of the five senses: sight (visual;
                       how does the thing look in terms of color, size, shape), hearing (auditory;
                       volume, musical qualities), taste (gustatory; sweet, bitter, salty, sour,
                       gritty, smooth, chewy), smell (olfactory; sweet, rancid, fragrant, aromatic,
                       musky), and feel (tactile; rough, silky, nubby, scratchy). The words
                       kinesthetic (movement of the body) and organic (feelings related to
                       the inner workings of the body) can be added to those senses to describe
                       internal physical feeling, such as straining muscles or pain (kinesthetic)
                       and nausea or the feelings of heightened emotions (organic).

                       Description as a method of support also depends on details, or answering
                       the five questions of what, where, how, who, when. To use description, you
                       must dig deeper into your vocabulary and think concretely. This example
                       shows that progression.
Exploring Public Speaking  127 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas

         Furniture

         A chair

         A recliner

         A La-Z-Boy rocker-recliner

         An old green velvet La-Z-Boy rocker recliner

         An old lime green velvet La-Z-Boy rocker recliner with a
         cigarette burn on the left arm

As you add more description, two things happen. The "camera focus"
becomes clearer, but you also add tone, or attitude. A recliner is one thing,
but who buys a lime green velvet recliner? And someone sat in it, smoked,
and was careless with the cigarette. In this case, the last line is probably
too much description unless you want to paint a picture of a careless
person with odd taste in furniture. That is why description has its limits.

Description is useful as supporting material in terms of describing
processes. This topic was discussed in Chapter 6 in chronological patterns
of organization. Describing processes requires detail and not taking for
granted what the audience already knows. Some instructors use the
"peanut butter sandwich" example to make this point: How would you
describe making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to someone who had
never seen a sandwich, peanut butter, or jelly? You would need to put
yourself in their shoes to describe the process and not assume they know
that the peanut butter and jelly go on the inside, facing surfaces of the
bread, and that two pieces of bread are involved.
Exploring Public Speaking  128 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

Historic and Scientific Fact

This type of supporting material is useful for clarification but is especially
useful for proving a point. President John Adams is quoted as saying,
"Facts are stubborn things," but that does not mean everyone accepts
every fact as a fact, or that everyone is capable of distinguishing a fact
from an opinion. A fact is defined by the Urban Dictionary as "The place
most people in the world tend to think their opinions reside." This is a
humorous definition, but often true about how we approach facts. The
meaning of "fact" is complicated by the context in which it is being used.
The National Center for Science Education (2008) defines fact this way:

         In science, an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and
         for all practical purposes is accepted as `true.' Truth in science,
         however, is never final and what is accepted as a fact today may
         be modified or even discarded tomorrow.

Another source explains fact this way:

         [Fact is] a truth known by actual experience or observation. The
         hardness of iron, the number of ribs in a squirrel's body, the
         existence of fossil trilobites, and the like are all facts. Is it a fact
         that electrons orbit around atomic nuclei? Is it a fact that Brutus
         stabbed Julius Caesar? Is it a fact that the sun will rise tomorrow?
         None of us has observed any of these things - the first is an
         inference from a variety of different observations, the second is
         reported by Plutarch and other historians who lived close enough
         in time and space to the event that we trust their report, and
         the third is an inductive inference after repeated observations.
         ("Scientific Thought," n.d.)

Without getting into a philosophical dissertation on the meaning of
truth, for our purposes facts are pieces of information with established
"backup." You can cite who discovered the fact and how other authorities
have supported it. Some facts are so common that most people don't know
where they started--who actually discovered that the water molecule
is two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen (H2O)? But we could find
out if we wanted to (it was, by the way, the 18th century chemist Henry
Cavendish). In using scientific and historical fact in your speech, do not
take citation for granted. If it is a fact worth saying and a fact new to the
audience, assume you should cite the source of the fact.

Also, the difference between historical narrative (mentioned above) and
historical fact has to do with length. An historical fact might just be a
date, place, or action, such as "President Ronald Reagan was shot by John
Hinckley on March 30, 1981, in front of Washington, D.C., Hilton Hotel."
An historical narrative would go into much more detail and add dramatic

Secret Service agents.

people, much less regression analysis, two-tailed T-tests, and margin of

understanding of them.                                                          the number that is

Mean is the same as mathematical average, something you learned to do           occurring within a
early in math classes: add up the figures in a list and divide by the number    given set of numbers
of figures. Related to mean is the concept of standard deviation, which is
the average amount each figure is different from (higher or lower) than the
average or mean. Standard deviation is harder to figure (and usually done
by computer!) but it does let you know if a group is more similar than alike.
If the average on a test in a class is 76, but the standard deviation is 20,
that tells you students tended to do really well (96) or really poorly (56) on
it (we're simplifying here, but you see the point).

The median, however, is the middle number in a distribution. If all
salaries of players in Major League Baseball were listed from highest to
lowest, the one in the exact middle of the list would be the median. You
can tell from this that it probably will not be the same as the average,
and it rarely is; however, the terms "median" and "mean" are often
interchanged carelessly. Mode is the name for the most frequently
occurring number in the list. As an example, Figure 7.3 is a list of grades
from highest to lowest that students might make on a midterm in a class.
The placement of mean, median, and mode are noted.

Percentages have to do with ratios. There are many other terms you
would be introduced to in a statistics class, but the point remains: be
careful of using a statistic that sounds impressive unless you know what it
represents. There is an old saying about "figures don't lie but liars figure"
Exploring Public Speaking  130 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

and another, "There are liars, damn liars, and statisticians." These sayings
are exaggerations but they point out that we are inundated with statistical
information and often do not know how to process it. Another thing to
watch when using numerical facts is to be careful with your billions and
your millions. There is a big difference. If you say that 43 billion people
in the US are without adequate health care (instead of 43 million), you
will probably confuse your audience, since the population of the planet is
around 7.7 billion!

In using statistics, you are probably going to use them as proof more than
as explanation. Statistics are considered a strong form of proof. Here are
some guidelines for using them effectively in a presentation.

                           Figure 7.3 - Mean, Mode, Median
Exploring Public Speaking  131 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

1. Use statistics as support, not as a main point. The audience may
   cringe or tune you out for saying, "Now I'd like to give you some
   statistics about the problem of gangs in our part of the state." That
   sounds as exciting as reading the telephone book! Use the statistics
   to support an argument. "Gang activity is increasing in our region.
   For example, it is increasing in the three major cities. Mainsville
   had 450 arrests for gang activity this year alone, up 20% from all
   of last year." This example ties the numerical fact (450 arrests) and
   the statistical comparison (up 20%) to an argument. The goal is to
   weave or blend the statistics seamlessly into the speech, not have
   them stand alone as a section of the speech.

2. Always provide the source of the statistic. In the previous example,
   it should read, "According to a report published on the Georgia
   Bureau of Investigation's website, Mainsville had 450 arrests . .
   ." There are a number of "urban myth" statistics floating around
   that probably have a basis in some research done at some point in
   time, but that research was outlived by the statistic. An audience
   would have reason to be skeptical if you cannot provide the name
   of the researcher or organization that backs up the statistics and
   numerical data. By the way, it is common for speakers and writers
   to say "According to research" or "According to studies." This tag
   is essentially meaningless and actually a logical fallacy. Give a real
   source to support your argument.

3. In regard to sources, depend on the reliable ones. Table 7.1,
   originally published in Wrench, Goding, Johnson, and Attias (2011),
   lists valid websites providing statistical information.

4. Do not overuse statistics. While there is no hard and fast rule on
   how many to use, there are other good supporting materials and you
   would not want to depend on statistics alone. You want to choose
   the statistics and numerical data that will strengthen your argument
   the most and drive your point home. Statistics can have emotional
   power as well as probative value if used sparingly.

5. Use graphs to display the most important statistics. If you are using
   presentation software such as PowerPoint, you can create your
   own basic pie, line, or bar graphs, or you can borrow one and put
   a correct citation on the slide. However, you do not need to make
   a graph for every single statistic. More information on these types
   of visual aids and what type of information they convey best can be
   found in Chapter 9.

6. Explain your statistics as needed, but do not make your speech a
   statistics lesson. Explain the context of the statistics. If you say, "My
   blog has 500 subscribers" to a group of people who know little about
   blogs, that might sound impressive, but is it? You can also provide
Exploring Public Speaking  132 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

                              a story of an individual, and then tie the individual into the statistic.
                              After telling a story of the daily struggles of a young mother with
                              multiple sclerosis, you could follow up with "This is just one story in
                              the 400,000 people who suffer from MS in the United States today,
                              according to National MS Society."

                           7. If you do your own survey or research and use numerical data
                              from it, explain your methodology. "In order to understand the
                              attitudes of freshmen at our college about the subject of open source
                              textbooks, I polled 150 first-year students, only three of whom were
                              close friends, asking them this question: `Do you agree that our
                              college should encourage the faculty to use open source textbooks?'
                              Seventy-five percent of them indicated that they agreed with the
                              statement."

                           8. It goes without saying that you will use the statistic ethically, that
                              there will be no distortion of what the statistic means. However, it
                              is acceptable and a good idea to round up numerical data to avoid
                              overwhelming the audience. Earlier we used the example of the U.S.
                              census, stating the population in 2010 was 308.7 million. That is
                              a rounded figure. The actual number was 308,745,538, but saying
                             "almost 309 million" or "308.7 million" will serve your purposes and
                              not be unethical.

                                                 Table 7.1 - Statistics-Oriented Websites

                           9. Additionally, do not make statistics mean what they do not mean.
                              Otherwise, you would be pushing the boundaries on ethics. In the
                              example about your survey of students, if you were to say, "75%
                              of college freshmen support . . . ." That is not what the research
                              said. Seventy-five percent of the students you surveyed indicated
                              agreement, but since your study did not meet scientific standards
                              regarding size of sample and how you found the sample, you can
Exploring Public Speaking  133 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

        only use the information in relation to students in your college, not          Testimony
        the whole country. One of the authors had a statistics professor        the words of others
        who often liked to say, "Numbers will tell you whatever you want        used as proof or
        if you torture them long enough," meaning you can always twist or       evidence
        manipulate statistics to meet your goals.
                                                                                          Expert
    10. An effective technique with numerical data is to use physical           someone with
        comparisons. "The National Debt is 17 trillion dollars. What does       recognized credentials,
        that mean? It means that every American citizen owes $55,100."          knowledge, education,
       "It means that if the money were stacked as hundred dollar bills,        and/or experience in a
        it would go to . . ." Or another example, "There are 29 million         subject
       Americans with diabetes. That is 9.3%. In terms closer to home, of
        the 32 people in this classroom, 3 of us would have diabetes." Of
        course, in this last example, the class may not be made up of those in
        risk groups for diabetes, so you would not want to say, "Three of us
        have diabetes." It is only a comparison for the audience to grasp the
        significance of the topic.

    11. Finally, because statistics can be confusing, slow down when you
        say them, give more emphasis, gesture--small ways of helping the
        audience grasp them.

Testimony

Testimony is the words of others. You might think of them as quoted
material. Obviously, all quoted material or testimony is not the same.
Some quotations you just use because they are funny, compelling, or
attention-getting. They work well as openings to introductions. Other
types of testimony are more useful for proving your arguments. Testimony
can also give an audience insight into the feelings or perceptions of others.
Testimony is basically divided into two categories: expert and peer.

Expert Testimony

What is an expert? Here is a quotation of the humorous kind: An expert
is "one who knows more and more about less and less" (Nicholas Butler).
Actually, an expert for our purposes is someone with recognized
credentials, knowledge, education, and/or experience in a subject. Experts
spend time studying the facts and putting the facts together. They may
not be scholars who publish original research but they have in-depth
knowledge. They may have certain levels of education, or they have real-
world experience in the topic.

For example, one of the authors is attending a quilt show this week to talk
to experts in quilting. This expertise was gained through years of making,
preserving, reading about, and showing quilts, even if they never took
Quilting 101 in college. To quote an expert on expertise, "To be an expert,
someone needs to have considerable knowledge on a topic or considerable
Exploring Public Speaking  134 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

Peer testimony          skill in accomplishing something" (Weinstein, 1993). In using expert
                        testimony, you should follow these guidelines:
any quotation from a
friend, family member,       Use the expert's testimony in his or her relevant field, not outside of
or classmate about an          it. A person may have a Nobel Prize in economics, but that does not
incident or topic              make them an expert in biology.

                             Provide at least some of the expert's relevant credentials.
                             Choose experts to quote whom your audience will respect and/or

                               whose name or affiliations they will recognize as credible.
                             Make it clear that you are quoting the expert testimony verbatim

                               or paraphrasing it. If verbatim, say "Quote . . . end of quote" (not
                               unquote--you cannot unquote someone).
                             If you interviewed the expert yourself, make that clear in the speech
                               also. "When I spoke with Dr. Mary Thompson, principal of Park Lake
                               High School, on October 12, she informed me that . . ."
                        Expert testimony is one of your strongest supporting materials to prove
                        your arguments, but in a sense, by clearly citing the source's credentials,
                        you are arguing that your source is truly an expert (if the audience is
                        unfamiliar with him or her) in order to validate his or her information.

                        Peer Testimony

                        Any quotation from a friend, family member, or classmate about an
                        incident or topic would be peer testimony. It is useful in helping the
                        audience understand a topic from a personal point of view. For example,
                        in the spring of 2011, a devastating tornado came through the town where
                        one of the authors and many of their students live. One of those students
                        gave a dramatic personal experience speech in class about surviving
                        the tornado in a building that was destroyed and literally disappeared.
                        They survived because she and her coworkers at their chain restaurant
                        were able to get to safety in the freezer. While she may not have had an
                        advanced degree in a field related to tornadoes or the destruction they can
                        cause, this student certainly had a good deal of knowledge about surviving
                        a tornado. However, do not present just any testimony of a peer or friend
                        as if it were expert or credentialed.

                        7.3 - Attention Factors and Supporting

                        Material

                        In Chapter 2, we discussed how public speaking as an oral form of
                        communication is different from written forms of communication.
                        Therefore, as a speaker, you must work to maintain the attention of your
                        audience. In this section, we will look more deeply at attention and how
                        you can use supporting materials to keep the audience's attention in
                        addition to the important functions of clarifying and proving ideas.
Exploring Public Speaking  135 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

What is Attention?                                                                   Perception
                                                                              how people organize
Attention and perception are closely tied concepts, but they are not exactly  and interpret the
the same. If you have taken an introduction to psychology course, one         patterns of stimuli
of the earliest chapters in the textbook was probably about perception,       around them
since our perceptual processes are so foundational to how we think and
process. Perception deals primarily with how we organize and interpret                Attention
the patterns of stimuli around us. The key words in this definition are       focus on one stimulus
patterns, organize, and interpret. The brain does the work of taking          while ignoring or
thousands of stimuli around us and making sense of them. Sensation is         suppressing reactions
taking in the stimuli in the physical realm; perception is doing something    to other stimuli
with it psychologically. Perception is obviously influenced by memory,
experiences, past learning, etc. If you taste a desert, the scent and taste
are physically going to your brain, and thus you are sensing it. But if you
say, "This tastes like my mother's recipe for this desert," then you are
perceiving.

Attention, on the other hand, is focused perception. Attention is defined
as focus on one stimulus while ignoring or suppressing reactions to other
stimuli. It has been referred to as the "allocation of limited processing
resources" (Anderson, 2005, p. 519). Although we think we can multitask
and pay attention to three things at a time, we cannot.

The diagram in Figure 7.4 might help show why multitasking is a problem
rather than a benefit. In the figure, two balls from the upper chutes (which
represent the two sources of stimuli, such as two auditory messages) are
trying to enter the central chute at the same time. For a practical example
that you can probably relate to, let's say these balls represent watching TV
and playing a game on your phone at the same time. Only one ball can go
through the single chute at a time, which is representative of your focus
(the ideas or tasks you can actually think about at a given moment). The
"balls" or stimuli must take turns, therefore making your attention shift
back and forth, affecting your ability to do one task versus the other.

When you try to pay attention to two things at once, you are going to let
the information in but have to switch back and forth on the pathways,
making your attention (listening, reading, processing) less efficient. This
means that in our example above, you're either going to miss something
that is being said on TV or you're going to not play the game very well
because you can't divide your focus between the two activities. Multitudes
of studies have been done on how inefficient multitasking behavior is,
especially for students (Weimer, 2012).

When you pay attention, you focus and other stimuli become muted
or nonexistent in your mind for that amount of time. We have all had
experiences when we so focused on a stimulus--it could be a concert, a
movie, a roller coaster ride--that we almost "wake up" to the rest of the
world when it is over.
Exploring Public Speaking  136 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

                              Figure 7.4 - How Attention Works

Why Do We Pay Attention?

Perception is not something we have a good deal of control over, but we
do have more say in attention. There are basically five reasons we pay
attention to what we do when confronted with lots of competing stimuli.

    1. We choose to focus on one thing over another. Plain and simple,
       we grit our teeth and pay attention, such as when we are making
        ourselves study difficult material for a test. While this is a behavior
       we accept as adults, as public speakers we should not expect the
        audience to do all the work of paying attention just because they feel
        a duty to do so; they probably will not. We should attempt to meet
        the audience half way by using our understanding of attention. We
        should use various techniques in our speech to help the audience pay
        attention.

    2. Expectations. If a speaker started a lecture with "In this presentation
       I am going to say the word `serendipity,' and when I do, the first
        person who jumps up and says `gotcha' will get this $100 bill." The
        audience is expecting to hear something and tuning in for it. Of
        course, this is an extreme example (and we don't recommend it!) but
       when a speaker gives an introduction that sets up for the audience
       what to expect from the context, attention can be enhanced.

    3. Need states. Have you ever noticed that the hamburgers on the fast
        food commercials look juicier and more delicious when you are
        hungry? When we are in a need state, we will be focused on those
        items that meet the need. When your instructor begins discussing
        in class what you can expect on the next exam, you probably perk
Exploring Public Speaking  137 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

        up a bit, since this is information students generally need to know
        in order to do well in the class. Because that information meets a
        personal need, they will be more receptive to and focused on it.

    4. Past training and experiences. You will notice what you have
        been taught or trained, either directly or indirectly, to focus on.
        Sometimes you will not even be aware that you are doing so. For
        example, if you have a background in rodeo competition, you will
        see aspects and details in a rodeo scene in a movie that someone else
        would just take for granted.

    5. All of these reasons for paying attention are relevant to the public
        speaker, but the last one is most directly usable and related to
        supporting material. There are certain qualities or characteristics
        of stimuli that naturally attract our attention. These have been
        termed the "factors of attention." If a public speaker puts these
        traits into the speech and presentation aids, the audience's ability
        to pay attention will be bolstered. These characteristics, listed
        below, are generally ways to "perk up" you audience's ears and gain
        their attention, at least temporarily. Our attention can wane rather
        quickly and a speaker must work to keep the audience engaged.
        Incorporating attention factors can help.

Attention Factors

The list of factors that can help you get or maintain attention during your
speech is rather long, and a speaker cannot, of course, use all of them in
one speech, but they are useful tools in certain speech situations. As you
progress as a public speaker, you can use them in an "impromptu" fashion
if you think the audience needs an attention boost, or you can plan to use
them in strategic places.

The first factor in getting or maintaining attention is movement. A moving
object will gain more attention than a stationary one. Movement is one of
the factors of attention you can use in different ways. You can use stories
that have movement in plot. You can use physical movement in your
delivery, even stepping from point to point. Transitions give a sense of
movement to a speech, as well as not dwelling on one idea too long. The
animation of words and graphics in PowerPoint or other slide presentation
software is another use of animation.

At the same time, because animation and movement attract attention
and therefore distract attention, it should be used strategically and
intentionally (for a good purpose). For example, little animated figures on
the slides or your own pacing back and forth and repetitive gestures are
movements you would want to avoid because they are not purposeful and
they draw the audience's attention away from your message.
Exploring Public Speaking  138 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

The second factor of attention is conflict. Showing ideas, groups, teams,
etc. that are in conflict draws attention. Stories can also utilize conflict.

The third factor of attention is novelty. Your ideas and the way you
approach them should be fresh and new to the audience. When we get to
persuasion in Chapter 13, we will also see that evidence used to persuade
an audience should be new to them.

The fourth factor of attention is humor. Humor is usually not the focus of
your speech, especially in a class situation, but well-placed and intentional
humor can be helpful to maintain attention of your audience. It should be
appropriate to the topic and well-practiced. It is probably a good idea to
"road test" your humor to be sure it is funny to other people. We all have
our own sense of what is funny and have experienced those times when
friends or family don't seem to "get" what we find funny. If you want to
tell a joke, be sure to tell it, not read it, and practice the delivery well. See
Appendix D for more information on humor in public speaking.

The fifth factor of attention is familiarity. As mentioned already,
supporting materials should be immediately accessible and draw from
your audience's experience so they can understand quickly in an oral
communication setting. Familiarity is attractive because it is comfortable.
Familiarity may seem in conflict with novelty, and in a sense they show
both sides of how our minds work. We like new things (such as the most
recent design of a sports car) but we also like comfortable, familiar things
(such as our favorite movie we have seen ten times already). They function
differently in a speech. Familiarity works better to explain a new concept;
novelty works better to pique an audience's interest.

The sixth factor is contrast. This one is particularly useful to a speaker
in creating visual aids so that key words stand out, for example, on
presentation slides. Contrast also applies to the variety in your voice
(avoiding what we would call monotone or monorate).
Exploring Public Speaking  139 Chapter 7: Supporting Your Speech Ideas
Version 4.2

The seventh factor of attention is repetition. We have already seen how
key repetitions at points in the speech can remind the audience of your
structure and main ideas.

Suspense is the eighth factor of attention. Although not as useful in public
speaking as some of the factors, suspense can be useful in an introduction.
You can use a series of questions asking the audience to guess your topic;
however, this is a risky approach if you disappoint your audience when
the "real" topic is not what they are guessing. You can also tell a story in
the introduction and say you will give the outcome of the story at the end
of the speech, or pose a question and promise that by the end of the speech
they will know the answer. However, always be sure to deliver on the
promise!

The ninth factor is proximity, which refers to physical closeness. While
not applicable to supporting materials, proximity does relate to public
speaking delivery. The more physical distance between the audience
members and the speaker and the audience, the harder it will be for the
audience to remain attentive. If you know that only 20 people are going
to attend a presentation, it is best to have it in a 20-seat room, not an
auditorium that seats 100. The audience members will spread out and feel
detached from each other, and it will be harder for you be or to feel close
to them.

The tenth factor of attention is need-oriented subjects. We pay attention
to what meets our needs. For example, when you are hungry, you probably
notice fast food advertisements more on television (which advertisers
recognize and use against us). If you are shopping for a car, you will be
more aware of car advertisements.

The eleventh factor is intensity, which is also useful in the delivery aspect
of public speaking. Raising your voice somewhat at key times and slowing
down are useful for attention.

The last attention factor is concreteness, which in a sense describes all of
them. All of the factors and types of supporting materials are tied to real
or concrete experience. The more a speaker can attach the speech to real
experience, either her own or preferably the audience's, the more effective
she will be.

Conclusion

It is hard to imagine an effective speech without a variety of supporting
materials. Think of it like cooking a flavorful cuisine--there will be
a mixture of spices and tastes, not just one. Statistics, narratives and
examples, testimony, definitions, descriptions, and facts all clarify your
concepts for the audience, and statistics, testimony, facts, and historical
examples also support logical arguments. In the process of composing
your speech, be sure to provide sources and use varied and interesting
language to express the support your speech ideas require and deserve.

Something to Think About

One type of supporting material that is commonly used but was not
fully discussed in this chapter is quotations such as "The only limits to
our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today" (Franklin D.
Roosevelt). You can go to websites to find quotable quotes on various
topics. What category (testimony, narratives, statistics, examples) would
quotations such as this fall into? Would they be for proof or explanation?
When would they be useful? What could be some downsides to using
them? (Some of these answers are discussed in Chapter 8.)

Watch a TV show and do not change the channel when the commercials
come on. What factors of attention do the advertisers use to get you to
attend to the commercial? Hint: Don't say music-that's not a factor of
attention. What is it about the music that gets your attention, such as
intensity or familiarity?

Case Study

Terrence is planning a speech for his fraternity on the next charity
fundraiser. He wants to advocate that they support Habitat for Humanity
with an open mic talent show on campus. What supporting materials
might Terrence use?

8.1 - General Guidelines for Introductions and

Conclusions

Can you imagine how strange a speech would sound without an
introduction? Or how jarring it would be if, after making a point, a speaker
just walked away from the lectern and sat down? You would most likely be
pretty confused, and the takeaway from that speech--even if the content
was really good--would likely be, "I was confused" or "That was a weird
speech."

This is just one of the reasons all speeches need introductions and
conclusions. Introductions and conclusions serve to frame the speech
and give it a clearly defined beginning and end. They help the audience to
see what is to come in the speech, and then let them mentally prepare for
the end. In doing this, introductions and conclusions provide a "preview/
review" of your speech as a means to reiterate or re-emphasize to your
audience what you are talking about.

If you remember back to Chapter 2, we talked about "planned redundancy"
as a strategy for aiding retention and understanding of your purpose and
supporting speech ideas. Since speeches are auditory and live, you need
to make sure the audience remembers what you are saying. So one of
the primary functions of an introduction is to preview what you will be
covering in your speech, and one of the main roles of the conclusion is to
review what you have covered. It may seem like you are repeating yourself
and saying the same things over and over, but that repetition ensures that
your audience understands and retains what you are saying.

The challenge, however, is that there is much more that a speaker must
do in the introduction and conclusion than just preview or review the
topic and main points. The roles that introductions and conclusions
fulfill are numerous, and, when done correctly, can make your speech
stronger. However, the introduction and conclusion are not the main parts
of the speech; that is the body section where the bulk of your research
and information will be housed. So to that end, the introduction and
conclusion need to be relatively short and to the point.

The general rule is that the introduction and conclusion should each be
about 10% of your total speech, leaving 80% for the body section. You
can extend the introduction to 15% if there is good reason to, so 10-15%
of the speech time is a good guideline for the introduction Let's say that
your informative speech has a time limit of 5-7 minutes: if we average
that out to 6 minutes that gives us 360 seconds. Ten to fifteen percent of
360 is 36-54, meaning your full introduction--which includes the thesis
and preview--should come in at about a minute. That isn't to say that
your speech instructor will be timing you and penalize you for hitting
the 60 second mark, but rather to highlight the fact that you need to be
Exploring Public Speaking  143 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

economical with your time. An introduction or conclusion of a 6-minute
speech that lasts 90 seconds is taking up 25% or your speech, leaving
much less time for the body.

Consequently, there are some common errors to avoid in introductions:

     rambling and meandering, not getting to the point;
     speaking to become comfortable;
     saying the specific purpose statement, especially as first words;
     choosing a technique that hurts credibility, such as pedantic (defining

       words like "love") or a method that is not audience-centered;
     beginning to talk as you approach the platform or lectern; instead, it

       is preferable to reach your destination, pause, smile, and then begin;
     reading your introduction from your notes; instead, it is vital to

       establish eye contact in the introduction, so knowing it very well is
       important;
     inappropriate or irrelevant humor or references;
     talking too fast; instead, let your audience get used to your voice by
       speaking emphatically and clearly.
Your instructor will probably caution you about the default introduction
beginning speakers are so apt to use: "My name is . . . and my speech is
about . . ." This does not get attention, nor is it artful; if you have slides,
that information is on the title slide; and it is what your brain does when
you let your nerves take over.

As we have mentioned before, it is best to write your introduction after
you have a clear sense of the body of your presentation. The challenge
to introductions is that there is a lot you need to get done in that 10%-
15%, and all of it is vital to establishing yourself as a knowledgeable and
credible speaker.

In terms of the conclusions, be careful NOT to:

     signal the end multiple times. In other words, no "multiple
       conclusions" or saying "As I close" more than once;

     rambling; if you signal the end, finish;
     talking as you leave the platform or lectern
     indicating with facial expression or body language that you were not

       happy with the speech.
In the following sections, we will discuss specifically what you should
include in the introduction and conclusion, and offer a number of options
for accomplishing each.

8.2 - Structuring the Introduction

A common concern many students have as the date of their first major
speech approaches is "I don't know how I should start my speech." What
they are really saying is they aren't sure what words will be memorable,
Exploring Public Speaking  144 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

                         attention-capturing, and clever enough to get their audience interested or,
                         on a more basic level, sound good. This is a problem most speakers have,
                         since the first words you say, in many ways, set the tone for the rest of your
                         speech. There may not be any one "best" way to start a speech, but we can
                         provide some helpful guidelines that will make starting a speech much
                         easier.

                         With that in mind, there are five basic elements that you will want to
                         incorporate into your introduction. And while you have some leeway to
                         structure your introduction in a way that best fits with your speech and
                         you wouldn't necessarily always do all of these in the order below, the
                         following order of these five elements is fairly standard. Unless you have a
                         specific reason to do otherwise, it is probably a pretty good order for you
                         to use.

   Attention getter      Element 1: Get the Audience's Attention

the statement or         The first major purpose of an introduction is to gain your audience's
question that piques     attention and make them interested in what you have to say. While many
the audience's interest  audiences may be polite and not talk while you're speaking, actually
in what you have to say  getting them to listen to what you are saying is a completely different
at the very beginning    challenge. Let's face it--we've all tuned someone out at some point
of a speech              because we weren't interested in what they had to say. If you do not get the
                         audience's attention at the outset, it will only become more difficult to do
                         so as you continue speaking.

                         That's why every speech should start with an attention getter, or some
                         sort of statement or question that piques the audience's interest in what
                         you have to say at the very start of a speech. Sometime these are called
                         "grabbers." The first words out of your mouth should be something that
                         will perk up the audience's ears. Starting a speech with "Hey everybody.
                         I'm going to talk to you today about soccer" already sounds boring and
                         has not tried to engage the individuals in the audience who don't care
                         about soccer. Once your audience has deemed your speech to be boring,
                         trying to inform, persuade, or entertain them becomes exponentially more
                         difficult. So let's briefly discuss what you can do to capture your audience's
                         attention from the onset.

                         First, when selecting an attention-getting device, you want to make sure
                         that the option you choose is actually appropriate and relevant to your
                         specific audience. Different audiences will have different backgrounds
                         and knowledge, so you should use your audience analysis to determine
                         whether specific information you plan on using would be appropriate for a
                         specific audience. For example, if you're giving a speech on the importance
                         of family units to a group of individuals over the age of sixty-five, starting
                         your speech with a reference to the television show Stranger Things may
                         not be the best idea because the audience may be unfamiliar with that
                         show.
Exploring Public Speaking  145 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

You will also want to choose an attention-getting device appropriate for               Anecdote
your speech topic. Ideally, your attention-getting device should have a
relevant connection to your speech. Imagine if a speaker pulled condoms        a brief account or story
out of his pocket, yelled "Free sex!" and threw the condoms at the             of an interesting or
audience in the beginning of a speech about the economy. While this may        humorous event
clearly get the audience's attention, this isn't really a good way to prepare
an audience for a speech about the stock market, or really much else. To
help you out, below we have listed a number of different attention getters
that you may find useful for opening your speech.

Anecdotes and Narratives

An anecdote is a brief account or story of an interesting or humorous
event. Notice the emphasis here is on the word "brief." A common mistake
speakers make when telling an anecdote is to make the anecdote too long.
An example of an anecdote used in a speech about the pervasiveness of
technology might look something like this:

         In July 2009, a high school student named Miranda Becker was
         walking along a main boulevard near her home on Staten Island,
         New York, typing in a message on her cell phone. Not paying
         attention to the world around her, she took a step and fell right
         into an open manhole.

Notice that the anecdote is short and has a clear point. From here the
speaker can begin to make his or her point about how technology is
controlling our lives.

A second type of anecdote is a parable or fable. A parable or fable is an
allegorical anecdote designed to teach general life lessons. The most widely
known parables for most Americans are those in the Bible, and the best-
known fables are Aesop's Fables (http://www.umass.edu/aesop/index.
php). So if you decide your speech will focus on the benefits of remaining
in college for more than four years in order to do an internship, a co-op,
or to take time with your learning, you may want to adapt some version of
"The Tortoise and The Hare" as your attention getter.

It is sometimes helpful to begin your speech in a way that your audience
finds familiar, since this can make them feel more connected to your
speech. This may be particularly helpful for topics with which your
audience is unfamiliar. One of the best and easiest ways to do this is
to begin with a story that your audience is likely to have heard before.
These types of stories come in a number of forms, but the most common
ones include fables, tall tales, ghost stories, parables, fairy tales, myths,
and legends. Again, let us emphasize that any type of narrative used in
a speech introduction or in the speech as a whole should not go on so
long as to dominate the speech, and should have direct relevance to the
purpose, subject, and audience.
Exploring Public Speaking  146 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

A personal story is another option here. You may consider starting your
speech with a story about yourself that is relevant to your topic. Some
of the best speeches are ones that come from personal knowledge and
experience. If you are an expert or have firsthand experience related to
your topic, sharing this information with the audience is a great way to
show that you are credible during your attention getter. For example,
someone who had experienced gastric bypass surgery and wanted to give
an informative speech about the procedure could introduce the speech this
way:

         In the fall of 2015, I decided that it was time that I took my life into
         my own hands. After suffering for years with the disease of obesity,
         I decided to take a leap of faith and get a gastric bypass in an
         attempt to finally beat the disease.

If you use a personal example, don't get carried away with the focus
on yourself and your own life. Your speech topic is the purpose of the
attention getter, not the other way around. Another pitfall in using a
personal example is that it may be too personal for you to maintain your
composure. For example, a student once started a speech about her
grandmother by stating, "My grandmother died of cancer at 3:30 this
morning." The student then proceeded to burst into uncontrollable tears.
While this is an extreme example, we strongly recommend that you avoid
any material that could get you upset during a classroom speech.

Startling Statement/Statistic/Fact

Another way to start your speech is to surprise your audience with startling
information about your topic. Often, startling statements come in the form
of statistics and strange facts. The goal of a good startling statistic is that it
surprises the audience and gets them engaged in your topic. For example,
if you're giving a speech about oil conservation, you could start by saying,
"A Boeing 747 airliner holds 57,285 gallons of fuel." You could start a
speech on the psychology of dreams by noting, "The average person has
over 1,460 dreams a year."

A strange fact, on the other hand, is a statement that does not involve
numbers but is equally surprising to most audiences. For example, you
could start a speech on the gambling industry by saying, "There are
no clocks in any casinos in Las Vegas." You could start a speech on the
Harlem Globetrotters by saying, "In 2000, Pope John Paul II became the
most famous honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters." All four of
these examples came from a great website for strange facts (http://www.
strangefacts.com).

Although startling statements are fun, it is important to use them ethically.
First, make sure that your startling statement is factual. The Internet is
full of startling statements and claims that are simply not factual, so when
Exploring Public Speaking  147 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

you find a statement you'd like to use, you have an ethical duty to ascertain
its truth before you use it and to provide a reliable citation. Second, make
sure that your startling statement is relevant to your speech and not just
thrown in for shock value. We've all heard startling claims made in the
media that are clearly made for purposes of shock or fear mongering, such
as "Do you know what common household appliance could kill you? Film
at 11:00." As speakers, we have an ethical obligation to avoid playing on
people's emotions in this way.

A Rhetorical Question

A rhetorical question is a question to which no actual reply is expected.
For example, a speaker talking about the history of Mother's Day could
start by asking the audience, "Do you remember the last time you told
your mom you loved her?" In this case, the speaker does not expect the
audience to shout out an answer, but rather to think about the question as
the speech goes on.

                                                                                      Rhetorical
                                                                                       Question

                                                                               A question to which no
                                                                               actual reply is expected

Immediate Reference to Subject

The most direct (but probably the least interesting of the possible attention
getters) is to tell your audience the subject of your speech. Here's an
example:

        We are surrounded by statistical information in today's world, so
         understanding statistics is becoming paramount to citizenship in
         the twenty-first century.
Exploring Public Speaking  148 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

This sentence explicitly tells an audience that the speech they are about to
hear is about the importance of understanding statistics. While this isn't
the most entertaining or interesting attention getter, it is very clear and
direct. And note that it justifies the importance of the audience paying
attention while avoiding being completely snooze-inducing, as it would
have been if it were reworded as, "I want to talk to you about statistics."

Reference to Audience or Appeal to Self-Interest

As we have tried to emphasize throughout this book, your audience is the
single most important factor is crafting your speech, so it makes sense
that one approach to opening your speech is to make a direct reference
to the audience. In this case, the speaker has a clear understanding of
the audience and points out that there is something unique about the
audience that should make them interested in the speech's content. Here's
an example:

         As students at State College, you and I know the importance of
         selecting a major that will benefit us in the future. In today's
         competitive world, we need to study a topic that will help us be
         desirable to employers and provide us with lucrative and fulfilling
         careers. That's why I would like all of you to consider majoring in
         communication.

In this example, the speaker reminds the audience of their shared status
as students and uses the common ground to acknowledge the importance
of selecting a major that will benefit them in the future. Earlier in the
textbook (Chapter 4) we used the expression WIIFM ("What's in it for
me?") to remind you that your topic and approach should appeal to the
self-interests and needs of the audience members.

Quotation

Another way to capture your listeners' attention is to use the words of
another person that relate directly to your topic. Maybe you've found
a really great quotation in one of the articles or books you read while
researching your speech. If not, you can also use a number of Internet
or library sources that compile useful quotations from noted individuals.
Quotations are a great way to start a speech, so let's look at an example
that could be used during the opening of a commencement address (a type
of special occasion speech discussed later in Chapter 15):

         The late actress, fashion icon, and social activist Audrey Hepburn
         once noted that, "Nothing is impossible. The word itself says `I'm
         possible'!"

If you use a quotation as your attention getter, be sure to give the source
first (as in this example) so that it isn't mistaken as your own wording.
Exploring Public Speaking  149 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

Reference to Current Events

Referring to a current news event that relates to your topic is often an
effective way to capture attention, as it immediately makes the audience
aware of how relevant the topic is in today's world. For example, consider
this attention getter for a persuasive speech on frivolous lawsuits:

         On January 10 of this year, Scott Anthony Gomez, Jr., and a
         fellow inmate escaped from a Pueblo, Colorado, jail. During their
         escape the duo attempted to rappel from the roof of the jail using
         a makeshift ladder of bed sheets. During Gomez's attempt to scale
         the building, he slipped, fell forty feet, and injured his back. After
         being quickly apprehended, Gomez filed a lawsuit against the jail
         for making it too easy for him to escape.

In this case, the speaker is highlighting a news event that illustrates what a
frivolous lawsuit is, setting up the speech topic of a need for change in how
such lawsuits are handled.

Historical Reference

You may also capture your listeners' attention by referring to an historical
event related to your topic. Obviously, this strategy is closely related to the
previous one, except that instead of a recent news event you are reaching
further back in history to find a relevant reference. For example, if you are
giving a speech on the perception of modern music as crass or having no
redeeming values, you could refer back to Elvis Presley and his musical
breakout in the 1950s as a way of making a comparison:

         During the mid-1950s, Elvis Presley introduced the United
         States to a new genre of music: rock and roll. Initially viewed as
         distasteful, and Presley was himself chastised for his gyrating
         dance moves and flashy style. Today he is revered as "The King
         of Rock `n Roll." So when we criticize modern artists for being
         flamboyant or over the top, we may be ridiculing some of the most
         important musical innovators we will know in our lifetimes.

In this example, the speaker is evoking the audience's knowledge of Elvis
to raise awareness of similarities to current artists that may be viewed
today as he was in the 1950s.

Humor

Humor is another effective method for gaining an audience's attention.
Humor is an amazing tool when used properly. We cannot begin to explain
all the facets of humor within this chapter, but we can say that humor
is a great way of focusing an audience on what you are saying. However,
Exploring Public Speaking  150 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

humor is a double-edged sword. If you do not wield the sword carefully,
you can turn your audience against you very quickly.

When using humor, you really need to know your audience and
understand what they will find humorous. One of the biggest mistakes a
speaker can make is to use some form of humor that the audience either
doesn't find funny or, worse, finds offensive. Think about how incompetent
the character of Michael Scott seems on the television program The
Office, in large part because of his ineffective use of humor. We always
recommend that you test out humor of any kind on a sample of potential
audience members prior to actually using it during a speech. If you do use
a typical narrative "joke," don't say it happened to you. Anyone who heard
the joke before will think you are less than truthful!

Now that we've warned you about the perils of using humor, let's
talk about how to use humor as an attention getter. Humor can be
incorporated into several of the attention-getting devices mentioned. You
could use a humorous anecdote, quotation, or current event. As with other
attention-getting devices, you need to make sure your humor is relevant to
your topic, as one of the biggest mistakes some novices make when using
humor is to add humor that really doesn't support the overall goal of the
speech. So when looking for humorous attention getters, you want to make
sure that the humor is not going to be offensive to your audience, does
elicit laughter, and is relevant to your speech.

For example, here's a humorous quotation from Nicolas Chamfort, a
French author during the sixteenth century: "The only thing that stops
God from sending another flood is that the first one was useless." While
this quotation could be effective for some audiences, other audiences may
Exploring Public Speaking  151 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

find this humorous quotation offensive. The Chamfort quotation could
be appropriate for a speech on the ills of modern society, but probably
not for a speech on the state of modern religious conflict. It also would
not be appropriate in an area that had just experienced damaging floods.
You want to make sure that the leap from your attention getter to your
topic isn't too complicated for your audience, or the attention getter will
backfire.

This list of attention-getting devices represents a thorough, but not
necessarily exhaustive, range of ways that you can begin your speech.
Certainly these would be the more common attention getters that most
people employ. Again, as mentioned earlier, your selection of attention
getter is not only dependent on your audience, your topic, and the
occasion, but also on your preferences and skills as a speaker. If you know
that you are a bad storyteller, you might elect not to start your speech
with a story. If you tend to tell jokes that no one laughs at even though
you think they are hilarious, you might avoid starting your speeches with
humor.

To review, think back to the factors of attention in Chapter 7. The best
attention getters are

     concrete (they bring up or refer to real experiences);
     novel (they use material that is new or fresh to the audience);
     familiar (makes the audience perk up with something comfortable

       and close to their experience);
     movement-oriented (don't spend too long in the introduction because

       the audience will wonder where you are headed);
     need-oriented (your attention getter and introduction in general

       should relate to the needs or interests of the audience).
Other factors like suspense (introducing a story and finishing it at the end)
or conflict (telling a story with strong opposing forces and tension) can
also be used.

Element 2: Establish or Enhance Your Credibility

Whether you are informing, persuading, or entertaining an audience,
one of the things they will be expecting is for you to know what you are
talking about. So the second element of an introduction is to let your
audience know that you are a knowledgeable and credible source for this
information. To do this, you will need to explain how you know what you
know about your topic.

For some people, this will be simple. If you are informing your audience
how a baseball is thrown, and you have played baseball since you were
eight years old, that makes you a fairly credible source. You probably
know what you are talking about. So let us know that by saying something
like, "Having played baseball for over ten years, including two years as the
Exploring Public Speaking  152 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

         Rapport      starting pitcher on my high school's varsity team, I can tell you about the
                      ways that pitchers use to throw different kind of balls in a baseball game."
a relationship or     With regard to persuasive speaking, if you are trying to convince your
connection a speaker  audience to join Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and you have been
makes with the        volunteering for years, let them know: "I've been serving with Big Brothers
audience              Big Sisters for the last two years, and I can tell you that the experience is
                      very rewarding." By telling your audience you volunteer, you are saying to
                      them "I'm not asking you to do anything I don't engage in myself."

                      However, you may be speaking on a subject with which you have no
                      history of credibility. If you are just curious about when streetlights were
                      installed at intersections and why they are red, yellow, and green, you
                      can give an interesting speech on that. But you will still need to give your
                      audience some sort of reason to trust your knowledge. Since you were
                      required to do research, you are at least more knowledgeable on the
                      subject that anyone else in the class. In this case you might say, "After
                      doing some research and consulting several books on the subject, I want to
                      share what I've learned about the evolution of traffic lights in America."

                      Element 3: Establish Rapport

                      The next element of your introduction will be to establish rapport with
                      your audience. Rapport is basically a relationship or connection you
                      make with your audience. In everyday life, we say that two people have
                      a rapport when they get along really well and have a good connection. In
                      your introduction, you will want to explain to your audience why you are
                      giving them this information and why it is important to them (answering
                      the WIIFM question). You will be making a connection through this
                      shared information and explaining to them how it will benefit them. One
                      of the best examples of rapport we have seen came from an informative
                      speech on the poet Lord Byron:

                               You may be asking yourselves why you need to know about Lord
                               Byron. If you take British Literature or Humanities 1202 as I did
                               last semester, you will be discussing his life and works, so after
                               this speech you will have a good basis for the class material.

                      What is important here is that this speaker used the audience analysis
                      techniques discussed in Chapter 2 to determine the demographic make-
                      up of the audience and determine what would motivate them to listen.
                      Knowing that they are all college students, the speaker enticed them to
                      listen with the suggestion that this information would benefit them in a
                      future class they might take.

                      Another important thing to note here is that there is not necessarily a right
                      or wrong way to establish rapport with your audience. You as the speaker
                      must determine what you think will work best and help make a connection.
                      Take for example an informative speech on "how to throw a baseball."
Exploring Public Speaking  153 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

How would you establish rapport with your audience on that topic? Maybe
you choose to focus on the age of your audience, and noting that they are
all relatively young and that some of them are already parents, you might
say, "A lot of people in this room have or may have children someday, and
if you decide you want to throw a ball with them or help them with sports,
here are three steps you can use to teach them how to throw a baseball."
Will everyone in the class have kids someday? Probably not, but it is
reasonable to guess that most of your audience will relate to this approach
based on a demographic analysis.

Element 4: Preview Your Topic/Purpose/Central Idea

The fourth major function of an introduction after getting the audience's
attention is to reveal the purpose of your speech to your audience. Have
you ever sat through a speech wondering what the basic point was? Have
you ever come away after a speech and had no idea what the speaker
was talking about? An introduction should make the topic, purpose,
and central idea clear. This might be a good place for you to review the
material in Chapter 4 about writing central idea statements and specific
purposes. For most speeches, the central idea and preview (Element 5)
should come at the end of the introduction.

While not a hard and fast rule, you will probably also want to avoid having
the audience "guess" what your topic is through clues. Consider the
following topic reveal:

         Today I'd like to talk to you about a man who overcame great
         adversity to become the President of the United States. During his
         time in office he faced increasing opposition from conservative
         voices in government, as well as some dissension among his own
         party, all while being thrust into a war he didn't want.
Exploring Public Speaking  154 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

As an attention getter, this may not be bad, but what it doesn't do is reveal
the topic. The speaker at this point might assume the audience has clearly
figured out who this speech is about and moved on. Unfortunately, the
above passage could refer to either Abraham Lincoln, Barack Obama,
or even another president. Members of the audience might either be
confused or disappointed when they figure out the speech isn't about what
they thought it was.

It should also be noted here that at no point in your introduction do you
ever want to read your specific purpose statement as a way of revealing
your topic. Your specific purpose is included on your outline for your
instructor's sake and to keep you on track during preparation. The
language used in the specific purpose ("To inform my audience...") is too
awkward to be actually read aloud.

Element 5: Preview Your Main Points

Just like previewing your topic, previewing your main points helps your
audience know what to expect throughout the course of your speech and
prepares them to listen. Your preview of main points should be clear and
easy to follow so that there is no question in your audience's minds what
they are. Long, complicated, or verbose main points can get confusing. Be
succinct and simple: "Today, in our discussion of Abraham Lincoln's life,
we will look at his birth, his role as president, and his assassination." From
that preview there is little question as to what specific aspects of Lincoln's
life the speech will cover. However, if you want to be extra sure they get
it, you can always enumerate them by using signposts (as we discussed in
Chapter 6): "In discussing how to make chocolate chip cookies, first we
will cover what ingredients you need, second we will talk about how to mix
them, and third we will look at baking them."

What these five elements do is prepare your audience for the bulk of the
speech (i.e. the body section) by letting them know what they can expect,
why they should listen, and why they can trust you as a speaker. Having all
five elements starts your speech off on much more solid ground that you
would get without having them.

8.3 - Examples of Introductions

Below you will find examples of informative and persuasive introductions.
Notice that each contains the five elements necessary for a good
introduction: an attention getter, the establishment of rapport with
the audience, the speaker's credibility, a clear topic reveal, and clearly
articulated main points. An important point to mention about the
introduction is that the parts should flow or "bridge" into each other.
You do not want to have a disconnect between the attention getter, the
credibility enhancer, the rapport, and the reveal, nor do you want to seem
Exploring Public Speaking  155 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

to be jumping around between these parts of the introduction. You also
can switch the rapport and credibility sections if it makes more sense, but
definitely start with the attention-getter and end with the preview.

(Note: We have written these introductions out as paragraphs, but your
instructor may require you to present them in a different format in your
outline.)

Informative Speech Introductions

Topic: Allergies

My parents knew that something was really wrong when my mom
received a call from my home economics teacher saying that she needed
to get to the school immediately and pick me up. This was all because
of an allergy, something that everyone in this room is either vaguely or
extremely familiar with. Three very common allergies include pet and
animal allergies, seasonal allergies, and food allergies. All three of these
allergies take control over certain areas of my life, as all three types affect
me, starting when I was just a kid and continuing today [attention-getter].
Because of this, I have done extensive research on the subject, [credibility]
and would like to share some of what I've learned with all of you today.
Whether you just finished your freshman year of college, you are a new
parent, or you have children that are grown and out of the house, allergies
will most likely affect everyone in this room at some point [rapport]. So it
will benefit you all to know more about them, specifically the three most
common sources of allergies and the most recent approaches to treating
them [purpose and preview].

Topic: Seasonal Affective Disorder (See if you can identify the
parts on Example 2.)

When winter is approaching and the days are getting darker and shorter,
do you feel a dramatic reduction in energy? Or do you sleep longer
than usual during the fall or winter months? If you answered "yes" to
either of these questions, you may be one of the millions of people who
suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD. For most people these
problems do not cause great suffering in their life, but for an estimated
six percent of the United States population these problems can result in
major suffering. As a student in the registered nursing program here at
State College, I became interested in SAD after learning more about it
and want to share this information with all of you in case you recognize
some of these symptoms in yourself or someone you love. In order to fully
understand SAD, it is important to look at the medical definition of SAD,
the symptoms of this disorder, and the measures that are commonly used
to ease symptoms.

Persuasive Speech Introduction

Topic: Term Life Insurance

You have cried silent tears and uttered desperate prayers, but as you watch
the medical team unhook the tubes, turn off the heart monitor and shoot
furtive, helpless glances your way, you face the unmistakable reality that
cancer has won over your loved one and you are left with unimaginable
grief, despair and yes, financial burden. Most of us would not choose to
cause our loved ones financial pain on top of the emotional pain of our
deaths, but by failing to plan for their financial needs, that is exactly what
we do. I have learned a lot about life insurance in my research for this
presentation, from taking a thirteen-week course about financial matters,
and from the experience of purchasing a term life insurance policy just
last year. I know most of you probably have not thought much about
life insurance, but someday each and every one of us in this room will
pass away and somebody is going to have to pay for our funerals. Term
life insurance is affordable, protects those you love from the financial
devastation of your uninsured death, and reinforces your commitment
to their financial and emotional well-being while you are living. Let's
examine the definition of term life insurance and then its benefits.

8.4 - Structuring the Conclusion

Similar to the introduction, the conclusion has three specific elements
that you will want to incorporate in order to make it as strong as possible.
Given the nature of these elements and what they do, these should
generally be incorporated into your conclusion in the order they are
presented below.

Element 1: Signal the End

The first thing a good conclusion should do is to signal the end of a speech.
You may be thinking that telling an audience that you're about to stop
speaking is a "no brainer," but many speakers really don't prepare their
audience for the end. When a speaker just suddenly stops speaking, the
audience is left confused and disappointed. Instead, you want to make
sure that audiences are left knowledgeable and satisfied with your speech.
In a way, it gives them time to begin mentally organizing and cataloging all
the points you have made for further consideration later.
Exploring Public Speaking  157 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

Generally, the easiest way to signal that it is the end of your speech is
to begin your conclusion with the words, "In conclusion." Similarly, "In
summary" or "To conclude" work just as well. While these may seem very
blunt ways of communicating the end of your speech to the audience, you
want it to be extremely clear to everyone that you are wrapping things up.
Certainly you can choose to employ more elegant, interesting, or creative
language here, but you do basically want to telegraph the end is coming
with, for example, a restatement of your central idea statement.

On the other hand, saying "In conclusion" (and definitely saying it more
than once) can have an unintended negative effect. The audience may
figure you are finished and turn you off, sort of like how we get up and
leave during the credits in a movie. Therefore, you can also go straight to
the summary, which is Element 2.

Element 2: Restate Main Points

In the introduction of a speech you delivered a preview of your main
points; now in the conclusion you will deliver a review. One of the biggest
differences between written and oral communication is the necessity
of repetition in oral communication (the issue of "planned redundancy"
again). When you preview your main points in the introduction, effectively
discuss and make transitions to your main points during the body of the
speech, and finally, review the main points in the conclusion, you increase
the likelihood that the audience will understand and retain your main
points after the speech is over. Remember, your English instructors can
re-read your essays as many times as they want, but your audience - and
your instructor - only have one opportunity to catch and remember the
points you are trying to get across in your speech.

Because you are trying to remind the audience of your main points, you
want to be sure not to bring up any new material or ideas. For example, if
you said, "There are several other issues related to this topic, such as...but
I don't have time for them," that would make the audience confused and
perhaps wonder why you did not address those issues in the body section.
Exploring Public Speaking  158 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

        Clincher        Or if you were giving a persuasive speech on wind energy and you ended
                        with, "Wind energy is the energy of the future, but there are still a few
something memorable     problems with it, such as noise and killing lots of birds," you are bringing
with which to conclude  up a counter-argument that should have been dealt with in the body of the
your speech             speech.

                        This is a good place to remind you that the introduction, preview,
                        transitions, and conclusion are for helping the audience be interested and
                        prepared to listen, to retain, and to follow your speech. The hard core facts
                        and content are in the body. If you are tempted to cram lots of material
                        into the conclusion, that is not the place for it, nor is it the place to provide
                        the important steps to a solution.

                        As you progress as a public speaker, you will want to work on rephrasing
                        your summary statement so that it does not sound like an exact repeat of
                        the preview. For example, if your preview was:

                                 The three arguments in favor of medical marijuana that I will
                                 present are that it would make necessary treatments available
                                 to all, it would cut down on the costs to law enforcement, and it
                                 would bring revenue to state budgets.

                        Your summary might be:

                                 In the minutes we've had together, I have shown you that
                                 approving medical marijuana in our state will greatly help
                                 persons with a variety of chronic and severe conditions. Also,
                                 funds spent on law enforcement to find and convict legitimate
                                 marijuana users would go down as revenues from medical
                                 marijuana to the state budget would go up.

                        Element 3: Clincher

                        The third element of your conclusion is the clincher, or something
                        memorable with which to conclude your speech. The clincher is sometimes
                        referred to as a Concluding Device. These are the very last words you will
                        say in your speech, so you need to make them count. This is the last thing
                        your audience will hear, so you want to make it good. A good clincher
                        prevents your audience from feeling let down, and in fact can even make
                        an audience remember a speech more favorably.

                        In many ways the clincher is like the inverse of the attention getter. You
                        want to start the speech off with something strong, and you want to
                        end the speech with something strong. To that end, similar to what we
                        discussed above with attention getters, there are a number of ways you can
                        make your clincher strong and memorable.
Exploring Public Speaking  159 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

Conclude with a Challenge

One way you can end your speech is with a challenge. A challenge is a call
to engage in some kind of activity that requires a special effort. In a speech
on the necessity of fundraising, a speaker could conclude by challenging
the audience to raise ten percent more than their original projections. In
a speech on eating more vegetables, you could challenge your audience to
increase their current intake of vegetables by two portions daily. In both of
these challenges, audience members are being asked to go out of their way
to do something different that involves effort on their part.

In a challenge, try to make it aspirational but reasonable. The challenge
should be something they can strive for but not see as impossible. The
audience may see two more servings a day of fruits and vegetables as
reasonable, but six probably as too much.

In the same category as a challenge, probably the most common
persuasive concluding device is the appeal for action or the call to action.
In essence, the appeal for action occurs when a speaker asks their audience
to engage in a specific behavior. Whether the speaker appeals for people
to eat more fruit, buy a car, vote for a candidate, oppose the death penalty,
get more sleep, or donate blood, the speaker is asking the audience to
engage in action.

One specific type of appeal for action is the immediate call to action.
Whereas some appeals ask for people to engage in behavior in the future,
the immediate call to action asks people to engage in behavior right
now. If a speaker wants to see a new traffic light placed at a dangerous
intersection, they may conclude by asking all the audience members
to sign a digital petition right then and there, using a computer the
speaker has made available or their own devices. For a speech on eating
more vegetables, the speaker could pass out raw veggies and dip at
the conclusion of the speech; someone giving a speech on petitioning
a lawmaker for a new law could provide audience members with a
prewritten email they can send to the lawmaker.

If you are giving a persuasive speech about a solution to a problem, you
should not relegate the call to action to the very end of the speech. It
should probably be a main point where you can deal with the steps and
specifics of the solution in more detail. For example, perhaps a speaker
has been discussing the problems associated with the diminishing of art
education in the United States. The speaker could then propose a solution
of creating more community-based art experiences for school children as a
way to fill this gap. Although this can be an effective conclusion, speakers
should ask themselves whether the solution should be discussed in more
depth as a stand-alone main point within the body of the speech so that
audience concerns about the proposed solution can be addressed.

Version 4.2

         Inspire         Conclude with a Quotation

to affect or arouse      Another way you can conclude a speech is by providing a quotation
someone's emotions       relevant to the speech topic. When using a quotation, you need to think
in a specific, positive  about whether your goal is to end on a persuasive note or an informative
manner                   note. Some quotations will have a clear call to action, while other
                         quotations summarize or provoke thought. For example, let's say you are
                         delivering an informative speech about dissident writers in the former
                         Soviet Union. You could end by citing this quotation from Alexander
                         Solzhenitsyn: "A great writer is, so to speak, a second government in his
                         country. And for that reason no regime has ever loved great writers."

                         Notice that this quotation underscores the idea of writers as dissidents,
                         but it doesn't ask listeners to put forth effort to engage in any specific
                         thought process or behavior. If, on the other hand, you were delivering a
                         persuasive speech urging your audience to sponsor a child in a developing
                         country for $40 per month, you might use this quotation by Forest
                         Witcraft:

                         "A hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank account was,
                         the sort of house I lived in, or the kind of car I drove. But the world may be
                         different because I was important in the life of a child."

                         In this case, the quotation leaves the audience with the message that
                         monetary sacrifices are worth taking, that they make our lives worthwhile,
                         and that the right thing to do is to go ahead and make that sacrifice.

                         Conclude by Visualizing the Future

                         The purpose of a conclusion that refers to the future is to help your
                         audience imagine the future you believe can occur. If you are giving
                         a speech on the development of video games for learning, you could
                         conclude by depicting the classroom of the future where video games are
                         perceived as true learning tools. More often, speakers use visualization of
                         the future to depict how society or how individual listeners' lives would
                         be different if the audience accepts and acts on the speaker's main idea.
                         For example, if a speaker proposes that a solution to illiteracy is hiring
                         more reading specialists in public schools, the speaker could ask her or his
                         audience to imagine a world without illiteracy.

                         Conclude by Inspiration

                         By definition, the word inspire means to affect or arouse someone. Both
                         affect and arouse have strong emotional connotations. The ultimate goal of
                         an inspirational concluding device is similar to an "appeal for action," but
                         the ultimate goal is more lofty or aspirational. The goal is to stir someone's
                         emotions in a specific manner. This is done by sharing a story, poem, or
                         quotation that appeals to the audience's basic values and therefore appeals
Exploring Public Speaking  161 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

to emotions. Stories or allusions to "underdogs" who overcame obstacles
to achieve something worthwhile or those who make sacrifices for the good
of others can help inspire. You probably know of such stories (Olympic
athletes and a well-known figure such as Captain Sullenberg are examples)
that would be of value, as long as they are relevant to your topic and
purpose.

Poetry is sometimes used to inspire, but you want to use a short passage
(eight lines or less) of poetry that is clear to the audience. One famous
example of an inspiring speech that ended with a poem was President
Reagan's speech on the evening of the day of the Challenger Disaster
in January 1986. He finished it with the words, "The crew of the Space
Shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived
their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them,
this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye
and"slipped the surly bonds of earth" to "touch the face of God." This is a
reference to the poem "High Flight" by John Gillepsie Magee, Jr.

Conclude with a Question

Another way you can end a speech is to ask a rhetorical question that
forces the audience to ponder an idea. Maybe you are giving a speech
on the importance of the environment, so you end the speech by saying,
"Think about your children's future. What kind of world do you want them
raised in? A world that is clean, vibrant, and beautiful--or one that is filled
with smog, pollution, filth, and disease?" Notice that you aren't actually
asking the audience to verbally or nonverbally answer the question; the
goal of this question is to force the audience into thinking about what kind
of world they want for their children.

Refer Back to the Introduction

This method provides a good sense of closure to the speech and can be one
of the most effective methods. If you started the speech with a startling
statistic or fact, such as "Last year, according to the official website of the
American Humane Society, four million pets were euthanized in shelters
in the United States," in the end you could say, "Remember that shocking
number of four million euthanized pets? With your donation of time or
money to the Northwest Georgia Rescue Shelter, you can help lower that
number in our region."

Conclude with an Anecdote or Personal Story

As with your attention getter, a brief story can be a strong way to conclude.
However, it must be relevant and not go on too long. Combining this
method and the previous one, you might finish telling a story that you
started in the introduction as your clincher. This method is probably better
Exploring Public Speaking  162 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

with persuasive speeches where you want to end with a strong emotional
appeal.

Conclude with a Reference to Audience or Audience Self-Interest

The last concluding device involves a direct reference to your audience.
This concluding device is used when a speaker attempts to answer the
basic audience question, "What's in it for me?" (the WIIFM question). The
goal of this concluding device is to spell out the direct benefits a behavior
or thought change has for audience members. For example, a speaker
talking about stress reduction techniques could conclude by clearly listing
all the physical health benefits stress reduction offers (e.g., improved
reflexes, improved immune system, improved hearing, reduction in blood
pressure). In this case, the speaker is spelling out why audience members
should care about the topic and what's in it for them.

Informative versus Persuasive Conclusions

As you read through the above possible ways to conclude a speech,
hopefully you noticed that some of the methods are more appropriate
for persuasive speeches and others are more appropriate for informative
speeches. An appeal to action, for example, may not be appropriate for
an informative speech since asking your audience to do something often
borders on persuasion, which isn't what an informative speech is intended
to do. Similarly, if your persuasive speech is on the importance of voting in
the next local election, an appeal to action clincher would probably be one
of your stronger options.

8.5 - Examples of Conclusions

Here are two examples of conclusions. More examples can be found on the
outlines at the ends of Chapters 12, 13, and 15. As before, try to determine
what sentences in the conclusion relate to the three elements.

Informative Speech Conclusion

Topic: Anxiety

Anxiety is a complex emotion that afflicts people of all ages and social
backgrounds and is experienced uniquely by each individual. We have
seen that there are multiple symptoms, causes, and remedies, all of which
can often be related either directly or indirectly to cognitive behaviors.
While most people do not enjoy anxiety, it seems to be part of the universal
human experience, so realize that you are not alone, but also realize
that you are not powerless against it. With that said, the following quote,
attributed to an anonymous source, could not be more true, "Worry does
not relieve tomorrow of its stress; it merely empties today of its strength."
Exploring Public Speaking  163 Chapter 8: Introductions and Conclusions
Version 4.2

Persuasive Speech Conclusion

Topic: Adopting a Rescue Animal

I believe you should adopt a rescue animal because it helps stop forms of
animal cruelty, you can add a healthy companion to your home, and it is
a relatively simple process that can save a life. Each and every one of you
should go to your nearest animal shelter, which may include the Catoosa
Citizens for Animal Care, the Humane Society of Northwest Georgia in
Dalton, the Murray County Humane Society, or the multiple other shelters
in the area. On your visit, you can investigate and maybe fall in love
with a new animal companion to bring into your life. I'll leave you with a
paraphrased quote from Deborah Jacobs's article "Westminster Dog Show
Junkie" on Forbes.com: "You may start out thinking that you are rescuing
the animal, and ultimately find that the animal rescues you right back."

Something to Think About

Read out loud one of the example introductions earlier in the chapter, and
time your reading. If an introduction should not be longer than about
10%-15% of the total speech time, how long would the speech attached
to this introduction be? (You'll have to do the math!) If you had to give a
shorter speech using this introduction, how would you edit it to make it for
the time limit but still be an effective introduction?

Final Note: If you are wondering about the photo at the beginning of
this chapter, it is of the headstone of poet Emily Dickinson in Amherst,
Massachusetts. Her parting words, as shown on the marker, were "Called
Back." That was her "life" conclusion.

                                                                                   the resources beyond
When you give a speech, you are presenting much more than just a                   the speech itself that
collection of words and ideas. Because you are speaking "live and in               a speaker uses to
person," your audience members will experience your speech through                 enhance the message
all five of their senses: hearing, vision, smell, taste, and touch. In some        conveyed to the
speaking situations, the speaker appeals only to the sense of hearing. They        audience
more or less ignore the other senses except to avoid visual distractions by
dressing and presenting themselves in an appropriate manner. But the                       Olfactory
speaking event can be greatly enriched by appeals to the other senses. This        of or relating to the
is the role of presentation aids.                                                  sense of smell

Presentation aids are the resources beyond the speech words and                           Gustatory
delivery that a speaker uses to enhance the message conveyed to the                of or relating to the
audience. The type of presentation aids that speakers most typically make          sense of taste
use of are visual aids: pictures, diagrams, charts and graphs, maps, and
the like. Audible aids include musical excerpts, audio speech excerpts, and
sound effects. A speaker may also use fragrance samples or food samples
as olfactory (sense of smell) or gustatory (sense of taste) aids. Finally,
presentation aids can be three-dimensional objects, animals, and people;
they can also change over a period of time, as in the case of a how-to
demonstration.

As you can see, the range of possible presentation aids is almost unlimited.
However, all presentation aids have one thing in common: To be effective,
each presentation aid a speaker uses must be a direct, uncluttered example
of a specific element of the speech. It is understandable that someone
presenting a speech about Abraham Lincoln might want to include a
photograph of him, but because everyone already knows what Lincoln
looked like, the picture would not contribute much to the message unless,
perhaps, the message was specifically about the changes in Lincoln's
appearance during his time in office.

Other visual artifacts are more likely to deliver information more directly
relevant to the speech--a diagram of the interior of Ford's Theater where
Lincoln was assassinated, a facsimile of the messy and much-edited
Gettysburg Address, or a photograph of the Lincoln family, for example.
The key is that each presentation aid must directly express an idea in your
speech.

Moreover, presentation aids must be used at the time when you are
presenting the specific ideas related to the aid. For example, if you are
speaking about coral reefs and one of your supporting points is about the
location of the world's major reefs, it would make sense to display a map
of these reefs while you're talking about location. If you display it while
you are explaining what coral actually is, or describing the kinds of fish
that feed on a reef, the map will not serve as a useful visual aid--in fact, it's
likely to be a distraction.
Exploring Public Speaking  166 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

To be effective, presentation aids must also be easy to use and easy for
the listeners to see and understand. In this chapter, we will present some
principles and strategies to help you incorporate effective presentation
aids into your speech. We will begin by discussing the functions that good
presentation aids fulfill. Next, we will explore some of the many types of
presentation aids and how best to design and utilize them. We will also
describe various media that can be used for presentation aids. We will
conclude with tips for successful preparation and use of presentation aids
in a speech.

9.2 - Functions of Presentation Aids

Why should you use presentation aids? If you have prepared and
rehearsed your speech adequately, shouldn't a good speech with good
delivery be enough to stand on its own? While it is true that impressive
presentation aids will not rescue a poor speech, a good speech can often
be made even better by the strategic use of presentation aids. Presentation
aids can fulfill several functions: they can serve to improve your audience's
understanding of the information you are conveying, enhance audience
memory and retention of the message, add variety and interest to your
speech, and enhance your credibility as a speaker. Let's examine each of
these functions.

Improving Audience Understanding

Human communication is a complex process that often leads to
misunderstandings. If you are like most people, you can easily remember
incidents when you misunderstood a message or when someone else
misunderstood what you said to them. Misunderstandings happen in
public speaking just as they do in everyday conversations.

One reason for misunderstandings is the fact that perception and
interpretation are highly complex individual processes. Most of us have
seen the image in which, depending on your perception, you see either
the outline of a vase or the facial profiles of two people facing each other.
Or perhaps you have seen the image of the woman who may or may
not be young, depending on your frame of reference at the time. (You
can see these images at http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/
Creative/Drawing/vases.htm and https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=P9iv173VtGM.)

These images show how interpretations can differ, and it means that
your presentations must be based on careful thought and preparation
to maximize the likelihood that your listeners will understand your
presentations as you intend them to do so. As a speaker, one of your
basic goals is to help your audience understand your message. To
Exploring Public Speaking     167 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

reduce misunderstanding, presentation aids can be used to clarify or to
emphasize.

Figure 9.1 - Coriolis Effect
Exploring Public Speaking   168 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2
                           Figure 9.2 - Model of Communication

Clarifying

Clarification is important in a speech because if some of the information
you convey is unclear, your listeners will come away puzzled or possibly
even misled. Presentation aids can help clarify a message if the
information is complex or if the point being made is a visual one.

If your speech is about the impact of the Coriolis Effect on tropical storms,
for instance, you will have great difficulty clarifying it without a diagram
because the process is a complex one. The diagram in Figure 9.1 ("Coriolis
Effect") would be effective because it shows the audience the interaction
between equatorial wind patterns and wind patterns moving in other
directions. The diagram allows the audience to process the information
in two ways: through your verbal explanation and through the visual
elements of the diagram. By the way, the Coriolis Effect is defined as

        "an effect whereby a mass moving in a rotating system experiences
         a force (the Coriolis force ) acting perpendicular to the direction of
         motion and to the axis of rotation. On the earth, the effect tends
         to deflect moving objects to the right in the northern hemisphere
         and to the left in the southern and is important in the formation of
         cyclonic weather systems."

You can see why a picture really helps with this definition.

Figure 9.2 ("Model of Communication") is another example of a diagram
that maps out the process of human communication. In this image you
clearly have a speaker and an audience with the labels of source, channel,
message, receivers, and feedback to illustrate a basic model of human
communication. As with most models, it is simplified. (Can you remember
what two components of the communication process, explained in Chapter
1, are missing here?)

Version 4.2

Figure 9.3 - Petroglyph example

                             Figure 9.4 - Planetary Water Supply

Another aspect of clarifying occurs when a speaker wants to help audience
members understand a visual concept. For example, if a speaker is
talking about the importance of petroglyphs in Native American culture,
just describing the petroglyphs won't completely help your audience to
visualize what they look like. Instead, showing an example of a petroglyph,
Exploring Public Speaking  170 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

                           as in Figure 9.3 ("Petroglyph") can more easily help your audience form a
                           clear mental image of your intended meaning.

    Figure 9.5 - Chinese Lettering Amplified. Source: Image courtesy of Wikimedia,
                            http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/

Emphasizing

When you use a presentational aid for emphasis, you impress your
listeners with the importance of an idea. In a speech on water
conservation, you might try to show the environmental proportions of the
resource. When you use a conceptual drawing like the one in Figure 9.4
("Planetary Water Supply"), you show that if the world water supply were
equal to ten gallons, only ten drops would be available and drinkable for
human or household consumption. This drawing is effective because it
emphasizes the scarcity of useful water and thus draws attention to this
important information in your speech.

Another way of emphasizing that can be done visually is to zoom in on
a specific aspect of interest within your speech. In Figure 9.5 ("Chinese
Lettering Amplified"), we see a visual aid used in a speech on the
importance of various parts of Chinese characters. On the left side of the
visual aid, we see how the characters all fit together, with an emphasized
version of a single character on the right.

So, clarifying and emphasizing are two roles that support the
"Improving Audience Understanding" purpose of presentation aids. What
are other purposes?

Aiding Retention and Recall

The second function that presentation aids can serve is to increase the
audience's chances of remembering your speech. An article by the U.S.
Department of Labor (1996) summarized research on how people learn
Exploring Public Speaking  171 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

and remember. The authors found that "83% of human learning occurs
visually, and the remaining 17% through the other senses--11% through
hearing, 3.5% through smell, 1% through taste, and 1.5% through touch."

For this reason, exposure to an image can serve as a memory aid to your
listeners. When your graphic images deliver information effectively and
when your listeners understand them clearly, audience members are
likely to remember your message long after your speech is over. Moreover,
people often are able to remember information that is presented in
sequential steps more easily than if that information is presented in an
unorganized pattern. When you use a presentation aid to display the
organization of your speech (such as can be done with PowerPoint slides),
you will help your listeners to observe, follow, and remember the sequence
of information you conveyed to them. This is why some instructors display
a lecture outline for their students to follow during class and why a slide
with a preview of your main points can be helpful as you move into the
body of your speech.

An added plus of using presentation aids is that they can boost your
memory while you are speaking. Using your presentation aids while you
rehearse your speech will familiarize you with the association between a
given place in your speech and the presentation aid that accompanies that
material.

Adding Variety and Interest

A third function of presentation aids is simply to make your speech more
interesting. For example, wouldn't a speech on varieties of roses have
greater impact if you accompanied your remarks with a picture of each
rose? You can imagine that your audience would be even more enthralled
if you had the ability to display an actual flower of each variety in a bud
vase. Similarly, if you were speaking to a group of gourmet cooks about
Indian spices, you might want to provide tiny samples of spices that they
could smell and taste during your speech.

Enhancing a Speaker's Credibility

Presentation aids alone will not be enough to create a professional image.
As we mentioned earlier, impressive presentation aids will not rescue a
poor speech. Even if you give a good speech, you run the risk of appearing
unprofessional if your presentation aids are poorly executed. Conversely,
a high quality presentation will contribute to your professional image.
This means that in addition to containing important information, your
presentation aids must be clear, clean, uncluttered, organized, and large
enough for the audience to see and interpret correctly. Misspellings
and poorly designed presentation aids can damage your credibility as a
speaker.
Exploring Public Speaking  172 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

In addition, make sure that you give proper credit to the source of any
presentation aids that you take from other sources. Using a statistical chart
or a map without proper credit will detract from your credibility, just as
using a quotation in your speech without credit would. This situation will
usually take place with digital aids such as PowerPoint slides. The source
of a chart or the data shown in a chart form should be cited at the bottom
the slide.

If you focus your efforts on producing presentation aids that contribute
effectively to your meaning, that look professional, and that are handled
well, your audience will most likely appreciate your efforts and pay
close attention to your message. That attention will help them learn
or understand your topic in a new way and will thus help the audience
see you as a knowledgeable, competent, and credible speaker. With the
prevalence of digital communication, the audience expectation of quality
visual aids has increased.

Avoiding Problems with Presentation Aids

Using presentation aids can come with some risks. However, with a little
forethought and adequate practice, you can choose presentation aids
that enhance your message and boost your professional appearance in
front of an audience. One principle to keep in mind is to use only as many
presentation aids as necessary to present your message and/or to fulfill
your classroom assignment. The number and the technical sophistication
of your presentation aids should never overshadow your speech.

Another important consideration is technology. Keep your presentation
aids within the limits of the working technology available to you. Whether
or not your classroom technology works on the day of your speech, you
will still have to present. What will you do if the computer file containing
your slides is corrupted? What will you do if the easel is broken? What if
you had counted on stacking your visuals on a table that disappears right
when you need it? Or the Internet connection is down for a YouTube video
you plan to show?

You must be prepared to adapt to an uncomfortable and scary situation.
This is why we urge students to go to the classroom well ahead of time to
test the equipment and ascertain the condition of items they're planning to
use. As the speaker, you are responsible for arranging the things you need
to make your presentation aids work as intended. Carry a roll of masking
tape or some pushpins so you can display your poster even if the easel
is gone. Test the computer setup. Have your slides on a flash drive AND
send it to yourself as an attachment or upload to a Cloud service. Have an
alternative plan prepared in case there is some glitch that prevents your
computer-based presentation aids from being usable. And of course, you
must know how to use the technology.
Exploring Public Speaking  173 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

More important than the method of delivery is the audience's ability to
see and understand the presentation aid. It must deliver clear information,
and it must not distract from the message. Avoid overly elaborate
presentation aids. Instead, simplify as much as possible, emphasizing the
information you want your audience to understand.

Another thing to remember is that presentation aids do not "speak for
themselves." When you display a visual aid, you should explain what it
shows, pointing out and naming the most important features. If you use
an audio aid such as a musical excerpt, you need to tell your audience what
to listen for. Similarly, if you use a video clip, it is up to you as the speaker
to point out the characteristics in the video that support the point you are
making. Do this probably beforehand, so you are not speaking over the
video. Afterward is probably not best, because it's too late for the audience
to notice those aspects. We've often seen students show a YouTube clip
"just because" and its relevance was not stated or clear.

At the same time, a visual aid should be quickly accessible to the audience.
This is where simplicity comes in. Just as in organization of a speech you
would not want to use 20 main points, but more like 3-5, you should limit
categories of information on a visual aid. For example, a circle or pie graph
should not have ten or more "pie pieces."

                        9.3 - Types of Presentation Aids

                        Now that we've explored some basic hints for preparing visual aids,
                        let's look at the most common types of visual aids: charts, graphs,
                        representations, objects/models, and people.

                        Charts

                        A chart is commonly defined as a graphical representation of data
                        (often numerical) or a sketch representing an ordered process. Whether
                        you create your charts or do research to find charts that already exist,
                        it is important for them to exactly match the specific purpose in your
                        speech. Figure 9.6 ("Acupuncture Charts") shows two charts related to
                        acupuncture. Although both charts are good, they are not equal. One
                        chart might be useful in a speech about the history and development of
                        acupuncture while the other chart would be more useful for showing
                        the locations of meridians (the lines along which energy flows) and the
                        acupuncture points.

                        The rest of this section will explore three common types of charts:
                        statistical charts, sequence-of-steps chart, and decision trees.

                        Statistical Charts

                        For most audiences, statistical presentations must be kept as simple as
                        possible, and they must be explained. The statistical chart shown in Figure
                        9.7 ("Birth Weight Chi-Square") is from a study examining the effects of
                        maternal smoking on a range of congenital birth defects. Unless you are
Exploring Public Speaking  175 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

familiar with statistical terminology, this chart may be very confusing.
When visually displaying information from a quantitative study, you
need to make sure that you understand the material and can successfully
and simply explain how one should interpret the data. If you are unsure
about the data yourself, then you should probably not use this type of
information. This is definitely an example of a visual aid that, although
it delivers a limited kind of information, does not speak for itself. On the
other hand, if you are presenting to an upper level or graduate class in
health sciences or to professionals in health occupations, this chart would
be appropriate. As with all other principles of public speaking, KNOW
YOUR AUDIENCE.

Sequence-of-Steps Charts

Charts are also useful when you are trying to explain a process that
involves several steps. The two visual aids in Figure 9.8 ("Steps in Cell
Reproduction") both depict the process of cell division called mitosis using
a sequence-of-steps chart, but they each deliver different information.
The first chart lacks labels to indicate the different phases of cell division.
Although the first chart has more visual detail and may look more
scientific, the missing information may confuse your audience. In the
second chart, each phase is labeled with a brief explanation of what is
happening, which can help your audience understand the process.

                         Decision trees are useful for showing the relationships between ideas.
                         The example in Figure 9.9 ("Open Educational Resource Decision Tree")
                         shows how a decision tree could be used to determine whether to use
                         open-source textbook material. As with the other types of charts, you want
                         to be sure that the information in the chart is relevant to the purpose of
                         your speech and that each question and decision is clearly labeled. This
                         particular tree is pertinent to this textbook, which is an open educational
                         resource drawing from other open educational resources, and the decision
                         tree shows some of the processes the authors went through to decide on
                         the content of this text.

are so widely used that we will discuss them separately. A graph is a
pictorial representation of the relationships of quantitative data using dots,         Bar graph
lines, bars, pie slices, and the like. Graphs show how one factor (such as      a graph designed to
size, weight, number of items, test scores) varies in comparison to other       show the differences
items. Whereas a statistical chart may report the mean ages of individuals      between quantities
entering college, a graph would visually depict the mean age changes over
time with lines on an x-y axis. A statistical chart may report the amount of
computers sold in the United States, while a graph will use bars or lines to
show their breakdown by operating systems such as Windows, Macintosh,
and Linux.

Public speakers can show graphs using a range of different formats. Some
of those formats are specialized for various professional fields. Very
complex graphs often contain too much information that is not related
to the purpose of a student's speech. If the graph is cluttered, it becomes
difficult to comprehend. In this section, we're going to analyze the
common graphs speakers utilize in their speeches: line graphs, bar graphs,
pie graphs, and pictographs.

Line Graph

A line graph is designed to show trends over time. In Figure 9.10
("Enron's Stock Price"), we see a line graph depicting the fall of Enron's
stock price from August 2000 to January 2002. Notice that although
it has some steep rises, the line has an overall downward trend clearly
depicting the plummeting of Enron's stock price. This is far more effective
in showing the relationship of numbers than a chart (as in Figure 9.7) or
reading the numbers aloud. These graphs are commonly used for showing
economic trends (Wall Street stock prices) or sociological data (e.g., crime
rates). As background, Enron was an energy company around which there
was a scandal in the early 2000s due to accounting fraud.

Bar Graph

Bar graphs are useful for showing the differences between quantities.
They can be used for population demographics, fuel costs, math ability
in different grades, and many other kinds of data. The graph in Figure
9.11 ("Suicide vs. Homicide") is well designed. It is relatively simple and
is carefully labeled, making it easy for the speaker to guide the audience
through the recorded numbers of each type of death. The bar graph is
designed to show the difference between rates of suicides and homicides
across various age groups. When you look at the data, the first grouping
clearly shows that eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds are more likely to die
because of a homicide than any of the other age groups. You can easily see
from Figures 9.10 and 9.11 how graphs, if correct and used ethically, can
make a dramatic point.

The graph in Figure 9.12 ("Distribution of Income and Wealth in the
United States") is a complicated bar graph depicting the disparity between
the so-called "haves" and the "have nots" within the United States. On the
left hand side of the graph you can see that the Top 20% of people within
the United States account for 84.7% of all of the wealth and 50.1% of all of
the income. On the other hand, those in the bottom 40% account for only
0.2% of the wealth and 12.1% of the actual income.

While the graph is very well designed, it presents a great deal of
information. For example, it shows "wealth" and "income," for several
groups; however, these are related but different concepts. In a written
publication, readers will have time to sit and analyze the graph, but in
a speaking situation, audience members need to be able to understand
the information in a graph very quickly. For that reason, this graph is
Exploring Public Speaking  180 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

                        probably not as effective for speeches as the one in Figure 9.11 ("Suicide
                        vs. Homicide").

                        Pie Graph

                        Pie graphs are usually depicted as circles and are designed to show
                        proportional relationships within sets of data; in other words, they show
                        parts of or percentages of a whole. They should be simplified as much as
                        possible without eliminating important information. As with other graphs,
                        the sections of the pie need to be plotted proportionally. In the pie graph
                        shown in Figure 9.13 ("Causes of Concussions in Children") we see a clear
                        and proportional chart that has been color-coded. Color-coding is useful
                        when it's difficult to fit the explanations in the actual sections of the graph;
                        in that case, you need to include a legend, or key, to indicate what the
                        colors in the graph mean. In this graph, audience members can see very
                        quickly that falls are the primary reason children receive concussions.

                        However, the pie graph in Figure 9.14 ("World Populations") is jumbled,
                        illegible, confusing, and overwhelming in every way. The use of color
                        coding doesn't help. Overall, this graph simply contains too much
                        information and is more likely to confuse an audience than help them
                        understand something.

Similar to bar graphs, pictographs use numbers and/or sizes of iconic              drawings or sketches
symbols to dramatize differences in amounts. An example is found in                that outline and
Figure 9.15. Pictographs, although interesting, do not allow for depiction         explain the parts of
of specific statistical data. If you were trying to show the output of oil from    an object, process,
various countries through oil wells, each oil well representing a ten million      or phenomenon that
barrels a day, it might be hard for the audience to see the difference             cannot be readily seen
between a third of an oil well and a fourth of one, but that is a significant
difference in amounts (3.3 million versus 2.5 million).

    Figure 9.15 - Pictograph - Favorite Pizza Toppings of State College Freshmen.

Graphs can present challenges in being effective but also in being ethical.
To be both ethical and effective, you need a good understanding of what
Exploring Public Speaking  182 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

statistics mean, and you need to create or use graphs that show amounts
clearly. If you were showing GPAs of freshmen, sophomore, junior, and
senior students at your college, and the bottom number on the graph was
2.25 rather than 0.0, that would result in a visually bigger difference than
what really exists (see Figure 9.16). Even though seniors do have a higher
GPA than juniors, it is only .3 higher, not three times higher, as the graph
seems to indicate.

               Figure 9.16 - Misrepresentative Graph of GPAs of Students.

Diagrams

Diagrams are drawings or sketches that outline and explain the parts
of an object, process, or phenomenon that cannot be readily seen. Like
graphs, diagrams can be considered a type of chart, as in the case of
organizational charts and process-flow charts.

When you use a diagram, be sure to explain each part of the phenomenon,
paying special attention to elements that are complicated or prone to
misunderstanding. In the example shown in Figure 9.17 ("The Human
Eye"), you might wish to highlight that the light stimulus is reversed when
it is processed through the brain or that the optic nerve is not a single stalk
as many people think.

Maps

Maps are extremely useful if the information is clear and limited. There
are all kinds of maps, including population, weather, ocean current,
political, and economic maps, so you should find the right kind for the
purpose of your speech. Choose a map that emphasizes the information
you need to deliver. The map shown in Figure 9.18 ("African Map with
Nigerian Emphasis") is simple, showing clearly the geographic location of
Nigeria. This can be extremely valuable for some audiences who might not
be able to name and locate countries on the continent of Africa. The map
also shows the relative size of Nigeria compared to its neighbors. Figure
9.19 ("Rhode Island Map") is a map of the state of Rhode Island, and it
emphasizes the complicated configuration of islands and waterways that
characterize this state's coastal geography.

Photographs and Drawings

Sometimes a photograph or a drawing is the best way to show an
unfamiliar but important detail. Figure 9.20 ("Wigwam Photograph") is
a photograph of a wigwam, a dwelling used by Native Americans in the
North East. Audiences expect high quality in photographs now, and as
with all presentation aids they should enhance the speech and not just "be
there." It is common to put stock photographs on PowerPoint slides as
"clip art," but they should be relevant and not detract from the message of
the slide.

                             Figure 9.20 - Wigwam Photograph.

Video or Audio Recordings

Another very useful type of presentation aid is a video or audio recording.
Whether it is a short video from a website such as YouTube or Vimeo, a
segment from a song, or a piece of a podcast, a well-chosen video or audio
recording may be a good choice to enhance your speech. Imagine, for
example, that you're giving a speech on how Lap-Band surgeries help
people lose weight. One of the sections of your speech could explain how
the Lap-Band works, so you could easily show a forty-three second video
available on YouTube to demonstrate the part of the surgery. Maybe you
could include a recording of a real patient explaining why they decided to
get the Lap-Band.

There is one major warning to using audio and video clips during a
speech: do not forget that they are supposed to be aids to your speech,
not the speech itself. In addition, be sure to avoid these five mistakes that
speakers often make when using audio and video clips:
Exploring Public Speaking  186 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

     Avoid choosing clips that are too long for the overall length of the
      speech. Your instructor can give you some guidelines for how long
      video and audio clips should be for the speeches in your class, if they
      are allowed (and make sure they are).

     Practice with the audio or video equipment prior to speaking. If
      you are unfamiliar with the equipment, you'll look foolish trying to
      figure out how it works. This fiddling around will not only take your
      audience out of your speech but also have a negative impact on your
      credibility. It also wastes valuable time. Finally, be sure that the
      speakers on the computer are on and at the right volume level.

     Cue the clip to the appropriate place prior to beginning your speech.
      We cannot tell you the number of times we've seen students spend
      valuable speech time trying to find a clip on the Internet. You need to
      make sure your clip is ready to go before you start speaking. Later in
      this chapter we will look at using video links in slides.

     In addition to cuing the clip to the appropriate place, the browser
      window should be open and ready to go. If there are advertisements
      before the video, be sure to have the video cued to play after the ad.
      The audience should not have to sit through a commercial. There
      are websites that allow you to cut a segment out of a YouTube video,
      then creating a new link to put in your slides. The authors did not
      test these platforms, so we cannot list them or give recommendations
      here, but they can be found through a search engine.

     The audience must be given context before a video or audio clip is
      played, specifically what the clip is and why it relates to the speech.
      At the same time, the video should not repeat what you have already
      said, but add to it.

Objects or Models

Objects and models are another form of presentation aid that can be very
helpful in getting your audience to understand your message. Objects refer
to anything you could hold up and talk about during your speech. If you're
talking about the importance of not using plastic water bottles, you might
hold up a plastic water bottle and a stainless steel water bottle as examples.

Models, on the other hand, are re-creations of physical objects that you
cannot have readily available with you during a speech. If you're giving a
speech on heart murmurs, you may be able to show how heart murmurs
work by holding up a model of the human heart. As will be discussed in the
section on handouts below, a speaker should not pass an object or model
around during a speech. It is highly distracting.
Exploring Public Speaking  187 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

People and Animals

The next category of presentation aids are people and animals. We can
often use ourselves or other people to adequately demonstrate an idea
during our speeches.

Animals as Presentation Aids

When giving a speech on a topic relating to animals, it is often tempting
to bring an animal to serve as your presentation aid. While this can
sometimes add a very engaging dimension to the speech, it carries some
serious risks that you need to consider.

The first risk is that animal behavior tends to be unpredictable. You
may think this won't be a problem if your presentation aid animal is
small enough to be kept confined throughout your speech--for example,
a goldfish in a bowl or a lizard or bird in a cage. However, even caged
animals can be very distracting to your audience if they run about, chirp,
or exhibit other agitated behavior. The chances are great that an animal
will react to the stress of an unfamiliar situation by displaying behavior
that does not contribute positively to your speech or to the cleanliness of
the physical environment. Additionally, the animal's behavior may not
only affect audience attention during your speech, but potentially during
your classmates' speeches as well.

The second risk is that some audience members may respond negatively to
a live animal. In addition to common fears and aversions to animals like
snakes, spiders, and mice, many people have allergies to various animals.
One of the authors had an experience where a student brought his six-foot
yellow python to class for a speech--in a duffel bag! As a result, one of the
other students refused to stay in the room because of her snake phobia
(the instructor was not too comfortable either).

The third risk is that some locations may have regulations about bringing
non-service animals onto the premises. If animals are allowed, the person
bringing the animal may be required to bring a veterinary certificate or
may be legally responsible for any damage caused by the animal.

For these reasons, before you decide to use an animal as a presentation
aid, ask yourself if you could make your point equally well with a picture,
model, diagram, or other representation of the animal in question, and
clear it with your instructor.

Speaker as Presentation Aid

Speakers can often use their own bodies to demonstrate facets of a speech.
If your speech is about ballroom dancing or ballet, you might use your
Exploring Public Speaking  188 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

body to demonstrate the basic moves in the cha-cha or the five basic ballet
positions.

Other People as Presentation Aids

In some cases, such as for a demonstration speech, you might want to ask
someone else to serve as your presentation aid. You should arrange ahead
of time for a person (or persons) to be an effective aid--do not assume that
an audience member will volunteer on the spot. If you plan to demonstrate
how to immobilize a broken bone, your volunteer must know ahead of
time that you will touch them as much as necessary to demonstrate how to
splint the break.

You must also make certain that they will arrive dressed presentably and
that they will not draw attention away from your message through their
appearance or behavior. The transaction between you and your human
presentation aid must be appropriate, especially if you are going to
demonstrate something like a dance step. In short, make sure your helper
will know what is expected of them and consents to it.

9.4 - Using Presentation Slides

Ever since the 1990s and the mainstreaming of personal computer
technology, speakers have had the option of using slide presentation
software to accompany their speeches and presentations. The most
commonly known one is PowerPoint, although there are several others:

     Canva
     Prezi, available at www.prezi.com
     Slide Rocket, available at www.sliderocket.com
     Google Slides, available in Google Drive and useful for collaborative

      assignments
     Keynote, the Apple presentation slide software on MACs
     Impress, a Libre Office product (https://www.libreoffice.org/

      discover/impress/)
     Prezent-It
     AdobeAcrobat Presenter
     Hancom Office 2020

These products, some of which are offered free for trial or basic
subscriptions (called a "freemium"), allow you to present professional-
looking slides. Each one is "robust," a word used to mean it has a large
number of functions and features, some of which are helpful and some
of which are less useful for individual purposes. For example, you can
use the full range of fonts, although many of them are not appropriate
for presentations because they are hard to read. In this section we will
discuss the proper use of presentation slides, with the assumption that you
Exploring Public Speaking  189 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

understand the basics of cutting, pasting, inserting, etc. involved in these
products. You may have taken a class in high school where you learned
to use the technology, but that is not the same as learning to use them for
actual presentations.

The Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Presentation

Slides

In some industries and businesses, there is an assumption that speakers
will use presentation slides. They allow visualization of concepts, they
are easily portable, they can be embedded with videos and audio, words
can dance around the screen--why wouldn't a speaker use them? You
will probably also be expected to have slide presentations in future
assignments in college. Knowing how to use them, beyond the basic
technology, is vital to being a proficient presenter.

But why not use them? Franck Frommer, a French journalist and
communication expert, published the book How PowerPoint Makes
You Stupid (2012), whose title says it all. He criticizes the "linearity" of
PowerPoint and similar presentation software, meaning that audiences are
not encouraged to see the relationship of ideas and that PowerPoint hurts
critical thinking in the audience. Slide follows slide of bulleted information
without one slide being more important or the logical connections being
clear.

As recently as the mid-2000s, critics such as well-known graphic expert
and NASA consultant Edward Tufte (2005) charged that PowerPoint's
tendency to force the user to put a certain number of bullet points on each
slide in a certain format was a serious threat to the accurate presentation
of data. As Tufte put it, "the rigid slide-by-slide hierarchies, indifferent
to content, slice and dice the evidence into arbitrary compartments,
producing an anti-narrative with choppy continuity."

Tufte argues that poor decision making, such as was involved with
the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster, may have been related to
the shortcomings of such presentation aids in NASA meetings. While
more recent versions of PowerPoint and similar programs allow much
more creative freedom in designing slides, this freedom comes with
a responsibility--the user needs to take responsibility for using the
technology to support the speech and not get carried away with the many
special effects the software is capable of producing.

It should be mentioned here that Prezi helps address one of the major
criticisms of PowerPoint. Because Prezi, in its design stage, looks
something like a mind map on a very large canvas with grid lines, it allows
you to show the relationship and hierarchy of ideas better. For example,
you can see and design the slides so that the "Big Ideas" are in big circles
and the subordinate ideas are in smaller ones.
Exploring Public Speaking  190 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

In addition to recognizing the truth behind Frommer's and Tufte's
critiques, we have all sat through a presenter who committed the errors
of putting far too much text on the slide. When a speaker does this, the
audience is confused--do they read the text or listen to the speaker? An
audience member cannot do both. (Remember the pipeline graphic
in Chapter 7.) Then, the speaker feels the need to read the slides rather
than use PowerPoint for what it does best, visual reinforcement and
clarification. We have also seen many poorly designed PowerPoint slides,
either through haste or lack of knowledge: slides where the graphics are
distorted (elongated or squatty), words and graphics not balanced, text
too small, words printed over photographs, garish or nauseating colors,
or animated figures left up on the screen for too long and distracting the
audience. What about you? Can you think about PowerPoint "don'ts" that
have hurt your reception of a presentation or lecture? This would be a
good discussion for class, and a good way to know what not to do with
your own slides.

Creating Quality Slide Shows

Slides should show the principles of good design, which include unity,
emphasis or focal point, scale and proportion, balance, and rhythm
(Lauer & Pentak, 2000). Presenters should also pay attention to tone and
usability. With those principles in mind, here are some tips for creating
and then using presentation software.

Unity and Consistency

Generally it is best to use a single font for the text on your visuals so that
they look like a unified set. Or you can use two different fonts in consistent
ways, such as having all headings and titles in the same font and all bullet
points in the same font. Additionally, the background should probably
remain consistent, whether you choose one of the many design templates
or if you just opt for a background color.

In terms of unity, the adage, "Keep It Simple, Speaker" definitely applies
to presentation slides. Each slide should have one message, one photo,
one graphic. The audience members should know what they are supposed
to look at on the slide. A phrase to remember about presentation slides
and the wide range of design elements available is "Just because you can,
doesn't mean you should."

Another area related to unity and consistency, as well as audience
response, is the use of animation or movement. There are three types of
animation in slideshows. First, you can embed little characters or icons
that have movement. These may seem like fun, but they have limited use
and should not stay on the screen very long--you can use the second type
of animation to take them off the screen.
Exploring Public Speaking  191 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

That second type is the designed movement of text or objects on and off
the screen. Although using this function takes up time in preparing your
slides, especially if you want to do it well and be creative with it, it is
very useful. You can control what your audience is seeing. It also avoids
bringing up all the text and material on a slide at one time, which tempts
the audience to pay more attention to the screen than to you. Movement
on the screen attracts attention (see Factors of Attention in Chapter 7),
for better or worse. PowerPoint, for example, allows bouncing words,
pulsating text, swirling phrases, even Star Wars scroll, all of which may or
may not serve your purpose.

The third type of animation is called slide transitions, which is the design
of how the next slide appears. In PowerPoint you can have the slides
appear automatically or as blinds, as little checkerboards, from different
sides of the screen, in opening circles, etc. (You can also use sound effects,
but that is strongly discouraged.) In Prezi, the slides transition by zooming
in and out, which is a clever effect but does make some audience members
experience motion sickness. In general, you want to use a consistent
and efficient pattern of movement with the second and third types of
animation.

Emphasis, Focal Point, and Visibility

Several points should be made about how to make sure the audience sees
what they need to see on the slides.

    1. It is essential to make sure the information is large enough for the
        audience to see; and since the display size may vary according to
        the projector you are using, this is another reason for practicing in
        advance with the equipment you intend to use.

    2. The standard rule is for text is 7 X 7, or sometimes (if the screen is
        smaller) 6 X 6. Does this mean 49 or 36 words on the slide? No. It
        means, in the case of 7 X 7, that you should have no more than seven
        horizontal lines of text (this does not mean bullet points, but lines of
        text, including the heading) and the longest line should not exceed
        seven words.

    3. Following the 7 X 7 rule will keep you from putting too much
        information on a slide, and you should also avoid too many slides.
       Less sometimes really is more. Again, there is no hard and fast rule,
        but a ten-minute speech probably needs around ten slides, unless
       you can make a good argument for more based on the content of
        the speech. If, however, the slides are just text and no supporting
        graphics, more than ten is too many.

    4. Do not assume that all the built-in templates utilize highly visible
        text. Text should not be smaller than 22 point font for best visibility,
Exploring Public Speaking  192 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

                              and some of the templates use much smaller fonts than 22 point.
                              This is especially important in those situations where the speaker
                              creates handouts. Text smaller than 22 is very difficult to see on
                              handouts of your slides. (However, handouts are not necessarily
                              recommended for most situations.)

                           5. High contrast between the text and slides is extremely important.
                              White fonts against very dark backgrounds and black fonts against
                              very light backgrounds are probably your safest bet here. Remember
                              that the way it looks on your computer screen is not the exactly how
                              it will look when projected--the light is coming from a different
                              place. Avoid words on photos. Figure 9.21 shows a photo with the
                              words placed across the center of the image. Not only does this
                              obviously obscure some of the picture, but it also makes the words
                              difficult to read. Figure 9.22, by contrast, has the accompanying text
                              placed just blow the image, making both much easier to see, and a
                              citation is provided.

Exploring Public Speaking  193 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

6. Also in terms of visibility, most experts say that sans serif fonts
   such as Calibri, Arial, Tahoma, and Verdana are better for reading
   from screens than serif fonts such as Times New Roman, Bookface,
   Cambria, Georgia, or Garamond. Merriam-Webster (2018) defines
  "serif" as "any of the short lines stemming from and at an angle to the
   upper and lower ends of the strokes of a letter." Serifs are additions
   to the letters on different fonts that give them a different appearance
   and help the flow of eye when reading.

                           Figure 9.23 - Sample Slide for Critique.

How does the slide in Figure 9.23 stack up beside these rules for visibility?
You probably noticed that slide is a "fail" in terms of high contrast between
the font and background and the use of a block of text not broken up for
easy reading. The audience would feel like they are supposed to read it but
not be able to. Also, since the text is a quotation from John Dewey, the text
should have quotation marks around it.

Tone

Fonts, color, clip art, photographs, and templates all contribute to tone,
which is the attitude being conveyed in the slides. If you want a light
tone, such as for a speech about cruises, some colors (springtime, pastel,
cool, warm, or primary colors) and fonts (such as Comic Sans) and lots of
photographs will be more appropriate. For a speech about the Holocaust,
more somber colors and design elements would be more fitting, whereas
clip art would not be.

Scale and Proportion

Although there are several ways to think about scale and proportion, we
will discuss three here. First, bullet points. Bullet points infer that the
items in the bulleted list are equal and the sequence doesn't matter. If you
Exploring Public Speaking  194 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

want to communicate order, sequence, or priority, use numbers. Do not
mix outline points or numerical points with bullet points. Also, you should
not put your outline (Roman numerals, etc.) on the slide.

Bullet points should be short--not long, full sentences--but at the same
time should be long enough to mean something. In a speech on spaying
and neutering pets, the bullet point "pain" may be better replaced with
"Pet feels little pain." Second, when you are designing your slides, it is best
to choose a template and stick with it. If you input all your graphics and
material and then change the template, the format of the slide will change,
in some cases dramatically, and you will have distorted graphics and
words covered up. You will then have to redesign each slide, which can be
unnecessarily time-consuming.

The third aspect of scale and proportion is the relationship between the
graphics and text in terms of size. This aspect is discussed below in the
next section on "Balance." Also, a graphic should be surrounded by some
empty space and not just take up the whole slide.

Balance

In general you want symmetrical slides. Below are four examples of
slides that are unbalanced (Figures 9.24-9.27); the last one (Figure 9. 28)
achieves a better symmetry and design.

                             Figure 9.24 - This slide leaves too much "white space" below the text, leaving an
                           imbalance between the text and graphic; the graphic goes up into the title, and the

                                                               title could be centered.
Exploring Public Speaking  195 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

Figure 9.25 - This slide does not break the text up into bullets and is therefore hard
to read; the graphic is strangely small, and the heading is in a different font. Script

                         fonts are often hard to read on screens.

 Figure 9.26 - In this slide, similar problems from Figure 9.25 are repeated, but the
text is also too small and the graphic is distorted because it was not sized from the

                                             corner.
Exploring Public Speaking  196 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

                           Figure 9.27 - This slide is far too "busy." The additional clip art is not helpful, the font
                            is too small, and the ideas are disconnected. Having text in all caps is also difficult

                                                                        to read.

                           Figure 9.28 - This version provides more visual balance and does not violate the 7X7
                           rule. Probably a photograph would work better than clip art on this slide. It also has

                                                              a typo--can you find it?
Exploring Public Speaking  197 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

Rhythm in Presenting

The rhythm of your slide display should be reasonably consistent--you
would not want to display a dozen different slides in the first minute of
a five-minute presentation and then display only one slide per minute
for the rest of the speech. Timing them so that the audience can actually
take them in is important. Presenters often overdo the number of slides,
thinking they will get a better grade, but too many slides just causes
overkill.

If you can obtain a remote mouse to change slides, that can help you
feel independent of the mouse attached to the computer. However, you
have to practice with the remote "clicker." But if you have to use the
mouse to change slide, keep your hands off of it between clicks. We have
seen students wiggle the little arrow all over the screen. It is extremely
annoying.

Whether using a remote "clicker" or the attached mouse, you must attend
to the connection between what is on the screen and what you are actually
talking about at the moment. Put reminders in your notes about when you
need to change slides during your speech.

For better or worse, we have become very screen-oriented in our
communication, largely because screens change often and that constant
changing teaches us to expect new stimuli, which we crave. If the screen is
up but you are not talking about what is on the screen, it is very confusing
to the audience.

If you are using PowerPoint and if you are not talking about something
on a slide, hit the "B" key or the blank screen button on the remote
mouse. This action will turn the screen to black. You can also hit the "W"
key, which turns the screen to white, but that will make the audience
think something is coming. Unfortunately, the downside of the "B" key
action is that it will return you to the previous screen. To avoid this,
some presenters put a black slide between slides in the presentation so
that hitting the forward key gives the same effect, but hitting it again
takes them to a new screen. (Other programs have similar functions; for
example, if using Prezi, the "B" key also shows a black screen.)

In fact, a basic presentation rule is to show your visual aid only when you
are talking about it, and remove it when you no longer are talking about it.
Some other practical considerations are as follows:

    1. Be sure the file is saved in a format that will be "readable" on the
        computer where you are presenting. A common example is that a
        Keynote presentation (Apple) does not open on all PCs. You can
        save Keynote as a .ppt file for use on a PC. Likewise, if you chose to
        use Prezi or other web-based presentation software, you will need a
        strong, reliable Internet connection to show the slides.
Exploring Public Speaking  198 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

                           2. Any borrowed graphic must be cited on the slide where it is used;
                              the same would be true of borrowed textual material. Putting your
                              sources only on the last slide is insufficient. Your instructor may
                              require you to do so, but the borrowed material should also be cited
                              on the slide where it is located.

                           3. A very strong temptation for speakers is to look at the projected
                              image rather than the audience during the speech. This practice cuts
                              down on eye contact, of course, and is distracting for the audience.
                              Two solutions for that are to print your notes from the presentation
                              slides and/or use the slides as your note structure. Also remember
                              that if the image is on the computer monitor in front of you, it is on
                              the screen behind you.

                           4. Always remember--and this cannot be emphasized enough--
                              technology works for you, not you for the technology. The
                              presentation aids are aids, not the speech itself.

                           5. As mentioned before, sometimes life happens--technology does not
                              work. It could be that the projector bulb goes out or the Internet
                              connection is down. The show must go on.

                           6. If you are using a video or audio clip from an Internet source, it is
                              probably best to hyperlink the URL on one of the slides rather than
                              minimize the program and change to the Internet site. You can do
                              this by highlighting a key word on the slide, right clicking to find
                             "hyperlink," and then pasting the URL there. Although you can also
                              embed video in a PowerPoint, it makes the file extremely large and
                              that may cause problems if you want to send it through an email
                              system that limits the size of attachment. Posting the file to the
                              Cloud or using Google slides or Prezi would allow the embedded
                              video to be accessed.

                           7. Finally, it is common for speakers to think "the slide changes, so the
                              audience know there is a change, so I don't need a verbal transition."
                              Please do not fall into this trap. Verbal transitions are just as, and
                              maybe more, necessary for a speech using slides. This principle was
                              mentioned in Chapter 6, Section 3.

9.5 - Low-Tech Presentation Aids

One reason for using digital media is that they can't be prone to physical
damage in the form of smudges, scratches, dents, and rips. Unlike posters
and objects, presentation software can be kept professional looking if you
have to carry them through a rainstorm or blizzard. However, there are
times when it makes sense to use "low-tech" media for presentations. Here
are some directions for those times.
Exploring Public Speaking  199 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

Dry-Erase Board

If you use a chalkboard or dry-erase board, you will be perceived as not
using a prepared presentation aid. However, numerous speakers do utilize
chalk and dry-erase boards effectively. Typically, these speakers use the
chalk or dry-erase board for interactive components of a speech. For
example, maybe you're giving a speech in front of a group of executives.
You may have a PowerPoint all prepared, but at various points in
your speech you want to get your audience's responses. (More recent
technologies allow you to do the interaction on the screen, but this would
have to be supported by the environment.) Chalk or dry-erase boards
are very useful when you want to visually show information that you are
receiving from your audience. If you ever use a chalk or dry-erase board,
follow these four simple rules:

    1. Write large enough so that everyone in the room can see (which is
        harder than it sounds; it is also hard to write and talk at the same
        time!).

    2. Print legibly; don't write in cursive script.

    3. Write short phrases; don't take time to write complete sentences.

    4. Be sure you have markers that will not go dry, and clean the board
        afterward.

Flipchart

A flipchart is useful for situations when you want to save what you have
written for future reference or to distribute to the audience after the
presentation. As with whiteboards, you will need good markers and
readable handwriting, as well as a strong easel to keep the flipchart
upright.

Posters

You may have the opportunity in your college years to attend or participate
in a "poster session." These are times during an academic conference
where visitors can view a well-designed poster depicting a research project
and discuss it one-on-one with the researcher. These kinds of posters are
quite large and involve a great deal of work. They can be generated from
PowerPoint but require a special printer.

If you are giving a poster presentation, that is still a kind of public
speaking, only with a smaller audience and in a shorter format. You
should be able to explain your research clearly to listeners who have not
taken advanced courses in our subject area. You'll notice there are many
photos in this textbook of students in poster sessions because they are
an excellent way to show research in a dialogic, "give and take" kind of
Exploring Public Speaking  200 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

way. Passion, organization, eye contact, fluency, vocabulary, and all the
other aspects of public speaking discussed in this book apply to poster
sessions. Being able to answer questions concisely is important, also, since
the listeners will need to move on to the next poster. Just as with other
speeches, you should practice for your poster session.

Otherwise, posters are probably not the best way to approach presentation
aids in a formal speech. There are problems with visibility and size as
well as portability. Avoid producing a presentation aid that looks like you
simply cut pictures out of magazines or from the Internet and pasted them
on. Slapping some text and images on a board looks unprofessional and
will not be viewed as credible or effective.

Handouts

Handouts are appropriate for delivering information that audience
members can take away with them. As we will see, handouts require a
great deal of management if they are to contribute to your credibility as a
speaker.

First, make sure the handout is worth the trouble of making, copying, and
distributing it. Does the audience really need the handout? Second, make
sure to bring enough copies of the handout for each audience member
to get one. Having to share or look on with one's neighbor does not
contribute to a professional image. Under no circumstances should you
ever provide a single copy of a handout to pass around. It is distracting
and everyone will see it at different times in the speech, which is also true
about passing any object around the room.

There are three possible times to distribute handouts: before you begin
your speech, during the speech, and after your speech is over. Naturally,
if you need your listeners to follow along in a handout, you will need to
distribute it before your speech begins. If you have access to the room
ahead of time, place a copy of the handout at or on each seat in the
audience. If not, ask a volunteer to distribute them as quickly as possible
while you prepare to begin speaking. If the handout is a "takeaway," leave
it on a table near the door so that those audience members who are
interested can take one on their way out; in this case, don't forget to tell
them to do so as you conclude your speech. It is almost never appropriate
to distribute handouts during your speech, as it is distracting, takes up
time, and interrupts the pace of your presentation.

Conclusion

To finish this chapter, we will recap and remind you about the principles
of effective presentation aids. Whether your aid is a slide show, object,
person, or dry erase board, these standards are essential:
Exploring Public Speaking  201 Chapter 9: Presentation Aids in Speaking
Version 4.2

     Presentation aids must be easily seen or heard by your audience.
      Squinting and head-cocking are not good reactions. Neither should
      they look at the screen the whole time and ignore the speaker.

     Presentation aids must be portable, easily handled, and efficient.

     Presentation aids should disappear when not in use.

     Presentation aids should be aesthetically pleasing, which includes
      in good taste. Avoid shock value just for shock value. You might
      want to show pictures of diseased organs and teeth, deformities, or
      corpses for your speech to make a point, but context is everything.
      Will your audience react so strongly that the overall point is missed?
      Additionally, electronic media today allows you to create very "busy"
       slides with varieties of fonts, colors, collages of photos, etc. Keep in
      mind the principles of unity and focal point.

     Color is another aesthetic aspect. Some colors are just more soothing,
      readable, and appropriate than others. Also, the color on your slides
      may be different when projected from what is on your computer.
      Finally, presentation aids must support your speech and have high
      relevance to your content.

This chapter has covered a wide range of information about all kinds
of audio and visual aids, but audiences today expect and appreciate
professionally designed and handled presentation aids. The stakes are
higher now, but the tools are many.

Something to Think About

What are some attention problems caused by using projection equipment
during a speech?

Which kind of presentation aid would be most useful for the following?

    1. data on how the average American family uses its income
    2. discussing the number of wind turbines in five Midwestern states
    3. explaining the changes in enrollment of minority students at your

        college over 20 years
    4. a speech on the chambers of the human heart
    5. a speech on the differences between North and South Korea
    6. a speech the Sutton Hoo archaeological dig in England

Watch a TED Talk and note how the speaker uses-or doesn't-slides.

        Language     10.1 - What Language Is and Does

any formal system    The Ancient Romans who studied and taught rhetoric divided its study
of gestures, signs,  and process into five "canons:" invention, disposition, style, memory, and
sounds, and symbols  delivery. The term "style" does not refer to clothing styles but language
used or conceived    choices. Should a public speaker use very basic language because the
as a means of        audience is unfamiliar with his topic? Or more technical language with
communicating        many acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon because the audience has
thought, either      expertise in the topic? Or academic language with abstract vocabulary, or
through written,     flowery, poetic language with lots of metaphors and images? Or emotional
enacted, or spoken   language to inspire the audience? Perhaps you have never thought
means                about those questions, but they are ones that influence both the clarity
                     of the message as well as the credibility a speaker will gain during the
                     presentation.

                     However, we would be wrong if we treated language as an "add-on" to
                     the ideas and structure of the speech. Language is far too complex
                     and foundational to our lives for us to consider it as an afterthought
                     for a speech. In this chapter we will look at how language functions in
                     communication, what standards language choices should meet in public
                     speaking, and how you can become more proficient in using language in
                     public speaking.

                     Language is any formal system of gestures, signs, sounds, and symbols
                     used or conceived as a means of communicating thought, either through
                     written, enacted, or spoken means. Linguists believe there are far more
                     than 6,900 languages and distinct dialects spoken in the world today
                     (Anderson, 2012). The language spoken by the greatest number of people
                     on the planet is Mandarin (a dialect of Chinese). Other widely spoken
                     languages are English, Spanish, and Arabic. English is spoken widely
                     on every content, but Mandarin is spoken by the most people. While we
                     tend to think of language in its print form, for most of history and for
                     most of the world, language has been or is spoken, or oral. More than half
                     of spoken languages have not even been put into written form yet (See
                     https://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/langhotspots/fastfacts.html for
                     more facts about world languages).

                     We have already seen in earlier chapters that public speakers have to make
                     adjustments to language for audiences. For example, spoken language is
                     more wordy and repetitive than written language needs to be or should
                     be. Spoken language uses more simple and compound sentences than
                     compound or compound/complex ones. It is accompanied by gestures,
                     vocal emphasis, and facial expressions. Additionally, spoken language
                     includes more personal pronouns and more expressive, emotional,
                     colloquial, slang, and nonstandard words.

                     The study of language is, believe it or not, controversial. If you are an
                     education, communication, social sciences, pre-law, or English major, you

will somewhere in your college career come up against this truth. While
we use words every day and don't think about it, scholars in different
fields concern themselves with how we choose words, why we choose
words, what effect words have on us, and how the powerful people of the
world use words. One theory of language, general semantics, says that
meaning resides in the person using the word, not in the word ("Basic
Understandings," 2015). It is helpful for the public speaker to keep this
mind, especially in regard to denotative and connotative (see Chapter
1) meaning. Wrench, Goding, Johnson, and Attias (2011) use this example
to explain the difference:

         When we hear or use the word "blue," we may be referring to
         a portion of the visual spectrum dominated by energy with a
         wavelength of roughly 440-490 nano-meters. You could also say
         that the color in question is an equal mixture of both red and green
         light. While both of these are technically correct ways to interpret
         the word "blue," we're pretty sure that neither of these definitions
         is how you thought about the word. When hearing the word
        "blue," you may have thought of your favorite color, the color of
         the sky on a spring day, or the color of a really ugly car you saw
         in the parking lot. When people think about language, there are
         two different types of meanings that people must be aware of:
         denotative and connotative. (p. 407)

Denotative meaning is the "objective" meaning that the majority of people
would associate with a word. We sometimes refer to denotative meanings
as dictionary definitions. The [scientific] definitions provided in the first
two sentences of the quotation above are examples of definitions that
might be found in a dictionary. Connotative meaning is the idea suggested
by or associated with a word at a cultural or personal level. In addition to
the examples above, the word "blue" can evoke many other ideas:

     State of depression (feeling blue)
     Indication of winning (a blue ribbon)
     Side during the Civil War (blues vs. grays)
     Sudden event (out of the blue).
     States that lean toward the Democratic Party in their voting
     A slang expression for obscenity (blue comedy)
     In plural form, a genre of music (the blues)
Language is not just something we use; it is part of who we are and how we
think. When we talk about language, we have to use words to do so, and
language is also hard to separate from who we are. Each of us has our own
way of expressing ourselves. Even more, it is almost impossible to separate
language from thinking. Many people think the federal government
should enact a law that only English is spoken in the United States (in
government offices, schools, etc.). This is opposed by some groups because
it seems discriminatory to immigrants and non-native speakers of English,

      Euphemism       and overlooks the reality that one's language is often part of their identity
                      and self-definition.
language devices
often used to make    Language is not only about who we are; it is also about power or at least is
something unpleasant  used by powerful people. In fact, some educational and political theorists
sound more tolerable  believe that language is all about power. For instance, euphemisms are
                      often used to make something unpleasant sound more tolerable. In one of
                      the more well-known examples of the use of euphemisms, the government
                      commonly tries to use language to "soften" what many would see as bad.
                      During the Vietnam War, "air support" was invented to cover the real
                      meaning: "bombing." When you hear air support, you probably think
                      "planes bringing supplies in," not "bombing."

                      Even today, terms like "revenue enhancement" are used instead of "tax
                      increases." The word euphemism has at its core "eu," (which is a prefix
                      from Greek meaning "good" or "pleasant") and "phem" (a root word
                      for speaking). Just as blasphemy is speaking evil about sacred things,
                      "euphemism" is "pleasant speaking about unpleasant things." We use
                      euphemisms every day, but we have to be careful not to obscure meaning
                      or use them deceptively.

                      There's an old saying in competitive debate, "He who defines the terms
                      wins the debate." This statements expresses another way in which
                      language can be used for power: who determines the meaning of words?
                      Feminists in the 1970s argued that the common way we use English
                      language was biased against women. King-sized means "big and powerful,"
                      but "queen-sized" means "for overweight women." "Master" was not
                      equivalent to "mistress." "Madame" has taken on a negative connotation,
                      even though it should have been equivalent to "sir." Many words referring
                      to women had to add a suffix that was often "less than," such as "-ess" or
                      "-ette" or "co-ed." In the last thirty years we have gotten away from that,
                      so that we typically hear a female actor referred to as "actor" rather than
                      "actress," but old habits die hard.

                      This example brings up another issue with language: words change
                      meaning over time, or more specifically, the meaning we attached to
                      them changes. "Pretty" used to mean "clever" 250 years ago. "Prevent"
                      meant to "precede," not to keep from happening. Language is simply not
                      static, as much as we might like it to be. One of the main reasons we find
                      Shakespeare daunting is that so many of the Elizabethan words are either
                      no longer used or their meanings have changed. You can probably have
                      an interesting discussion in class with your instructor about the dynamic
                      nature of language and meaning, even in our lifetimes.

                      With regard to the use of language for power, even unknowingly,

                      We see another example of power in language in the abortion debate.
                      Prior to 1973, abortions could be obtained legally, to some extent, in three
                      states: California, New York, and Hawaii. After the Roe v. Wade decision
Exploring Public Speaking  207                                                 Chapter 10: Language

Version 4.2

in January of 1973, they could, at least theoretically, be obtained in all
fifty states. Roe v. Wade did not make abortions legal so much as it made
anti-abortion laws illegal or unconstitutional. Practically, the effect was
basically the same, but we are often imprecise in our use of language. The
people who were against abortion were now on the defensive, and they had
to start fighting. It's generally better to be "pro-"something rather than
"anti-"something, so they became "pro-life." Those favoring abortion rights
then automatically became "pro-death." One side had defined the terms
of the debate, and the other had to come up with something comparable.
"Pro-choice" takes advantage of the American belief in personal freedoms.

Related to using language with and for power, political opponents often
try to simplify complex debate through slogans or short memorable
phrases that call on particular values: concepts of what the United States
("America") should be, standards of morality, or definitions of freedom. In
these cases connotation can overtake denotation. We'll use "family" as an
example, although there are others. When some political groups use the
word "family," they mean female mother and male father who are legally
married, and child(ren). Other groups seek to define or put different
boundaries around the word "family"-same sex couples, a single mother
or father and children, or groups of persons living together. A word that
should connote safety becomes about political power and argument.

Can you think of how advertisers choose words in a way that is meant
to affect your thinking and see an object in different ways? Realtors sell
"homes," not houses. McDonald's sells "Happy Meals" even though it is
essentially the same food items they sell that are not "Happy Meals." As
you progress as a public speaker, you will become more aware of the power
certain words have over audiences. An ethical communicator will use
language in a way that encourages respect for others, freedom of thought,
and informed decision making. First, however, a speaker should seek to
meet the standards of clarity, effectiveness, appropriateness, and elegance
in language, which are discussed in the next section.

10.2 - Standards for Language in Public

Speaking

Clear language is powerful language. Clarity is the first concern of a public
speaker when it comes to choosing how to phrase the ideas of their speech.
If you are not clear, specific, precise, detailed, and sensory with your
language, you won't have to worry about being emotional or persuasive,
because you won't be understood. There are many aspects of clarity in
language, listed below.

your audience           Unfortunately, when abstract language is used, the images evoked
                        might not be the ones you really want to evoke. A word such as "art" is
                        very abstract; it brings up a range of mental pictures or associations:
                        dance, film, theatre, painting, drama, a child's drawing on a refrigerator,
                        sculpture, a violin concerto, etc. When asked to identify what an abstract
                        term like "art" means, twenty people will have twenty "mental pictures."

Version 4.2

In order to show how language should be more specific, the "ladder of               Literal language
abstraction" (Hayakawa, 1939) was developed. The ladder of abstraction
in Figure 10.1 helps us see how our language can range from abstract              language that does not

everyone is familiar with Michelangelo's David, but Bernini's version             language that uses

Bernini's is as much a symbol of the Baroque Age as Michelangelo's is             to compare things that

are shown in Figure 10.2. A picture is worth a thousand words, right?                      Similes

Related to the issue of specific vs. abstract is the use of the right word.       a figure of speech
Mark Twain is quoted as saying, "The difference between the right word            involving the
and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a               comparison of one
lightning bug." For example, the words "prosecute" and "persecute" are            thing with another
commonly confused, but not interchangeable. Two others are peremptory/            thing of a different
pre-emptive and prerequisites/perquisites. Can you think of other such            kind (specifically using

does not use comparisons like similes and metaphors; figurative
language uses comparisons with objects, animals, activities, roles, or
historical or literary figures. Literal says, "The truck is fast." Figurative
says "The truck is as fast as..." or "The truck runs like..." or "He drives that
truck like Kyle Busch at Daytona." Similes use some form of "like" or "as"
in the comparisons. Metaphors are direct comparisons, such as "He is
a zombie before he gets his coffee in the morning." Here are some more
examples of metaphors:

         Love is a battlefield.

language that makes     how metaphor is stronger than simile, think of the difference "Love is a

taste, see, hear, and   pick their metaphors and not overuse them. Also, avoid mixed metaphors,

language                The mixed metaphor here is the use of "up a river" and "change horses"
                        together; you would either need to use an all river-based metaphor
                        (dealing with boats, water, tides, etc.) or a metaphor dealing specifically
                        with horses. The example above about a "new crop" "being born," is
                        actually a mixed metaphor, since crops aren't born, but planted and
                        harvested. Additionally, in choosing metaphors and similes, speakers want
                        to avoid clichs, discussed next.

                        Clichs are expressions, usually similes, that are predictable. You know
                        what comes next because they are overused and sometimes out of date.
                        Clichs do not have to be linguistic--we often see clichs in movies, such as
                        horror films where you know exactly what will happen next! It is not hard
                        to think of clichs: "Scared out of my . . ." or "When life gives you lemons. .
                        ." or "All is fair in. . ." or, when describing a reckless driver, "She drives like
                        a . . . " If you filled in the blanks with "wits," "make lemonade," "love and
                        war," "or "maniac," those are clichs.

                        Clichs are not just a problem because they are overused and boring;
                        they also sometimes do not communicate what you need, especially to
                        audiences whose second language is English. "I will give you a ballpark
                        figure" is not as clear as "I will give you an estimate," and assumes the
                        person is familiar with American sports. Therefore, they also will make
                        you appear less credible in the eyes of the audience because you are not
                        analyzing them and taking their knowledge, background, and needs into
                        account. In our diverse world, being aware of your audience members
                        whose first language is not English is a valuable tool for a speaker.

                        Additionally, some clichs are so outdated that no one knows what they
                        mean. "The puppy was as cute as a button" is an example. You might hear
                        your great-grandmother say this, but who really thinks buttons are cute
                        nowadays? Clichs are also imprecise. Although clichs do have a comfort
                        level to them, comfort puts people to sleep. Find fresh ways, or just use
                        basic, literal language. "The bear was big" is imprecise in terms of giving
                        your audience an idea of how frightful an experience of facing a bear
                        would be. "The bear was as big as a house" is a clich and an exaggeration,
                        therefore imprecise. A better alternative might be, "The bear was two feet
Exploring Public Speaking  211                                                Chapter 10: Language

Version 4.2

taller than I am when he stood on his back legs." The opposite of clichs is
clear, vivid, and fresh language.

In trying to avoid clichs, use language with imagery, or sensory
language. This is language that makes the recipient smell, taste, see, hear,
and feel a sensation. Think of the word "ripe." What is "ripe?" Do ripe
fruits feel a certain way? Smell a certain way? Taste a certain way? Ripe
is a sensory word. Most words just appeal to one sense, like vision. Think
of color. How can you make the word "blue" more sensory? How can you
make the word "loud" more sensory? How would you describe the current
state of your bedroom or dorm room to leave a sensory impression? How
would you describe your favorite meal to leave a sensory impression? or a
thunderstorm?

Poetry uses much imagery; for example, in "Daffodils" by William
Wordsworth, notice the metaphors ("daffodils dancing;" "host," an old
English word for large heavenly armies); simile ("as the stars"); and the
imagery ("golden" rather than "yellow," and other appeals to feeling and
sight):

        A host, of golden daffodils;

         Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

         Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

         Continuous as the stars that shine

        And twinkle on the Milky Way.

While rhetoric is not poetry, poetry's use of creative and clear language
can inspire us to do so in public speaking. To conclude this section on
clarity, we will use a quotation from psychologist and well-known speaker
Brene Brown: "Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind" (Brown, 2018). She uses

                      Language achieves effectiveness by communicating the right message
                      to the audience. Clarity contributes to effectiveness, but there are some
                      other aspects of effectiveness. To that end, language should be a means
                      of inclusion and identification, rather than exclusion. Let's establish
                      this truth: Language is for communication; communication is symbolic,
                      and language is the main (but not only) symbol system we use for
                      communication. If language is for communication, then its goal should be
                      to bring people together and to create understanding.

                      Unfortunately, we habitually use language for exclusion rather than
                      inclusion. We can push people away with our word choices rather than
                      bringing them together. We discussed the concepts of stereotyping
                      and totalizing in Chapter 2, and they serve as examples of exclusionary
                      language. What follows are some examples of language that can exclude
                      members of your audience from understanding what you are saying.

                      Jargon

                      Jargon (which we discussed in Chapter 2) used in your profession or
                      hobby should only be used with audiences who share your profession
                      or hobby. Not only will the audience members who don't share your
                      profession or hobby miss your meaning, but they will feel that you are
                      not making an honest effort to communicate or are setting yourself above
                      them in intelligence or rank. Lawyers are often accused of using "legalese,"
                      but other professions and groups do the same. If audience members do not
                      understand your references, jargon, or vocabulary, it is unlikely that they
                      will sit there and say, "This person is so smart! I wish I could be smart like
                      this speaker." The audience member is more likely to be thinking, "Why
                      can't this speaker use words we understand and get over themselves?"

                      What this means for you is that you need to be careful about assumptions
                      of your audience's knowledge and their ability to interpret jargon. For
                      example, if you are trying to register for a class at the authors' college and
                      your advisor asks for the CRN, most other people would have no idea what
                      you are talking about (course reference number). Acronyms, such NPO,
                      are common in jargon. Those trained in the medical field know it is based
                      on nil per os, the Latin for "nothing by mouth," but that doesn't translate
                      as an acronym in English. The military has many acronyms, such as MOS
                      (military occupational specialty, or career field in civilian talk). If you are
                      speaking to an audience who does not know the jargon of your field, using
                      it will only make them annoyed by the lack of clarity.

Sometimes we are not even aware of our jargon and its inadvertent effects.                 Slang

she heard that she had been "purged." The word sounds much worse than           a type of language

Slang                                                                           or group that others
                                                                                may not understand
The whole point of slang is for a subculture or group to have its own code,
almost like secret words. Once slang is understood by the larger culture,
it is no longer slang and may be classified as "informal" or "colloquial"
language. "Bling" was slang; now it's in the dictionary. Sports have a great
deal of slang used by the players and fans that then gets used in everyday
language. For example, "That was a slam dunk" is used to describe
something easy, not just in basketball.

Complicated vocabulary

If a speaker used the word "recalcitrant," some audience members would
know the meaning or figure it out ("Calci-"is like calcium, calcium is
hard, etc.), but many would not. It would make much more sense for
them to use a word readily understandable-"stubborn." Especially in oral
communication, we should use language that is immediately accessible.
However, do not take this to mean "dumb down for your audience." It
means being clear and not showing off. For a speaker to say "I am
cognizant of the fact that..." instead of "I know" or "I am aware of..." adds
little to communication.

Profanity and cursing

It is difficult to think of many examples, other than artistic or comedy
venues, where profanity or cursing would be effective or useful with most
audiences, so this kind of language is generally discouraged.

Credibility

Another aspect of effectiveness is that your language should enhance your
credibility. First, audiences trust speakers who use clear, vivid, respectful,
engaging, and honest language. On the other hand, audiences tend not
to trust speakers who use language that excludes others or who exhibit
uneducated language patterns. All of us make an occasional grammatical
or usage error. However, constant verb and pronoun errors and just
plain getting words confused will hurt the audience's belief that you are
competent and knowledgeable. In addition, a speaker who uses language
and references that are not immediately accessible or that are unfamiliar
will have diminished credibility. Finally, you should avoid the phrase "I

grammatical structures     Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in a sentence or passage. As
                           such, it is a kind of rhyme. Minister Tony Campolo said, "When Jesus told

       Hyperbole           from his 1961 inaugural address is one of the most quoted examples of
intentional                antithesis: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can
exaggeration for effect    do for your country." In that speech he gave another example, "If a free
                           society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are
                           rich."

                           Parallelism is the repetition of sentence structures. It can be useful for
                           stating your main ideas. Which one of these sounds better?

                                   "Give me liberty or I'd rather die."

                                   "Give me liberty or give me death."

disparaged for being the oldest president (up to that point in history),
would joke about his age. In one case he said, "The chamber is celebrating
an important milestone this week: your 70th anniversary. I remember the
day you started."

Irony is the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally
signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect. Although
most people think they understand irony as sarcasm (such as saying
to a friend who trips, "That's graceful"), it is a much more complicated
topic. A speaker may use it when they profess to say one thing but clearly
mean something else or say something that is obviously untrue and
everyone would recognize that and understand the purpose. Irony in oral
communication can be difficult to use in a way that affects everyone in the
audience the same way.

Using these techniques alone will not make you an effective speaker.
Dr. King and President Kennedy combined them with strong metaphors
and images as well; for example, Dr. King described the promises of the
founding fathers as a "blank check" returned with the note "insufficient
funds" as far as the black Americans of his time were concerned. That was
a very concrete, human, and familiar metaphor to his listeners and still
speaks to us today.

Appropriateness

Appropriateness relates to several categories involving how persons
and groups should be referred to and addressed based on inclusiveness
and context. The term "politically correct" has been overused to describe
the growing sensitivity to how the power of language can marginalize or
exclude individuals and groups. While there are silly extremes such as the
term "vertically challenged" for "short," these humorous examples obscure
the need to be inclusive about language. Overall, people and groups

identifies with based
on a common culture    Gender-Inclusive Language

                       The first common form of non-inclusive language is language that
                       privileges one of the sexes over the other. There are three common
                       problem areas that speakers run into while speaking: using "he" as generic,
                       using "man" to mean all humans, and gender-typing jobs. Consider the
                       statement, "Every morning when an officer of the law puts on his badge,
                       he risks his life to serve and protect his fellow citizens." Obviously, both
                       male and female police officers risk their lives when they put on their
                       badges.

                       A better way to word the sentence would be, "Every morning when officers
                       of the law put on their badges, they risk their lives to serve and protect
                       their fellow citizens." Notice that in the better sentence, we made the
                       subject plural ("officers") and used neutral pronouns ("they" and "their")
                       to avoid the generic "he." However, it is now grammatically acceptable
                       to use the pronoun "they," "their," and "them" for singular antecedents.
                       Likewise, speakers of English have traditionally used terms like "man,"
                       and "mankind" when referring to both females and males. Instead of using
                       the word "man," use "humans."

                       The last common area where speakers get into trouble with gender and
                       language has to do with job titles. For example, it is not unusual for people
                       to assume, even in 2020, that doctors are male and nurses are female.
                       This, despite the fact that 35% of all physicians are female and 60% under
                       the age of 35 are female (Johnson, 2018). As a result, they may say "she
                       is a woman doctor" or "he is a male nurse" when mentioning someone's
                       occupation, perhaps not realizing that the statements "she is a doctor" and
                       "he is a nurse" already inform the listener as to the gender of the person
                       holding that job.

                       Ethnic Identity

                       Ethnic identity refers to a group an individual identifies with based
                       on a common culture. For example, within the United States we have
                       numerous ethnic groups, including Italian Americans, Irish Americans,
                       Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Cuban Americans, and
                       Mexican Americans. Avoid statements such as "The committee is made
                       up of four women and a Vietnamese man," and replace it with "The
                       committee is made up of five people."

                       If for some reason gender and ethnicity have to be mentioned--and almost
                       always it does not--the gender and ethnicity of each member should
                       be mentioned equally. "The committee is made up of three European-
Exploring Public Speaking  217                                                 Chapter 10: Language

Version 4.2

American women, one Latina, and one Vietnamese male." In recent
years, there has been a trend toward steering inclusive language away
from broad terms like "Asians" and "Hispanics" because these terms are
not considered precise labels for the groups they actually represent. Use
Korean-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Mexican-Americans, etc. to
be more precise. If you want to be safe, the best thing you can do is ask
a couple of people who belong to an ethnic group how they prefer to be
referred to in that context.

Disability

The last category of exclusive versus inclusive language that causes
problems for some speakers relates to individuals with physical or
intellectual disabilities or forms of mental illness. Sometimes it happens
that we take a characteristic of someone and make that the totality or all
of what that person is. For example, some people are still uncomfortable
around persons who use wheelchairs and don't know how to react. They
may totalize and think that the wheelchair defines and therefore limits
the user. The person in the wheelchair might be a great guitarist, sculptor,
parent, public speaker, or scientist, but those qualities are not seen, only
the wheelchair.

Although the terms "visually impaired" and "hearing impaired" are
sometimes used for "blind" and "deaf," this is another situation where the
person should be referred to as they prefer. "Hearing impaired" denotes a
wide range of hearing deficit, as does "visually impaired. "Deaf" and "blind"
are not generally considered offensive by these groups.

Another example is how to refer to what used to be called "autism." Saying
someone is "autistic" is similar to the word "retarded" in that neither is
appropriate. Preferable terms are "a person with an autism diagnosis" or
"a person on the autism spectrum." In place of "retarded," "a person with
intellectual (or developmental) disabilities" should be used. Likewise,
slang words for mental illness should always be avoided, such as "crazy" or
"mental." In general, be careful in professional and public speaking settings
of using any slang that has crept into the language and diminishes people
or their conditions. A few years ago the inappropriate "going postal" was a
slang term used to refer to someone having a dangerous outburst of anger.

Other Types of Appropriateness

Language in a speech should be appropriate to the speaker and the
speaker's background and personality, to the context, to the audience,
and to the topic. Let's say that you're an engineering student. If you're
giving a presentation in an engineering class, you can use language that
other engineering students will know. On the other hand, if you use
that engineering vocabulary in a public speaking class, many audience
members will not understand you. As another example, if you are speaking
Exploring Public Speaking  218  Chapter 10: Language

Version 4.2

             about the Great Depression to an audience of young adults or recent
             immigrants, you can't assume they will know the meaning of terms like
             "New Deal" and "WPA," which would be familiar to an audience of senior
             citizens. Audience analysis is a key factor in choosing the language to use
             in a speech.

             10.3 - Developing Your Ability to Use Effective

             Language in Public Speaking

             At this point, we will make some applications and suggestions about using
             language as you grow as a public speaker.

             First, get in the habit of using "stipulated definitions" with concrete
             examples (defining operationally). In other words, define your terms for
             the audience. If you are using jargon, a technical term, a word that has
             multiple meanings in different contexts, or an often-misunderstood word,
             you can say at the beginning of the body of your speech, "In this speech I
             am going to be using the word,"X," and what I mean by it is..." And then
             the best way to define a word is with a picture or example of what you
             mean, and perhaps also an example of what you don't mean (visual aids
             can help here). Don't worry; this is not insulting to most audiences if the
             word is technical or unfamiliar to them. On the other hand, as mentioned
             earlier in the textbook, providing dictionary definitions of common words
             such as "love" or "loyalty" would be insulting to an audience, pretty boring,
             and a waste of time.

             Second, develop specific language. The general semantics movement
             suggested ways to develop more specific language that reflects the
             imperfection of our perceptions and the fact that reality changes. You can
             develop specific language by the following:

                  Distinguishing between individuals and the group (that is, avoid
                    stereotyping). No individual represents all the other individuals of
                    their ethnicity, culture, nationality, religion, gender, etc.

                  Specifying time and place of behavior instead of making broad
                    statements. What was a true of a person in 1999 is not necessarily
                    true of the person now.

                  Using names for jobs or roles ("accountants," "administrative
                    assistants," "instructors") instead of "people" or "workers."

                  Avoid "always/never" language. "Always" and "never" usually do not
                    reflect reality and tend to make listeners defensive.

                  Avoid confusing opinion for fact. If I say, "Fast and Furious 9 is a
                    stupid movie," I am stating an opinion in the language of fact. If
                    you preface opinions with "I believe," or "It is my opinion" you will

Version 4.2

       be truthful and gain the appearance of being fair-minded and non-
      -dogmatic. What should be said is "The first time I saw a Fast and
       Furious movie, I didn't understand the history of the franchise," or "I
       really am just not a fan of car movies." These examples sentence are
       more specific, clear, and honest about one's own opinions than "Fast
       and Furious 9 is a stupid movie." Using this kind of language also
       helps make the speaker seem less dogmatic and closed-minded.

Third, personalize your language. In a speech it's fine to use personal
pronouns as opposed to third person. That means "I," "me," "we," "us,"
"you," etc. are often helpful in a speech. It gives more immediacy to the
speech. Be careful of using "you" for examples that might be embarrassing
or inapplicable. "Let's say you are arrested for possession of a concealed
weapon," sounds like the audience members are potential criminals.

Finally, develop your vocabulary, but not to show it off. One of the benefits
of a college education is that your vocabulary will expand greatly, and
it should. A larger vocabulary will give you access to more complicated
reading material and allow you to understand the world better. But
knowing the meaning of a more complicated word doesn't mean you have
to use it with every audience.

Conclusion

Although the placement of this chapter may seem to indicate that
language choices, or what the ancient rhetoricians called "style," are not
as important as other parts of speaking, language choices are important
from the very beginning of your speech preparation, even to your research
and choice of search terms. Audience analysis will help you to develop
language that is clear, vivid, appropriate, credible, and persuasive.

             11.1 - The Importance of Delivery

             As we stated in Chapter 1, some surveys indicate that many people claim
             to fear public speaking more than death, but this finding is somewhat
             misleading. No one is afraid of writing their speech or conducting the
Exploring Public Speaking  221                                                   Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

research. Instead, people generally only fear the delivery aspect of the
speech, which, compared to the amount of time you will put into writing
the speech (days, hopefully), will be the shortest part of the speech
giving process (5-8 minutes, generally, for classroom speeches). The
irony, of course, is that delivery, being the thing people fear the most, is
simultaneously the aspect of public speaking that will require the least
amount of time.

Consider this scenario about two students, Bob and Chris. Bob spends
weeks doing research and crafting a beautifully designed speech that, on
the day he gets in front of the class, he messes up a little because of nerves.
While he may view it as a complete failure, his audience will have gotten
a lot of good information and most likely written off his mistakes due to
nerves, since they would be nervous in the same situation.

Chris, on the other hand, does almost no preparation for his speech, but,
being charming and comfortable in front of a crowd, smiles a lot while
providing virtually nothing of substance. The audience takeaway from
Chris's speech is, "I have no idea what he was talking about" and other
feelings ranging from "He's good in front of an audience" to "I don't trust
him." So the moral here is that a well-prepared speech that is delivered
poorly is still a well-prepared speech, whereas a poorly written speech
delivered superbly is still a poorly written speech.

We realize that delivery is what you are probably most concerned about
when it comes to giving speeches, so this chapter is designed to help you
achieve the best delivery possible and eliminate some of the nervousness
you might be feeling. To do that, we should first dismiss the myth that
public speaking is just reading and talking at the same time. You already
know how to read, and you already know how to talk, which is why you're
taking a class called "public speaking" and not one called "public talking"
or "public reading."

Speaking in public has more formality than talking. During a speech, you
should present yourself professionally. This doesn't necessarily mean you
must wear a suit or "dress up" unless your instructor asks you to. However,
it does mean making yourself presentable by being well-groomed and
wearing clean, appropriate clothes. It also means being prepared to use
language correctly and appropriately for the audience and the topic, to
make eye contact with your audience, and to look like you know your topic
very well.

While speaking has more formality than "talking," it has less formality
than reading. Speaking allows for flexibility, meaningful pauses, eye
contact, small changes in word order, and vocal emphasis. Reading is
a more or less exact replication of words on paper with little nonverbal
interpretation. Speaking, as you will realize if you think about excellent
speakers you have seen and heard, provides a more animated message.

      Impromptu        11.2 - Methods of Speech Delivery
        Speaking
                       What follows are four methods of delivery that can help you balance
the presentation of a  between too much and too little formality when giving a speech. Each
short message without  has its own strengths and weaknesses, but you will most likely want to
advance preparation    focus on the extemporaneous approach, since that is probably what your
                       instructor will want from you.

                       Impromptu Speaking

                       Impromptu speaking is the presentation of a short message without
                       advance preparation. You have probably done impromptu speaking many
                       times in informal, conversational settings. Self-introductions in group
                       settings are examples of impromptu speaking: "Hi, my name is Steve, and
                       I'm a volunteer with the Homes for the Brave program." Another example
                       of impromptu speaking occurs when you answer a question such as, "What
                       did you think of the movie?" Your response has not been preplanned, and
                       you are constructing your arguments and points as you speak. You might
                       find yourself walking into a work meeting and your boss says, "I want you
                       to talk about the last stage of the project. . . " and you have no warning.

                       The advantage of this kind of speaking is that it's spontaneous and
                       responsive in an animated group context. The disadvantage is that the
                       speaker is given little or no time to contemplate the central theme of his or
                       her message. As a result, the message may be disorganized and difficult for
                       listeners to follow.

                       Here is a step-by-step guide that may be useful if you are called upon to
                       give an impromptu speech in public:

                           1. Take a moment to collect your thoughts and plan the main point or
                               points you want to make.

                           2. Thank the person for inviting you to speak. Do not make comments
                               about being unprepared, called upon at the last moment, on the spot,
                               or uneasy. No one wants to hear that, and it will embarrass others
                               and yourself.

                           3. Deliver your message, making your main point as briefly as you can
                               while still covering it adequately and at a pace your listeners can
                               follow.

                           4. Stay on track. Answer the question or prompt as given; resist the
                               temptation to go elsewhere.

                           5. If you can, use a structure, using numbers if possible: "Two main
                               reasons . . ." or "Three parts of our plan. . ." or "Two side effects of
                               this drug. . ." "Past, present, and future" or "East Coast, Midwest,
                               and West Coast" are common structures.

Version 4.2

    6. Thank the person again for the opportunity to speak.

    7. Stop talking (it is easy to "ramble on" when you don't have
        something prepared). If in front of an audience, don't keep talking
        as you move back to your seat.

Impromptu speeches are generally most successful when they are brief
and focus on a single point.

Manuscript Speaking                                                                   Manuscript
                                                                                        Speaking
Manuscript speaking is the word-for-word iteration of a written
message. In a manuscript speech, the speaker maintains his or her               the word-for-word
attention on the printed page except when using visual aids. The                iteration of a written
advantage to reading from a manuscript is the exact repetition of               message
original words. In some circumstances this can be extremely important.
For example, reading a statement about your organization's legal
responsibilities to customers may require that the original words be exact.
In reading one word at a time, in order, the only errors would typically be
mispronunciation of a word or stumbling over complex sentence structure.
A manuscript speech may also be appropriate at a more formal affair (like
a funeral), when your speech must be said exactly as written in order to
convey the proper emotion or decorum the situation deserves.

However, there are costs involved in manuscript speaking. First, it's
typically an uninteresting way to present. Unless the speaker has
rehearsed the reading as a complete performance animated with vocal
expression and gestures (well-known authors often do this for book
readings), the presentation tends to be dull. Keeping one's eyes glued to
the script prevents eye contact with the audience. For this kind of "straight"
manuscript speech to hold audience attention, the audience must be
already interested in the message and speaker before the delivery begins.

It is worth noting that professional speakers, actors, news reporters, and
politicians often read from an autocue device, such as a TelePrompTer,
especially when appearing on television, where eye contact with the
camera is crucial. With practice, a speaker can achieve a conversational
tone and give the impression of speaking extemporaneously and
maintaining eye contact while using an autocue device. However, success
in this medium depends on two factors: (1) the speaker is already an
accomplished public speaker who has learned to use a conversational
tone while delivering a prepared script, and (2) the speech is written in a
style that sounds conversational and in spoken rather than written, edited
English, for example, with shorter, more direct sentences and clearer
transitions.

Version 4.2

  Extemporaneous       For the purposes of your public speaking class, you will not be encouraged
        speaking       to read your speech. Instead, you will be asked to give an extemporaneous
                       presentation.

speech, spoken in a    Extemporaneous speaking is the presentation of a carefully planned

                       speaker can establish and maintain eye contact with the audience and
      Memorized        assess how well they are understanding the speech as it progresses. And
        speaking       since you will be graded (to some degree) on establishing and maintaining
                       eye contact with your audience, extemporaneous speaking can be
the rote recitation    extremely beneficial in that regard. Without all the words on the page to

committed to memory    preparation and speaking (notes) outlines as a foundation for your speech;
                       this topic is addressed in Chapter 6.

                       Speaking extemporaneously has some advantages. It promotes the
                       likelihood that you, the speaker, will be perceived as knowledgeable and
                       credible since you know the speech well enough that you don't need to
                       read it. In addition, your audience is likely to pay better attention to the
                       message because it is engaging both verbally and nonverbally. It also
                       allows flexibility; you are working from the strong foundation of an outline,
                       but if you need to delete, add, or rephrase something at the last minute
                       or to adapt to your audience, you can do so. The outline also helps you be
                       aware of main ideas vs. subordinate ones.

                       The disadvantage of extemporaneous speaking is that it in some cases
                       it does not allow for the verbal and the nonverbal preparation that are
                       almost always required for a good speech. Adequate preparation cannot
                       be achieved the day before you're scheduled to speak, so be aware that if
                       you want to present a credibly delivered speech, you will need to practice
                       many times. Because extemporaneous speaking is the style used in the
                       great majority of public speaking situations, most of the information in
                       the subsequent sections of this chapter is targeted toward this kind of
                       speaking.

                       Memorized Speaking

                       Memorized speaking is the rote recitation of a written message that
                       the speaker has committed to memory. Actors, of course, recite from
                       memory whenever they perform from a script. When it comes to speeches,
                       memorization can be useful when the message needs to be exact and the
                       speaker doesn't want to be confined by notes.
Exploring Public Speaking  225                                                      Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

The advantage to memorization is that it enables the speaker to maintain                   Vocal cues
eye contact with the audience throughout the speech. Being free of notes
means that you can move freely around the stage and use your hands                  the subtle but
to make gestures. If your speech uses visual aids, this freedom is even             meaningful variations
more of an advantage. According to Damon Brown (2015), TED Talks are                in speech delivery,
memorized.                                                                          which can include
                                                                                    the use of pitch, tone,
However, there are some real and potential costs. First, unless you also            volume, and pace
plan and memorize every vocal cue (the subtle but meaningful variations
in speech delivery, which can include the use of pitch, tone, volume, and
pace), gesture, and facial expression, your presentation will be flat and
uninteresting, and even the most fascinating topic will suffer. You might
end up speaking in a monotone or a sing-song repetitive delivery pattern.
You might also present your speech in a rapid "machine-gun" style that
fails to emphasize the most important points.

Second, if you lose your place and start trying to ad lib, the contrast in
your style of delivery will alert your audience that something is wrong.
If you go completely blank during the presentation, it will be extremely
difficult to find your place and keep going. Obviously, memorizing a typical
seven-minute classroom speech takes a great deal of time and effort, and
if you aren't used to memorizing, it is very difficult to pull off. Realistically,
you probably will not have the time necessary to give a completely
memorized speech. However, if you practice adequately, you will approach
the feel of a memorized speech while still being extemporaneous.

As we said earlier, for the purposes of this class you will use
extemporaneous speaking. Many professional speakers who are paid to
make speeches use this approach because, while they may largely know
what they want to say, they usually make changes and adjustments based
on the audience or event. This approach also incorporates most of the
benefits of memorized speaking (knowing what you want to say; being
very thoroughly rehearsed) and manuscript speaking (having some words
in front of you to refer to) without the inherent pitfalls those approaches
bring with them.

11.3 - Preparing For Your Delivery

In the 1970s, before he was an author, playwright, and film actor, Steve
Martin was an up-and-coming stand-up comedian whose popularity
soared as a result of his early appearances on The Tonight Show with
Johnny Carson and Saturday Night Live. As Martin notes in his
autobiography, Born Standing Up (2008), as the audiences for his act got
bigger and bigger, he needed to adapt his delivery to accommodate:

         Some promoters got on board and booked me into a theater in
         Dallas. Before the show I asked one of them, How many people are
         out there?" "Two thousand," he said. Two thousand? How could

a speech                          funny or direct with so many people; I reluctantly dropped it from
                                  my repertoire. (p. 168)

                         Martin's audiences would grow to be around 50,000 at the height of
                         his popularity as a stand-up comedian, again requiring him to make
                         adjustments to his delivery (he began wearing his iconic all-white suit so
                         that people in the nosebleed seats at his shows could still see his frenetic
                         movements from afar). Few of us will ever speak to so many people at once,
                         but even though you don't expect an audience of such size, you should still
                         be prepared to adapt to the setting in which you will speak.

                         Your audiences, circumstances, and physical contexts for public speaking
                         will vary. At some point in your life you may run for public office or rise
                         to a leadership role in a business or volunteer organization. Or you may
                         be responsible for informing coworkers about a new policy, regulation,
                         or opportunity. You may be asked to deliver remarks in the context of a
                         worship service, wedding, or funeral. You may be asked to introduce a
                         keynote speaker or simply to make an important announcement in some
                         context. Sometimes you will speak in a familiar environment, while at
                         other times you may be faced with an unfamiliar location and have very
                         little time to get used to speaking with a microphone. Being prepared
                         to deal with different speaking situations will help reduce anxiety you
                         may have about giving a speech, so let's look at factors you need to keep
                         in mind as you prepare for your speech in this class, as well as future
                         speeches you may need to give.

                         Using Lecterns

                         A lectern is a small raised surface, usually with a slanted top, where a
                         speaker can place notes during a speech. While a lectern adds a measure
                         of formality to the speaking situation, it also allows speakers the freedom
                         to do two things: to come out from behind the lectern to establish more
                         immediate contact with the audience and to use both hands for gestures.

                         which is a raised platform or stage.

                         However, for inexperienced speakers who feel anxious, it is all too
                         tempting to grip the edges of the lectern with both hands for security. You
                         might even wish you could hide behind it. Be aware of these temptations
                         so you can manage them effectively and present yourself to your audience
                         in a manner they will perceive as confident. One way to achieve this
                         is by limiting your use of the lectern to a place to rest your notes. Try
Exploring Public Speaking  227                                                  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

stepping to the side or front of the lectern when speaking with free hands,
only occasionally standing at the lectern to consult your notes. This will
enhance your eye contact as well as free up your hands for gesturing.
Figures 11.1-11.3 give some examples of posture for speaking with a lectern.

Speaking in a Small or Large Physical Space

If you are accustomed to being in a classroom of a certain size, you will
need to make adjustments when speaking in a smaller or larger space than
what you are used to. A large auditorium can be intimidating, especially
for speakers who feel shy and "exposed" when facing an audience.
However, the maxim that "proper preparation prevents poor performance"
is just as true here as anywhere. If you have prepared and practiced well,
you can approach a large-venue speaking engagement with confidence.

In terms of practical adjustments, be aware that your voice is likely to echo,
especially if far fewer people are in the space than it can hold, so you will
want to speak more slowly as well as more loudly than usual and make use
of pauses to mark the ends of phrases and sentences. Similarly, your facial
expressions and gestures should be larger so that they are visible from
farther away. If you are using visual aids, they need to be large enough to
be visible from the back of the auditorium. Of course, if the speaker can get
the audience to move to the front, that is the best situation, but it tends to
be difficult to achieve.

Limited space is not as disconcerting for most speakers as enormous
space, and it has the advantage of minimizing the tendency to pace
back and forth while you speak. A small space also calls for more careful
management of note cards and visual aids, as your audience will be able to
see up close what you are doing with your hands. Do your best to minimize
fumbling, including setting up in advance or arriving early to decide how
to organize your materials in the physical space. Of course, if you have any
control over the location of the presentation, you should choose one that
fits the size of your audience.

Speaking Outdoors

Outdoor settings can be charming, but they are prone to distractions. If
you're giving a speech in a setting that is picturesquely beautiful or prone
to noise such as from cars, it may be difficult to maintain the audience's
attention. If you know this ahead of time, you might plan your speech to
focus more on mood than information and perhaps to make reference to
the lovely view.

More typically, outdoor speech venues can pose challenges with weather,
sun glare, and uninvited guests, such as insects and pigeons. If the venue
is located near a busy highway, it might be difficult to make yourself heard
over the ambient noise. You might lack the usual accommodations, such
Exploring Public Speaking  228  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

             as a lectern or table. Whatever the situation, you will need to use your best
             efforts to project your voice clearly without sounding like you're yelling or
             straining your voice. In the best outdoor situation, you will have access to
             a microphone.

             Using a Microphone

             Most people today are familiar with microphones that are built into video
             recorders, phones, and other electronic devices, but they may be new to
             using a microphone to deliver a speech. One overall principle to remember
             is that a microphone only amplifies, it does not clarify. If you are not
             enunciating clearly, the microphone will merely enable your audience to
             hear amplified mumbling.

             Microphones come in a wide range of styles and sizes. Generally, the
             easiest microphone to use is the clip-on style worn on the front of your
             shirt or blouse. (These are commonly referred to as a Lavalier mic, which
             is a brand name.) If you look closely at many television personalities and
             news anchors, you will notice these tiny microphones clipped to their
             clothing. They require very little adaptation. You simply have to avoid
             looking down--at your notes, for instance--because your voice will be
             amplified when you do so. If you have to use a hand-held microphone,
             making gestures and using notes becomes very difficult.

             Lectern (stationary) and handheld microphones require more adaptation.
             If they're too close to your mouth, they can screech. If they're too far away,
             they might not pick up your voice. Some microphones are directional,
             meaning that they are only effective when you speak directly into them. If
             there is any opportunity to do so, ask for tips about how to use a particular
             microphone. Also practice with it for a few minutes while you have
             someone listen from a middle row in the audience and signal whether you
             can be heard well. The best plan, of course, would be to have access to the
             microphone for practice ahead of the speaking date.

             Often a microphone is provided when it isn't necessary. If the room is
             small or the audience is close to you, do not feel obligated to use the
             microphone. Sometimes an amplified voice can feel less natural and less
             compelling than a direct voice. However, if you forgo the microphone,
             make sure to speak loudly enough for all audience members to hear you--
             not just those in front.

             Audience Size

             A small audience is an opportunity for a more intimate, minimally formal
             tone. If your audience has only eight to twelve people, you can generate
             greater audience contact. Make use of all the preparation you have done.
             You do not have to revamp your speech just because the audience is small.
Exploring Public Speaking  229                                                 Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

When the presentation is over, there will most likely be opportunities to
answer questions and have individual contact with your listeners.

One problem with a small audience is that some people will feel it is their
right, or they have permission, to interrupt you or raise their hands to ask
questions in the middle of your speech. This makes for a difficult situation,
because the question may be irrelevant to your topic or cause you to go on
a side track if answered. The best you can do is say you'll try to deal with
that question at the end of the speech if you have time and hope they take
the hint. Better, good rules should be established at the beginning that
state there is limited time but discussion may be possible at the end.

Your classroom audience may be as many as twenty to thirty students.
The format for an audience of this size is still formal but conversational.
Depending on how your instructor structures the class, you may or may
not be asked to leave time after your speech for questions and answers.
Some audiences are much larger. If you have an audience that fills an
auditorium, or if you have an auditorium with only a few people in it, you
still have a clearly formal task, and you should be guided as much as
possible by your preparation.

11.4 - Practicing Your Delivery

There is no foolproof recipe for good delivery. Each of us is unique, and we
each embody different experiences and interests. This means each person
has an approach, or a style, that is effective for her or him. This further
means that anxiety can accompany even the most carefully researched
and interesting message. But there are some techniques you can use
to minimize that anxious feeling and put yourself in the best possible
position to succeed on speech day.

If you've ever watched your favorite college football team practice, you
may have noticed that sometimes obnoxiously loud crowd noise is blaring
over the speaker system in the stadium. The coaches know that the crowd,
whether home or away, will be raucous and noisy on game day. So to
prepare, they practice in as realistic an environment as possible. You need
to prepare for your speech in a similar way. What follows are some general
tips you should keep in mind, but they all essentially derive from one very
straight-forward premise:

Practice your speech beforehand, at home or elsewhere, the way
you will give it in class.

Practice Your Speech Out Loud

We sometimes think that the purpose of practicing a speech is to learn
the words and be prepared for what we will need to say. Certainly that is
part of it, but practice also lets you know where potential problems lie.
Exploring Public Speaking  230  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

             For example, if you only read your speech in your head, or whisper the
             words quietly, you're not really practicing what you will be doing in front
             of the class. Since you will be speaking with a normal volume for your
             assignment, you need to practice that way, even at home. Not only will this
             help you learn the speech, but it will help identify any places where you
             tend to mispronounce or stumble over words. Also, sentences on paper
             do not always translate well to the spoken medium. Practicing out loud
             allows you to actually hear where your sentences and phrases are awkward,
             unnatural, or too long, and allows you to correct them before getting up in
             front of the audience.

             Practice Your Speech Standing Up

             In all the time that the authors of this book have been teaching speech,
             not once have any of us come into a classroom and seen a bed behind the
             lectern for students to speak from. This is to say that when you practice at
             home, lying on your bed reading your speech really only prepares you for
             one thing: lying on a bed reading a speech. Since you will be standing in
             front of your class, you need to practice that way. As we mention in more
             detail below, the default position for delivering a speech is with your feet
             about shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Practicing this
             way will help develop muscle memory and will make it feel more natural
             when you are doing it for real. We also suggest you wear the same shoes
             you will be wearing on the day of your speech. Shoes with good support
             will help your posture and mental attitude.

             Practice Your Speech with a Lectern

             One of the biggest challenges with practicing a speech as you're going
             to give it is usually the fact that most of us don't own a lectern. This
             is problematic, since you don't want to practice giving your speech
             while holding your notes in front of you because that is what will feel
             comfortable when you give your speech for real. So the solution is to
             practice your speech while standing behind something that approximates
             the lectern you will have in your classroom. Sometime this may be a
             kitchen counter or maybe even a dresser you pull away from the wall.
             One particularly creative idea that has been used in the past is to pull out
             an ironing board and stand behind that. The point is that you want to
             get experience standing behind something and resting your speech on it,
             especially if that is how you will give the speech in reality.

             Of course, if you really want to practice with an actual lectern, it might be
             worth the time to see if your classroom is empty later in the day or find out
             if another classroom has the same type of lectern in it. Practicing with the
             "real thing" is always ideal.
Exploring Public Speaking  231                                                  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

Practice Your Speech with an Audience

Obviously on the day you give your speech you will have an audience of
your fellow students and your instructor watching you. The best way to
prepare for the feeling of having someone watch you while giving a speech
is to have someone watch you while you practice giving a speech. We don't
mean a collection of stuffed animals arranged on your bed or locking your
pets in the room with you, but actual human beings. Ask your parents,
siblings, friends, or significant other to listen to you while running through
what you will say. Not only will you get practice in front of an audience,
but they may be able to tell you about any parts that were unclear or
problems you might encounter when you give it for a grade.

Not to overcomplicate the issue, but remember that when you speak to
your class, you will have an entire room full of people watching. Therefore,
if you only have one person watching you practice, be sure to simulate an
entire audience by looking around the room and not focusing on just that
one person. When you give your speech for real, you will want to make eye
contact with the people on the left side of the room as well as the right;
with the people in the front as well as in the back.

You also want the eye contact to be around five seconds long, not just a
glance; the idea is that you are talking to individuals, not just a glob of
people. During practice, it may help to pick out some strategically placed
objects around the room to occasionally focus on just to get into the habit
of looking around more often. In fact, it might help you to realize that you
can really only "talk to" (with eye contact) one person at a time, which
might cause you to feel less nervous and more conversational.
Exploring Public Speaking  232  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

             Practice Your Speech for Time

             You will undoubtedly be given a time limit for each of your speeches, and
             points will probably be deducted from your grade if you go over or under
             that time. Therefore, you want to make sure you are well within time.
             Your instructor's requirement is not just to allow enough time for all the
             class speeches. It teaches the discipline of speaking within time limits. As
             a general rule, if your speech window is 5-7 minutes, your ideal speech
             time is going to be 6 minutes; this gives you an extra 60 seconds at the
             beginning in case you talk very fast and race through it, and 60 seconds
             on the back end in case you get lost or want to add something at the last
             minute. If you practice at home and your 5-7 minute speech lasts 5:06, you
             are probably going to be in trouble on speech day. Most likely your nerves
             will cause you to speak slightly faster and put you under the 5:00 mark.
             More likely, you don't have enough material to explain your concepts fully.
             If your times are vastly different, you may have to practice four or more
             times.

             When practicing your speech at home for time, it is a good idea to time
             yourself at least three times, although more is better in this case. This
             way you can see if you are generally coming in around the same time and
             feel pretty good that it is an accurate reflection of how long you will speak.
             Conversely, if during your three rehearsals your times are 5:45, 5:12, and
             6:37, then that is a clear indicator that you need to be more consistent in
             what you are saying and doing.
Exploring Public Speaking  233                                                Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

Although we are using examples of practicing for classroom speeches, the
principle is even more important for non-classroom speeches. One of the
authors had to give a very important presentation about the college to an
accreditation board. She practiced about 15 times, to make sure the time
was right, that her transitions made sense, that she was fluid, and that
the presentational slides and her speech matched. Each time something
improved.

Practice Your Speech by Recording Yourself

There is nothing that gets us to change what we're doing or correct a
problem more quickly than seeing ourselves doing something we don't
like on video. Your instructor may record your speech in class and have
you critique it afterwards, but it may be more helpful to do that in advance
of giving your speech. By watching yourself, you will notice all the small
things you do that might prove to be distracting and affect your grade
during the actual speech. Many times students aren't aware that they have
low energy or a monotone/monorate voice, or that they bounce, sway,
pull at their clothes, play with hair or jewelry, or make other unusual
and distracting movements. At least, they don't know this until they see
themselves. Since we are generally our own harshest critics, you will be
quick to notice any flaws in your speech and correct them.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related reasons, many students took
or are taking the basic public speaking course through online or remote
delivery. Although this is an inevitable situation, many public speaking
instructors tend to see online delivery of the public speaking class as far
less than ideal. Appendix C addresses speaking online, so we will refer you
to that section. If you are required to record your speech and post for the
instructor's assessment, your submitted video should not be your first
attempt. You should record at least one practice speech, critique yourself,
and then do a final for submission.

It is important enough that it deserves reiterating:

Practice your speech beforehand, at home or elsewhere, the way
you will give it in class.

Following these steps will not only prepare you better for delivering the
speech, but they may also help reduce anxiety since you will feel more
familiar with the situation you find yourself in when faced with a speaking
engagement. Additionally, the more you speak publicly, whether for
practice or in front of a live audience, the more fluid you will become for
later speeches.

11.5 - What to Do When Delivering Your Speech

The interplay between the verbal and nonverbal components of your
speech can either bring the message vividly to life or confuse or bore
the audience. Therefore, it is best that you neither overdramatize your
speech delivery behaviors nor downplay them. This is a balance achieved
through rehearsal, trial and error, and experience. One way to think of
this is in terms of the Goldilocks paradigm: you don't want to overdo the
delivery because you might distract your audience by looking "hyper" or
overly animated. Conversely, someone whose delivery is too understated
(meaning they don't move their hands or feet at all) looks unnatural and
uncomfortable, which can also distract. Just like Goldilocks, you want a
delivery that is "just right." (Figure 11.4) This middle ground between too
much and too little is a much more natural approach to public speaking
delivery. This natural approach will be covered in more detail in the
following sections where we discuss specific aspects of your delivery and
what you need to think about while actually giving your speech.

Hands

Almost everyone who gives a speech in public gets scared or nervous to
some extent. Even professionals who do this for a living feel that way, but
Exploring Public Speaking  236  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

             they have learned how to combat those nerves through experience and
             practice. When we get scared or nervous, our bodies emit adrenaline into
             our systems so we can deal with whatever problem is causing us to feel
             that way. Unfortunately, you will need to be standing relatively still for the
             next 5-7 minutes, so that burst of adrenaline is going to try to work its way
             out in your body and manifest itself somehow. One of the main ways is
             through your hands.

             It may sound funny, but we have seen more than one student unknowingly
             incorporate "jazz hands" (shaking your hands at your sides with fingers
             opened wide) at various points in their speech. While certainly an extreme
             example, this and behaviors like it can easily becoming distracting. At the
             other end of the scale, people who don't know what to do with their hands
             or use them "too little" sometimes hold their arms stiffly at their sides,
             behind their backs, or in their pockets, all of which can also look unnatural
             and distracting.

             The key for knowing what to do with your hands is to use them naturally
             as you would in normal conversation. If you were standing around talking
             to your friends and wanted to list three reasons why you should all take
             a road trip this weekend, you would probably hold up your fingers as
             you counted off the reasons ("First, we hardly ever get this opportunity.
             Second, we can..."). Try to pay attention to what you do with your hands in
             regular conversations and incorporate that into your delivery.

             However, with all that said, if you have nothing else to do with your hands,
             such as meaningful gestures, the default position for them is to be resting
             gently on the sides of the lectern (see Figure 11.2). You don't want to grip
             the lectern tightly, but resting them on the edges keeps them in position to
             move your notes on if you need to or use them to gesture. As stated above,
             you want to practice this way beforehand so you are used to speaking this
             way when you come to class.

             Feet

             Just like your hands, a lot of nervous energy is going to try to work its
             way out of your body through your feet. On the "too much" end, this is
             most common when people start "dancing" behind the lectern. Another
             variation is twisting feet around each other or the lower leg. On the other
             end are those who put their feet together, lock their knees, and never move
             from that position. Both of these options look unnatural, and therefore will
             prove to be distracting to your audience. Locking your knees can also lead
             to loss of oxygen in your brain, not a good state to be in, because it can
             cause you to faint.

             The default position for your feet, then, is to have them shoulder-width
             apart with your knees slightly bent (see Figure 11.3). Again, you want to
             look and feel natural, so it is fine to adjust your weight or move out from
Exploring Public Speaking  237                                                 Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

behind the lectern, but constant motion (or perpetual stillness) will not
lead to good overall delivery.

These two sections on hands and feet mention "energy." Public speakers
need to look energetic--not hyperactive, but engaged and upbeat about
communicating their message. The correct display of energy is part of
the muscle memory discussed in Chapter 1. Slumping, low and unvarying
pitch and rate, and lack of gestures telegraph "I don't care" to an audience.

While we have mentioned many aspects of nonverbal delivery that can
distract or detract, and therefore should be eliminated, there is a positive
side to delivery. Strong and controlled energy in voice and posture, eye
contact, variety, and purposeful movement all add to credibility (Burgoon,
Birk, & Pfau, 1990).

Objects

There is a very simple rule when it comes to what you should bring with
you to the lectern when you give your speech: Only bring to the lectern
what you absolutely need to give the speech. Anything else you have
with you will only serve as a distraction for both you and the audience. For
the purposes of this class, the only objects you should need to give your
speech are whatever materials you are speaking from, and possibly a visual
aid if you are using one. Beyond that, don't bring pens, laptops, phones,
lucky charms, or notebooks with you to the lectern. These extra items can
ultimately become a distraction themselves when they fall off the lectern
or get in your way. Some students like to bring their electronic tablet,
laptop computer, or cell phone with them, but there are some obvious
disadvantages to these items, especially if you don't turn the ringer on
your cell phone off. Cell phones are not usually large enough to serve as
presentation notes; we've seen students squint and hold the phone up to
their faces.

             Not only do you need to be aware of what you bring with you, but you
             should also be aware of what you have on your person as well. Sometimes,
             in the course of dressing for a speech, we can overlook simple issues that
             can cause problems while speaking. Some of these can include:

                  Jewelry that `jingles' when you move, such as heavy bracelets;
                  Uncomfortable shoes or shoes that you are not used to (don't make

                    speech day the first time you try wearing high heels);
                  Anything with fringe, zippers, or things hanging off it. They might

                    become irresistible to play with while speaking;
                  For those with longer hair, remember that you will be looking down

                    at your notes and then looking back up. Don't be forced to "fix" your
                    hair or tuck it behind your ear every time you look up. Use a barrette,
                    hairband, or some other method to keep your hair totally out of your
                    face so that the audience can see your eyes and you won't have to
                    adjust your hair constantly. It can be very distracting to an audience
                    to watch a speaker pull hair from their face after every sentence.

             The Lectern and Posture

             We have already discussed the lectern, but it is worth mentioning again
             briefly here. The lectern is a tool for you to use that should ultimately
             make your speech easier to give, and you need to use it that way. On the
             "too much" end, some people want to trick their audience into thinking
             they are not nervous by leaning on the podium in a relaxed manner,
Exploring Public Speaking  239                                                  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

sometime going so far as to actually begin tipping the podium forward.
Your lectern is NOT part of your skeletal system, to prop you up, so don't
do this. On the "too little" end are those who are afraid to touch it, worried
that they will use it incorrectly or somehow knock it over (you won't!).

As always, you want the "Goldilocks" middle ground. As stated above,
rest your notes and hands on it, but don't lean on the lectern or "hug" it.
Practicing with a lectern (or something similar to a lectern) will eliminate
most of your fears about using it.

The lectern use is related to posture. Most of us let gravity pull us down.
One of the muscle memory tricks of public speaking is to roll your
shoulders back. Along with making your shoulder muscles feel better,
doing so with feet apart and knees bent, rolling your shoulders back will
lead to a more credible physical presence--you'll look taller and more
energetic. You'll also feel better, and you'll have larger lung capacity for
breathing to support your tone and volume.

Eye Contact

Especially in Western cultures, we see eye contact as a sign of sincerity,
truthfulness, and confidence. As we've said consistently throughout this
book, your audience is the single biggest factor that influences every aspect
of your speech. And since eye contact is how you establish and maintain
a rapport with your audience during your speech, it is an extremely
important element of your delivery. Your instructor may or may not
indicate a standard for how much eye contact you need during the speech,
such as 50%, but he or she will absolutely want to see you making an effort
to engage your audience through looking directly at them.

What is important to note here is that you want to establish genuine eye
contact with your audience, and not "fake" eye contact. There have been a
lot of techniques generated for "faking" eye contact, and none of them look
natural. For example, these are not good ideas:

     Three points on the back wall - You may have heard that instead of
       making eye contact, you can just pick three points on the back wall
       and look at those. What ends up happening, though, is you look
       like you are staring off into space and your audience will spend the
       majority of your speech trying to figure out what you are looking at.
      To avoid this, look around the entire room, at people, including the
       front, back, left, and right sides of the space.

     The swimming method - This happens when someone is reading his
       or her speech and looks up quickly and briefly to try to make it seem
       like they are making eye contact, not unlike a swimmer who pops
       his head out of the water for a breath before going back under. Eye
       contact is more than just physically moving your head; it is about
Exploring Public Speaking  240  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

         Volume                  looking at your audience and establishing a connection. In general,
                                 your eye contact should last at least five seconds at a time and should
the relative softness or         be with individuals throughout the room.
loudness of your voice
                               The stare down - Since you will, to some degree, be graded on your
                                 eye contact, some students think (either consciously or not), that
                                 the best way to ensure they get credit for establishing eye contact
                                 is to always and exclusively look directly at their instructor. While
                                 we certainly appreciate the attention, we want to see that you are
                                 establishing eye contact with your entire audience, not just one
                                 person. Also, this behavior is uncomfortable for the instructor.

                          Finally, as public speaking teachers for many years, we have heard the
                          "think of your audience naked or in their underwear" cliche more times
                          than we want to admit. We discourage that approach, for multiple reasons.
                          It should also be noted here that the standard of sustained eye contact is a
                          Western value and may not apply to audiences of other cultures.

                          Volume

                          Volume refers to the relative softness or loudness of your voice. Like most
                          of the other issues we've discussed in this section, the proper volume for a
                          given speaking engagement usually falls on the scale in Figure 11.4. If you
                          speak too softly ("too little" volume), your audience will struggle to hear
                          and understand you and may give up trying to listen. If you speak with
                          "too much" volume, your audience may feel that you are yelling at them, or
                          at least feel uncomfortable with your shouting. The volume you use should
                          fit the size of the audience and the room.

                          Fortunately for some of you, for the purposes of this class, your normal
                          speaking voice will probably work just fine since you are in a relatively
                          small space with around twenty people. However, if you know that you are
                          naturally a soft-spoken person, you will need to work on breathing to get
                          more air into your lungs, and on projecting your voice to the people in the
                          last row, not just those in the front. And as you know, classroom sizes vary,
                          so your room may seat 22 students or 52--a big difference in how loud
                          you will need to be. Of course, if you are naturally a very loud talker, you
                          may want to make other adjustments when giving your speech. Obviously
                          this will all change if you are asked to speak in a larger venue or given a
                          microphone to use.

                          Public speaking relies on the voice for interest, credibility, audibility, and
                          clarity. The British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli of the 19th century
                          wrote, "There is no greater index of character so sure as the voice." While
                          that seems exaggerated today, a public speaker at any level cannot ignore
                          the energy, loudness, and clarity in their voice. There are four steps to
                          voice production: breathing (produced by the lungs, which are largely
                          responsible for the vocal characteristic of volume); phonation (the
Exploring Public Speaking  241                                                 Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

production of the sound in the vocal folds, which close and vibrate to
produce sound for speaking as the air is exhaled over them; phonation
creates pitch); resonation (a type of amplification of the sound in the
larynx, oral cavity, and nasal cavity, which creates the characteristic of
quality); and articulation, which produces the sounds of language others
can understand and is responsible for rate and for being understood.

The visual in Figure 11.5 shows a cutaway of these parts of the anatomy.
Your instructor may give you more directions on maximizing the power of
your voice to achieve more variety and power. In section 11.6 we include a
vocal exercise for doing so. We have all listened to a low-energy, monotone,
monorate speaker and know how hard it is, so you should pay attention
to your recording, perhaps by closing your eyes and just listening, to see if
your voice is flat and lifeless.

                                           Figure 11.5                                    Pitch

Exploring Public Speaking  242  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

            Rate        Delivering a speech in a monotone manner is usually caused by reading
                        too much; generally the speaker's focus is on saying the words correctly
the speed at which you  (because they have not practiced). They forget to speak normally to show
speak; how quickly or   their interest in the topic, as we would in everyday conversation. For most
slowly a speaker talks  people, pitch isn't a major issue, but if you think it might be for you, ask
                        the people in your practice audience what they think. Generally, if we are
                        interested in and passionate about communicating our thoughts, we are
                        not likely to be monotone. We are rarely monotone when talking to friends
                        and family about matters of importance to us, so pick topics you care
                        about.

                        Rate

                        How quickly or slowly you say the words of your speech is the rate. Too
                        little rate (i.e. speaking too slowly) will make it sound like you may not
                        fully know your speech or what you are talking about, and will ultimately
                        cost you some credibility with your audience. It may also result in the
                        audience being bored and lose focus on what you are saying. Rate is one
                        reason you should try to record yourself (even if just audio on your phone)
                        beforehand and be mindful of time when you practice. Your voice's rate
                        will affect the time it takes to give the speech. In our experience, novice
                        speakers tend to err on the side of speaking too fast, usually due to anxiety.

                        By contrast, too much rate (i.e. speaking too fast) can be overly taxing
                        on an audience's ability to keep up with and digest what you are saying.
                        Regulating your breathing is the first step. Sometimes student speak so
                        fast they have to gasp for breath--not a good sign. If you know you speak
                        quickly, especially when nervous, be sure to practice slowing down and
                        writing yourself delivery cues in your notes (see Chapter 6) to maintain
                        a more comfortable rate. As always, recording and timing your speech
                        during practice helps.

                        You especially will want to maintain a good, deliberate rate at the
                        beginning of your speech because your audience will be getting used to
                        your voice. We have all called a business where the person answering the
                        phone mumbles the name of the business in a rushed way. We aren't sure
                        if we called the right number. Since the introduction is designed to get the
                        audience's attention and interest in your speech, you will want to focus on
                        clear and emphatic delivery there. Regulating rate is another reason why
                        video-recording yourself can be so helpful because we often do not realize
                        how fast we speak.

                        Pauses

                        The common misconception for public speaking students is that pausing
                        during your speech is bad, but that isn't necessarily true. You pause
                        in normal conversations, so you shouldn't be afraid of pausing while
                        speaking. This is especially true if you are making a particularly important
Exploring Public Speaking  243                                                  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

point or want for a statement to have a more powerful impact: you will            Vocalized pauses
want to give the audience a moment to digest what you have said.
                                                                                pauses that
For example, consider the following statement: "Because of issues like          incorporate some sort
pollution and overpopulation, in 50 years the earth's natural resources         of sound or word that
will be so depleted that it will become difficult for most people to obtain     is unrelated to what is
enough food to survive." Following a statement like this, you want to give      being said; "uh," "um,"
your audience just a brief moment to fully consider what you are saying.        and "like" are well-
Hopefully they will think something along the lines of What if I'm still        known examples
alive then? or What will my children do? and become more interested in
hearing what you have to say. Or they might think Is this true? Why is the
speaker saying this? Either way, the pause allows them to reflect without
having to keep up with your next line.

Of course, there is such a thing as pausing too much, both in terms of
frequency and length. Someone who pauses too often (after each sentence)
may come off seeming like they don't know their speech very well or they
are trying to be dramatic. Someone who pauses too long (more than a few
seconds), runs the risk of the audience feeling uncomfortable or, even
worse becoming distracted or letting their attention wander. We are
capable of processing words more quickly than anyone can speak clearly,
which is one of the reasons listening is difficult (Foulke, 1968). Pauses
should be controlled to maintain attention of the audience.

Vocalized pauses

At various points during your speech, you may find yourself in need of a
brief moment to collect your thoughts or prepare for the next section of
your speech. At those moments, you will be pausing, but we don't always
like to let people know that we're pausing. So what many of us do in an
attempt to "trick" the audience is fill in those pauses with sounds so that it
appears that we haven't actually paused. These are known as vocalized
pauses, or sometimes "fillers." Another term for them is "nonfluencies."

Everyone uses vocalized pauses to some degree, but not everyone's
are problematic. They become so when the vocalized pauses become
distracting due to their overuse. You can probably remember a time
when you were speaking to someone who said the word "like" after every
three words and you became focused on that habit. One of your authors
remembers attending a wedding and (inadvertently) began counting the
number of times the best man said "like" during his toast (22 was the final
count). The most common vocalized pause is "uh," but then there are
others. Can you think of any?

The bad news here is that there is no quick fix for getting rid of your
vocalized pauses. They are so ingrained into all of our speech patterns that
getting rid of them is a challenge. However, there is a two-step process
you can employ to begin eliminating them. First, you need to identify
Exploring Public Speaking  244  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

             what your particular vocalized pause is. Do you say "um," "well," or "now"
             before each sentence? Do you finish each thought with, "you know?" Do
             you use "like" before every adjective (as in "he was like so unhappy")?

             After figuring out what your vocalized pause is, the second step is to
             carefully and meticulously try to catch yourself when you say it. If you
             hear yourself saying "uh," remind yourself, I need to try to not say that.
             Catching yourself and being aware of how often you use vocalized pauses
             will help you begin the process of reducing your dependence on them and
             hopefully get rid of them completely.

             One of the authors uses a game in her class that she adopted from a couple
             of disc jockeys. It is called the "uh game." The callers had to name six
             things in a named category (items in a refrigerator, pro-football teams,
             makes of cars, etc.) in twenty seconds without saying a vocalized pause
             word or phrase. It sounds easy, but it isn't, especially on the spot with a
             radio audience. It is a good way to practice focusing on the content and not
             saying a vocalized pause.

             Conclusion

             The ten items listed above represent the major delivery issues you will
             want to be aware of when giving a speech, but it is by no means an
             exhaustive list. There is however, one final piece of delivery advice we
             would like to offer. We know that no matter how hard you practice and
             how diligent you are in preparing for your speech, you are most likely
             going to mess up some aspect of your speech when you give it in class, at
             least a little. That's normal. Everyone does it. The key is not to make a
             big deal about it or let the audience know you messed up. Odds are that
             they will never even realize your mistake if you don't tell them there was a
             mistake. Saying something like "I can't believe I messed that up" or "Can I
             start over?" just telegraphs to the audience your mistake. In fact, you have
             most likely never heard a perfect speech delivered in your life. It is likely
             that you just didn't realize that the speaker missed a line or briefly forgot
             what they wanted to say. Definitely avoid making a face when you walk
             away from the lectern after your conclusion!

             As has been the driving maxim of this chapter, this means that you need to

             Practice your speech beforehand, at home or elsewhere, the way
             you will give it in class.

             Since you know you are likely going to make some sort of mistake in class,
             use your practice time at home to work on how you will deal with those
             mistakes. If you say a word incorrectly or skip a sentence or subpoint,
             don't go back and begin that section anew. That's not what you would
             do in class, so just correct yourself and move on. If you practice dealing
Exploring Public Speaking  245                                                 Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

with your mistakes at home, you will be better prepared for the inevitable
errors that will find their way into your speech in class.

A final thought on practice. We have all heard, "Practice makes perfect."
That is not always true. Practice makes permanent; the actions
become habitual. If you practice incorrectly, your performance will be
incorrect. Be sure your practice is correct.

11.6 - Expert Advice on the Voice from an Acting

Instructor

Mr. Chad Daniel, who has enjoyed a long career in acting, directing, and
teaching, explains some vocal exercises that can help students with
volume, pitch, variety, and expressiveness.

When I teach voice, I never talk about volume. I talk about breath support.
When I tell a student to make something louder or softer, it teaches them
to push or hold back without breath or body connection, so it's all in their
throats. What I want them to think about is directing the breath energy
around the sound/voicing. When I teach Acting, I talk about making
something more urgent or important, and that will naturally increase or
decrease the volume. The damage done to a voice comes directly from
sound that is not supported by breath. The breath should be doing all the
work, and the voice should be doing the articulating. An example might
be if I grip the heavy bar for 100-pound weight with my just fingers, I am
going to damage them. My hands supported by my biceps and triceps
should be doing the heavy lifting. Another example might be, the breath
is getting the sound out there, while the voice is doing the communicating.
The increase or decrease of volume should come as a byproduct of more or
less breath energy and the urgency of the message.

Breath and voice connection comes directly from a consistent practice,
which involves warming up and exercising the voice. This work should
involve the whole body: First finding where tension is living within the
body, then releasing that tension through breathing, stretching, and the
creation of sound. Tension is an enemy to the voice, so this work is doubly
important to novice speakers because of nerves and inexperience.

Here is a warm-up exercise I use in the classroom.

    1. Find a spot in the room where they have enough room to extend
        their arms out to the side without touching anyone else.

    2. Find a neutral stance, with feet parallel, about shoulder width apart,
        and knees should not be locked.

    3. At your own pace, close the eyes and let your attention drift inward.
        Rock forward onto the toes, then back onto the heels finding the
        sweet spot in the middle where they are not using much muscular
Exploring Public Speaking  246  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

                              control to keep themselves upright; the skeleton should be doing
                              the supporting. This is the point where the awareness starts to come
                              into the breathing. I think terminology is important, so I never say
                              take a breath, I say allow the breath to drop in, and allow the breath
                              fall out, continuously reminding the students throughout the course
                              of the warmup. They are not vocalizing at this point, it is all just
                              focusing on the breath.
                           4. Slowly let the head drop over, chin to chest, and roll down the spine
                              one vertebrae at a time, on a ten count.
                           5. At this point they are hanging over like a rag doll, knees are slightly
                              bent, neck is released, and arms are released and flopped over. This
                              is not as much of a stretch as it is a release. (The weight should still
                              be in the middle of the feet; I tell students to imagine the feet are
                              like hands gripping the floor.)
                           6. While dropped over, make sure they are not holding on with the
                              neck, shake the head no and nod the head yes to facilitate the release.
                              The head should be floppy, and eyes should be looking at shins not
                              the ground. If you are looking at the ground, then there is tension
                              in the neck. Have students place their hands on the lower back and
                              breathe into the hands. You want the students to start to understand
                              how to make lots of room for breath.
                           7. After three breaths dropped over, they should begin to roll up the
                              spine on a ten count, all while continuing to check in with the
                              breath. Once they reach the top of the spine, the head should remain
                              dropped over. Once here, use the hands to place the head back on
                              top of the neck, giving it an extra gentle lift. You want them to think
                              about extending the neck opening the channel and making more
                              room for breath. Ask speakers to check in with their bodies and try
                              to find out where the movement is happening when they breathe.
                              Most will be in the shoulders, but you want to get them to try and
                              have this breath movement happening in the lower ribs and the belly.
                              (If the movement with the breath is happening in the shoulders,
                              then there is still tension and they are not going to be fully utilizing
                              the breath)
                           8. Have them bring the focus back inward, closing eyes if they want,
                              and begin touching sound. Like I said before, it is just a gentle tap
                              of sound; "huh". The first "H" of "huh" is very lightly tapped. If
                              they come in too strong with this initial sound it is going to create a
                              glottal stop, which can cause tension in the vocal folds. In order to
                              counteract this, that initial "h" sound must be almost inaudible.
                           9. Students go up to the balls of their feet, then extend out through
                              the arms, making themselves as tall and wide as possible, all while
                              touching the "huh" sound. They stay extending for three breaths,
                              continuing to touch sound.
                           10. Release the arms then the feet, leaving the neck extended. At
                              this point, the feet are flat on the floor, but the neck is fully
Exploring Public Speaking  247                                                 Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

   extended. They continue the "huh' sound, extending it more
   and more for each breath, until it is extending out to the end of
   their breath. Ex: Huh... Huuuh... Huuuuuh... Huuuuuuuuuuuh...
   Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh... (the length of the word gets bigger,
   not the energy exerted on it. In other words, it doesn't get louder,
   just longer.) All of this done while continuously reminding them
   to support with breath, so the more sound that comes out, the
   more breath should be behind it. Vocalization should never be
   unsupported.
11. At this point, students should pick a spot somewhere in the room,
   and send their "huhs" to that spot. Imagine that your sound is a laser
   beam, and you are drilling a hole in the wall with it. Then imagine
   that the sound is something soft like a pillow, and throw pillows at
   the wall with the sound. Then imagine it is something else and send
   that to the wall. (The location that they are sending the sound to
   should be at 10 - 15 feet away)
12. Once the student has practiced sending sound out for a bit, have
   them drop their chin to their chest, hold it for a breath, then roll
   the right ear over the right shoulder, hold it for a breath, then left
   ear over left shoulder, hold it for a breath, and finally back to chin
   to chest, all of this while touching sound. Have them hold the ridge
   of the jawline using only the thumb and forefinger, waggle the jaw
   up and down (never side to side) and put some voice behind that. If
   they are having trouble moving the jaw up and down, it means there
   is tension in the jaw muscles. Next have them hold the bottom jaw
   in place and lift the top jaw off of the bottom, then bring bottom
   to the top, bottom off top, bottom to top, all the way until their
   mouths and throats (channels) are wide open, and they are facing
   the ceiling. Send the sound to the ceiling. After sending sound, bring
   head forward leaving the channel open and send sound to wall, bring
   head down leaving channel open and send sound to the floor, then
   come back to center. (This helps them to open their soft palates and
   throats, to fully resonate the sound out)
13. At this point, have them use their hands and place it on a certain
   spot on their bodies, like a hand on the belly, and send the sound
   from that spot. (This is all imagination work, but it is really effective.
   Let them know that they are not really sending sound from that spot,
   but it should feel like they are.)
14. Have them come to a neutral stance, close the eyes again, and
   imagine that their body is a big empty vessel with a little bowl at the
   bottom, right about where their pelvis is, and each time the breath
   comes in, it scoops into that bowl and comes back out. This is about
   making lots of room for breath. They should be ready to start giving
   lines from their speeches with the breath. So, instead of "huh" They
   would say a word or two from their speeches. Ask them to think up
Exploring Public Speaking  248  Chapter 11: Delivery

Version 4.2

                     theme words from their speeches and put those with the breath. This
                     will start to facilitate the connection of mind, breath, and voice.)
                 15. Lastly have them move around the room communicating that word
                     with other members of the group, as they pass each other.
             This is a lot of information, but this warm up only takes about 10 minutes
             at the most. Pitch and Volume should both be a byproduct of urgency
             of message. If you connect the speech with the breath, and know what
             you specifically want to do with your speech, then volume and pitch can
             happen spontaneously, and there will be no need to plan these elements
             out.

             Conclusion

             Good delivery is meant to augment your speech and help convey
             your information to the audience. Anything that potentially distracts
             your audience means that fewer people will be informed, persuaded,
             or entertained by what you have said. Practicing your speech in an
             environment that closely resembles the actual situation that you will be
             speaking in will better prepare you for what to do and how to deliver your
             speech when it really counts.

             Something to Think About

             Each of us struggles with a certain aspect of delivery: voice, posture, eye
             contact, distracting movement, vocalized pauses, etc. What is yours?
             Based on this chapter and what you have already experienced in class,
             what is your biggest takeaway about improving delivery?

             We have found it helps students to do a few minutes of vocal or physical
             exercises together at the beginning of class on a "speech day." Examples
             are stretching, posture, breathing (such as saying the whole alphabet in
             one deep breath), and even power posing like Amy Cuddy advocates. Also,
             the class can be split into small groups and practice the first part (maybe
             minute) of their speech to each other to ease into the total experience.

Informative speech       12.1 - What is an Informative Speech?
a speech based entirely
and exclusively on       Defining what an informative speech is can be both straightforward and
facts and whose main     somewhat tricky at the same time. Very simply, an informative speech
purpose is to inform     can first be defined as a speech based entirely and exclusively on facts.
rather than persuade,    Basically, an informative speech conveys knowledge, a task that every
amuse, or inspire        person engages in every day in some form or another. Whether giving
                         someone who is lost driving directions, explaining the specials of the day
      Irrefutable        as a server, or describing the plot of a movie to friends, people engage
a statement or claim     in forms of informative speaking daily. Secondly, an informative speech
that cannot be argued    does not attempt to convince the audience that one thing is better than
                         another. It does not advocate a course of action. Consider the following
         Opinion         two statements:
a personal view,
attitude, or belief      2 + 2 = 4
about something
                         George Washington was the first President of the United States.

                         In each case, the statement made is what can be described as irrefutable,
                         meaning a statement or claim that cannot be argued. In the first example,
                         even small children are taught that having two apples and then getting
                         two more apples will result in having four apples. This statement is
                         irrefutable in that no one in the world will (or should!) argue this: It is a
                         (mathematical) fact.

                         Similarly, with the statement "George Washington was the first President
                         of the United States," this again is an irrefutable (historical) fact. If you
                         asked one hundred history professors and read one hundred history
                         textbooks, the professors and textbooks would all say the same thing:
                         Washington was the first president. No expert, reliable source, or person
                         with any common sense would argue about this.

                         (Someone at this point might say, "No, John Hanson was the first
                         president." However, he was president under the Articles of Confederation
                         for a short period--November 5, 1781, to November 3, 1782--not under
                         our present Constitution. This example shows the importance of stating
                         your facts clearly and precisely and being able to cite their origins.)

                         Therefore, an informative speech should not incorporate opinion as its
                         basis. This can be the tricky part of developing an informative speech,
                         because some opinion statements sometime sound like facts (since they
                         are generally agreed upon by many people), but are really opinions.

                         For example, in an informative speech on George Washington, you might
                         say, "George Washington was one of the greatest presidents in the history
                         of the United States." While this statement may be agreed upon by most
                         people, it is possible for some people to disagree and argue the opposite
                         point of view. The statement "George Washington was one of the greatest
                         presidents in the history of the United States" is not irrefutable, meaning
Exploring Public Speaking  251  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

someone could argue this claim, or its opposite: "George Washington was
not a great president." If, however, you present the opinion as an opinion
from a source, that is acceptable: it is a fact that someone (hopefully
someone with expertise) holds the opinion. You do not want your central
idea, your main points, and the majority of your supporting material to be
opinion or argument in an informative speech.

Additionally, you should never take sides on an issue in an informative
speech, nor should you "spin" the issue in order to influence the opinions
of the listeners. Even if you are informing the audience about opposing
views or different interpretations on controversial topics, you should
clearly and fairy explain the issues. This is not to say, however, that the
audience's needs and interests have nothing to do with the informative
speech. We come back to the WIIFM principle ("What's in it for me?)
because even though an informative speech is fact-based, it still needs to
relate to people's lives in order to maintain their attention and be worth
their time and effort.

The question may arise here, "If we can find anything on the Internet now,
why bother to give an informative speech?" The answer lies in the unique
relationship between audience and speaker found in the public speaking
context. The speaker can choose to present information that is of most
value to the audience. Secondly, the speaker is not just overloading the
audience with data. As we have mentioned before, that's not really a good
idea because audiences cannot remember great amounts of data and facts
after listening. The focus of the content is what matters. This is where
the specific purpose and central idea come into play. Remember, public
speaking is not a good way to "dump data" on the audience, but to make
information meaningful.

Finally, although we have stressed that the informative speech is fact-
based and does not have the purpose of persuasion, information still has
at least an indirect effect on someone. If a classmate gives a speech on
correctly using the Heimlich Maneuver to help a choking victim, the side
effect (and probably desired result) is that the audience would use it when
confronted with the situation.

12.2 - Types of Informative Speeches

While the topics to choose from for informative speeches are
nearly limitless, they can generally be put into five broad categories.
Understanding the type of informative speech that you will be giving can
help you to figure out the best way to organize, research, and prepare for it,
as will be discussed below.
Exploring Public Speaking  252  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

Type 1: History

A common approach to selecting an informative speech topic is to discuss
the history or development of something. With so much of human
knowledge available via the Internet, finding information about the
origins and evolution of almost anything is much easier than it has ever
been (with the disclaimer that there are many websites out there with
false information). With that in mind, some of the areas that a historical
informative speech could cover would include:

Objects

(Example: the baseball; the saxophone). Someone at some point in history
was the first to develop what is considered the modern baseball. Who was
it? What was it originally made of? How did the baseball used in the 1800s
evolve into the baseball that is used by Major League Baseball today?

Places

(Example: your college; Disney World). There is a specific year that you
college or university opened, a specific number of students who were
initially enrolled, and often colleges and universities have name and
mission changes. All of these facts can be used to provide an overall
understanding of the college and its history. Likewise, the Disney World of
today is different from the Disney World of the early 1970s; the design has
developed over the last fifty years.

Ideas

(Example: democracy; freedom of speech). It is possible to provide facts
on an idea, although in some cases the information may be less precise.
For example, while no one can definitively point to a specific date or
individual who first developed the concept of democracy, it is known
to have been conceived in ancient Greece (Raaflaub, Ober, & Wallace,
2007). By looking at the civilizations and cultures that adopted forms of
democracy throughout history, it is possible to provide an audience with
a better understanding of how the idea has been shaped into what it has
become today.

Type 2: Biography

A biography is similar to a history, but in this case the subject is
specifically a person, whether living or deceased. For the purposes of
this class, biographies should focus on people of some note or fame,
since doing research on people who are not at least mildly well-known
could be difficult. There is also the question of "why?" The subject of the
biography should have some connection, impact, or role in the audience's
Exploring Public Speaking  253  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

lives. For example, Charles Drew; he invented the "blood bank," a modern
institution we cannot imagine living without. He has a fascinating life
story and an urban myth surrounding his tragic death.

As with histories, there are specific and irrefutable facts that can help
provide an overview of someone's life, such as dates that President Lincoln
was born (February 12, 1809) and died (April 15, 1865) and the years
he was in office as president (1861-1865). This might be a good place
to address research and support. The basic dates of Abraham Lincoln's
life could be found in multiple sources and you would not have to cite
the source in that case. But it you use the work of a specific historian to
explain how Lincoln was able to win the presidency in the tumultuous
years before the Civil War, that would need a citation of that author and
the publication.

Type 3: Processes

Examples of process speech topics would be how to bake chocolate chip
cookies, how to throw a baseball, how a nuclear reactor works, or how a
bill works its way through Congress.

Process speeches are sometimes referred to as demonstration or "how
to" speeches because they often entail demonstrating something. These
speeches require you to provide steps that will help your audience
understand how to accomplish a specific task or process. However, How
To speeches can be tricky in that there are rarely universally agreed upon
(i.e. irrefutable) ways to do anything. If your professor asked the students
in his or her public speaking class to each bring in a recipe for baking
chocolate chip cookies, would all of them be the exact same recipe?

Probably not, but they would all be similar and, most importantly, they
would all give you chocolate chip cookies as the end result. Students giving
a demonstration speech will want to avoid saying "You should bake the
cookies for 12 minutes" since that is not how everyone does it. Instead, the
student should say something like:

        "You can bake the cookies for 10 minutes."

        "One option is to bake the cookies for 10 minutes."

        "This particular recipe calls for the cookies to be baked for 10
         minutes."

Each of the previous three statements is absolutely a fact that no one can
argue or disagree with. While some people may say 12 minutes is too long
or too short (depending on how soft or hard they like their cookies), no
one can reasonably argue that these statements are not true.

On the other hand, there is a second type of process speech that focuses
not on how the audience can achieve a result, such as changing oil in
Exploring Public Speaking  254  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

their cars or cooking something, but on how a process is achieved. The
goal is understanding and not performance. After a speech on how to
change a car tire, the audience members could probably do it (they might
not want to, but they would know the steps in an emergency). However,
after a speech on how a bill goes through Congress, the audience would
understand this important part of democracy but not be ready to serve in
Congress.

Type 4: Ideas and Concepts

Sometimes an informative speech is designed to explain an idea or
concept. What does democracy mean? What is justice? In this case, you
will want to do two things. First, use the definition methods listed in
Chapter 6, such as classification and differentiation. The second is to make
your concept concrete, real, and specific for your audience with examples.

Type 5: Categories or divisions

Sometimes an informative speech topic doesn't lend itself to a specific
type of approach, and in those cases the topics tend to fall into a "general"
category of informative speeches. For example, if a student wanted to give
an informative speech on the four "C's" of diamonds (cut, carat, color, and
clarity), they certainly wouldn't approach it as if they were providing the
history of diamonds, nor would they necessarily be informing anyone
on "how to" shop for or buy diamonds or how diamonds are mined. The
approach in this case would simply be to inform an audience on the four
"C's" and what they mean. Other examples of this type of informative
speech would be positions in playing volleyball or the customs to know
when traveling in a specific foreign county.

As stated above, identifying the type of informative speech being given can
help in several ways (conducting research, writing the introduction and
conclusion), but perhaps the biggest benefit is that the type of informative
speech being given will help determine, to some degree, the organizational
pattern that will need to be used (see Chapter 6). For example, a How
To speech must be in chronological order. There really isn't a way (or
reason) to present a How To speech other than how the process is done
Exploring Public Speaking  255  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

in a time sequence. That is to say, for a speech on how to bake chocolate
chip cookies, getting the ingredients (Main Point 1) must come before
mixing the ingredients (Main Point 2), which must come before baking
them (Main Point 3). Putting them in any other order will only confuse the
audience.

Similarly, most Histories and Biographies will be organized
chronologically, but not always. It makes sense to explain the history of
the baseball from when it was first developed to where it is today, but
certain approaches to Histories and Biographies can make that irrelevant.
For an informative speech on Benjamin Franklin, a student might choose
as his or her three main points: 1) His time as a printer, 2) His time as
an inventor, 3) His time as a diplomat. These main points are not in
strict chronological order because Franklin was a printer, inventor, and
diplomat at the same time during overlapping periods of his whole life.

As for general informative speeches, since the topics that can be included
in this category are very diverse and cover a range of subject matter, the
way they are organized will be varied as well. However, if the topic is
"types of" something or "kinds of" something, the organizational pattern
would be topical; if it were the layout of a location, such as the White
House, it would be spatial (refer to Chapter 6 for more on Organization).

12.3 - Guidelines for Selecting an Informative

Speech Topic

While some of the guidelines for selecting a topic were discussed
in Chapters 2, 4, and 5, this section will more specifically focus on
informative speech topics and problems that can arise when choosing
them.

Pick a specific or focused topic

Perhaps one of the most common misconceptions students have about
informative speech topics is that the topic needs to be broad in order to
fill the time requirements for the speech. It is not uncommon for a student
to propose an informative speech topic such as "To inform my audience
about the history of music." How is that topic even possible? When did
the history of music even begin? The thinking here is that this speech will
be easy to research and write since there is so much information available.
But the opposite is actually true. A topic this broad makes doing research
even harder if not impossible.

Let's consider the example of a student who proposes the topic "To inform
my audience about the Civil War." The Civil War was, conservatively
speaking, four years long, resulted in over 750,000 casualties, and
Exploring Public Speaking  256  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

arguably changed the course of human history. So to think that it is
possible to cover all of that in five to seven minutes is unrealistic. Also, a
typical college library has hundreds of books dealing with the Civil War.
How will you choose which ones are best suited to use for your speech?

The better approach in this case is to be as specific as possible. A revised
specific purpose for this speech might be something like "To inform my
audience about the Gettysburg Address" or "to inform my classmates out
the Confederate Army's strategy in the Battle of Chickamauga." These
topics are much more compact (the Gettysburg Address is only a few
minutes long), and doing research will now be exponentially easier--
although you will still find hundreds of sources on them. Or, an even
more specific topic would be like the one in the outline at the end of this
chapter: "To inform my classmates of the specific places in Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania, that are considered haunted."

Instead of looking through all the books in your campus library on the
Civil War, searching through the library's databases and catalog for
material on the Gettysburg Address will yield a much more manageable
number of books and articles. It may sound counterintuitive, but selecting
a speech topic that is very specifically focused will make the research and
writing phases of the informative speech much easier.

Avoid faux or fake informative speech topics

Sometimes students think that because something sounds like an
informative speech topic, it is one. This happens a lot with political issues
that are usually partisan in nature. Some students may feel that the
speech topic "To inform my audience why William Henry Harrison was
a bad president" sounds factual, but really this is an opinion. Similarly, a
number of topics that include conspiracy and paranormal subject matter
are usually mistaken for good informative topics as well.
Exploring Public Speaking  257  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

It is not uncommon for a student to propose the topic "To inform my
audience about the existence of extraterrestrials," thinking it is a good
topic. After all, there is plenty of evidence to support the claim, right?
There are pictures of unidentified objects in the sky that people claim are
from outer space, there are people who claim to have seen extraterrestrials,
and most powerful of all, there are people who say that they have been
abducted by aliens and taken into space. Congress even held hearings
about them in 2022!

The problem here, as you have probably already guessed, is that these
facts are not irrefutable. Not every single person who sees something
unknown in the sky will agree it is an alien spacecraft, and there can be
little doubt that not everyone who claims to have been abducted by a UFO
is telling the truth. This isn't to say that you can't still do an informative
speech on alien sites. For example, two viable options are "To inform my
audience about the SETI Project" or "To inform my audience of the origin
of the Area 51 conspiracy." However, these types of speeches can quickly
devolve into opinion if you aren't careful, which would then make them
persuasive speeches. Even if you start by trying to be objective, unless you
can present each side equally, it will end up becoming a persuasive speech.
Additionally, when a speaker picks such a topic, it is often because of a
latent desire to persuade the audience about them.

12.4 - Guidelines for Preparing an Informative

Speech

Don't Be Too Broad

In preparing and writing an informative speech, one of the most common
mistakes students make is to think that they must be comprehensive in
covering their topic, which isn't realistic. Take for example an informative
speech on Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was 56 years old when he died, so
to think that it is possible to cover his entire life's story in 5 to 7 minutes
is unrealistic. A more focused speech on Lincoln might have the specific
purpose: "To inform my audience about Abraham Lincoln's administration
of the Civil War." This is still a huge topic in that massive books have been
written about it, but it could be addressed in three or four main points
such as:

    I. The Civil War began in the aftermath of Lincoln's Election and
          Inauguration

    II. Finding the right military leaders for the Union was his major
          challenge at the beginning.

    III. The Emancipation Proclamation changed the nature of the War.
    IV. Lincoln adopted a policy that led to the North's victory.
Exploring Public Speaking  258  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

Regardless of the topic, you will never be able to cover everything that is
known about your topic, so don't try. Select the resources that will best
help the audience gain a general understanding of the topic, that will
interest them, and that they hopefully will find valuable.

Be Accurate, Clear, and Interesting

A good informative speech conveys accurate information to the audience
in a way that is clear and that keeps the listener interested in the topic.
Achieving all three of these goals--accuracy, clarity, and interest--is the
key to being an effective speaker. If information is inaccurate, incomplete,
or unclear, it will be of limited usefulness to the audience.

Part of being accurate is making sure that your information is current.
Even if you know a great deal about your topic or wrote a good paper on
the topic in a high school course, you will need to verify the accuracy and
completeness of what you know, especially if it is medical or scientific
information. Most people understand that technology and scientific
knowledge changes rapidly, so you need to update your information
almost constantly. The same is true for topics that, on the surface, may
seem to require less updating. For example, the Civil War occurred over
150 years ago, but contemporary research still offers new and emerging
theories about the events leading up to the war, its execution, and its long-
term effects. So even with a topic that seems to be unchanging, carefully
check the information to be sure it's accurate and up to date.

What defines "interesting?" In approaching the informative speech, you
should keep in mind the good overall principle that the audience is asking,
"what's in it for me?" The audience is either consciously or unconsciously
wondering "What is in this topic for me? How can I use this information?
Of what value is this speech content to me? Why should I listen to it?" One
reason this textbook uses examples of the Civil War is that the authors'
college is located by several Civil War sites and even a major battlefield.
Students see reminders of the Civil War on a regular basis.

You might consider it one of the jobs of the introduction to answer these
questions directly or indirectly. If you can't, then you need to think about
your topic and why you are addressing it. If it's only because the topic is
interesting to you, you are missing the point. For example, why should we
know about Abraham Lincoln's administration of the Civil War? Obviously,
because it had significant, long-term consequences to Americans, and you
should articulate that in terms the audience can understand.

Keep in Mind Audience Diversity

Finally, remember that not everyone in your audience is the same, so
an informative speech should be prepared with audience diversity in
mind. If the information in a speech is too complex or too simplistic, it
Exploring Public Speaking  259  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

will not hold the interest of the listeners. Determining the right level of
complexity can be hard. Audience analysis is one important way to do this
(see Chapter 2). Do the members of your audience belong to different age
groups? Did they all go to public schools in the United States, or are some
them international students? Are they all students majoring in the same
subject, or is there a mixture of majors? Never assume that just because an
audience is made up of students, they all share a knowledge or experience
set. Equally, they may not be affected equally or similarly by the same
information; the Civil War is an example of this kind of topic. Audience
members of different backgrounds would have unique perspectives and
interpretations of those events; an international student, for example, may
have very little background knowledge compared to a person who grew up
in a Southern state where the Civil War was fought.

12.5 - Giving Informative Speeches in Groups

There are instances where you will be called upon to give an informative
speech as part of a group of other informative speakers. This situation
may be referred to as a panel or as a symposium. The difference is that in
a panel, the focus is on a discussion by experts in front of an audience. The
expert speakers may start with an opening statement, but typically the
panelists are seated and their opening remarks are designed to present
their basic position or stance and the bulk of time is spent in question-
and-answer from the audience, from the moderator, or from each other.
Some tips for panels are given here.

A symposium is more formal and the experts or presenters have put
together prepared speeches on different aspects of an overall topic. For
example, they may all be experts on juveniles in the criminal justice
system, but they have chosen or been assigned a specific informative topic
for the audience, who are probably also professionals in that field. One
might speak on challenges with legal representation for juveniles, another
on family reconciliation, another on educational opportunities, and so on.
While there may be time for question and answers at the end, the bulk of
the time is taken up by the prepared speeches.

One of the authors has used the symposium format in her teaching
of the informative speech for over 30 years. The students at first are
skeptical, but usually afterward they see the benefit of the experience in
the classroom. For one thing, instead of a class of 25-30 separate and
unrelated informative speeches, there are three or four sets of related
speeches that explore a topic in more depth. Some popular topics
have been physical and mental health issues (diabetes, breast cancer,
schizophrenia, phobias), life choices (pets, life skills, college success), the
arts (musical genres, history of film), travel, and food. In those years, there
have been topics that didn't work. Serial killers and sexually transmitted
infections were two of them. One speech on those subjects is interesting.
Exploring Public Speaking  260  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

Six or seven, not as much. Just to clarify, the author always assigns the
groups but the students pick the topics.

Here are some pointers if you are assigned to give a symposium-style
informative speech.

    1. Spend ample time discussing the topics so that everyone is
        supportive of the overall topic and the way the topic is broken down
        into separate speech topics. Do not let one person run the show and
        insist on a specific topic. A strong personality can sway the rest of
        the group and then later the other members become unhappy about
        the topic and resentful of the persuasive member.

    2. Try to develop topics in different ways; for example, let's take the
        overall topic of phobias. The temptation is for each separate speech
        to be a specific phobia. While this is all right, it becomes repetitive to
        the audience. There are other ways to develop the subtopics (origins,
        different treatment options, phobias related to certain demographic
        groups) instead of six or seven speeches on different phobias.

    3. Be in constant communication with your peers so that you know
        exactly what their topics are and how they are being developed. You
        don't want one or two co-presenters to "go rogue" and change their
        topics without the knowledge of the others in the group. You also
        do not want to end up overlapping, so that part of your speech is
        actually in someone else's speech. Share phone numbers so you can
        text or call each other, if the members are willing.

    4. You should appoint a moderator who will introduce the speeches
        and speakers and close or call for questions when the speeches are
        completed, and possibly summarize the set of speeches at the end.
       This member does not have to be the first or last speaker in the
        group.

    5. Be sure the order of speeches is logical, not random.
    6. Be sure to get to the class early so you can set up and feel secure that

       your team members are present.
    7. If you are required to have a question-and-answer session at the

        end, the moderator should try to make sure that the participation is
        balanced and one talkative person doesn't answer all the questions.
       There will be questions you cannot answer, so just be honest and say,
       "I didn't find that answer in my research."
Many instructors use this format because it not only teaches informative
speaking skills, but because it emphasizes team work. You will be expected
to do many team projects in your educational and professional careers,
and this is a good way to start learning effective teamwork skills.

Conclusion

Learning how to give informative speeches will serve you well in your
college career and your future work. Keep in mind the principles
Exploring Public Speaking  261  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

in this chapter but also those of the previous chapters: relating to
the informational needs of the audience, using clear structure, and
incorporating interesting and attention-getting supporting evidence.

Something to Think About

Here are three general topics for informative speeches. Write specific
purposes for them and explain how you would answer the WIIFM
question.

     1. Type 1 diabetes
     2. The psychological effects of using social media
     3. Guitars
Two outlines for informative speeches are provided on the following pages.
They utilize slightly different formats; other outline formats are included
in one of the appendices. Your instructor will let you know which one he or
she prefers or will provide examples of another format. The speech about
"haunted places in Gettysburg" may seem persuasive, but the specific
purpose says "places ... that are considered haunted," not "are haunted."

Sample Outline: Informative Speech on Lord

Byron

By Shannon Stanley

Specific Purpose: To inform my audience about the life of George Gordon,
Lord Byron.

Central Idea: George Gordon, Lord Byron overcame physical hardships,
was a world-renowned poet, and an advocate for the Greek's war for
freedom.

Introduction

    I. Imagine an eleven year old boy who has been beaten and sexually
          abused repeatedly by the very person who is supposed to take care
          of him.
              A. This is one of the many hurdles that George Gordon, better
                    known as Lord Byron, overcame during his childhood.
              B. Lord Byron was also a talented poet with the ability to
                    transform his life into the words of his poetry.
              C. Byron became a serious poet by the age of fifteen and he
                    was first published in 1807 at the age of nineteen.
              D. Lord Byron was a staunch believer in freedom and equality,
                    so he gave most of his fortune, and in the end, his very life,
                    supporting the Greek's war for independence.
              E. While many of you have probably never heard of Lord
Exploring Public Speaking  262  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

                           Byron, his life and written work will become more familiar
                           to you when you take Humanities 1201, as I learned when I
                           took it last semester.

Body

II. Lord Byron was born on January 22, 1788 to Captain John Byron
and Catherine Gordon Byron.

              A. According to Paul Trueblood, the author of Lord Byron,
                    Lord Byron's father only married Catherine for her dowry,
                    which he quickly went through, leaving his wife and child
                    nearly penniless.

              B. By the age of two, Lord Byron and his mother had moved
                    to Aberdeen in Scotland and shortly thereafter, his father
                    died in France at the age of thirty-six.

              C. Lord Byron was born with a clubbed right foot, which is a
                    deformity that caused his foot to turn sideways instead of
                    remaining straight, and his mother had no money to seek
                    treatment for this painful and embarrassing condition.
                       1. He would become very upset and fight anyone who
                             even spoke of his lameness.
                       2. Despite his handicap, Lord Byron was very active
                             and liked competing with the other boys.

              D. At the age of ten, his grand-uncle died leaving him the title
                    as the sixth Baron Byron of Rochdale.
                       1. With this title, he also inherited Newstead Abbey, a
                             dilapidated estate that was in great need of repair.
                       2. Because the Abbey was in Nottinghamshire England,
                             he and his mother moved there and stayed at the
                             abbey until it was rented out to pay for the necessary
                             repairs.
                       3. During this time, May Gray, Byron's nurse had
                             already begun physically and sexually abusing him.
                       4. A year passed before he finally told his guardian,
                             John Hanson, about May's abuse; she was fired
                             immediately.
                       5. Unfortunately the damage had already been done.
                       6. In the book Lord Byron, it is stated that years later
                             he wrote "My passions were developed very early- so
                             early, that few would believe me if I were to state the
                             period, and the facts which accompanied it."

              E. Although Lord Byron had many obstacles to overcome
                    during his childhood, he became a world renowned poet by
                    the age of 24.

III. Lord Byron experienced the same emotions we all do, but he was
able to express those emotions in the form of his poetry and share them
with the world.

              A. According to Horace Gregory, The author of Poems of
Exploring Public Speaking  263  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

IV.                George Gordon, Lord Byron, the years from 1816 through
of the             1824 is when Lord Byron was most known throughout
                   Europe.
              B. But according to Paul Trueblood, Childe Harold was
                    published in 1812 and became one of the best-selling works
                    of literature in the 19th century.

                       1. Childe Harold was written while Lord Byron was
                             traveling through Europe after graduating from
                             Trinity College.

                       2. Many authors such as Trueblood, and Garrett, the
                             author of George Gordon, Lord Byron, express their
                             opinion that Childe Harold is an autobiography
                             about Byron and his travels.

              C. Lord Byron often wrote about the ones he loved the most,
                    such as the poem "She Walks in Beauty" written about his
                    cousin Anne Wilmont, and "Stanzas for Music" written for
                    his half-sister, Augusta Leigh.

              D. He was also an avid reader of the Old Testament and would
                   write poetry about stories from the Bible that he loved.
                       1. One such story was about the last king of Babylon.
                       2. This poem was called the "Vision of Belshazzar," and
                             is very much like the bible version in the book of
                             Daniel.

              E. Although Lord Byron is mostly known for his talents as
                    a poet, he was also an advocate for the Greek's war for
                    independence.

        Lord Byron, after his self-imposed exile from England, took the side
        Greek's in their war for freedom from Turkish rule.

              A. Byron arrived in Greece in 1823 during a civil war.
                       1. The Greek's were too busy fighting amongst
                             themselves to come together to form a formidable
                             army against the Turks.
                       2. According to Martin Garrett, Lord Byron donated
                             money to refit the Greek's fleet of ships, but did not
                             immediately get involved in the situation.
                       3. He had doubts as to if or when the Greek's would
                             ever come together and agree long enough to make
                             any kind of a difference in their war effort.
                       4. Eventually the Greek's united and began their
                             campaign for the Greek War of Independence.
                       5. He began pouring more and more of his fortune into
                             the Greek army and finally accepted a position to
                             oversee a small group of men sailing to Missolonghi.

              B. Lord Byron set sail for Missolonghi in Western Greece
                    in 1824. 1. He took a commanding position over a small
                    number of the Greek army despite his lack of military
Exploring Public Speaking                    264  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

                                             Lord Byron died on April 19, 1824 at the age of 36 due to
                                             the inexperienced doctors who continued to bleed him
                                             while he suffered from a severe fever.

                                                1. After Lord Byron's death, the Greek War of
                                                      Independence, due to his support, received more
                                                      foreign aid which led to their eventual victory in
                                                     1832.

                                                2. Lord Byron is hailed as a national hero by the Greek
                                                      nation.

                                                3. Many tributes such as statues and road-names have
                                                      been devoted to Lord Byron since the time of his
                                                      death.

V. In conclusion, Lord Byron overcame great physical hardships to
become a world-renowned poet, and is seen as a hero to the Greek nation
and is mourned by them still today.

              A. I have chosen not to focus on Lord Byron's more liberal
                    way of life, but rather to focus on his accomplishments in
                    life.

              B. He was a man who owed no loyalty to Greece, yet gave his
                    life to support their cause.

              C. Most of the world will remember Lord Byron primarily
                    through his written attributes, but Greece will always
                    remember him as the "Trumpet Voice of Liberty."

Sample Outline: Informative Speech on
Haunted Places in Gettysburg

By Leslie Dean

Specific Purpose: To inform my classmates of specific places in Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania, that are considered to be haunted.
Exploring Public Speaking  265  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

Introduction: Do you believe in paranormal activity? Have you ever been
to a place that is haunted? My personal opinion on this subject matter
is open to question; however, there are a lot of people that have had
firsthand encounters with the paranormal. Throughout the world there
are countless places that are considered to be haunted by tormented souls
that still lurk among us in search of a way to free their souls. Most places
that claim to be haunted are intertwined with tales of battles and as a
result many fatalities. Tragic times in history make for the perfect breeding
grounds for the haunted places that exist today.

Thesis/Preview: Gettysburg is a city that is plagued by historical events
that play a role in the manifestations that haunt Gettysburg today.
These include locations at The Devil's Den, Little Round Top, and the
Hummelbaugh House.

    I. The Devil's Den is considered a site for paranormal activity.
              A. The Devil's Den has historical significance retained during
                    the American Civil War.
                       1. Location held heavy fighting during battle that took
                             place on July 2, of 1863.
                       2. The total death toll estimated during battle
                             consisted of 800 for the Union and more than 1,800
                             for the Confederates.
              B. Some reported paranormal activity at the Devil's Den.
                       1. According to author, consultant, and lecturer Dennis
                             William Hauck, he states in his book Haunted Places
                             that if you stand outside at the Devil's Den there can
                             be the sounds of drum rolls and gunshots heard.
                       2. According to many visitors there have been many
                             people that claim to have seen and/or taken pictures
                             of and had conversations with a friendly soldier who
                             either disappears or doesn't show up in photographs.

Transition: Spooky, unexplainable things happen at the Devil's Den but
there is also paranormal activity in another area of Gettysburg, Little
Round Top.

II. Another location said to be haunted is Little Round Top.
              A. Little Round Top's historical significance.
                       1. A site where Union soldiers held up to maintain an
                             advantage over the Confederate soldiers.
                       2. According to James Brann, an author from Civil
                             War Magazine, this was a site Union Colonel
                             Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain led his 20th Maine
                             Regiment in perhaps the most famous counterattack
                             of the Civil War.
              B. Manifestations at Little Round Top.
                       1. During filming of the movie Gettysburg (1993),
Exploring Public Speaking  266  Chapter 12: Informative Speaking
Version 4.2

                             extras portraying Union soldiers were greeted by a
                             man in the uniform of a Union private.

                                   a. Handed them musket rounds.
                                   b. Actual rounds that dated back to the Civil

                                        War.
                       2. Ghostly solders can still be seen marching in

                             formation and riding horses in the fight against their
                             enemy.
Transition: It seems that a lot of landmarks are haunted but there are also
structures known to be stricken with paranormal activity.

III. Hummelbaugh House is a non-battlefield place for ghost-sightings.
              A. Historical significance of Hummelbaugh House.
                       1. The house is located on the east side of the city and
                             was just behind the Union lines.
                       2. It was used for a hospital and because of the times
                             amputated limbs would be thrown out the windows
                             resulting in a huge pile of body parts.
              B. Paranormal activity at the house.
                       1. The windows in the house often startle people with
                             loud vibrations.
                       2. The calls for help from soldiers can still be heard in
                             and around the house.

Conclusion: In closing, according to History.com the Battle of Gettysburg
was one of the biggest in the Civil War, resulting in over 150,000
causalities. With these statistics it is no surprise that lost souls still lurk
the eerie grounds of this historical place. Whether it is vibrating windows
or actual encounters with soldiers from 1863, Gettysburg has more
than enough encounters with the paranormal to convince the biggest of
doubters. Going to Gettysburg would guarantee a chance to literally step
back in time and encounter something that is only remembered in history
books. So believer in the paranormal or not, Gettysburg is a place to go to
experience a part of history whether it be historical sites or a random run
in with a ghostly soldier.

13.1 - Why Persuade?

When your instructor announced on the syllabus or in class that you
would be required to give a persuasive speech for this class, what was
your reaction? "Oh, good, I've got a great idea," or, "Oh, no!"? For
many people, there is something a little uncomfortable about the word
"persuasion." It often gets paired with ideas of seduction, manipulation,
force, lack of choice, or inducement as well as more positive concepts such
as encouragement, influence, urging, or logical arguments. You might
get suspicious if you think someone is trying to persuade you. You might
not appreciate someone telling you to change your viewpoints. On the
other hand, you might not think you have any beliefs, attitudes, values, or
positions that are worth advocating for in front of an audience.

However, if you think of persuasion simply as a formal speech with a
purpose of getting people to do something they do not want to do, then
you will miss the value of learning persuasion and its accompanying skills
of appeal, argument, and logic. Persuasion is something you do every day,
in various forms. Convincing a friend to go see the latest movie instead
of staying in to watch TV; giving your instructor a reason to give you an
extension on an assignment (do not try that for this speech, though!);
writing a cover letter and resume and going through an interview for a
job--all of these and so many more are examples of persuasion. In fact, it
is hard to think of life without the everyday give-and-take of persuasion.

You may also be thinking, "I've given an informative speech. What's
the difference?" While this chapter will refer to all of the content of the
preceding chapters as it walks you through the steps of composing your
persuasive speech, there is a difference. Although your persuasive speech
will involve information--probably even as much as in your informative
speech--the key difference is the word "change." Think of it like this:

INFORMATION + CHANGE = PERSUASION

You will be using the information for the purpose of changing something.
First, we try to change the audience's beliefs, attitudes, and actions,
and second, possibly the context they act upon. In the next section we
will investigate the persuasive act and then move on to the barriers to
persuasion.

13.2 - A Definition of Persuasion

Persuasion can be defined in two ways, for two purposes. The first
(Lucas, 2015) is "the process of creating, reinforcing, or changing people's
beliefs or actions" (p. 306). This is a good, simple straightforward
definition to start with, although it does not encompass the complexity
Exploring Public Speaking  269      Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

of persuasion. This definition does introduce us to what could be called a
"scaled" way of thinking about persuasion and change.

Figure 13.1 - Persuasion Continuum

Think of persuasion as a continuum or line going both directions (see               Proposition
Figure 13.1). Your audience members, either as a group or individually, are
sitting somewhere on that line in reference to your central idea statement,   The central idea
or what we are going to call a proposition in this chapter. In your speech    statement in a
you are proposing the truth or validity of an idea, one which the audience    persuasive speech;
may not find true or acceptable. Sometimes the word "claim" is used for       a statement made
proposition or central idea statement in a persuasive speech, because you     advancing a judgment
are claiming an idea is true or an action is valuable.                        or opinion

For example, your proposition might be, "The main cause of climate
change is human activity." In this case you are not denying that natural
forces, such as volcanoes, can affect the climate, but you are claiming
that climate change is mainly due to pollution and other harmful things
humans have done to the environment. To be an effective persuasive
speaker, one of your first jobs after coming up with this topic would be to
determine where your audience "sits" on the continuum in Figure 13.1.

        +3 means strongly agree to the point of making lifestyle choices
         to lessen climate change (such as riding a bike instead of driving
         a car, recycling, eating certain kinds of foods, and advocating for
         government policy changes).

        +2 means agree but not to the point of acting upon it or only acting
         on it in small ways.

        +1 as mildly in favor of your proposition; that is, they think it's
         probably true but the issue doesn't affect them personally.

         0 means neutral, no opinion, or feeling too uninformed to make a
         decision.

        -1 means mildly opposed to the proposition but willing to listen to
         those with whom they disagree.
Exploring Public Speaking  270  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

         -2 means disagreement to the point of dismissing the idea pretty
         quickly.

         -3 means strong opposition to the point that the concept of climate
         change itself is not even listened to or acknowledged as a valid
         subject .

Since everyone in the audience is somewhere on this line or continuum,
persuasion in this case means moving them to the right, somewhere closer
to +3. Thinking about persuasion this way has three values:

     You can visualize and quantify where your audience "sits."

     You can accept the fact that any movement toward +3 or to the right
       is a win.

     You can see that trying to change an audience from -3 to +3 in one
       speech is just about impossible. Therefore, you will be able to take a
       reasonable approach. In this case, if you knew most of the audience
       was at -2 or -3, your speech would be about the science behind
       climate change in order to open their minds to its possible existence.
       However, that audience is not ready to hear about its being caused
       mainly by humans or what action should be taken to reverse it.

In this case, do not conclude that it is pointless to try to persuade or
"reason with" some people. It could be a matter of steps. Yes, confirmation
bias and perceptual selectivity keep people from being open enough to
listen to opposing arguments, but humans are often more interested
in listening to people who are willing to listen, respect, and have a
relationship with them rather than simply argue with or at them.

Your instructor may have the class engage in some activity about your
proposed topics in order for you to write your proposition in a way that it
is more applicable to your audience. For example, you might have a group
discussion on the topics or administer surveys to your fellow students.
Some topics are so controversial and divisive that trying to persuade about
them in class is inappropriate, often because of limited time allotted for
each speech and consequent lack of time to explore the question in depth.
Your instructor may forbid some topics or steer you in the direction of
others, probably because they have learned from experience that a subject
is too controversial to deal with in a short speech in a classroom context or
that the topic is overused and does not challenge the students. That does
not mean the subject should not be addressed in other venues.

You might also ask if it is possible to persuade to the negative, for example,
to argue against something or try to move the audience to be opposed to
something. In this case you would be trying to move your audience to the
left on the continuum rather than to the right. Yes, it is possible to do so,
but it might confuse the audience. Also, you might want to think in terms
Exploring Public Speaking  271  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

of phrasing your proposition so that it is favorable as well as reasonable.       Target audience
For example, "Elderly people should not be licensed to drive" could be         the members of an
replaced with "Drivers over the age of 75 in our state of should be required   audience the speaker
to pass a vision and health test every two years to renew their drivers'       most wants to
licenses." The first one is not clear (what is "elderly?"), reasonable (no     persuade and who are
license at all?), or positive (based on restriction) in approach. The second   likely to be receptive to
is specific, reasonable, doable, and positive. Your audience may disagree,     persuasive messages
but the proposition itself is not extreme or vaguely stated.
                                                                                      Persuasion
It should also be added that the proposition is assumed to be controversial.    A symbolic process in

would be foolish to give a speech when everyone in the audience totally         people to change

called the target audience. These are the members of your audience on           choice
whom you are truly focusing your persuasion. At the same time, another
cluster of your audience that is not part of your target audience are those
who are extremely opposed to your position to the point that they probably
will not give you a fair hearing. Additionally, some members of your
audience may already agree with you and be well informed; others may
agree even though they don't know why, and still others may agree with
you but are not taking action.

To go back to our original definition, "the process of creating, reinforcing,
or changing people's beliefs or actions," and each of these purposes
implies a different approach. You can think of creating as moving an
audience from 0 to +1, +2, or +3. You only really "create" something when
it does not already exist, meaning the audience's attitude will be a 0 since
they have no opinion. In creating, you have to first engage the audience
that there is a vital issue at stake. Then you must provide arguments in
favor of your claim to give the audience a basis for belief.

Reinforcing is moving the audience from +1 toward +3 in the hope that
they take action (since the real test of belief is whether people act on it).
In reinforcing, the audience already agrees with you but need steps and
pushes (nudges) to make it action. Changing is moving from -1 or -2 to
+1 or higher. In changing, you must first be credible, provide evidence for
your side but also show why the audience's current beliefs are mistaken or
incompletely informed.

However, this simple definition, while it gets to the core of "change" that
is inherent in persuasion, could be improved with some attention to the
Exploring Public Speaking  272  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

   Mental dialogue       ethical component and the "how" of persuasion. For that purpose, let's
                         look at Perloff's (2003) definition of persuasion:
an imagined
conversation the                 A symbolic process in which communicators try to convince other
speaker has with a                people to change their attitudes or behavior regarding an issue

which the speaker                 choice. (p. 8)
tries to anticipate
what questions,          There are several important factors about this definition. First, notice
concerns, or issues the  that persuasion is symbolic, that is, uses language or other symbols (even
audience may have        graphics can be symbols), rather than force or other means. Second,
to the subject under     notice that it is an attempt, not always fully successful. Third, there is
discussion               an "atmosphere of free choice," in that the persons being persuaded
                         can choose not to believe or act. And fourth, notice that the persuader
                         is "trying to convince others to change." Modern psychological research
                         has confirmed that the persuader does not always or necessarily change
                         the audience directly (Aronson, 1999). The processes that the human
                         mind goes through while it listens to a persuasive message is like a silent,
                         mental dialogue the audience is having with the speaker's ideas. The
                         audience members as individuals eventually convince themselves to
                         change based on the "symbols" used by the speaker.

                         Some of this may sound like splitting hairs, but these are important
                         points. The fact that an audience has free choice means that they are active
                         participants in their own persuasion and that they can choose whether the
                         speaker is successful. This factor calls on the student speaker to be ethical
                         and truthful. Sometimes students will say, "It is just a class assignment, I
                         can lie in this speech," but that is not a fair or respectful way to treat your
                         classmates.

                         Further, the basis of your persuasion is language; even though "a picture
                         is worth a thousand words" and can help add emotional appeal to your
                         speech, you want to focus on communicating through words. Also,
                         Perloff's definition distinguishes between "attitude" and "behavior,"
                         meaning that an audience may be persuaded to think, to feel, or to act.
                         Finally, persuasion is a process. Successful persuasion actually takes a
                         while. One speech can be effective, but usually an accumulation of other
                         messages influences the listener in the long run. That is why people can be
                         persuaded from -3 to +3, but over time, not overnight.

                         13.3 - Why is Persuasion Hard?

                         Persuasion is hard mainly because we have a bias against change. As much
                         as we hear statements like "The only constant is change" or "Variety is the
                         spice of life," the evidence from research and from our personal experience
                         shows that, in reality, we do not like change. Recent research, for example,
                         in risk aversion, points to how we are more concerned to keep from losing
                         something we have than with gaining something else. Change is often seen
Exploring Public Speaking  273  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

as a loss of something rather than a gain of something else. Change is a        Selective exposure
step into the unknown, a gamble (Vedantam & Greene, 2013).
                                                                               the decision to expose

holidays (12 LCUs). Change is stressful. We do not generally embrace           disagreement between
things that bring us stress.                                                   conflicting thoughts
                                                                               and/or actions),
Additionally, communication scholars have pointed to how we go out of          which can be very
our way to protect our beliefs, attitudes, and values. First, we selectively   uncomfortable, and
expose ourselves to messages that we already agree with, rather than           results in actions to get
those that confront or challenge us. This selective exposure is especially     rid of the dissonance
seen in choices of mass media that individuals listen to and read, whether     and maintain
TV, radio, or Internet sites. Not only do we selectively expose ourselves      consonance
to information, we selectively attend to, perceive, and recall information
that supports our existing viewpoints, referred to as selective attention,
selective perception, and selective recall (McCroskey, 1973).

This principle led Leon Festinger (1957) to form the theory of cognitive
dissonance, which states, among other ideas, that when we are
confronted with conflicting information or viewpoints, we reach a state of
dissonance. This state can be very uncomfortable, and we will do things to
get rid of the dissonance and maintain "consonance." Ideally, at least for a
public speaker, the dissonance is relieved or resolved by being persuaded
(changed) to a new belief, attitude, or behavior. However, the easiest way
to avoid dissonance is to not expose oneself to conflicting messages in the
first place or to people who espouse those messages.

Additionally, as mentioned before, during a persuasive speech the
audience members are holding a mental dialogue with the speaker or
at least the speaker's content. They are putting up rebuttals or counter-
arguments. These have been called reservations (as in the audience
member would like to believe the speaker but has reservations about
doing so). They could be called the "yeah-buts"--the audience members
are saying in their minds, "Yeah, I see what you are arguing, but--".
Exploring Public Speaking  274  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

Reservations can be very strong, since, again, the bias is to be loss averse
and not to change our actions or beliefs.

In a sense, the reasons not to change can be stronger than even very logical
reasons to change. For example, you probably know a friend who will not
wear a seatbelt in a car. You can say to your friend, "Don't you know that
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2009) says, and I
quote, `1,652 lives could be saved and 22,372 serious injuries avoided each
year on America's roadways if seat belt use rates rose to 90 percent in
every state'?" What will your friend probably say, even though you have
cited a credible source?

They will come up with some reason for not wearing it, even something as
dramatic as "I knew a guy who had a cousin who was in an accident and
the cop said he died because he was wearing his seatbelt." You may have
had this conversation, or one like it. Their arguments may be less dramatic,
such as "I don't like how it feels" or "I don't like the government telling
me what to do in my car." For your friend, the argument for wearing a seat
belt is not as strong as the argument against it, at least at this moment. If
they are open-minded and can listen to evidence, they might experience
cognitive dissonance and then be persuaded.

Solutions to the Difficulty of Persuasion

With these reasons for the resistance audience members would have to
persuasion, what is a speaker to do? Here are some strategies.

Since change is resisted, we do not make many large or major changes
in our lives. We do, however, make smaller, concrete, step-by-step or
incremental changes in our lives every day. Going back to our scale in
Figure 13.1, trying to move an audience from -3 to +2 or +3 is too big
Exploring Public Speaking  275  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

a move. Having reasonable persuasive goals is the first way to meet                     Two-tailed
resistance. Even moving someone from -3 to -2 is progress, and over                     arguments
time these small shifts can eventually result in a significant amount of
persuasion.                                                                      a persuasive technique
                                                                                 in which a speaker
Secondly, a speaker must "deal with the reservations." The speaker must          brings up a counter-
acknowledge they exist, which shows audience awareness, but then the             argument to their own
speaker must attempt to rebut or refute them. In reality, since persuasion       topic and then directly
involves a mental dialogue, your audience is more than likely thinking           refutes the claim
of counter-arguments in their minds. Therefore, including a refutation
section in your speech, usually after your presentation of arguments in
favor of your proposition, is a valuable strategy. Simply announcing that
there are other arguments held against your main proposition is not
enough; you must provide adequate refute them (Hass & Linder, 1972).

Generally, strong persuasive speeches offer the audience what are
called two-tailed arguments, which bring up a valid issue against
your argument which you, as the speaker, must then refute. After
acknowledging them and seeking to refute or rebut the reservations,
you must also provide evidence for your refutation. Ultimately, this will
show your audience that you are aware of both sides of the issue you are
presenting and make you a more credible speaker. However, you cannot
just say something like this:

         One common misconception about wearing seatbelts is that if
         the car goes off a bridge and is sinking in water, you would not
         be able to release the belt and get out. First, that rarely happens.
         Second, if it did, getting the seat belt unbuckled would be the least
         of your worries. You would have to know how to get out of the
         car, not just the seat belt. Third, the seat belt would have protected
         you from any head injuries in such a crash, therefore keeping you
         conscious and able to help anyone else in the car.

This is a good start, but there are some assertions in here that would need
support from a reliable source, such as the argument that the "submerging
in water" scenario is rare. If it has happened to someone you know, you
probably would not think it is rare. However, there are some techniques
for rebuttal or refutation that work better than others. You would not want
to say, "One argument against my proposition is . . . , and that is wrong"
or "If you are one of the people who believe this about my proposition, you
are wrong." On the other hand, you could say that the reservations are
"misconceptions," "myths," or "mistaken ideas" that are commonly held
about the proposition.

The third strategy is to keep in mind that since you are asking the
audience to change something, they must view the benefits of the change
as worth the stress of the change. If you do good audience analysis, you
Exploring Public Speaking  276  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

                      know they are asking, "What's in it for me?" What benefit, advantage, or
                      improvement would happen for the audience members?

                      If the audience is being persuaded to sign an organ donor card, which is
                      an altruistic action that cannot benefit them in any way because they will
                      be dead, what would be the benefit? Knowing others would have better
                      lives, feeling a sense of contribution to the good of humanity, and helping
                      medical science might be examples. The point is that a speaker should be
                      able to engage the audience at the level of needs, wants, and values as well
                      as logic and evidence.

           Ethos      13.4 - Traditional Views of Persuasion

the influence of      In the fourth century BCE, Aristotle took up the study of the public
speaker credentials   speaking practices of the ruling class in Athenian society. For two years
and character in a    he observed the rhetoric of the men who spoke in the assembly and the
speech; arguments     courts. In the end, he wrote Rhetoric to explain his theories about what
based on credibility  he saw. Among his many conclusions, which have formed the basis of
                      communication study for centuries, was the classification of persuasive
                      appeals into ethos, logos, and pathos. Over the years, Aristotle's original
                      understanding and definition of these terms have been refined as more
                      research has been done.

                      Ethos

                      Ethos has come to mean the influence of speaker credentials and
                      character in a speech. Ethos is one of the more studied aspects of public
                      speaking, and it was discussed earlier in Chapter 3. During the speech,
                      a speaker should seek to utilize their existing credibility, based on the
                      favorable things an audience already knows or believes about the speaker,
                      such as education, expertise, background, and good character. The
                      speaker should also improve or enhance credibility through citing reliable,
                      authoritative sources, strong arguments, showing awareness of the
                      audience, and effective delivery.

                      The word "ethos" looks very much like the word "ethics," and there are
                      many close parallels to the trust an audience has in a speaker and their
                      honesty and ethical stance. In terms of ethics, it goes without saying
                      that your speech will be truthful. Another matter to consider is your own
                      personal involvement in the topic. Ideally you have chosen the topic
                      because it means something to you personally.

                      For example, perhaps your speech is designed to motivate audience
                      members to take action against bullying in schools, and it is important to
                      you because you work with the Boys and Girls Club organization and have
                      seen how anti-bullying programs can have positive results. Sharing your
                      own involvement and commitment is key to the credibility and emotional
Exploring Public Speaking  277  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

appeal (ethos and pathos) of the speech, added to the logos (evidence                   Logos
showing the success of the programs and the damage caused by bullying
that goes unchecked). However, it would be wrong to manufacture stories       logical and organized
of personal involvement that are untrue, even if the proposition is a         arguments and the
socially valuable one.                                                        credible evidence to

Aristotle's original meaning for logos had philosophical meanings tied        logic
to the Greek worldview that the universe is a place ruled by logic and
reason. Logos in a speech was related to standard forms of arguments                    Pathos
that the audience would find acceptable. Today we think of logos as both
logical and organized arguments and the credible evidence to support          the use of emotions
the arguments. Later in this chapter we will look at the logical structures   such as anger, joy,
for persuasive speeches, and Chapter 14 will deal with logic and avoiding     hate, desire for

                                                                              the rightness of
In words like "empathy," "sympathy," and "compassion" we see the root         a proposition;
word behind pathos. Pathos, to Aristotle, was using the emotions such as      arguments based on
anger, joy, hate, desire for community, and love to persuade the audience     emotion
of the rightness of a proposition. One example of emotional appeals is
using strong visual aids and engaging stories to get the attention of the
audience. If a speaker just asks you to donate money to help homeless
dogs and cats, that may not have a strong effect, but seeing the ASPCA's
commercials that feature emaciated and mistreated animals is probably
much more likely to persuade you to donate (add the music for full
emotional effect).

Emotions are also engaged by showing the audience that the proposition
relates to their needs. However, we recognize that emotions are
complex and that they also can be used to create a smokescreen to logic.
Emotional appeals that use inflammatory language--name-calling--are
often unethical or at least counterproductive. Some emotions are more
appropriate for persuasive speeches than others. Anger and guilt, for
example, do have effectiveness but they can backfire. Positive emotions
such as pride, sympathy, and contentment are usually more productive.

One negative emotion that is useful and that can be used ethically is fear.
When you think about it, we do a number of things in life to avoid negative
consequences, and thus, out of fear. Why don't we drive 100 miles an
hour on the interstate? Fear of getting a ticket, fear of paying more for
insurance, fear of a crash, fear of hurting ourselves or others. Fear is not
always applicable to a specific topic, but research shows that mild fear
appeals, under certain circumstances, are very useful. When using fear
appeals, the speaker must:
Exploring Public Speaking  278  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

     Prove the fear appeal is valid.
     Prove that it applies to the audience
     Prove that the solution can work
     Prove the solution is available to the audience
Without these "proofs," the audience may dismiss the fear appeal as not
being real or not applying to them (O'Keefe, 2002). Mild and reasonable
are the keys here. Intense, over-the-top fear appeals, especially showing
gory photos, are often dismissed by the audience.

For example, a student gave a speech in one of our classes about flossing
teeth. This may seem like an overdone subject, but in this case it wasn't.
He used dramatic and disturbing photos of dental and gum problems but
also proved that these photos of gum disease really did come from lack
of flossing. He also showed the link between lack of flossing and heart
disease. The solution to avoid the gum disease and other effects was
readily available, and the student proved through his evidence that the
solution of flossing regularly did work to avoid the disease. Fear appeals
can be overdone, but mild ones supported by evidence are very useful.

Because we feel positive emotions when our needs are met and negative
ones when our needs are not met, aligning your proposition with strong
audience needs is part of pathos. Earlier in this book (Chapter 2) we
examined the well-known Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Students are
often so familiar with it that they do not see its connection to real-life
experiences. For example, safety and security needs, the second level on
the hierarchy, is much broader than what many of us initially think. It
includes:

     supporting the military and homeland security;
     buying insurance for oneself and one's family;
     having investments and a will;
     personal protection such as taking self-defense classes;
     policies on crime and criminal justice in our communities;
     buying a security system for your car or home; seat belts and

       automotive safety; or even
     having the right kind of tires on one's car (which is actually a viable

       topic for a speech).

The third level up in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, love and belongingness,
deals with a whole range of human experiences, such as connection with
others and friendship; involvement in communities, groups, and clubs;
prioritizing family time; worship and connection to a faith community;
being involved in children's lives; patriotism; loyalty; and fulfilling
personal commitments.

In the speech outline at the end of the chapter about eliminating Facebook
time, the speaker appeals to the three central levels of the hierarchy in
her three points: safety and security from online threats, spending more
Exploring Public Speaking  279  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

time with family and friends in real time rather than online (love and
belonging), and having more time to devote to schoolwork rather than
on Facebook (esteem and achievement). Therefore, utilizing Maslow's
hierarchy of needs works as a guide for finding those key needs that relate
to your proposition, and by doing so, allows you to incorporate emotional
appeals based on needs.

Up to this point in the chapter, we have looked at the goals of persuasion,
why it is hard, and how to think about the traditional modes of persuasion
based on Aristotle's theories. In the last section of this chapter, we will
look at generating an overall organizational approach to your speech based
on your persuasive goals.

13.5 - Constructing a Persuasive Speech

In a sense, constructing your persuasive speech is the culmination of the
skills you have learned already. In another sense, you are challenged to
think somewhat differently. While the steps of analyzing your audience,
formulating your purpose and central idea, applying evidence, considering
ethics, framing the ideas in appropriate language, and then practicing
delivery will apply, you will need to consider some expanded options about
each of these steps.

Formulating a Proposition

As mentioned before, when thinking about a central idea statement in a
persuasive speech, we use the terms "proposition" or claim. Persuasive
speeches have one of four types of propositions or claims, which
determine your overall approach. Before you move on, you need to
determine what type of proposition you should have (based on the
audience, context, issues involved in the topic, and assignment for the
class).

Proposition of Fact

Speeches with this type of proposition attempt to establish the truth of a
statement. The core of the proposition (or claim) is not whether something
is morally right and wrong or what should be done about the topic, only
that a statement is supported by evidence or not. These propositions
are not facts such as "the chemical symbol for water is H20" or "Barack
Obama won the presidency in 2008 with 52.9% of the popular vote."
Propositions or claims of fact are statements over which persons disagree
and there is evidence on both sides, although probably more on one than
the other. Some examples of propositions of fact are:

         Converting to solar energy can save homeowners money.
Exploring Public Speaking  280  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

         John F. Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald working
         alone.

         Experiments using animals are essential to the development of
         many life-saving medical procedures.

         Climate change has been caused primarily by human activity.

         Granting tuition tax credits to the parents of children who attend
         private schools will perpetuate educational inequality.

        Watching violence on television causes violent behavior in children.

        William Shakespeare did not write most of the plays attributed to
         him.

         John Doe committed the crime of which he is accused.

Notice that in none of these are any values--good or bad--mentioned.
Perpetuating segregation is not portrayed as good or bad, only as an effect
of a policy. Of course, most people view educational inequality negatively,
just as they view life-saving medical procedures positively. But the point of
these propositions is to prove with evidence the truth of a statement, not
its inherent value or what the audience should do about it. In fact, in some
propositions of fact no action response would even be possible, such as
the proposition that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of
President Kennedy.

Propositions of Definition

This is probably not one that you will use in your class, but it bears
mentioning here because it is used in legal and scholarly arguments.
Propositions of definitions argue that a word, phrase, or concept has
a particular meaning. Remembering back to Chapter 7 on supporting
materials, we saw that there are various ways to define words, such as
by negation, operationalizing, and classification and division. It may be
important for you to define your terms, especially if you have a value
proposition. Lawyers, legislators, and scholars often write briefs, present
speeches, or compose articles to define terms that are vital to defendants,
citizens, or disciplines. We saw a proposition of definition defended in the
Supreme Court's 2015 decision to redefine marriage laws as applying to
same-sex couples, based on arguments presented in court. Other examples
might be:

        The Second Amendment to the Constitution does not include
         possession of automatic weapons for private use.

        The action committed by Mary Smith did not meet the standard
         for first-degree murder.
Exploring Public Speaking  281  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

         Thomas Jefferson's definition of inalienable rights did not include
         a right to privacy.

         An athlete who receives compensation for playing their sport
         becomes a professional and gives up amateur status.

In each of these examples, the proposition is that the definition of these
things (the Second Amendment, amateur status, crime, and inalienable
rights) needs to be changed or viewed differently, but the audience is not
asked to change an attitude or action.

Propositions of Value

It is likely that you or some of your classmates will give speeches with
propositions of value. When the proposition has a word such as "good,"
"bad," "best," "worst," "just," "unjust," "ethical," "unethical," "moral,"
"immoral," "beneficial," "harmful," "advantageous," or "disadvantageous,"
it is a proposition of value. Some examples include:

         Hybrid cars are the best form of automobile transportation
         available today.

         Homeschooling is more beneficial for children than traditional
         schooling.

         The removal of American troops from Afghanistan was not
         justified.

         Capital punishment is morally wrong.

         Mascots that involve Native American names, characters, and
         symbols are demeaning.

         A vegan diet is the healthiest one for adults.

Propositions of value require a first step: defining the "value" word. If
a war is unjustified, what makes a war "just" or "justified" in the first
place? That is a fairly philosophical question. What makes a form of
transportation "best" or "better" than another? Isn't that a matter of
personal approach? For different people, "best" might mean "safest," "least
expensive," "most environmentally responsible," "stylish," "powerful," or
"prestigious." Obviously, in the case of the first proposition above, it means
"environmentally responsible." It would be the first job of the speaker, after
introducing the speech and stating the proposition, to explain what "best
form of automobile transportation" means. Then the proposition would be
defended with separate arguments.

Version 4.2

Propositions of Policy

These propositions are easy to identify because they almost always have
the word "should" in them. These propositions call for a change in policy
or practice (including those in a government, community, or school), or
they can call for the audience to adopt a certain behavior. Speeches with
propositions of policy can be those that call for passive acceptance and
agreement from the audience and those that try to instigate the audience
to action, to actually do something immediately or in the long-term.

         Our state should require mandatory recertification of lawyers
         every ten years.

         The federal government should act to ensure clean water
         standards for all citizens.

         The federal government should not allow the use of technology to
         choose the sex of an unborn child.

         The state of Georgia should require drivers over the age of 75 to
         take a vision test and present a certificate of good health from a
         doctor before renewing their licenses.

         Wyeth Daniels should be the next governor of the state.

         Young people should monitor their blood pressure regularly to
         avoid health problems later in life.

As mentioned before, the proposition determines the approach to the
speech, especially the organization. Also as mentioned earlier in this
chapter, the exact phrasing of the proposition should be carefully done to
be reasonable, positive, and appropriate for the context and audience. In
the next section we will examine organizational factors for speeches with
propositions of fact, value, and policy.

Organization Based on Type of Proposition

Organization for a proposition of fact

If your proposition is one of fact, you will do best to use a topical
organization. Essentially that means that you will have two to four discrete,
distinct arguments in support of the proposition. For example:

Proposition: Converting to solar energy can save homeowners money.

    I. Solar energy can be economical to install.
              A. The government awards grants.
              B. The government gives tax credits.

    II. Solar energy reduces power bills.
    III. Solar energy requires less money for maintenance.
Exploring Public Speaking  283  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

    IV. Solar energy works when the power grid goes down.
Here is a first draft of another outline for a proposition of fact:

Proposition: Experiments using animals are essential to the development
of many life-saving medical procedures.

    I. Research of the past shows many successes from animal
          experimentation.

    II. Research on humans is limited for ethical and legal reasons.
    III. Computer models for research have limitations.
However, these outlines are just preliminary drafts because preparing a
speech of fact requires a great deal of research and understanding of the
issues. A speech with a proposition of fact will almost always need an
argument or section related to the "reservations," refuting the arguments
that the audience may be considering in their minds, their mental dialogue.
So the second example needs revision, such as:

    I. The first argument in favor of animal experimentation is the record
          of successful discoveries from animal research.

    II. A second reason to support animal experimentation is that
          research on humans is limited for ethical and legal reasons.

    III. Animal experimentation is needed because computer models for
          research have limitations.

    IV. Many people today have concerns about animal experimentation.
              A. Some believe that all experimentation is equal.
                       1. There is experimentation for legitimate medical
                             research.
                       2. There is less important experimentation for
                             cosmetics or shampoos that has largely been
                             discontinued.
              B. Others argue that the animals are mistreated.
                       1. There are protocols for the treatment of animals in
                             experimentation.
                       2. Legitimate medical experimentation follows the
                             protocols.
              C. Some believe the persuasion of certain advocacy groups
                    like PETA.
                       1. Many of the groups that protest animal
                             experimentation have extreme views.
                       2. Some give untrue representations.

To complete this outline, along with introduction and conclusion, there
would need to be quotations, statistics, and facts with sources provided to
support both the pro-arguments in Main Points I-III and the refutation to
the misconceptions about animal experimentation in Subpoints A-C under
Point IV.

Version 4.2

Organization for a proposition of value

A persuasive speech that incorporates a proposition of value will have a
slightly different structure. As mentioned earlier, a proposition of value
must first define the "value" word for clarity and provide a basis for the
other arguments of the speech. The second or middle section would
present the defense or "pro" arguments for the proposition based on
the definition. The third section would include refutation of the counter
arguments or "reservations." The following outline draft shows a student
trying to structure a speech with a value proposition. Keep in mind it is
abbreviated for illustrative purposes, and thus incomplete as an example
of what you would submit to your instructor, who will expect more
detailed outlines for your speeches.

Proposition: Hybrid cars are the best form of automotive transportation
available today.

    I. Automotive transportation that is best meets three standards.
          (Definition)
              A. It is reliable and durable.
              B. It is fuel efficient and thus cost efficient.
               C. It is therefore environmentally responsible.

    II. Studies show that hybrid cars are durable and reliable. (Pro-
          Argument 1)
              A. Hybrid cars have 99 problems per 100 cars versus 133
                    problem per 100 conventional cars, according to TrueDelta,
                    a car analysis website much like Consumer Reports.
              B. J.D. Powers reports hybrids also experience 11 fewer engine
                    and transmission issues than gas-powered vehicles, per
                    100 vehicles.

    III. Hybrid cars are fuel-efficient. (Pro-Argument 2)
              A. The Toyota Prius gets 48 mpg on the highway and 51 mpg
                    in the city.
              B. The Ford Fusion hybrid gets 47 mpg in the city and in the
                    country.

    IV. Hybrid cars are environmentally responsible. (Pro-Argument 3)
              A. They only emit 51.6 gallons of carbon dioxide every 100
                    miles.
              B. Conventional cars emit 74.9 gallons of carbon dioxide every
                    100 miles.
               C. The hybrid produces 69% of the harmful gas exhaust that a
                    conventional car does.

    V. Of course, hybrid cars are relatively new to the market and some
          have questions about them. (Reservations)
              A. Don't the batteries wear out and aren't they expensive to
                    replace?
                       1. Evidence to address this misconception.
Exploring Public Speaking  285  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

                       2. Evidence to address this misconception.
              B. Aren't hybrid cars only good for certain types of driving and

                    drivers?
                       1. Evidence to address this misconception.
                       2. Evidence to address this misconception.

              C. Aren't electric cars better?
                       1. Evidence to address this misconception.
                       2. Evidence to address this misconception.

Organization for a propositions of policy

The most common type of outline organizations for speeches with
propositions of policy is problem-solution or problem-cause-solution.
Typically we do not feel any motivation to change unless we are convinced
that some harm, problem, need, or deficiency exists, and even more, that
it affects us personally. As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, why fix it?"As
mentioned before, some policy speeches look for passive agreement or
acceptance of the proposition. Some instructors call this type of policy
speech a "think" speech since the persuasion is just about changing the
way your audience thinks about a policy.

On the other hand, other policy speeches seek to move the audience to
do something to change a situation or to get involved in a cause, and
these are sometimes called a "do" speech since the audience is asked
to do something. This second type of policy speech (the "do" speech)
is sometimes called a "speech to actuate." Although a simple problem-
solution organization with only two main points is permissible for a speech
of actuation, you will probably do well to utilize the more detailed format
called Monroe's Motivated Sequence.

This format, designed by Alan Monroe (1951), who wrote a popular
speaking textbook for many years, is based on John Dewey's reflective
thinking process. It seeks to go in-depth with the many questions an
audience would have in the process of listening to a persuasive speech.
Monroe's Motivated Sequence involves five steps, which should not be
confused with the main points of the outline. Some steps in Monroe's
Motivated Sequence may take two points.

    1. Attention. This is the introduction, where the speaker brings
        attention to the importance of the topic as well as his or her own
        credibility and connection to the topic. This step will include the
        thesis and preview. A truly attention-getting introduction is vital to a
        persuasive speech.

    2. Need. Here the problem is defined and defended. This step may be
        divided into two main points, such as the problem and the causes
        of it, since logically a solution should address the underlying causes
        as well as the external effects of a problem. It is important to make
        the audience see the severity of the problem, and how it affects
Exploring Public Speaking  286  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

        them, their family, and/or their community. The harm or need can
        be physical, financial, psychological, legal, emotional, educational,
        social, or a combination. It will have to be supported by evidence.

    3. Satisfaction. A need calls for satisfaction in the same way a
        problem requires a solution. This step could also, in some cases, take
        up two main points. Not only does the speaker present the solution
        and describe it, but they must also defend that it works and will
        address the causes of the problem as well as the symptoms.

    4. Visualization. This step looks to the future either positively or
        negatively. If positive, the benefits from enacting or choosing the
        solution are shown. If negative, the disadvantages of not doing
        anything to solve the problem are shown. There may be times when
        it is acceptable to skip this step, especially if time is limited. The
        purpose of visualization is to motivate the audience by revealing
        future benefits or through fear appeals by showing future harms.

    5. Action. This can be the conclusion, although if the speaker really
        wants to spend time on moving the audience to action, the action
        step should be a full main point and the conclusion saved for
        summary and a dramatic ending. In the action step, the goal is to
        give specific steps for the audience to take as soon as possible to
        move toward solving the problem. Whereas the satisfaction step
        explains the solution overall, the action step gives concrete ways to
        begin making the solution happen.

The more concrete you can make the action step, the better. Research
shows that people are more likely to act if they know how accessible
the action can be (O'Keefe, 1997). For example, if you want to persuade
students to be vaccinated against the chicken pox virus (which can cause
a serious disease called shingles in older adults), you can give them
directions to and hours for a clinic or health center where vaccinations at a
free or discounted price can be obtained.

In some cases for speeches of policy, no huge problem needs solving.
Or, there is a problem, but the audience already knows about it and is
convinced that the problem exists and is important. In those cases, a
format called "comparative advantages" is used, which focuses on how one
possible solution is better than other possible ones. The organizational
pattern for this kind of proposition might be topical:

    I. This policy is better because...
    II. This policy is better because...
    III. This policy is better because...
If this sounds a little like a commercial that is because advertisements
often use comparative advantages to show that one product is better than
another. Here is an example:
Exploring Public Speaking  287  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

Proposition: Owning the Barnes and Noble Nook is more advantageous
than owning the Amazon Kindle.

     I. The Nook allows owners to trade and loan books to other owners
           or people who have downloaded the Nook software, while the
          Kindle does not.

     II. The Nook has a color-touch screen, while the Kindle's screen is
           black and grey and non-interactive.

     III. The Nook's memory can be expanded through microSD, while the
          Kindle's memory cannot be upgraded.

Building Upon Your Persuasive Speech's Arguments

Once you have constructed the key arguments and order of points
(remembering that if you use topical order, to put your strongest or most
persuasive point last), it is time to be sure your points are well supported.
In a persuasive speech, there are some things to consider about evidence.

First, your evidence should be from sources that the audience will find
credible. If you can find the same essential information from two sources
but know that the audience will find the information more credible
from one source than another, use and cite the information from the
more credible one. For example, if you find the same statistical data
on Wikipedia and the U.S. Department of Labor's website, cite the U.S.
Department of Labor (your instructor will probably not encourage use
of the Wikipedia site anyway). Audiences also accept information from
sources they consider unbiased or indifferent. Gallup polls, for example,
have been considered reliable sources of survey data because unlike some
organizations, Gallup does not have a cause (political or otherwise) it is
supporting.

Secondly, your evidence should be new to the audience. In other words,
the best evidence is that which is from credible sources and the audience
has not heard before (Reinard, 1988; McCroskey, 1969). If they have
heard it before and discounted it, they will not consider your argument
well supported. An example is telling people who smoke that smoking
will cause lung cancer. Every adult in the U.S. has heard that many times,
but 14% of the population still smokes, which is about one in seven
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Many of those who
smoke have not heard the information that really motivates them to quit
yet, and of course quitting is very difficult. Additionally, new evidence is
more attention-getting, and you will appear more credible if you tell the
audience something new (as long as you cite it well) than if you use the
"same old, same old" evidence and arguments they have heard before.

Third, in order to be effective and ethical, your supporting evidence should
be relevant and not used out of context, and fourth, it should be timely and
not out of date.
Exploring Public Speaking  288  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

After choosing the evidence and apportioning it to the correct parts of the
speech, you will want to consider use of metaphors, quotations, rhetorical
devices, and narratives that will enhance the language and "listenability"
of your speech. Narratives are especially good for introduction and
conclusions, to get attention and to leave the audience with something
dramatic. You might refer to the narrative in the introduction again in the
conclusion to give the speech a sense of finality.

Next you will want to decide if you should use any type of presentation aid
for the speech. The decision to use visuals such as PowerPoint slides or a
video clip in a persuasive speech should take into consideration the effect
of the visuals on the audience and the time allotted for the speech (as well
as your instructor's specifications). The charts, graphs, or photographs you
use should be focused and credibly done.

One of your authors remembers a speech by a student about using seat
belts (which is, by the way, an overdone topic). What made the speech
effective in this case were photographs of two totaled cars, both of which
the student had been driving when they crashed. The devastation of the
wrecks and his ability to stand before us and give the speech because he
had worn his seat belt was effective (although it didn't say much for his
driving ability). If you wanted an audience to donate to disaster relief after
an earthquake in a foreign country, a few photographs of the destruction
would be effective, and perhaps a map of the area would be helpful. But in
this case, less is more. Too many visual aids will likely distract from your
overall speech claim.

Finally, since you've probably already experience in class giving at least
one major speech prior to this one, your delivery for the persuasive speech
should be more practiced. Since delivery does affect credibility (Burgoon,
Birk, & Pfau, 1990), you want to be able to connect visually through eye
contact as you make your appeals. You want to be physically involved and
have vocal variety when you tell dramatic narratives that emphasize the
human angle on your topic. If you do use presentation slides, you want
to work them in seamlessly, using black screens when the visuals are not
necessary.

Conclusion

Your persuasive speech in class, as well as in real life, is an opportunity to
share a passion or cause that you believe will matter to society and help
the audience live a better life. Even if you are initially uncomfortable with
the idea of persuasion, we use it all the time in different ways. Choose your
topic based on your own commitment and experience, look for quality
evidence, craft your proposition so that it will be clear and audience
appropriate, and put the finishing touches on it with an eye toward
enhancing your logos, ethos, and pathos.

Something to Think About

Go to YouTube and look for "Persuasive Speeches by College Students."
There are quite a few. Here's one example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNr7Fx-SM1Y.

Do you find this speech persuasive? Why or why not? Based on the content
of this chapter, what did the speaker do correctly or perhaps not so
correctly that affected their persuasiveness?

Sample Outline: Persuasive Speech Using

Topical Pattern

By Janet Aguilar

Specific Purpose: To persuade my classmates to eliminate their Facebook
use.

Introduction: There she was late into the night still wide awake staring at
her phone's screen. In fact, she had to be at work early in the morning, but
scrolling through her Facebook account kept her awake. That girl was me
before I deactivated my Facebook account. I honestly could not tell you
how many hours I spent on Facebook. In the survey that I presented to you
all, one person admitted to spending "too much" time on Facebook. That
was me in the past. I spent too much time on Facebook. Time is precious
and once it is gone it does not return. So why do you spend precious time
on Facebook? Time that could be spent with family, resting, or being more
productive.

Thesis/Preview: Facebook users should eliminate their usage because
Facebook can negatively affect their relationships with others, their
sleeping patterns and health, and their ability to focus on school work.

    I. Family relationships can be affected by your Facebook usage.
              A. In the survey conducted in class, 11 of 15 students
                    confessed to have ignored someone while they were
                    speaking.
                       1. Found myself ignoring my children while they spoke.
                        2. Noticed other people doing the same thing especially
                             in parks and restaurants.
               B. According to Lynn Postell-Zimmerman on hg.org,
                    Facebook has become a leading cause for divorce.
               C. In the United States, 1 in 5 couples mentioned Facebook as
                    a reason for divorce in 2009.
Exploring Public Speaking  290  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

Transition: We have discussed how Facebook usage can lead to poor
relationships with people. Next we will discuss how Facebook can affect
your sleep patterns and health.

II. Facebook usage can negatively affect your sleep patterns and health.
              A. Checking Facebook before bed.
                       1. In my survey 11 students said they checked their
                             Facebook account before bed.
                       2. Staying on Facebook for long hours before bed.
              B. Research has shown that Facebook can cause depression,
                    anxiety, and addiction.
                       1. According to researchers Steels, Wickham and
                             Acitelli in an article in the Journal of Social &
                             Clinical Psychology titled "Seeing everyone else's
                             highlight reels: How Facebook usage is linked to
                             depressive symptoms," because Facebook users only
                             view the positive of their friend's life they become
                             unhappy with their life and it can lead to becoming
                             depressed and unhappy.
                       2. Marissa Maldonado on psychcentral.com, concluded
                             from recent studies that, "Facebook increases
                             people's anxiety levels by making them feel
                             inadequate and generating excess worry and stress."
                       3. Facebook addiction is a serious issue, according to
                             the article "Too much Facebook leads to anger and
                             depression" found on cnn.com and written by Cara
                             Reedy.
                                   a. Checking Facebook everywhere we go is a
                                         sign of addiction
                                   b. This addiction leads you to not being able to
                                         deactivate your Facebook account.

Transitions: Many of you have probably never thought of Facebook as
a threat to your health, but that's not all. We will now review how it can
affect you as a college student.

III. Facebook negatively affects students.
              A. I often found myself on Facebook instead of doing
                    schoolwork.
              B. I was constantly checking Facebook which takes away from
                    study time.
              C. I also found myself checking Facebook while in class, which
                    can lead to poor grades and getting in trouble with the
                    professor.
              D. A study of over 1,800 college students showed a negative
                    relationship between amount of Facebook time and GPA,
                    as reported by Junco in a 2012 article titled, "Too much
                    face and not enough books" from the journal Computers

                    and Human Behavior.
Conclusion: In conclusion, next time you log on to Facebook try
deactivating your account for a few day and see the difference. You will
soon see how it can bring positive changes in your family relationships,
will avoid future health problems, will help you sleep better, and will
improve your school performance. Instead of communicating through
Facebook try visiting or calling your close friends. Deactivating my account
truly helped me, and I can assure you we all can survive without Facebook.

Sample Outline: Persuasive Speech Using
Monroe's Motivated Sequence Pattern

Speech to Actuate: Sponsoring a Child in Poverty

Specific Purpose: to actuate my audience to sponsor a child through an
agency such as Compassion International.

Introduction (Attention Step)

    I. How much is $38? That answer depends on what you make, what
          you are spending it for, and what you get back for it. (Grabber)

    II. $38 per month breaks down to a little more than $1.25 per day,
          which is probably what you spend on a snack or soda in the break
          room. For us, it's not very much. (Rapport)

    III. I found out that I can provide better health care, nutrition, and
          even education for a child in Africa, South America, or Asia for
Exploring Public Speaking  292  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking

          the $38 per month by sponsoring a child through Compassion
          International. (Credibility)
    IV. If I can do it, maybe you can too: (Bridge)
Thesis: Through a minimal donation each month, you can make the life of
a child in the developing world much better.

Preview: In the next few minutes I would like to discuss the problem, the
work of organizations that offer child sponsorships, how research shows
they really do alleviate poverty, and what you can do to change the life of a
child.

Body

    I. The problem is the continued existence and effects of poverty.
          (Need Step)
              A. Poverty is real and rampant in much of the world.
                       1. According to a 2018 report of the Secretary General
                             of the United Nations, 9.2% of the world lives on
                             less than $1.90 per day.
                                   a. That is 600 million people on the planet.
                       2. This number is supported by the World Poverty
                             clock of the World Data Lab, which states that 8% of
                             the world's population lives in extreme poverty.
                                   a. The good news is that this number is one
                                         third of what it was in 1990, mostly due to
                                         the rising middle class in Asia.
                                   b. The bad news is that 70% of the poor will
                                         live in Africa, with Nigeria labeled the
                                        "Poverty Capital of the World," according to
                                         the Brookings Institution.
              B. Poverty means children do not get adequate health care.
                       1. One prevalent but avoidable disease is malaria,
                             which takes the lives of 3000 children every day,
                             according to UNICEF.
                       2. According to the World Health Organization,
                             diarrheal diseases claimed 2.46 million lives in 2012
                             and is the second leading cause of death in children
                             under 5.
              C. Poverty means children do not get adequate nutrition, as
                    stated in a report from UNICEF.
                       1. Inadequate nutrition leads to stunted growth.
                       2. Undernutrition contributes to more than one third
                             of all deaths in children under the age of five.
              D. Poverty means children are unlikely to reach adult age,
                    according to the CIA World Fact Book quoted on the
                    Infoplease website.
                       1. Child mortality rate in Africa is 8.04% (percentage
Exploring Public Speaking  293  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

            dying before age 5), while in North American is .64%
       2. Life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is almost 30

            years less than in the U.S.

              E. Poverty also means children are unlikely to receive
                    education and be trained for profitable work.
                       1. Nearly a billion people entered the 21st century
                             unable to read a book or sign their names, states the
                             Global Issues website on Poverty Facts.
                       2. UNESCO, a part of the United Nations, reports that
                             less than a third of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa
                             have completed primary education.

Transition: Although in all respects poverty is better in 2019 than it has
been in the past, poverty is still pervasive and needs to be addressed.
Fortunately, some great organizations have been addressing this for many
years.

II.     Some humanitarian organizations address poverty directly through
child  sponsorships. (Satisfaction Step)

              A. These organizations vary in background but not in
                    purpose. The following information is gleaned from each
                    organization's websites.
                       1. Compassion International is faith-based, evangelical.
                                  a. Around since early 1950s, started in Korea.
                                  b. Budget of $887 Million.
                                  c. Serves 1.92 million babies, children, and
                                        young adults.
                                  d. Works through local community centers
                                        and established churches.
                       2. World Vision is faith-based, evangelical.
                                  a. Around since the 1950s.
                                  b. Budget of far over $1 Billion.
                                  c. 60% goes to local community programs but
                                        more goes to global networks, so that 86%
                                        goes to services.
                                  d. World Vision has more extensive services
                                        than child sponsorship, such as water
                                        purification and disaster relief.
                                  e. Sponsors three million children across six
                                        continents
                       3. Children International is a nonsectarian
                             organization.
                                  a. Around since 1936.
                                  b. Budget of $125 Million.
                                  c. 88% of income goes directly to programs
                                        and children.
                                  d. Sponsors children in ten countries on four
Exploring Public Speaking  294  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

                                         continents
                       4. Save the Children is also nonsectarian.

                                   a. One hundred years of history, began in post
                                        WWI Europe.

                                   b. Budget of $880 Million.
                                   c. 87% goes to services.
                                   d. Sponsors 134 million children in 120

                                         countries, including 450,000 in U.S.
                       5. There are other similar organizations, such as

                             ChildFund and PlanUSA.
              B. These organizations work directly with local community

                    and on-site organizations.
                       1. The children are involved in a program, such as after
                             school.
                       2. The children live with their parents and siblings.
                       3. The sponsor's donation goes for medicine, extra
                             healthy, nutritious food, shoes for school, and other
                             items.
                       4. Sponsors can also help donate for birthdays and
                             holidays to the whole family to buy food or farm
                             animals.

Transition: Of course, any time we are donating money to an organization,
we want to be sure our money is being effectively and ethnically used.

III. This concern should be addressed in two ways: Is the money really
helping, and are the organizations honest? (Continuation of Satisfaction
Step)

              A. The organizations' honesty can be investigated.
                       1. You can check through Charity Navigator.
                       2. You can check through the Better Business Bureau-
                             Charity.
                       3. You can check through Charity Watch.
                       4. You can check through the organizations' websites.

              B. Secondly, is sponsoring a child effective? Yes.
                       1. According to Bruce Wydick, Professor of Economics
                             at the University of San Francisco, child sponsorship
                             is the fourth most effective strategy for addressing
                             poverty, behind water purification, mosquito nets,
                             and deworming treatments.
                       2. Dr. Wydick and colleagues' work has been published
                             in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy
                             from the University of Chicago.
                       3. He states, "Two researchers and I recently carried
                             out a study (sponsored by the U.S. Agency for
                             International Development) on the long-term
                             impacts of Compassion International's child
                             sponsorship program. The study, gathering data
Exploring Public Speaking  295  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

                             from over 10,000 individuals in six countries,
                             found substantial impact on adult life outcomes for
                             children who were sponsored through Compassion's
                             program during the 1980s and '90s...In adulthood,
                             formerly sponsored children were far more likely to
                             complete secondary school and had a much higher
                             chance of having a white-collar job. They married
                             and had children later in life, were more likely to be
                             church and community leaders, were less likely to
                             live in a home with a dirt floor and more likely to
                             live in a home with electricity."
Transition: To this point I have spoke of global problems and big solutions.
Now I want to bring it down to real life with one example.

IV. I'd like to use my sponsored child, Ukwishaka in Rwanda, as an
example of how you can. (Visualization Step)

              A. I have sponsored her for five years.
              B. She is now ten years old.
              C. She lives with two siblings and both parents.
              D. She writes me, I write her back, and we share photos at

                    least every two months.
              E. The organization gives me reports on her progress.
              F. I hope one day to go visit her.
              G. I believe Ukwishaka now knows her life can be more, can

                    be successful.
Transition: We have looked at the problem of childhood poverty and how
reliable, stable nongovernmental organizations are addressing it through
child sponsorships. Where does that leave you?

V. I challenge you to sponsor a child like Ukwishaka. (Action Step)
              A. Although I sponsor her through Compassion International,
                    there are other organizations.
              B. First, do research.

              C.  Second, look at your budget and be sure you can do this.
                     1. You don't want to start and have to stop.
              D.     2. Look for places you "waste" money during the
              E.           month and could use it this way.
              F.     3. Fewer snacks from the break room, fewer movies at
                           the Cineplex, brown bag lunch instead of eating out.
Conclusion
                  Talk to a representative at the organization you like.
                  Discuss it with your family.
                  Take the plunge. If you do.

                     1. Write your child regularly.
                     2. Consider helping the family, or getting friends to

                           help with extra gifts.
Exploring Public Speaking  296  Chapter 13: Persuasive Speaking
Version 4.2

    I. In this speech, we have taken a look at the state of poverty for
          children on this planet, at organizations that are addressing it
          through child sponsorships, at the effectiveness of these programs,
          and what you can do.

    II. My goal today was not to get an emotional response, but a
          realistically compassionate one.

    III. You have probably heard this story before but it bears repeating. A
          little girl was walking with her mother on the beach, and the sand
          was covered with starfish. The little girl wanted to rescue them and
          send them back to the ocean and kept throwing them in. "It won't
          matter, Honey," said her mother. "You can't get all of them back
          in the ocean." "But it will matter to the ones that I do throw back,"
          the little girl answered.

    IV. We can't sponsor every child, but we can one, maybe even two. As
          Forest Witcraft said, "What will matter in 100 years is that I made
          a difference in the life of a child." Will you make a difference?

14.1 - What is Correct Reasoning?

In Chapter 13, we reviewed ancient and modern research on how to
create a persuasive presentation. We learned that persuasion does not
just depend on one mode, but on the speaker using his or her personal
credibility and credentials; understanding what important beliefs,
attitudes, values, and needs of the audience connect with the persuasive
purpose; and drawing on fresh evidence that the audience has not heard

before. In addition to fresh evidence, the audience expects a logical speech          Analogical
and to hear arguments that they understand and to which they can relate.              reasoning
These are historically known as ethos, pathos, and logos. This chapter

We have seen that logos involves composing a speech that is structured         on its similarities to

reasoning and consequently avoiding fallacious reasoning, or logical
fallacies.                                                                      Figurative analogy

Although it is not a perfect or literal analogy, we can think of correct       an analogy where
reasoning like building a house. To build a house, a person need materials     the two things under
(premises and facts) a blueprint (logical method), and knowledge of            comparison are not
building trades (critical thinking ability). If you put them out in a field    essentially the same

handed them a blueprint, they would need knowledge of construction                Literal analogy
principles, plumbing, and reading plans (and some helpers), or no
building is going up. Logic could also be considered like cooking. A cook      an analogy where
needs ingredients, a recipe, and knowledge about cooking. In both cases,       the two things under
the ingredients or materials must be good quality (the information and         comparison have
facts must be true); the recipe or directions must be right (the logical       sufficient or significant
process); and the cook must know what they are doing.                          similarities to be
                                                                               compared fairly
In the previous paragraph, analogical reasoning was used. As we will
see in Section 14.2, analogical reasoning involves drawing conclusions            Logical fallacies
about an object or phenomenon based on its similarities to something
else. Technically, the comparisons of logic to building and cooking were       mistakes in reasoning;
examples of figurative analogy, not a literal one, because the two             erroneous conclusions
processes are not essentially the same. A figurative analogy is like a poetic  or statements made
one: "My love is like a red, red rose," (Robert Burns, 1759-1796); love, or    from poor inductive or
a loved person, and a flower are not essentially the same. An example of       deductive analyses
a literal analogy would be one between the college where the authors
work, Dalton State, and another state college in Georgia with a similar
mission, similar governance, similar size, and similar student bodies.

Analogical reasoning is one of several types of logical reasoning methods
which can serve us well if used correctly, but it can be confusing and even
unethical if used incorrectly. In this chapter we will look first at "good"
reasoning and then at several of the standard mistakes in reasoning, called
logical fallacies. In higher education today, teaching and learning
critical thinking skills are a priority, and those skills are one of the
characteristics that employers are looking for in applicants (Adams, 2014).
The difficult part of this equation is that critical thinking skills mean
slightly different things for different people.

Involved in critical thinking are problem-solving and decision-making, the
ability to evaluate and critique based on theory and the "knowledge base"
Exploring Public Speaking  300  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

                        (what is known in a particular field), skill in self-reflection, recognition of
                        personal and societal biases, and the ability to use logic and avoid logical
                        fallacies. On the website Critical Thinking Community, in an article
                        entitled "Our Concept and Definition of Critical Thinking" (2013), the term
                        is defined this way:

                                 Critical thinking is that mode of thinking -- about any subject,
                                 content, or problem -- in which the thinker improves the quality
                                 of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing, and
                                 reconstructing it. Critical thinking is self-directed, self-disciplined,
                                 self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It presupposes
                                 assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command
                                 of their use. It entails effective communication and problem-
                                 solving abilities, as well as a commitment to overcome our native
                                 egocentrism and sociocentrism.

                        Critical thinking is a term with a wide range of meaning, one of which
                        is the traditional ability to use formal logic. To do so, you must first
                        understand the two types of reasoning: inductive and deductive.

Inductive reasoning     14.2 - Inductive Reasoning

a type of reasoning     Inductive reasoning (also called "induction") is probably the form of
in which examples       reasoning we use on a more regular basis. Induction is sometimes referred
or specific instances   to as "reasoning from example or specific instance," and indeed, that is
are used to supply      a good description. It could also be referred to as "bottom-up" thinking.
strong evidence for     Inductive reasoning is sometimes called "the scientific method," although
(though not absolute    you don't have to be a scientist to use it, and use of the word "scientific"
proof of) the truth of  gives the impression it is always right and always precise, which it is not.
the conclusion; the     In fact, we are just as likely to use inductive logic incorrectly or vaguely as
scientific method       we are to use it well.

                        Inductive reasoning happens when we look around at various happenings,
                        objects, behavior, etc., and see patterns. From those patterns we develop
                        conclusions. There are four types of inductive reasoning, based on
                        different kinds of evidence and logical moves or, sometimes, jumps.

   Generalization       Generalization

a form of inductive     Generalization is a form of inductive reasoning that draws conclusions
reasoning that draws    based on recurring patterns or repeated observations. Vocabulary.com
conclusions based on    (2016) goes one step further to state it is "the process of formulating
recurring patterns or   general concepts by abstracting common properties of instances." To
repeated observations   generalize, one must observe multiple instances and find common
                        qualities or behaviors and then make a broad or universal statement
                        about them. For example, if every dog I see chases squirrels, then I would
                        probably generalize that all dogs chase squirrels.

Version 4.2

If you go to a certain business and get bad service once, you may not like
it. If you go back and get bad treatment again, you probably won't go back
again because you have concluded "Business X always treats its customers
badly." However, according to the laws of logic, you cannot really say
that; you can only say, "In my experience, Business X treats its customers
badly" or more precisely, "has treated me badly." Additionally, the word
"badly" is imprecise, so to be a valid conclusion to the generalization, badly
should be replaced with "rudely," "dishonestly," or "dismissively." The
two problems with generalization are over-generalizing (making too big
an inductive leap, or jump, from the evidence to the conclusion) and
generalizing without enough examples (hasty generalization, also seen in
stereotyping).

In the example of the service at Business X, two examples are really
not enough to conclude that "Business X treats customers rudely." The
conclusion does not pass the logic test for generalization, but pure logic
may not influence whether or not you patronize the business again. Logic
and personal choice overlap sometimes and separate sometimes. If the
business is a restaurant, it could be that there is one particularly rude
server at the restaurant, and they happened to wait on you during both of
your experiences. It is possible that everyone else gets fantastic service, but
your generalization was based on too small a sample.

Of course, one could also make a conclusion that's unrelated to the
evidence (called non sequitur, discussed in more detail below). If the
restaurant the person didn't like had the word "wagon" in its name, and
the person concludes all businesses with the word "wagon" in their names
treat customers badly, that's a non sequitur.

Inductive reasoning through generalization is used in surveys and polls.
If a polling organization follows scientific sampling procedures (sample
size, ensuring different types of people are involved, etc.), it can conclude
that their poll indicates trends in public opinion. Inductive reasoning is
also used in science. We will see from the examples below that inductive
reasoning does not result in certainty. Inductive conclusions are always
open to further evidence, but they are the best conclusions we have now.

For example, if you are a coffee drinker, you might hear news reports at
one time that coffee is bad for your health, and then six months later that
another study shows coffee has positive effects on your health. Scientific
studies are often repeated or conducted in different ways to obtain more
and better evidence and make updated conclusions. Consequently, the way
to disprove inductive reasoning is to provide contradictory evidence or
examples.
Exploring Public Speaking  302  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

  Causal reasoning    Causal reasoning

a form of inductive   Instead of looking for patterns the way generalization does, causal
reasoning that seeks  reasoning seeks to make cause-effect connections. Causal reasoning is
to make cause-effect  a form of inductive reasoning we use all the time without even thinking
connections           about it. If the street is wet in the morning, you know that it rained based
                      on past experience. Of course, there could be another cause--the city
                      decided to wash the streets early that morning--but your first conclusion
                      would be rain. Because causes and effects can be so multiple and
                      complicated, two tests are used to judge whether the causal reasoning is
                      valid.

                      Good inductive causal reasoning meets the tests of directness and
                      strength. The alleged cause must have a direct relationship on the effect
                      and the cause must be strong enough to make the effect. If a student fails
                      a test in a class that he studied for, he would need to examine the causes
                      of the failure. He could look back over the experience and suggest the
                      following reasons for the failure:

                          1. He waited too long to study.
                          2. He had incomplete notes.
                          3. He didn't read the textbook fully.
                          4. He wore a red hoodie when he took the test.
                          5. He ate pizza from Pizza Heaven the night before.
                          6. He only slept four hours the night before.
                          7. The instructor did not do a good job teaching the material.
                          8. He sat in a different seat to take the test.
                          9. His favorite football team lost its game on the weekend before.
                      Which of these causes are direct enough and strong enough to affect his
                      performance on the test? All of them might have had a slight effect on his
                      emotional, physical, or mental state, but all are not strong enough to affect
                      his knowledge of the material if he had studied sufficiently and had good
                      notes to work from. Not having enough sleep could also affect his attention
                      and processes more directly than, say, the pizza or football game. We often
                      consider "causes" such as the color of the hoodie to be superstitions ("I
                      had bad luck because a black cat crossed my path").

                      Taking a test while sitting in a different seat from the one where you sit in
                      class has actually been researched (Sauffley, Otaka, & Bavaresco, 1985),
                      as has whether sitting in the front or back affects learning (Benedict &
                      Hoag, 2004). (In both cases, the evidence so far says that they do not have
                      an impact, but more research will probably be done.) From the list above,
                      #1-3, #6, and #7 probably have the most direct effect on the test failure.
                      At this point our student would need to face the psychological concept of
                      locus of control, or responsibility--does he believe the failure on the test
                      was mostly his doing, or his instructor's?
Exploring Public Speaking  303  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

Causal reasoning is susceptible to four fallacies: historical fallacy, slippery     Sign reasoning
slope, false cause, and confusing correlation and causation. The first
three will be discussed later, but the last is very common, and if you take      a form of inductive
a psychology or sociology course, you will study correlation and causation       reasoning in which
well. This video of a Ted Talk will explain the concept in an entertaining       conclusions are drawn
manner. Confusing correlation and causation is the same as confusing             about phenomena
causal reasoning and sign reasoning, discussed below.                            based on events that
                                                                                 precede or co-exist
Sign Reasoning                                                                   with (but not cause) a
                                                                                 subsequent event
Right now, as one of the authors is writing this chapter, the leaves on the
trees are turning brown, the grass does not need to be cut every week, and
geese are flying towards Florida. These are all signs of fall in this region.
These signs do not make fall happen, and they don't make the other
signs--cooler temperatures, for example--happen. All the signs of fall are
caused by one thing: the rotation of the earth and its tilt on its axis, which
make shorter "days" (periods of sunshine), cooler temperatures, and less
chlorophyll in the leaves, leading to red and brown colors.

It is easy to confuse signs and causes. Sign reasoning, then, is a form
of inductive reasoning in which conclusions are drawn about phenomena
based on events that precede or co-exist with, but not cause, a subsequent
event. Signs are like the correlation mentioned above under causal
reasoning. Someone might argue, "In the summer more people eat ice
cream, and in the summer there is statistically more crime. Therefore,
eating more ice cream causes more crime!" (or "more crime makes people
eat more ice cream."). Those conclusions, of course, would be silly. These
are two things that happen at the same time--signs--but they are effects
of other things - hot weather, perhaps. If we see one sign, we will see the
other. Either way, they are signs or perhaps two different things that just
happen to be occurring at the same time, but not causes of one another.

Version 4.2

       Analogical       Analogical reasoning
       reasoning
                        As mentioned above, analogical reasoning involves comparison. For it
drawing conclusions     to be valid, the two things (schools, states, countries, businesses) must be
about an object or      truly alike in many important ways-essentially alike. Although Harvard
phenomenon based        University and your college are both institutions of higher education,
on its similarities to  they are probably not essentially alike in very many ways. They may have
something else          different missions, histories, governance, surrounding locations, sizes,
                        clientele, stakeholders, funding sources, funding amounts, etc. So it would
                        be foolish to argue, "Harvard has a law school; therefore, since we are both
                        colleges, my college should have a law school, too." On the other hand,
                        there are colleges that are very similar to your college in all those ways, so
                        comparisons between the two could be valid in relation to those likenesses.

                        You have probably heard the phrase, "that is like comparing apples and
                        oranges." When you think about it, though, apples and oranges are more
                        alike than they are different (they are both still fruit, after all). This
                        observation points out the difficulty of analogical reasoning--how similar
                        do the two "things" have to be for there to be a valid analogy? Second,
                        what is the purpose of the analogy? Is it to prove that State College A has
                        a specific program (sports, Greek societies, a theatre major), therefore,
                        College B should have that program, too? Are there other factors to
                        consider? Analogical reasoning is one of the less reliable forms of logic,
                        although it is used frequently.

                        To summarize, inductive or bottom-up reasoning comes in four varieties,
                        each capable of being used correctly or incorrectly. Remember that
                        inductive reasoning is disproven by counter evidence and its conclusions
                        are always up to revision by new evidence-what is called "tentative,"
                        because the conclusions might have to be revised. Also, the conclusions of
                        inductive reasoning should be precisely stated to reflect the evidence.

       Deductive        14.3 - Deductive Reasoning
       reasoning
                        The second type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning, or
a type of reasoning in  deduction, a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is based on the
which a conclusion      combination of multiple premises that are generally assumed to be true.
is based on the         It has been referred to as "reasoning from principle," which is a good
combination of          description. It can also be called "top-down" reasoning. However, you
multiple premises that  should not think of deductive reasoning as the opposite of inductive
are generally assumed   reasoning. They are two different ways of thinking about evidence and
to be true              reasoning.

                        First, formal deductive reasoning employs the syllogism, which is a
                        three-sentence argument composed of a major premise (a generalization
                        or principle that is accepted as true), a minor premise (an example of the
                        major premise), and a conclusion. This conclusion has to be true if the
Exploring Public Speaking  305  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

major and minor premise are true; it logically follows from the first two             Syllogism
statements. Here are some examples. The most common one you may
have seen before.                                                             a three-sentence
                                                                              argument composed
         All men are mortal. (Major premise: something everyone already       of a major premise
         agrees on)                                                           (a generalization
                                                                              or principle that is
         Socrates is a man. (Minor premise: an example taken from the         accepted as true), a
         major premise.)                                                      minor premise (and
                                                                              example of the major
         Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion: the only conclusion that can be     premise), and a
         drawn from the first two sentences.)                                 conclusion

         Major Premise: All State College students must pass Fundamentals
         of Public Speaking.

         Minor Premise: Brittany is a State College graduate.

         Conclusion: Brittany passed Fundamentals of Public Speaking.

         Major Premise: All dogs have fur.

         Minor Premise: Butter is a dog.

         Conclusion: Butter has fur.

Of course, at this point you may have some issues with these examples.
First, Socrates is already dead and you did not need a syllogism to know
that. The Greek philosopher lived 2,400 years ago! Second, these seem
kind of obvious. Third, are there some exceptions to "All State College
students must pass Fundamentals of Public Speaking"? Maybe there are;
some transfer students do not, and neither do certificate or continuing
education students. Finally, there are breeds of dogs that are hairless.
Some people consider them odd-looking, but they do exist. So while it is
true that all men are mortal, it is not absolutely and universally true that
all State College students must complete Fundamentals of Public Speaking
or that all dogs have fur.

Consequently, the first criterion for syllogisms and deductive reasoning is
that the premises have to be true for the conclusion to be true, even if the
method is right. A right method and untrue premises will not result in a
true conclusion. Equally, true premises with a wrong method will also not
result in true conclusions. For example:

         Major premise: All dogs bark.

         Minor premise: Butter barks.

         Conclusion: Butter is a dog.

You should notice that the minor premise is stated incorrectly. We know
other animals bark, notably seals (although it is hard to think of a seal
Exploring Public Speaking  306  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

      Enthymeme          named "Butter"). The minor premise would have to read "Butter is a dog"
                         to arrive at the logical conclusion, "Butter barks." (Also, there are dog
a syllogism with one of  breeds that do not bark.) However, by restating the major premise, you
the premises missing     have a different argument and a different variation of deductive reasoning.

                                  Major premise: Dogs are the only animals that wag their tails
                                  when happy.

                                  Minor premise: Butter wags his tail when happy.

                                  Conclusion: Butter is a dog.

                         Another term in deductive reasoning is an enthymeme. This odd word
                         refers to a syllogism with one of the premises missing.

                                  Major premise: (missing)

                                  Minor premise: Daniel Becker is a chemistry major.

                                  Conclusion: Daniel Becker will make a good Student Government
                                  president.

                         What is the missing major premise? "Chemistry majors make good
                         Student Government presidents." Why? Is there any support for this
                         statement? Deductive reasoning is not designed to present unsupported
                         major premises; its purpose is to go from what is known to what is not
                         known in the absence of direct observation. If it is true that chemistry
                         majors make good SGA presidents, then we could conclude Dan will do a
                         good job in this role. But the premise, which in the enthymeme is left out,
                         is questionable when put up to scrutiny.

                                  Major premise: Socialists favor government-run health care.

                                  Minor premise: (missing)

                                  Conclusion: Candidate Fran Stokes favors government-run health
                                  care.

                         The missing statement in the minor premise, "Fran Stokes is a socialist,"
                         is left out so that the audience can make the connection, even if it is
                         erroneous. Consequently, it is best to avoid enthymemes with audiences
                         and to be mindful of them when used by persuaders. They are mentioned
                         here to make you aware of how commonly they are used as shortcuts.
                         Enthymemes are common in advertising. You may have heard the slogan
                         for Smucker's jams, "With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good."

                                  Major premise: Products with odd names are good products.
                                  (questionable!)

                                  Minor premise: "Smucker's" is an odd name.

                                  Conclusion: Smucker's is a good product.

To conclude, deductive reasoning helps us go from known to unknown and
can lead to reliable conclusions if the premises and the method are correct.
It has been around since the time of the ancient Greeks. It is not the
flipside of inductive but a separate method of logic. While enthymemes are
not always errors, you should listen carefully to arguments that use them
to be sure that something incorrect is not being assumed or presented.

False Analogy

A false analogy is a fallacy where two things are compared that do not
share enough key similarities to be compared fairly. As mentioned before,
for analogical reasoning to be valid, the two things being compared must
be essentially similar--similar in all the important ways. Two states could
be analogous, if they are in the same region, have similar demographics
and histories, similar size, and other aspects in common. Georgia is more
like North Carolina than it is like Hawaii, although both are states. An
analogy between the United States and, for example, a small European
country with a homogeneous population is probably not a valid analogy,
although common. Even in the case where the two "things" being

prevented
                          Slippery Slope

                          A slippery slope fallacy is a type of false cause which assumes that
                          taking a first step will lead to subsequent events that cannot be prevented.
                          The children's book, If You Give a Moose a Muffin is a good example of
                          slippery slope; it tells all the terrible things (from a child's point of view)
                          that will happen, one after another, if a moose is given a muffin. If A
                          happens, then B will happen, then C, then D, then E, F, G and it will get
                          worse and worse and before you know it, we will all be in some sort of ruin.
                          So, don't do A or don't let A happen, because it will inevitably lead to Z,
                          and of course, Z is terrible.

                          This type of reasoning fails to look at alternate causes or factors that could
                          keep the worst from happening, and often is somewhat silly when A is
                          linked right to Z. A young woman may say to a young man asking her out,
                          "If I go out with you Thursday night, I won't be able to study for my test
                          Friday. Then I will fail the test. Then I will fail the class. Then I will lose
                          my scholarship. Then I will have to drop out of college. Then I will not
                          get the career I want, and I'll be 30 years old still living with my parents,
                          unmarried, unhappy, and no children or career! That's why I just can't go
                          out with you!" Obviously, this young woman has gone out of her way to
                          get out of this date, and she has committed a slippery slope. Additionally,
                          since no one can predict the future, we can never be entirely certain on the
                          direction a given chain of events will lead.

                          Slippery slope arguments are often used in discussions over emotional
                          and hot button topics such as gun control and physician-assisted suicide.
Exploring Public Speaking  309  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

One might argue that "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have
guns," a popular bumper sticker from the past. This is an example of a
slippery slope argument because it is saying that any gun control laws
will inevitably lead to no guns being allowed at all in the U.S. and then
the inevitable result that only criminals will have guns because they don't
obey gun control laws anyway. While it might be true criminals do not care
about gun laws, we already have a large number of gun laws and the level
of gun ownership is as high as ever.

However, just because an argument is criticized as a slippery slope, that
does not mean it is a slippery slope. Sometimes actions do lead to far-
reaching but unforeseen events, according to the "law of unintended
consequences." We should look below the surface to see if the accusation
of slippery slope is true.

For example, in regard to the anti-gun control "bumper sticker," an
investigation of the facts will show that gun control laws have been
ineffective in many ways since we have more guns than ever now
(347 million, according to a website affiliated with the National Rifle
Association). However, according to the Brookings Institution, there are

        "`...about 300 major state and federal laws, and an unknown but
         shrinking number of local laws'. . . . Rather than trying to base
         arguments for more or fewer laws on counting up the current
         total, we would do better to study the impact of the laws we do
         have." (Vernick & Hepburn, 2003, p. 2).

Note that in the previous paragraph, two numerical figures are used, both
from sources that are not free of bias. The National Rifle Association
obviously opposes gun restrictions and does not support the idea that
there are too many guns. Their website gives the background to show
how that figure was discovered. The Brookings Institution is a "think-
tank" (a group of scholars who write about public issues) that advocates
gun control. Their article explains how it came to its number of state and
federal laws, but admits that it omitted many local laws about carrying or
firing guns in public places. So the number is actually higher, by its own
admission. The Brookings Institution does not think there are too many
laws; it thinks there should be more, or at least better enforced ones. Also,
it should be noted that this article is based on data from 1970-1999, so the
information may be out of date.

This information about the sources is provided to make a point about
possible bias in sources and about critical thinking and reading, or more
specifically, reading carefully to understand your sources. Just finding
a source that looks pretty good is not enough. You must ask important
questions about the way the information is presented. An interesting
addition to the debate is found at (https://www.rand.org/research/gun-

                         be the reason for a student failing a test just because it happened first.

                         Hasty Generalization

                         Making a hasty generalization means making a generalization with
                         too few examples. It is so common that we might wonder if there are
                         any legitimate generalizations. One key to generalizations is how the
                         conclusions are "framed" or put into language. The conclusions should be
                         specific and be clear about the limited nature of the sample. Even worse is
                         when the generalization is also applied too hastily to other situations. For
                         example:

                                  Premise: Albert Einstein did poorly in math in school.

                                  Conclusion: All world-renowned scientists do poorly in math in
                                  school.

expression. Even a child can beat up a scarecrow; anyone can. Straw man
fallacy happens when an opponent in a debate misinterprets or takes a
small part of their opponent's position in a debate. Then they blow that
misinterpretation or small part out of proportion and make it a major
part of the opponent's position. This is often done by ridicule, taking
statements out of context, or misquoting.

Argument from Silence

You can't prove something from nothing. If the constitution, legal system,
authority, or the evidence is silent on a matter, then that is all you know.
You cannot conclude anything about that. "I know ESP is true because
no one has ever proven that it isn't true" is not an argument. Here we
see the difference between fallacious and false. Fallacious has to do with
the reasoning process being incorrect, not with the truth or falseness of

                         Statistical fallacies

                         There are many ways that statistics can be used incorrectly and even
                         unethically, but here we will deal with three. The first type of statistical
                         fallacy is "small sample," the second is "unrepresentative sample," and
                         the third is a variation of appeal to popularity (discussed below). In
                         small sample, an argument is being made from too few examples, so it is
                         essentially hasty generalization. In unrepresentative sample, a conclusion
                         is based on surveys of people who do not represent, or resemble, the
                         ones to whom the conclusion is being applied. If you ever take a poll on
                         a website, it is not "scientific" because it is unrepresentative. Only people
                         who go to that website are participating, and the same people could be
                         voting over and over. In a scientific or representative survey or poll, the
                         pollsters talk to different socio-economic classes, races, ages, and genders
                         and the data-gathering is very carefully performed.

                         If you go to the president of your college and say, "We need to have a
                         daycare here because 90% of the students say so," but you only polled
                         ten students, that would be small sample. If you say, "I polled 100
                         students," that would still be small, but better, unless all of them were
                         your friends who attended other colleges in the state. That group would
                         not be representative of the student body. If you polled 300 students but
                         they were all members of the same high school graduating class and the
                         same gender as you, that would also be unrepresentative sample. In reality,
                         the people most affected by the subject of the poll--student who are also
                         parents--should be the participants in the poll.

                         In the end, surveys indicate trends in opinions and behaviors, not the
                         future and not philosophical truth. We have lots of polls before the
                         election, but only one poll matters--the official vote on Election Day.

                         realize there is no connection between the premises and the conclusion. If
                         you say to your supervisor, "I need a raise because the price of BMWs went
                         up," that is a non sequitur.

                                                                                a fallacy that forces
There are appropriate appeals to authority, such as when you use sources        listeners to choose
in your speech who are knowledgeable, experienced, and credible. But not        between two
all sources are credible. Some may be knowledgeable about one field but         alternatives when
not another. A person with a Nobel Prize in economics is not qualified to       more than two
talk about medicine, no matter how smart they are (the economist could          alternatives exist
speak expertly about the economic factors in health care, perhaps). Of
course, the most common place we see this is in celebrity endorsements on       Appeal to Tradition
commercials.                                                                    Arguing that

This one is often referred to as the "either-or" fallacy. When you are given    continuing a policy
only two options, and more than two options exist, that is false dilemma.
Usually in false dilemma, one of the options is undesirable and the other             Bandwagon
is the one the persuader wants you to take. False dilemma is common.            a fallacy that
"America: Love it or Leave It." "If you don't buy this furniture today, you'll  assumes that because
never get another chance." "Vote for Candidate Russell or see our nation        something is popular,
destroyed."                                                                     it is therefore good,

Appeal to Tradition

Essentially, appeal to tradition is the argument, "We've always done
it this way." This fallacy happens when traditional practice is the only
reason for continuing a policy. Tradition is a great thing. We do many
wonderful things for the sake of tradition, and it makes us feel good. But
doing something only because it's always been done a certain way is not
an argument. Does it work? Is it cost effective? Is some other approach
better? If your college library refused to adopt a computer database of
books in favor of the old card catalog because "that's what libraries have
done for decades," you would likely argue they need to get with the times.
The same would be true if the classrooms all still had only chalkboards
instead of computers and projectors and the administration argued that it
fit the tradition of classrooms.

Bandwagon

This fallacy is also referred to as "appeal to majority" and "appeal to
popularity," using the old expression of "get on the bandwagon" to support
an idea. Essentially, bandwagon is a fallacy that asserts that because
something is popular (or seems to be), it is therefore good, correct, or
desirable. In a sense it was mentioned before, under statistical fallacies.
You've probably heard it or said it many times: "Everybody is doing it."
Well, of course, everybody is not doing it, it just seems like it from limited
observation. And the fact (or perception) that more than 50% of the

      Red herring       population is engaging in an activity does not make that a wise activity or
creating a diversion    right for you.
or introducing an
irrelevant point to     Many times in history over 50% of the population believed or did
distract someone        something that was not good or right, such as believing the earth was
or get someone off      the center of the solar system and the sun orbited around the earth. In a
the subject of the      democracy we make public policy to some extent based on majority rule,
argument                but we also have protections for the minority. This is a wonderful part of
                        our system. It is sometimes foolish to say that a policy is morally right or
     Ad hominem         wrong or wise just because it is supported by 50% of the people. So when
a fallacy that attacks  you hear a public opinion poll that says, "58% of the population thinks..."
the person rather than  keep this in mind. All it really means is that 58% of the people on a survey

issue in dispute        correct or that it will be the majority opinion in the future.

                        Red Herring

                        This one has an interesting history, and you might want to look it up. A
                        herring is a fish, and it was once used to throw off or distract foxhounds
                        from a particular scent of the fox they were chasing. A red herring,
                        then, is creating a diversion or introducing an irrelevant point to distract
                        someone or get someone off the subject of the argument. When a politician
                        in a debate is asked about his stance on immigration, and the candidate
                        responds, "I think we need to focus on reducing the debt. That's the real
                        problem!", he is introducing a red herring to distract from the original
                        topic under discussion. If someone argues, "We should not worry about
                        the needs of people in other countries because we have poor people in the
                        United States," that may sound good on the surface, but it is a red herring
                        and a false dilemma (either-or) fallacy. It is possible to address poverty in
                        this country and other countries at the same time.

                        Ad Hominem

                        This Latin term means "argument to the man," and generally refers to a
                        fallacy that attacks the person rather than dealing with the real issue in
                        dispute. A person using ad hominem connects a real or perceived flaw
                        in a person's character or behavior to an issue they support, asserting that
                        the flaw in character makes the position on the issue wrong. Obviously,
                        there is no connection. In a sense, ad hominem is a type of red herring
                        because it distracts from the real argument. In some cases, the "hidden
                        agenda" is to say that because someone of bad character supports an issue
                        or argument, therefore the issue or argument is not worthy or logical.
                        Sometimes the "flaw" that is the basis of the ad hominem argument is
                        something trivial, rather criminal behavior or poor judgment.

                        A person using ad hominem might say, "Climate change is not true. It is
                        supported by advocates such as Congressman Jones, and we all know that
                        Congressman Jones was convicted of fraud last year." This is not to say
Exploring Public Speaking  315  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

that Congressman Jones should be re-elected, only that climate change's           Ad misericordium
being true or false is irrelevant to the fraud conviction. Do not confuse
ad hominem with poor credibility or ethos. A speaker's ethos, based on           inappropriate appeal
character or past behavior, does matter. It just doesn't mean that the           to pity or emotions to
issues they support are logically or factually wrong.                            hide lack of facts or
                                                                                 argument
Ad Misericordium

This Latin term means "appeal to pity" and sometimes that term is used
instead of the Latin one. There is nothing wrong with pity and human
compassion as an emotional appeal in a persuasive speech; in fact, that is
definitely one you might want to use if it is appropriate, such as to solicit
donations to a worthwhile not-for-profit organization. However, if the
appeal to pity is used to elicit an emotional appeal and cover up a lack of
facts and evidence, it is being used as a smokescreen and is deceiving the
audience. If a nonprofit organization tried to get donations by wrenching
your heartstrings, that emotion may divert your attention from how much
of the donation really goes to the "cause." Chapter 3 of this book looked at
ethics in public speaking, and intentional use of logical fallacies is a breach
of ethics, even if the audience accepts them and does not use critical
thinking on its own.

Plain Folks

Plain folks is a tactic commonly used in advertising and by politicians.
Powerful persons will often try to make themselves appear like the
"common man." A man running for Senate may walk around in a campaign
ad in a flannel shirt, looking at his farm. (Flannel shirts are popular for
politicians, especially in the South.) A businessman of a large corporation
may want you to think his company cares about the "little guy" by showing
the owner helping on the assembly line. The image that these situations
create says, "I'm one of the guys, just like you." There is nothing wrong
with wearing a flannel shirt and looking at one's farm, unless the reason is
to divert from the real issues or send the wrong message.

Guilt by Association

This fallacy is a form of false analogy based on the idea that if two things
bear any relationship at all, they are comparable. No one wants to be
blamed for something just because she is in the wrong place at the wrong
time or happens to bear some resemblance to a guilty person. An example
would be if someone argued, "Adolf Hitler was a vegetarian; therefore
being a vegetarian is evil." Of course, vegetarianism as a life practice
had nothing to do with Hitler's character. Although this is an extreme
example, it is not uncommon to hear guilt by association used as a type
of ad hominem argument. There is actually a fallacy called "reductio ad
Exploring Public Speaking  316  Chapter 14: Logical Reasoning
Version 4.2

Hitlerum"--whenever someone dismisses an argument by bringing up a
comparison or reference to Hitler out of nowhere.

There are other fallacies, many of which go by Latin names. You can visit
other websites, such as http://www.logicalfallacies.info/ for more types
and examples. These eighteen are a good start to helping you discern good
reasoning and supplement your critical thinking knowledge and ability.

Conclusion

This chapter took the subject of public speaking to a different level in that
it was somewhat more abstract than the other chapters. However, public
speakers are responsible for using good reasoning as much as they are
responsible to have an organized speech, to analyze the audience, or to
practice for effective delivery.

Something to Think About

You cannot hear logical fallacies unless you listen carefully and critically.
Keep your ears open to possible uses of fallacies. Are they used in
discussion of emotional topics? Are they used to get compliance (such as
to buy a product) without allowing the consumer to think about the issues?
What else do you notice about them?

Here is a class activity one of the authors has used in the past to teach
fallacies. With a small group of classmates, create a "fallacy skit" to
perform for the class. Plan and act out a situation where a fallacy is
being used, and then be able to explain it to the class. The example under
Slippery Slope about the young woman turning down a date actually came
from the author's students in a fallacy skit.

a speech designed to
capture an audience's  Often the speaking opportunities life brings our way have nothing to do
attention while        with specifically informing or persuading an audience; instead, we are
delivering a message   commonly asked to speak during special occasions in our lives. Whether
                       you are standing up to give a speech at an awards ceremony or a toast at a
                       wedding, knowing how to deliver speeches in a variety of different contexts
                       is the nature of special occasion speaking. In this chapter, we are going to
                       explore what special occasion speeches are as well as a number of types of
                       special occasion speeches ranging from humorous to somber.

                       In broad terms, a special occasion speech is a speech designed to
                       address and engage the context and audience's emotions on a specific
                       occasion. Like informative or persuasive speeches, special occasion
                       speeches should communicate a clear message, but the manner of
                       speaking used is typically different. The word "special" in the term "special
                       occasion speeches" is somewhat subjective. Some occasions that call for
                       special occasion speeches truly are special occasions (e.g., a toast at a
                       wedding, an acceptance speech at an awards banquet, a eulogy for a loved
                       ones). However, such speeches can also be given at more mundane events,
                       such as the hundreds of public relations speeches that big companies give
                       every day. The goal of a special occasion speech is ultimately to stir an
                       audience's emotions and make them feel a certain way in response to the
                       situation or occasion.

                       Of all the types of speeches we are most likely to have to give during our
                       lives, many of them will fall into the special occasion category. These often
                       include speeches that are designed to inspire or motivate an audience to
                       do something. These are, however, different from a traditional persuasive
                       speech. Let's say you're the coach of your child's Little League team
                       or a project leader at your work. In both cases you might find yourself
                       delivering a speech to motivate and inspire your teams to do their best.
                       You can imagine how giving a motivational speech like that would be
                       different from a traditional persuasive speech, such as focusing on why
                       a group of 50-somethings should change their investment strategy or a
                       group of your peers to vote for a certain candidate for Student Senate.

                       To help us think through how to be effective in delivering special occasion
                       speeches, let's look at four key ingredients: preparation, adaptation to the
                       occasion, adaptation to the audience, and mindfulness about the time.

                       Be Prepared

                       First, and foremost, the biggest mistake you can make when standing to
                       deliver a special occasion speech is to underprepare or simply not prepare
                       at all. We've stressed the need for preparation throughout this text, so
Exploring Public Speaking  319  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

just because you're giving a wedding toast or a eulogy doesn't mean you
shouldn't think through the speech before you stand up and speak out. If
the situation is impromptu, even jotting some basic notes on a napkin is
better than not having any plan for what you are going to say.

Adapt to the Occasion

Not all content is appropriate for all occasions. If you are asked to deliver
a speech commemorating the first anniversary of a tragic event, then
obviously using humor wouldn't be appropriate. But some decisions
about adapting to the occasion are less obvious. Consider the following
examples:

     You are the maid of honor giving a toast at the wedding of your
      younger sister.

     You are receiving a Most Valuable Player award in your favorite sport.

     You are a sales representative speaking to a group of clients after a
      mistake has been discovered.

     You are a cancer survivor speaking at a high school student assembly.

     You are giving an after-dinner speech to the members of your
      fraternity.

How might you adapt your message and speaking style to convey your
message successfully to these various audiences?

Remember that being a competent speaker is about being both personally
effective and socially appropriate. Different occasions will call for different
levels of social appropriateness. One of the biggest mistakes speakers can
make is to deliver one generic speech to different groups without adapting
the speech to the specific occasion. In fact, professional speakers always
make sure that their speeches are tailored for different occasions by
getting information about the occasion from their hosts. When we tailor
speeches for special occasions, people are more likely to remember those
speeches than if we give a generic speech.

Adapt to Your Audience

Once again, we cannot stress the importance of audience adaptation
enough in this text. Different audiences will respond differently to speech
material, so the more you know about your audience, the more likely you'll
succeed in your speech. One of our coauthors was once at a conference for
teachers of public speaking. The keynote speaker stood and delivered a
speech on the importance of public speaking. While the speaker was good
and funny, the speech really fell flat. The keynote speaker basically told
Exploring Public Speaking  320  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

                        the public speaking teachers that they should take public speaking courses
                        because public speaking is important. Right speech, wrong audience!

                        Be Mindful of the Time

                        The last major consideration for delivering special occasion speeches
                        successfully is to be mindful of your time. Different speech situations have
                        their own conventions and rules with regard to time. Acceptance speeches
                        and toasts, for example, should be relatively short (typically under two
                        minutes). A speech of introduction should be extremely brief--just long
                        enough to tell the audience what they need to know about the person
                        being introduced in a style that prepares them to appreciate that person's
                        remarks. In contrast, commencement speeches, eulogies, and speeches
                        to commemorate events can run ten to twenty minutes, depending on the
                        context.

                        It's also important to recognize that audiences on different occasions
                        will expect speeches of various lengths. For example, although it's true
                        that graduation commencement speakers generally speak for ten to
                        twenty minutes, the closer that speaker heads toward twenty minutes the
                        more fidgety the audience becomes. To hold the audience's attention, a
                        commencement speaker would do well to make the closing minutes of the
                        speech the most engaging and inspiring portion of the speech. If you're not
                        sure about the expected time frame for a speech, ask the person who has
                        invited you to speak.

        Speech of       15.2 - Types of Special Occasion Speeches
     introduction
                        Unlike the informative and persuasive speeches you were required to
a mini-speech given by  give, special occasion speeches are much broader and allow for a wider
the host of a ceremony  range of topics, events, and approaches to be employed. However, while
that introduces         the following list of special occasion speeches is long, your instructor will
another speaker and     have specific types of special occasion speeches that you will be allowed (or
his or her speech       required) to do for class. Since you are likely to give many special occasion
                        speeches in your life, we want to cover everything you might need to know
                        to give a good one.

                        Speeches of Introduction

                        The first type of special occasion speech is the speech of introduction,
                        which is a mini-speech given by the host of a ceremony that introduces
                        another speaker and their speech. Few things are worse than when the
                        introducer of a speaker stands up and says, "This is Wyatt Ford. He's going
                        to talk about stress." While we did learn the speaker's name and the topic,
                        the introduction falls flat. Audiences won't be the least bit excited about
                        listening to Wyatt's speech.
Exploring Public Speaking  321  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

Just like any other speech, a speech of introduction should be a complete             Speech of
speech and have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion--and you                presentation
should try to do it all in under two minutes. This brings up another "few
things are worse" scenario: an introductory speaker who rambles on for        a brief speech given to
too long or who talks about himself or herself instead of focusing on the     accompany a prize or
person being introduced.                                                      honor

For an introduction, think of a hook that will make your audience
interested in the upcoming speaker. Did you read a news article related
to the speaker's topic? If the speaker is an author, have you read one of
their books? Have you been impressed by a presentation you've heard
the speaker give in the past? You need to find something that can grab
the audience's attention and make them excited about hearing the main
speaker.

The body of your speech of introduction should be devoted to telling the
audience about the speaker's topic, why the speaker is qualified, and why
the audience should listen (notice we now have our three main points).
First, tell your audience in general terms about the overarching topic of
the speech. Most of the time as an introducer, you'll only have a speech
title and maybe a paragraph of information to help guide this part of
your speech. That's all right. You don't need to know all the ins and outs
of the main speaker's speech; you just need to know enough to whet the
audience's appetite. Next, you need to tell the audience why the speaker is
a credible presenter on the topic. Has the speaker written books or articles
on the subject? Has the speaker had special life events that make him or
her qualified? Lastly, you need to briefly explain to the audience why they
should care about the upcoming speech. The outline can be adjusted; for
example, you can give the biographical information first, but these three
areas should be covered.

The final part of a good introduction is the conclusion, which is generally
designed to welcome the speaker to the platform. Many introducers will
conclude by saying something like, "I am looking forward to hearing how
Wyatt Ford's advice and wisdom can help all of us today, so please join me
in welcoming Dr. Wyatt Ford." At this point, you as the person introducing
the speaker are "handing off" the speaking duties to someone else, so it
is not uncommon to end your speech of introduction by clapping as the
speaker comes on stage or shaking the speaker's hand.

Speeches of Presentation

The second type of special occasion speech is the speech of
presentation. A speech of presentation is a brief speech given to
accompany a prize or honor. Speeches of presentation can be as simple
as saying, "This year's recipient of the Lavache Public Speaking prize is
Ryann Curley," or could last up to five minutes as the speaker explains why

a speech given by the
recipient of a prize or  When preparing a speech of presentation, it's always important to ask how
honor                    long the speech should be. Once you know the time limit, then you can set
                         out to create the speech itself. First, you should explain what the award or
        Speech of        honor is and why the presentation is important. Second, you can explain
       dedication        what the recipient has accomplished in order for the award to be bestowed.
a speech delivered to    Did the person win a race? Did the person write an important piece
mark the unveiling,      of literature? Did the person mediate conflict? Whatever the recipient
opening, or              has done, you need to clearly highlight their work. Lastly, if the race or
acknowledging of some    competition was conducted in a public forum and numerous people didn't
landmark or structure    win, you may want to recognize those people for their efforts as well. While
                         you don't want to steal the show away from winner, you may want to
                         highlight the work of the other competitors or nominees.

                         Speeches of Acceptance

                         The complement to a speech of presentation is the speech of
                         acceptance. The speech of acceptance is a speech given by the recipient
                         of a prize or honor. There are three typical components of a speech of
                         acceptance: 1) thank the givers of the award or honor, 2) thank those
                         who helped you achieve your goal, and 3) put the award or honor into
                         perspective. First, you want to thank the people who have given you the
                         award or honor and possibly those who voted for you. We see this done
                         every year during the Oscars, "First, I'd like to thank the Academy and all
                         the Academy voters."

                         Second, you want to give credit to those who helped you achieve the award
                         or honor. No person accomplishes things in life completely on their own.
                         We all have family members, friends, and colleagues who support us and
                         help us achieve what we do in life, and a speech of acceptance is a great
                         time to graciously recognize those individuals. Lastly, put the award in
                         perspective. Tell the people listening to your speech why the award is
                         meaningful to you. If you know you are up for an award, the odds of your
                         winning are high. In order to avoid blubbering through an acceptance
                         speech, have one ready. A good rule to remember is: Be thankful, be
                         gracious, be short.

                         Speeches of Dedication

                         A fourth special occasion speech is the speech of dedication. A speech
                         of dedication is delivered when a new store opens, a building is named
                         after someone, a plaque is placed on a wall, a new library is completed,
                         and so on. These speeches are designed to highlight the importance of the
                         project and possibly those to whom the project has been dedicated.
Exploring Public Speaking  323  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

When preparing a speech of dedication, start by explaining how you are
involved in the dedication and/or who is being honored in the dedication.
If the person to whom the dedication is being made is a relative, tell the
audience about your relationship and your relative's accomplishments.
Second, you want to explain what is being dedicated. If the dedication
is a new building or a pre-existing building, you want to explain the
importance of the structure. You should then explain who was involved in
the project. For example, if the project is a new structure, talk about the
people who built the structure or designed it. If the project is a pre-existing
structure, talk about the people who put together and decided on the
dedication.

Lastly, explain why the structure is important for the community in which
it is located. If the dedication is for a new store, talk about how the store
will bring in new jobs and new shopping opportunities. If the dedication is
for a new wing of a hospital, talk about how patients will be served and the
advances in medicine the new wing will provide the community.

Toasts                                                                                      Toast

At one time or another, almost everyone is going to be asked to deliver          a speech designed
a toast. A toast is a speech designed to congratulate, appreciate, or            to congratulate,
remember and, of course, involves glasses of (usually) an alcoholic drink.       appreciate, or
First, toasts can be delivered for the purpose of congratulating someone         remember
for an honor, a new job, or getting married. You can also toast someone to
show your appreciation for something he or she has done. Lastly, we toast
people to remember them and what they have accomplished.

When preparing a toast, the first goal is always to keep your remarks brief.
Toasts are generally given during the middle of some kind of festivities
(e.g., wedding, retirement party, farewell party), and you don't want your
toast to take away from those festivities for too long. Second, the goal of a
toast is to focus attention on the person or persons being toasted--not on
the speaker.
Exploring Public Speaking  324  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

           Roast         As such, while you are speaking, you need to focus your attention toward
                         the people being toasted, both by physically looking at them and by
a humorous speech        keeping your message about them. You should also avoid any inside jokes
designed to both praise  between you and the people being toasted because toasts are public and
and good-naturedly       should be accessible for everyone who hears them. To conclude a toast,
insult a person being    simply say something like, "Please join me in recognizing Gina for her
honored                  achievement" and lift your glass. When you lift your glass, this will signal
                         to others to do the same and then you can all take a drink, which is the end
                         of your speech.

                         Roasts

                         A roast is a very interesting and peculiar speech because it is designed to
                         both praise and good-naturedly insult a person being honored. Because
                         of this combination of purposes, it is not hard to argue that the roast
                         is probably a challenging type of speeches to write given the difficult
                         task of simultaneously praising and insulting the person. Generally,
                         roasts are given at the conclusion of a banquet in honor of someone's
                         life achievements. The television channel Comedy Central has been
                         conducting roasts of various celebrities for a few years, and if you've ever
                         watched one, you know that the "roasters" say some harsh things about
                         the "roastees" even though they are friends.

                         During a roast, the roaster will stand behind a lectern while the roastee is
                         seated somewhere where he or she is clearly on display for the audience to
                         see, thus allowing the audience to take in his or her reactions. Since half
                         the fun of a good roast is watching the roastee's reactions during the roast,
                         it's important to have the roastee clearly visible to the audience.

                         How does one prepare for a roast? First, you want to really think about
                         the person who is being roasted. Does he or she have any strange habits
                         or amusing stories in their past that you can discuss? When you think
                         through these questions, you want to make sure that you cross anything
                         off your list that is truly private information or will really hurt the person.
                         The goal of a roast is to poke at him, not massacre him.

                         Second, when selecting which aspects to poke fun at, you need to make
                         sure that the items you choose are widely known by your audience. Roasts
                         work when the majority of people in the audience can relate to the jokes
                         being made. If you have an inside joke with the roastee, bringing it up
                         during roast may be great fun for the two of you, but it will leave your
                         audience unimpressed. Lastly, end on a positive note. While the jokes
                         are definitely the fun part of a roast, you should leave the roastee and the
                         audience knowing that you truly do care about and appreciate the person.

Eulogies                                                                                     Eulogy

A eulogy is a speech given in honor of someone who has died (Don't                 a speech given in
confuse "eulogy" with "elegy," a poem or song of mourning). Not to sound           honor of someone who
depressing, but since everyone who is alive will someday die, the chance of        has died
your being asked to give a eulogy someday for a friend or family member is
significant. However, when the time comes to deliver a eulogy, it's good to
know what you're doing and to adequately prepare your remarks.

When preparing a eulogy, first you need to know as much information
about the deceased as possible. The more information you have about the
person, the more personal you can make the eulogy. While you can rely
on your own information if you were close to the deceased, it is always a
good idea to ask friends and relatives of the deceased for their memories,
as these may add important facets that may not have occurred to you.
Of course, if you were not very close to the deceased, you will need to
ask friends and family for information. Second, although eulogies are
delivered on the serious and sad occasion of a funeral or memorial service
for the deceased, it is very helpful to look for at least one point to be lighter
or humorous. In some cultures, in fact, the friends and family attending
the funeral expect the eulogy to be highly entertaining and amusing.

Take, for example, Tom Arnold's eulogy of Saturday Night Live actor
Chris Farley. During his speech at Farley's funeral, Arnold noted, "Chris
was concerned about his size, and so he made sure that all of us who
knew him well saw him naked at least once" (Glionna, 1998). Picturing
the heavy-set comedian naked surely brought some humor to the somber
proceedings, but Arnold knew Farley (and his audience) well enough to
know that the story would be appropriate.

Knowing the deceased and the audience is vital when deciding on the type
and amount of humor to use in a eulogy. It's doubtful statements like
Tom Arnold's would fit many eulogies. But it would be appropriate to tell
a funny story about Uncle Joe's love for his rattletrap car or Aunt Mary's
love of tacky Christmas sweaters. Ultimately, the goal of the humor or
lighter aspects of a eulogy is to relieve the tension that is created by the
serious nature of the occasion.

If you are ever asked to give a eulogy, that means you were probably close
to the deceased and are experiencing shock, sadness, and disbelief at your
loved one's passing. The last thing that you will want to do (or be in a
mental state to do) is figure out how to structure your eulogy. To that end,
here are three parts of a eulogy (i.e. main points) you can use to write one
without worrying about being original with structure or organizational
patterns: praise, lament, and consolation.
Exploring Public Speaking  326  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

         Lament        Praise
to express grief or
sorrow                 The first thing you want to do when remembering someone who has
                       passed away is remind the audience what made that person so special. So
         Console       you will want to praise them and their accomplishments. This can include
to offer comfort in a  notable achievements (being an award winner; helping with charities),
time of grief          personal qualities ("she was always willing to listen to your problems
                       and help in any way she could"), or anecdotes and stories (being a great
                       mother; how she drove to college to visit you when you were homesick).

                       Lament

                       The second thing you want to do in a eulogy is to lament the loss. To
                       lament means to express grief or sorrow, which is what everyone at a
                       funeral has gathered to do. You will want to acknowledge that everyone is
                       sad and that the deceased's passing will be difficult to get through. Here
                       you might mention all the things that will no longer happen as a result of
                       the death. "Now that Grandpa is gone, there won't be any more Sunday
                       dinners where he cooks chicken on the grill or bakes his famous macaroni
                       and cheese."

                       Console

                       The final step (or main point) in a eulogy is to console the audience, or
                       to offer comfort in a time of grief. What you must remember (and many
                       people often forget) is that a eulogy is not a speech for the person who has
                       died; it is a speech for the people who are still living to try to help them
                       deal with the loss. You will want to end your eulogy on a positive note.
                       Offer some hope that someday, things will get better. If the deceased was a
                       religious person, this is where you might want to incorporate elements of
                       that belief system. Some examples would include ideas like:

                               "Jim has gone home to be with the Lord and is looking down on us
                                fondly today."

                               "We may miss Aunt Linda deeply, but our memories of her will
                                live on forever, and her impact on this world will not soon be
                                forgotten."

                       Using the Praise-Lament-Console format for eulogies gives you a simple
                       system where you can fill in the sections with 1) why was the person good,
                       2) why you will miss him or her, and 3) how you and the audience will get
                       through this loss. It sometimes also helps to think of the three points in
                       terms of Past-Present-Future: you will praise the deceased for what he
                       did when he was alive (the past), lament the loss you are feeling now (the
                       present), and console your audience by letting them know that things will
                       be all right (the future).

With regard to a eulogy you might give in class, you generally have two           Speech of farewell
options for how to proceed: you can eulogize a real person who has               a speech allowing
passed away, or you can eulogize a fictional character (if your instructor       someone to say
permits that). If you give a eulogy in class on someone in your life who         goodbye to one part of

A speech of farewell allows someone to say good-bye to one part of his
or her life as he or she is moving on to the next part of life. Maybe you've
accepted a new job and are leaving your current job, or you're graduating
from college and entering the work force. Periods of transition are often
marked by speeches of farewell. When preparing a speech of farewell,
the goal should be to thank the people in your current position and let
them know how much you appreciate them as you make the move to
your next position in life. Second, you want to express to your audience
how much the experience has meant to you. A farewell speech is a time to
commemorate and think about the good times you've had. As such, you
should avoid negativity during this speech. Lastly, you want to make sure
that you end on a high note.

Speeches for Commencements

A speech of commencement (or, as it is more commonly known,
a "commencement speech") is designed to recognize and celebrate the
achievements of a graduating class or other group of people. These
typically take place at graduation ceremonies. Nearly every one of us
has sat through commencement speeches at some point in our lives.
And if you're like us, you've heard good ones and bad ones. Numerous
celebrities and politicians have been asked to deliver commencement
speeches at colleges and universities. A famous and well-thought-out
commencement speech was given by famed Harry Potter author J. K.
Rowling at Harvard University in 2008 (found at http://www.youtube.
com/watch?v=nkREt4ZB-ck). Rowling's speech has the perfect balance of
humor and inspiration, which are two of the main ingredients of a great
commencement speech.
Exploring Public Speaking  328  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

If you're ever asked to deliver a commencement speech, there are some key
points to think through when deciding on your speech's content.

     If there is a specific theme for the graduation, make sure that
      your commencement speech addresses that theme. If there is no
       specific theme, come up with one for your speech. Some common
       commencement speech themes are commitment, competitiveness,
       competence, confidence, decision making, discipline, ethics, failure
      (and overcoming failure), faith, generosity, integrity, involvement,
      leadership, learning, persistence, personal improvement,
      professionalism, reality, responsibility, and self-respect.

     Talk about your life and how graduates can learn from your
      experiences to avoid pitfalls or take advantages of life. How can your
      life inspire the graduates in their future endeavors?

     Make the speech appropriately humorous. Commencement speeches
       should be entertaining and make an audience laugh to some extent.

     Be brief! Nothing is more painful than a commencement speaker who
      drones on and on. Remember, the graduates are there to get their
      diplomas; their families are there to watch the graduates walk across
      the stage.

     Remember, while you may be the speaker, you've been asked to
      impart wisdom and advice for the people graduating and moving on
      with their lives, so keep it focused on them.

     Place the commencement speech into the broader context of the
      graduates' lives. Show the graduates how the advice and wisdom you
      are offering can be utilized to make their own lives better.

Overall, it's important to make sure that you have fun when delivering a
commencement speech. Remember, it's a huge honor and responsibility

                                                                            a humorous speech

                                                                            point
After-dinner speeches are humorous speeches that make a serious
point. These speeches get their name from the fact that they historically
follow a meal of some kind. After-dinner speakers are generally asked
to speak (or hired to speak) because they have the ability both to speak
effectively and to make people laugh. First and foremost, after-dinner
speeches are speeches and not stand-up comedy routines. All the basic
conventions of public speaking previously discussed in this text apply to
after-dinner speeches, but the overarching goal of these speeches is to be
entertaining and to create an atmosphere of amusement.

After-dinner speaking is an extremely difficult type of speaking to do
well because it is an entertaining speech that depends on the successful
delivery of humor. People train for years to develop comic timing, or
the verbal and nonverbal delivery used to enhance the comedic value of
a message. But after-dinner speaking is difficult, not impossible. What
follows is the method we recommend for developing a successful after-
dinner speech.

First, use all that you have learned about informative or persuasive
speeches to prepare a real informative or persuasive speech roughly two-
thirds the length of what the final speech will become. That is, if you're
going to be giving a ten-minute speech, then your "real" informative or
persuasive speech should be six or seven minutes in length. This is the
"serious message" portion of the speech where you will try to make a point
of educating your audience.

Next, go back through the speech and look for opportunities to insert
humorous remarks. Once you've looked through your speech and
examined places for verbal humor, think about any physical humor or
props that would enhance your speech. Physical humor is great if you can
pull it off without being self-conscious. One of the biggest mistakes any
humorist makes is to become too aware of what his or her body is doing
because it's then harder to be free and funny. As for props, after-dinner
speakers have been known to use everything from oversized inflatable
baseball bats to rubber clown noses. The goal for a funny prop is that it
adds to the humor of the speech without distracting from its message.

Last, and probably most important, try the humor out on real, live people.
This is important for three reasons. First, the success of humor depends
heavily on delivery, and especially timing in delivery. You will need
practice to polish your delivery so that your humor comes across. If you
can't make it through one of your jokes without cracking up, you will need
Exploring Public Speaking  330  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

                         to either incorporate the self-crackup into your delivery or forgo using that
                         joke.

     Motivational        Second, just because you find something unbelievably funny in your
          speech         head doesn't mean that it will make anyone else laugh. Often, humor
                         that we have written down on paper just doesn't translate when orally
a speech designed        presented. You may have a humorous story that you love reading on paper,

excitement) but also to  audience. What one audience finds funny another may find offensive.

to do something with     amazing and powerful speaking tool, but on the other side, few things will
that emotional arousal   alienate an audience more than offensive humor. If you're ever uncertain
                         about whether a piece of humor will offend your audience, don't use it.

                         So you may now be asking, "What kind of topics are serious that I can joke
                         about?" The answer to that, like the answer to most everything else in the
                         book, is dependent on your audience and the speaking situation, which
                         is to say any topic will work, while at the same time you need to be very
                         careful about how you choose your topic.

                         Take, for example, the experience one of your authors had while he was
                         attending a large university. One of the major problems that any large
                         university faces is parking: the ratio of parking spaces to students at some
                         of these schools can be 1:7 (one parking space for every seven students). In
                         addressing this topic at a banquet, a student gave an after- dinner speech

The religious speech is fairly self-explanatory; it is designed to

The final type of motivational speech is the success speech, which is
given by someone who has succeeded in some aspect of life and is giving
back by telling others how they too can be successful.

Summary

As stated at the beginning of this section, you will almost certainly be
limited by your professor with regards to which of these types of speeches
Exploring Public Speaking  332  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

you can give for your special occasion speech in class, but it is not
unrealistic to think that you will be called upon at various points in your
life to give one or more of these speeches. Knowing the types and basic
structures will help when those moments arise.

15.3 - Special Occasion Language

Special occasion speaking is so firmly rooted in the use of good language
that it makes sense to address it here, drawing from concepts in Chapter
10. More than any other category of speech, the special occasion speech
is arguably one where the majority of your preparation time will be
specifically allocated towards the words you choose. This isn't to say you
shouldn't have used good language in your informative and persuasive
speeches, but that the emphasis shifts slightly in a special occasion speech.

For example, for your informative and persuasive speeches you were
required to conduct research and cite your sources in a bibliography or
references/works cited page, which took you some time to look up and
format. In most cases, that will not be necessary in a special occasion
speech, although there may be reasons to consult sources or other persons
for information in crafting your speech. So for special occasion speeches,
there is a trade-off. The time you don't spend doing research is now going
to be reallocated towards crafting emotional and evocative phrases that
convey the sentiment your speech is meant to impart.

The important thing to remember about using language effectively is
that we are not talking about using big words just to sound smart. Do not
touch a thesaurus! Good language isn't about trying to impress us with
fancy words. It's about taking the words you are already comfortable and
familiar with and putting them in the best possible order. Consider the
following example from the then-president of the Ohio State University,
Gordon Gee, giving a commencement address at Florida State University
in 1997:

         As you look back on your years at Florida State I hope you
         remember many good things that have happened. These
         experiences are, for the most part, events of the mind. The
         memories, ladies and gentlemen, however, are treasures of the
         heart.

Notice three things about his use of language: first, he doesn't try to use
any fancy words, which he certainly could if he wanted to. Every word
in this portion of his speech is one that all of us knew by the time we left
elementary school, so again, don't mistake good language for big words.
Using a five-syllable word when a two-syllable word will work just as
well often means a speaker is trying too hard to sound smart. And given
that the use of those big words often comes off sounding awkward or
inappropriate, you're better off just sticking with what you know.
Exploring Public Speaking  333  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

Second, notice how he uses those basic words to evoke emotion and
wonderment. Putting the words you know into the best possible order,
when done well, will make your speech sound extremely eloquent and
emotional. Third, he uses parallelism in this brief snippet, one of the
rhetorical techniques discussed in Chapter 10. The use of "events of the
mind" and "treasures of the heart" to compare what is truly important
about the college experience is powerful. Indeed, Gee's commencement
address is full of various rhetorical devices, with the twelve-minute speech
also containing alliteration, assonance, and antithesis.

15.4 - Special Occasion Delivery

Just as the language for special occasion speaking is slightly different, so
too are the ways in which you will want to deliver your speech. First and
foremost, since you will be spending so much time crafting the perfect
language to use and putting your words in the right order, it is imperative
that you say exactly what you have written; otherwise, what was the point?
To that end, your delivery for a special occasion speech will skew slightly
more in favor of manuscript speaking discussed in Chapter 11. While it is
still vital to establish eye contact with your audience and to not sound like
you are reading, it is also important to get the words exactly right.

You will need to practice your special occasion speech as much as or even
more than you did for your informative or persuasive speeches. You need
to know what you are going to say and feel comfortable knowing what is
coming next. This is not to say you should have your speech memorized,
but you need to be able to take your eyes off the page in order to establish
and maintain a rapport with your audience, a vital element in special
occasion speaking because of the emotional component at the core of these
speeches. Knowing your speech will also allow you to counteract the flow
of adrenaline into your system, something particularly important given
that special occasion speeches tend to be very emotional, not just for the
audience, but for you as well.

Basically, knowing your speech well allows you to incorporate the emotion
that a special occasion speech is meant to convey, something that is
hard to do when you read the entirety of your speech. In this way your
audience will sense the pride you feel for a graduating class during a
commencement speech, the sorrow you feel for the deceased during a
eulogy, or the gratitude you have when accepting an award.

Conclusion

Special occasion speaking is the most varied type of speaking to cover;
however, there are some general rules to keep in mind regardless of what
type you are engaged in. Remember that using good, evocative language
is key, and that it is important that you deliver your speech in a way that
Exploring Public Speaking  334  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

both conveys the proper emotion for the occasion as well as allows you to
give the speech exactly as you wrote it.

Sample Outline: Commemorative (Tribute) Speech on Simone
Biles

By Kellie Barnes

Specific Purpose: To inspire my audience with the story of Simone Biles.

Introduction: "I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps. I'm the first
Simone Biles!" Said Simone, and boy did she earn that kind of recognition!
Some of you might hear that name and think of a random gymnast and
some of you may hear that name and not know who it is at all; but today,
before this class is over, I am going to make sure each and every one of you
remember just how great she is and why she deserves to be recognized.

Thesis: A person whom I admire over all other athletes is Simone Biles.

Preview: Simone is special in my eyes because she has overcome some big
challenges in her life to get to where she is today. Not only is she a three-
time gymnastics champion, but she made history while doing it.

    I. Simone overcame an extremely rough childhood in Columbus,
          Ohio, as both her mother and father were struggling with
          substance abuse.
              A. Simone's grandparents took her and her siblings under
                    their wings.
              B. Soon her grandparents were able to adopt all of the
                    grandchildren at a fairly young age.
              C. Although Simone didn't have the best relationship with her
                    mom as a young child, she had plenty of women to step up
                    in her life to fill that gap.
                       1. She had a grandmother who was basically "Mom" to
                             her.
                       2. She has also had the same gymnastics coach since
                             she was 11 years old.

Transition: Although Simone had a rather disheartening childhood, she
has emerged to be one of the best in her sport.

II. In her teens and standing at 4 foot 8 inches, Simone made a
tremendous name for herself in the gymnastics world. These are just a few
of her accomplishments.

              A. Simone was the first female ever to win three worldwide
                    all-around titles.
                       1. She has the most World Championship gold medals
                             won by a female gymnast in history with ten.
                       2. She is the most decorated World Championship
                             American gymnast with 14 total medals (10 gold,
Exploring Public Speaking  335  Chapter 15: Special Occasion Speaking
Version 4.2

                             two silver, two bronze).
              B. She became the Olympic Gold medalist in vault, floor,

                    Individual and Team all-around and Bronze medalist on
                    Beam at 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
              C. At just 19 years old, she became the most decorated female
                    gymnast in America.

                       1. Right behind her the whole time stood her amazing
                             family and support system.

                       2. She is the first African American to become an all-
                             around world champ.

              D. Consequently, she has received many media awards and
                    much attention.
                       1. She was named one of the Most Influential People in
                             the World list by TIME magazine.
                       2. She was named Associated Press Female Athlete of
                             the Year 2016.

Transition: Simone was so incredibly grateful that she had people to take
her in and support her through all of her success she tried her best to do
the same for others who were in need.

III. Simone started an amazing charity for foster kids as a way for her to
give back.

              A. Founded in 2015, Mattress Firm Foster Kids is now
                    effective in 40 states nationwide.

              B. "This is such a personal cause for me because I know first-
                    hand what it is like to be in foster care, the struggles and
                    all," says Simone.

              C. This cause has given back more than 610,000 items, such
                    as clothes and school supplies, to foster kids and their
                    families.

Conclusion: As I sit back and look at the life of Simone Biles I'm amazed
with all that she has done in such a short amount of time. At 20 years old
she had given back to those in need, rose above many tough challenges
in her life, and amongst all of that she is having the time of her life on the
mat, and earning medals and honors while doing so. "I'm out here to prove
what I'm capable of" said Simone and in my eyes, she is doing just that.

Appendix A: Cultural

Diversity in Public

Speaking

It goes without saying that the United States is becoming more and more
diverse. The millennial generation, those born between 1980 and 2000,
are described the most diverse generation in American history. Forty-
three percent are "non-white" due, in part, to increased immigration from
Asia and Latin America in the recent past (Lilley, 2014). Even more, news
stories and research indicate that the majority in the U.S. is not White,
male, Protestant, and middle class, but multi-racial and ethnic, of different
religions, 51% female, and of varying socio-economic groups.

Some issues related to the U.S.'s growing diversity were addressed in
Chapter 2. In this appendix, we will look at how diversity can be a help and
sometimes a challenge to a speaker.

Benefits and Challenges

The first way that diversity can be a help is if the speaker has been exposed
to diverse groups of people. Diversity should also be understood as not just
ethnic or racial, although those tend to be in the forefront of many minds.
Diversity of thought is often a more important type of diversity than what
might appear on the surface. Your audience may "look" and "sound" like
you, but have a completely different world view.

However, diversity can be a challenge because the more diverse an
audience, the harder audience analysis and accommodating one's
speech to the audience become. Also, one must be sure that he or she
truly understands the diversity of a group. For example, it is assumed
that all Arabic speakers are Muslims; however, persons of Lebanese
and Palestinian background may be of a Christian faith. Likewise, many
erroneously equate Muslims with Arab speakers and people of Arabic
background, but the largest Muslim majority country is Indonesia. As
mentioned in Chapter 2, "Latino" is a broad term that involves many
distinct cultures that often observe or utilize very different customs,
holidays, political views, foods, and practices. The historical experience
of African-Americans is not that of Afro-Caribbeans. A white person
from South Africa considers herself "African," although we in the U.S.
might scratch our heads at that because of how we traditionally think of
"African." (Elon Musk is an example.)
Exploring Public Speaking  337  Appendix A: Cultural Diveristy in
Version 4.2
                                                                                  Public Speaking

The more one can study cross-cultural communication issues, the more
sensitive one can become. It is, of course, next to impossible to know
every culture intimately; some of us are still working on learning our
own! What one should recognize is the basic ways that cultures are
categorized or grouped, based on certain characteristics, while at the same
time appreciating cultural uniqueness. Even more, appreciating cultural
uniqueness leads one to see predominant communication patterns or
behaviors.

One common method for categorizing or discussing cultures is by
"collectivist" or "individualistic." The United States, Germany, Israel, and
a few other countries are highly individualistic, while Asian, some Latino,
and some African cultures are highly collectivistic. While we in the U.S.
value family, we generally are expected and encouraged to make our own
life choices in career, education, marriage, and living arrangements. In
more collectivist cultures, the family or larger community would primarily
decide those life choices. In some cases, the individual makes decisions
based on what is better for the community as a whole rather than what he
or she would personally prefer.

Closely related to the distinction between collectivistic and individualistic
cultures is the distinction between high-context and low-context cultures.
High-context cultures are so closely "tied together" that behavioral norms
are implicit; they are just understood and have been learned through
close observation. These customs and norms do not need to be talked
about or explained explicitly. High-context cultures can be challenging for
newcomers who feel they need explanation. For example, if you and your
friends have a routine of watching football every Sunday, saying, "I'll see
you guys this weekend for the game" implies that the "when" and "where"
of the game is so ingrained that it doesn't even need to be explicitly stated.
Variations from the norms are so rare that learning them is easy; there is
no confusion.

Low-context cultures have to be more explicit because individual
freedoms and wider diversity of behavioral norms make learning through
observations more difficult. Continuing the example from above, in these
cases you might be gathering with a new group of friends who need
explicit, low-context communication to know what is going on: "We'll meet
at Jay's house on Bleaker Street at 11:30 on Sunday morning."

High-context cultures are described as more

         ...relational, collectivist, intuitive, and contemplative. This
         means that people in these cultures emphasize interpersonal
         relationships. Developing trust is an important first step to any
         business transaction. . . . These cultures are collectivist, preferring
         group harmony and consensus to individual achievement. And
Exploring Public Speaking  338  Appendix A: Cultural Diveristy in
Version 4.2
                                Public Speaking

         people in these cultures are less governed by reason than by
         intuition or feelings. (Chaturvedi & Chaturvedi, 2013)

Unfortunately, due to cultural biases, this description may to some make
individuals from high-context cultures sound "less than" in some ways
compared to Western cultures, which are low-context cultures. This is
something we should be very careful about in addressing an audience
or developing relationships with those of other cultures. Low-context
cultures are often described as more rational, action-oriented, practical,
clear in their communication, efficient, precise, and factual. In contrast,
high-context cultures spend more time on interpersonal trust, are
less direct and straightforward, and may use more polite and flowery
language. These descriptions can be problematic. Let us be clear that these
descriptions are about generalized differences, but not about "better" or
"worse" and definitely not about every individual member of the culture. A
person from a high-context culture is perfectly capable of being rational,
action-oriented, practical, etc., and a person from a low-context culture
still values interpersonal trust and politeness.

Another way to distinguish cultural groups is how decisions are made and
the predominant communication modes. As mentioned in Chapters 1 and
3, public speaking--a logical, rational, straightforward, individualistic
mode of communication, where traditionally one person attempts to exert
influence over others through verbal means--is at the core of Western
communication history. Public speaking exists in the context of debate,
two opposing views being presented either for one side to "win" or for
the audience to choose a compromised, hybrid position. Other cultures
have traditionally taken a more narrative communication mode, with
storytelling being the way the important information is conveyed, more
indirectly. Others value group discussion and keeping the harmony of
the group, while others value almost exclusively the advice of elders in
decision making. They believe the past and those who have experienced
more of it have a wisdom all their own and are worthy of more respect.

In reference to cultural differences, we see the differences most obviously
in nonverbal communication. While we Westerners may think of these
nonverbal communication differences (such as the traditional Asian
practice of greeting with a bow instead of shaking hands) as simply quaint
or only superficial, they reveal deep difference in the world views of each
culture. It would be worth your time to look into (easily done on the
Internet) why Asians traditionally bow and Westerners shake hands. The
practices say a lot about our shared histories and our views of the past,
religion, and interpersonal trust. Likewise, it is not unusual for adult men
friends of the same age to walk hand-in-hand in some Middle Eastern
countries, but that is less common in the United States and has a totally
different interpretation. In the two places, the same practice means two
entirely different things.

Version 4.2
                                                                             Public Speaking

Nonverbal communication, which is what is most obvious and visible to us
when we experience a new culture, is divided into categories such as:

     Oculesics (eye behavior)
     Haptics (touch behavior)
     Proxemics (distance and space from others)
     Vocalics (voice characteristics)
     Chronemics (use of time in communication)
     Kinesics (use of the arms, legs, and posture)
     Olfactics (the meaning of smell in communication)
     Objectics (the use of objects to convey or interpret meaning)
Each of these has unique patterns in various cultures, and the differences
in nonverbal communication behavior are often not understood to
have deeper cultural meanings. Some cultures may avoid eye contact
out of respect; their high-context nature means direct confrontation is
discouraged. Westerners, however, tend to judge low eye contact rather
harshly, as either dishonesty, disinterest, or low self-esteem. Likewise,
Westerners value punctuality sometimes over relationships, although
the higher the status of the individual, the more tolerant we can be of
tardiness. The CEO of the company can be 15 minutes late for a meeting,
but the employees would be disciplined for such tardiness. Other cultures
simply do not understand the Western love affair with the hands on the
clock. People from the United States are sometimes seen by other cultures
as loud (vocalics), too direct and forward (oculesics), taking up too much
space (kinesics and proxemics), and uncomfortable with touch or close
spaces (haptics and proxemics).

Of course, most audiences of different cultural backgrounds may include
those for whom English is a second (or third or fourth) language. Humor
columnist Dave Barry ironically wrote, "Americans who travel abroad for
the first time are often shocked to discover that, despite all the progress
that has been made in the last 30 years, many foreign people still speak in
foreign languages" ("Dave Barry Quotes," 2013). Often second language
speakers' use of correct English is as good as or better than some native
speakers in the United States[^1], but there will be some areas of concern
here.

Watch out for metaphors, slang, and figurative language that simply
have no meaning to non-native speakers of English. Many American
expressions have to do with sports--everything from poker to football--
and have no significance to those who have not grown up around those
sports.[^2] Some of our expressions actually have a racist past, without
our knowing or recognizing it because we do not know the origin of the
phrase. When we say "bury the hatchet," "go on the warpath," "put you in
the paddy wagon," "let's hear from the peanut gallery," or "I was gipped,"
we are inadvertently referring to ethnic stereotypes as well as using
references those of non-U.S. cultures would not understand.

Implications

What does all this mean to you, a college student taking a public speaking
class? Well, as emerging technology makes communicating with people
around the world easier and more common, there is a good chance you
might find yourself communicating or interacting with persons from other
cultures in your future careers. The ten items that follow should help you
begin to navigate any such situations more effectively.

     Dealing with persons of other cultures may mean that the
       straightforward, supposedly "rational" approach expected from
       traditional public speaking may be too forceful for other cultures.
      More descriptive, more narrative, and more relational forms of
       communication may be of service. As mentioned in chapter 1, stories
      may be your most powerful form of communication, especially with
       audiences of diverse cultures. At the same time, choose your stories
       carefully (see the next bullet point below).

     Primarily, recognize the underlying values of the culture. The value
       and place of family stands out here. You would want to be sure to
       show respect to parents and grandparents in everything you say; if
      you cannot do that, do not mention them at all. Other values may
       have to do with how genders are treated, modesty in clothing, or
       criticism of the government.

     Do not jump to judge speakers of other cultures by Western
       standards. Time limits are a good example. While this book stresses
       speaking within time limits, a speaker from a high-context culture
      may not see strict time limits as a standard for speaking and may go
      "overtime" in our Western way of thinking.

     Know your audience. Know what they appreciate (positive) and what
      would concern them (negative).

     Approach humor very carefully. Humor is highly contextual, personal,
       and cultural. Test your humor on a group representative before the
      presentation.

     Show knowledge of their culture. If speaking to an audience made
      up predominantly of persons who speak a certain language, learning
       a greeting or phrase in that language is a way to gain rapport. You
       could also use appropriate holiday references. Two presidents
       known for their oratorical abilities used this technique. When John
      F. Kennedy spoke in Berlin in 1963, he famously said, "Ich bin ein
      Berliner." (Although many have claimed he was actually saying
       the equivalent of "I am a Danish pastry" instead of "I am a person
       from Berlin," that myth has been debunked.) Either way, it did
      not matter; the crowd appreciated it. Ronald Reagan did much the
Exploring Public Speaking  341  Appendix A: Cultural Diveristy in
Version 4.2
                                                                              Public Speaking

       same at the beginning of his historic "Tear Down This Wall" speech
       at the Brandenburg Gate in 1986. His accent was not great, but his
       grammar and message were clear.

     If the group is diverse, don't leave out or marginalize someone by
       assuming all share exactly the same values or practices.

     Never "tokenize" someone by drawing attention to his or her
       difference, at least not without asking permission.

     Use the term preferred by the group to refer to them. Not all persons
       of Latin American descent want to be called "Latino/a," according to
       the Pew Research Center (Lopez, 2013). In fact, more prefer Hispanic,
       which is the term used by the U.S. Census Bureau since the 1970.
       Recently the term "Latinx" was created to be gender neutral; however,
       some research has indicated that the term has not been widely
       accepted.

     Always seek for commonalities over differences.

Below we have included some references sent to us by a professor in
Zhuhai, People's Republic of China. He shared them with us in reference
to public speaking in Asian cultures. As the world becomes "smaller" and
we are confronted with diversity more and more every day, we should
continue to build our knowledge and skill in intercultural communication.

Part 1: How To Be a College Student

Author: Barbara G. Tucker, Professor of Communication, Dalton State
College

Many students who take a basic public speaking course are enrolled in
their first semester or year of college. For that reason, in this fourth edition
of Exploring Public Speaking, we include helpful material on making the
life transition to being a college student and thus a lifelong learner. Your
instructor may or may not assign you to read these appendices, but we
hope you will consider reading them even if not assigned.

The Journey

In some ways, going to college is like taking a journey. It will feel like a
different culture with a different language, customs, expectations, and
even values. Consider these appendices as a guidebook for the journey.

In choosing the metaphor of a journey for college, we are comparing them
on several factors.

    1. Like a journey, rather than a weekend trip, college is a long process.
        The journey takes time.

    2. A journey goes through different terrain. Sometimes you will feel like
        it's more uphill than downhill.

    3. A journey involves guides, people who have been there before and
        have wisdom about the way to get to the destination. These are your
        professors mostly, but also your academic advisors, peer mentors,
        administrators, older students, and staff in Enrollment Services and
        the Dean of Students' Office.

    4. A journey requires a map. This is, for the most part, the college
        catalog that tells you what courses are required to fulfill your major.
       Your advisor can also probably provide you with a "course plan,"
        which breaks down in order which classes you should try to take
        each semester.

    5. A journey has a destination. Here is where you might find that your
        values are different from your professors or mentors. Many college
        students see this destination as commencement day and getting a
        diploma in front of family and friends. That is only part of it. Your
        professors and mentors want you to be introduced to ideas, books,
        authors, and experiences that you will continue to engage with
        throughout life.

Your destination for now is probably the career you see yourself working
in five years or more from now. You probably chose a major or perhaps
Exploring Public Speaking  344  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

even the college based on that career destination. That is reasonable and
you were probably encouraged by your high school teachers, counselors,
spiritual advisors, and parents to do that.

Why College?

However...there are a few problems with approaching college with only a
career destination focus.

First, you are likely to change your mind. Most college students do at some
point. In fact, according to Gordon, Haubley, et al (2000), 50% - 70% of
students change their majors at least once, and most will change majors
at least 3 times before they graduate.

Second, you may have to change your mind about your major. Some
college majors are competitive, meaning a fraction of those who want to
get into them are accepted, based on grades and other factors.

Third, you might want to change majors as you are exposed to new ideas
and career fields you didn't even know about.

Fourth, the career you end up in may not even have been invented yet. In
2007, when the author's son started college as a communication major,
no one had heard of a social media director. That is what he does now.
Conversely, some of the hottest jobs now might not be so hot in five years.
Technology is changing, knowledge is expanding, politics alter realities,
and the population is getting generally older. These trends will affect the
kinds of jobs that are created (Anders, 2017).

Fifth, and more to my point, college is about becoming a better version of
you, not just getting a job. If you see the main point of college as coming
out with a career, you will miss some of the best parts of the journey. Or
even worse, if you feel that every class is just an obstacle to that career
rather than a stepping stone to being a more prepared individual for that
career, you will miss the value of each class. And let's face it; you are going
to take at least forty classes over the next four to six years. You want to
enjoy them, not just see most of them as roadblocks to getting out.

Now, don't get me wrong. I am not saying you should spend all this time,
effort, and money to get a piece of paper that doesn't take you to a career
path. But note, I say career path. It is highly unlikely you will not walk
off the platform after graduation and into the perfect job you will stay in
for decades. The reality of today's workplace is that you will have many
positions and perhaps many careers over your forty or fifty years of work
life, and college cannot prepare you specifically for all of them right now.

What college prepares you for is to be a lifelong learner who can adapt
yourself and your skills to the new jobs the marketplace will create or
will interest you in the future, and the new skills you will be expected
Exploring Public Speaking  345  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                               College Student

to have in your chosen career field. If you want to be a registered nurse
and graduate with a bachelor of science in nursing, that will just be the
beginning of your learning to be a competent, caring nurse.

You have probably heard it before, but the top skills employers want,
inappropriately called "soft skills," have more to do with personal
abilities. Team work, critical thinking, work ethic, spoken and written
communication, conflict resolution, and group facilitation are common
skills seen on lists of what employers want in new hires. (Go ahead and
do an Internet search for this subject, and you will see what I mean). The
soft skills, which are really not soft but the basis of your success, are
what you learn in college classes and college experiences outside of the
classroom. (The term "soft" does not refer to them being squishy but fluid
and transferable to different contexts. Professors in the liberal arts really
do not like the term "soft skils" by they way, because they sound "less than"
something important.)

In other words, college is not a vocational program that trains you for a
specific job. If that goal interests you, you should consider it, because
the workplace desperately needs skilled workers such as electricians,
plumbers, technicians, and the like. College is designed to help you attain
(not give you) a wide set of skills and knowledge so you can adapt, grow,
communicate, and learn no matter what field you pursue, as well as give
you more specific skills for certain positions.

Also, college will not be the end of your learning. You may want to attain
another credential or degree after graduating from college. You will
definitely be expected by your employers to be involved in for-credit and
not-for-credit continuing education. This is the just the beginning of the
learning journey. Yes, you have been learning since birth and in school
since you were four or five, but there is one difference now: you are
learning because you want to. Learning is now your choice.

So, every part of the college experience, even the hard parts, should be
seen as part of the journey. If you're hiking in the mountains, the view
from the top will be magnificent but you might sweat a lot, trip and get
scrapes, or tramp through some thorny bushes before you reach the
summit.

However, if you prepare for the journey and stay on the right path, many
of the problems can be avoided. That is the purpose of these appendices.

Preparation

Of course, much of your preparation for college came in your K-12 years.
You learned to read and write, solve equations, perhaps speak the basics
of a foreign language, and perform many other academic tasks. You also
probably learned about working with others, solving problems, and taking
Exploring Public Speaking  346  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

responsibility through musical groups, sports teams, clubs, and other
extracurricular activities. In some ways, college will be a continuation of
those years, but many students find that high school did not prepare them
for everything that college brings. There are many reasons for this lack of
preparation. The question is, "If you find yourself unprepared, what can
you do about it?" That is the subject of these appendices: Getting the big
picture of what college is about; understanding your friend, the instructor;
time management; appreciating how we learn and you learn individually;
studying, reading, and test-taking; and avoiding the plagiarism trap. We
will finish up with some resources on campus.

Part 1 of Appendix B will deal with the first two; the others will address the
remaining five.

Getting the Big Picture of College

The institution of the university has actually been around longer than
high schools or elementary schools. The first university was founded in
Morocco in 859 C.E., the University of Karueein. (A college is traditionally
considered a section of a university as well as an independent unit; today
"universities" usually refer to institutions with graduate programs.) Oxford
University in England came along in 1096. For that reason, centuries of
tradition still cling to the culture of colleges and universities. Traditions
change slowly, especially when they have been around over 1000 years!
Part of being a college student is to learn the physical and cultural terrain
of the college, much of which comes from traditions.

Colleges and universities are generally separated into public and private.
In most cases, public institutions are in a system of related colleges or
univesities in a state. The author's college, Dalton State, for example, is
a unit of the University System of Georgia, which means a number of
positive things for students. They have access to books in all the libraries
in the University System of Georgia, as well as other resources. Their
credits can transfer easily to other institutions in the University System of
Georgia, although we prefer for students to stay here and not transfer! To
a large extent, the curriculum (the nature and number of courses taken) is
determined by the University System of Georgia.

A college degree is either a two-year (associate of arts or science) or four-
year (bachelor of arts, bachelor of science, bachelor of fine arts, bachelor of
social work, bachelor of business administration, etc.). Associate's degrees
are usually limited to 60 required hours . A bachelor's degree is usually
limited to 120 hours. There are, of course, some exceptions to these
standards. Most colleges have a set of "have to" classes for every student;
these might include a "core" of general education courses (some required,
some elective)); and then required and elective courses for the student's
specific chosen major. Some programs are very closely proscribed (few
Exploring Public Speaking  347  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                              College Student

elective choices, usually health professions and education), and some give
the student more flexibility.

For example, at Dalton State, there are 42 hours of required "core" classes.
Although you have some options to choose from here, you still have to take
a certain set of classes. These 42 hours are divided into five areas called
A-E:

A: Essential Areas (English 1101, 1102, and a math course) B: Institutional
Options (for Dalton State, you take COMM 1110 and a one-hour academic
elective) C: Literature and Fine Arts D: Science and Math, including two
lab sciences E: Social Sciences (including required American Government
and U.S. History)

Then there is Area F, 18 hours, which will be different depending on your
major. In some majors you have choices in Area F; in some, for example,
everything is set by state or accreditation standards. Other coleges, public
and private, typically have similar breakdowns or requirements for "core"
classes. Then in the junior and senior year, the student takes 60 or more
hours of courses in the major and perhaps a minor.

Many students feel that some of their freshman year classes are repeats
of what they had in high school. Unless you took AP or dual enrollment
classes, your freshman year classes will be much more demanding than
those high school classes, even if some of the material is review.

How will they be more demanding? First, you don't get "do-overs" on tests.
It is common for some high schools to let students take tests over until
they are passed. A failure on a college exam is, well, a failure. You might
be able to bring the grade up on the next tests, but you will rarely get a
second try on that test. Second, you are expected to be self-regulating and
self-directed as a learner (see Part 2 on "Learning to Learn."). You are a
legal adult, so you are supposed to take responsibility as an adult for your
learning. Third, there will be much more material on any one test than
you probably had in high school, which is one of the things new college
students find daunting. Fourth, your instructor may primarily lecture
instead of having the class do activities, projects, or field trips, and the
classes may be 75 minutes of straight instruction, even lecture.

All that said, the curriculum of college is not something a bunch of people
in a room thought up last week. It is the result of those hundreds of years
of what has traditionally been considered important to a college education.
History--how did we get to where we are? Social sciences--how do we
relate to other people? Literature, language, and public speaking--what
are the best ideas and how do we communicate them? Sciences--how does
the physical world work? Math--what is the logic behind numbers? You
can argue about the value of any one of them, but years of tradition have
solidified that these are what an educated person needs to know about.
Exploring Public Speaking  348  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

The configurations of classes may differ from college to college, but the
basic concepts are the same.

Advising and Your Classes

The subject of the curriculum brings us to another matter that students
often do not understand about college. Each college or university system
is "autonomous." Each has its own curriculum and set of required classes
for a particular major or degree. Each college has the right to accept or
not accept courses for transfer from another institution. This may seem
unfair, but that is part of the tradition of higher education and not likely to
change anytime soon. If you transfer from a public to a private institution,
or vice versa, or to a college out of state, some of your credits may not be
accepted for transfer there.

Also, our academic advisors cannot advise you for another institution, only
for this one. If you plan on transferring, you are responsible to talk to the
other institution about requirements and what will transfer. Since you
don't want to take a class that will not count toward your final degree and
you don't want to lose time, credits, and money, be in contact with the
school you hope to attend later.

Speaking of advisors, they are your best resource for making educational
choices. At the same time, they want you to develop the ability to make
your own academic decisions, specifically by being able to read the catalog,
the course plan, Banner and Degreeworks (these last two are common
student record and degree auditing systems; your college may have a
different "brand" of this software). You can then see what classes you
need each semester and design your schedule. They are willing to help
you in the freshmen year or if you change your major, but after a while the
advisor (who might be a faculty member) will want you to take ownership
of this process, with their help and approval. Some things to keep in mind
about advising:

     As freshmen, almost all the courses you are required to take in the
       core are offered frequently, usually every semester and with many
       sections, so you will not have trouble finding those courses when you
       need them.

     As you become a junior and senior, the courses may only be offered
       once a year, at a time that is not convenient, and/or even every two
      years. You will have to plan accordingly.

     Learn to use the records system and degree auditing software; they
       are great tools. If you advisor doesn't mention it, ask about it.

Another very important point about advising: Financial aid questions
must be addressed to the financial aid office staff in Enrollment Services.
The professional and faculty advisors usually have no access to your
Exploring Public Speaking  349  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                College Student

financial aid information. Students often run into financial aid problems
for a number of reasons: dropping too many courses, failing to pass
enough courses, and taking courses that are not required in their program
are three major ones. Not completing the FAFSA on time is also a huge
obstacle to navigating the financial aid universe. The financial aid office
staff are the experts and you need to check your email, Banner, and your
postal mail for notices from them about deadlines and your awards from
financial aid.

Additionally, the college most likelyexpects payment before the semester
begins. In fact, if you do not pay your bill or make sure your financial
aid is in order a couple of weeks before the start of the semester, your
registration will be "purged" or removed--you will no longer have a class
schedule, even if you had registered very early. Dates are advertised on the
website and calendar. Obviously, you do not want this to happen, because
you have to begin all over again trying to get into classes, and by then they
might be closed to new registrations. This is why you should have a way or
plan to take care of the fees and tuition as soon as you register.

So, to recap, college is a new terrain, and the college experience is a
journey over that terrain. The terrain has a physical and cultural features.
The physical one is the actual campus, which for Dalton State involves
many buildings over more than 40 acres of land. The cultural one involves
the rules and regulations, the language, the values, and the persons
and personalities. In the next section we will talk about the people most
affecting you--the faculty--but first I'd like to address the values of higher
education.

Values

The first value is rigor. That means the learning tasks require effort from
students. You could say it means the courses are hard, but there is more
to it than that. It means the academic standards and expectations are
high. At Dalton State, we have a tradition of being a rigorous college. Our
students who transfer do very well historically at other colleges. Our health
professions students do very well on certification exams. To be honest,
we take pride in being rigorous and having high standards but also in
empowering the students to meet those standards through good teaching.
Teaching is what our faculty do, and it is our priority.

The second is diversity and inclusion. College will allow you, and
sometimes force you, to encounter people and ideas that you have not
before. Your instructors may be from other countries or parts of the U.S.,
as might be your classmates. You will have classmates who are twenty
or even thirty years older than you--or younger. Your instructors may
teach theories and concepts you personally disagree with. One thing that
students often find in college is that the old cliques and "drama" that
happened in high school simply don't apply in college. It's about the
Exploring Public Speaking  350  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

learning and the work, not social status, cliques, or in-groups. Everyone
belongs, no matter what they look like, as long as they do the work.

The third is civility, which can be thought of as "actively showing respect."
Not agreement, but respect for them as human beings and members of the
community and as persons who have a right to express their opinions with
civility as well.

The fourth value is equality and fairness. You might not always think it is
true in your experience, but higher education values access (availability
of learning to those willing to work hard), equality (not getting a grade for
any reason other than performance, and not giving or asking for special
treatment) and fairness (equal output for equal input). For that reason,
if you ask a professor for special favors, you are asking him or her to be
unfair to the rest of the class who did not get those favors.

Now, in case my emphasis on work is making you worry that there is
nothing fun going on at your college, let me stop here and say that it
offers a wide variety of programs for social interaction, relaxation, fun,
and developing relationships, spirituality, and leadership. The Dean of
Students' Office, the Health and Wellness programs, and the Athletic
Department are three websites you should check out right now just to
convince you college is not all hard work and there is plenty of activities to
get involved in here!

College Faculty

I have mentioned faculty several times in this section on values, and there
is a reason for that. The persons you will have the most contact with on
campus, other than students, are your faculty. You may spend several
hours a week with them. It is best if you start to think of them in positive
and constructive manners rather than as stern, rigid, distant authority
figures who have no connection to your lives. The following is from a
PowerPoint I created for a first-year seminar course taught in 2016 I called
"The Care and Feeding of College Faculty."

Forget all the things you have heard about college professors. You might
have been taught that college faculty: * Spend most of their times writing
books * Are introverted, weird, or eccentric (the absent-minded professor
stereotype) * Have inappropriate relationships with their students
(while this has happened in some colleges, it usually ends badly, as in
unemployment. ) * Don't work very hard (We might only be on campus
about 30 hours per week, but we work away from the office many more
hours.) * Are mean. Students have informed me that their high school
teachers told them that college professors were uncaring. Perhaps they
said that so that the students would not expect the professors to be easy;
perhaps those high school teachers did have bad experiences. I can say this
is not the case at Dalton State and probably not at your institution. You

                                                                                  College Student

will find your instructors to be warm, polite, helpful, and friendly--but
professional. Part of growing up is to learn to negotiate between those two.

These mistaken and questionable ideas often come from TV and movies
are questionable. However, college faculty do have specific characteristics.

     They LOVE their discipline. They live their discipline. They went to
       school for years to understand their discipline. They think it's the
      greatest thing ever. I teach communication and do not understand
      why the subject does not fascinate everyone. Consequently, don't
      blow off their subject. Don't say it's worthless or boring or of no value.
      How would you feel if someone did that to you?

     They like to question, so they seem skeptical. In pursuing graduate
      degrees necessary to be a college teacher, we are taught to question
      ideas and assumptions. Sometimes we say things in class for you to
      think about, even if we don't agree with it.

     We expect you to follow the syllabus and do the assignments. The
       syllabus in college means much more than the syllabus in high
       school; you should keep it in a prominent or accessible position in
      your notebook.

     They have different personalities. Some of us are extraverts and some
      are introverts. Some have quirky senses of humor and some have
      fairly quiet ones.

     They are in total charge of their classrooms. College instructors
      are not to be disturbed when teaching. Do not walk into a college
      instructor's class and interrupt in the middle of a session, unless the
      building is on fire or it's a matter of life or death.

     Higher education changes slowly, and so do faculty. Colleges were
      originally run entirely by the faculty; there was not really a separate
      administrative staff. Even today, many college academic policies
      cannot be changed without the approval of the faculty. For example,
      we cannot change federal financial aid policy, but we can change the
      curriculum in a major if we choose to do so.

     Professors at Dalton State are student-oriented. We chose to work
      here because it is a teaching institution, which means our main
      responsibility is to teach, advise, and serve students, as opposed to
      doing research. We do engage in research, but that is not our priority.

     They don't treat some students better because they like them.

     We have heavy workloads. We teach 3-5 classes per semester, with
      varying numbers of students--as few as ten, as many as 100 or
      more. We have to keep office hours, one or two a day, which does not
      include committee meetings (faculty participate in governance of the
Exploring Public Speaking  352  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

       college, and that takes time), advising students, preparing classes,
       grading, assessments, and required continuing education.

     We have families and lives, too.

     College faculty do not deal with parents. It is against federal law
       for a college instructor to talk to your parents about your status
       (that means grades) in their class. That law is called the Buckley
      Amendment and often referred to as FERPA because of its origin
       in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. If a parent calls
       and asks about a student-and it does happen occasionally-we just
       say we are not allowed to talk about a student's progress to parents
       or anyone else outside the College personnel. There is a way around
       this law; the student can sign a waiver of his or her privacy rights in
      Enrollment Services. But our first response will be to refer to FERPA.

     As adults, authority figures, and experts in their subject matters,
       faculty members expect respect. It is best to refer to him or her
       as "Professor" if you do not know if the instructor has earned a
       doctorate, and as "Dr." if you know they have (it will probably be on
       the syllabus). We work hard for the doctorate and it is professional
       courtesy to use it. Some will say it is all right to call them by their first
       name (very rare) or "Mr." or "Ms." but unless they do, you should
       default to "Professor." You should also learn your professor's name
       and office location on Day One. The instructors keep office hours
       mainly for students to come see them about class matters. You will
       not be bothering them.

Keeping all these characteristics in mind, here is a list of Don'ts that will
keep you in good shape with your professors. Don't...

     Ever ask them if anything important happened in class on a day you
       were absent. This is literally the Kiss of Death and you may get a very
       harsh or sarcastic answer, such as "No, since you were not there, we
       put our heads down and thought about your absence."

     Don't email them like text speak. Emails should start professionally,
      "Dear Professor," identify who you are and your class (the email
       address may not do that), and clearly give your question or concern.
      You should have a closing as well. Your relationship with your
       faculty member is a professional one and this is a good time to learn
       professional communication. Many professors simply will not answer
       an email like this:

         hey I missed class today can I get the notes from you or
         the power point? Bill

Yes, I have gotten emails like this from students.
Exploring Public Speaking  353  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                College Student

     Expect special treatment. Fairness to students is extremely important
       to us.

     Play with your electronic devices in class. I cannot stress this one
       enough. Each faculty member will have a policy on phones and
       laptops, and you must abide by it. Remember, we are in control of
       our classrooms. Faculty are also allowed to call public safety and have
       students escorted out of class if they are really disruptive or causing
       harm to other students and their learning.

     Think attendance doesn't matter. This is one of the biggest lies that
       is propagated about college life. Attendance in class does matter,
      very, very much. No, we won't call the county truant officer. However,
       many faculty take daily roll, and we have to keep some record of
       attendance for financial aid purposes. So, we are aware of your
       attendance, but more important, you will not do well by missing
       many classes, even in a class that is purely lecture and test-taking.
      Lots of research shows this.

     Be afraid to go to their offices and ask for help. It's one of the best
       things you can do if you are having academic concerns. If you do go
       to their office, however, don't overlook the office hours sign on the
       door (also on the syllabus). If the professor has informed the students
       that she is in from 1:00-3:00 on Thursday afternoon, don't expect her
       to be there at 4:30.

     Think your instructors are psychic. If you never ask questions in class,
       even if you have them, we are not mind readers. Please ask.

At the end of the semester you will be asked to evaluate your instructors
online. First, please comply. The data is important to the college's
operations. Second, answer thoughtfully. Third, don't blindside the
instructor. If you say "He never explained X clearly," did you ask about
X? Fourth, don't get ugly and personal; swearing or obscenity on the
evaluations isn't helping anyone. State your case about the instructor's
behavior, not that you didn't like her shoes. The evaluations are about the
learning experience in the class, not whether you think the class should be
in the curriculum.

Parting thoughts

While there are a lot more things I could say about the journey of being a
college student, some things you just have to experience. Not everything
will make sense at first. Remember, it's a long journey.

Expect your college life to have a cyclical nature. The first few weeks will
be exciting and daunting; you may feel like your head will explode with all
the newness. A few weeks in you might feel a little down. The newness has
worn off and man, oh, man, the work is piling up. By the eighth week, it
Exploring Public Speaking  354  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

will feel like everything came at once, but you do get a short break about
then. The stress and activity builds and builds until finals and whew, it's
time to sleep and binge watch shows on Netflix. You say, "I got to get a
better start next time" before it starts again in January.

I'm telling you this now because the key word I want to leave you with
is PROACTIVITY. Your college journey will be enjoyable and successful
to the extent that you are proactive. I learned this all-important word
from the best book on time management, The Seven Habits of Highly
Successful People by Stephen A. Covey. In a sense it means "planning" but
more than that. Because we cannot plan for everything, we plan margin
and solutions for what we know we cannot plan for. I cannot plan when
I will have a flat tire; I can plan to have the resources in my car to fix the
flat when that happens. I cannot plan the traffic between my home and the
campus, but I can plan to leave 10 minutes early every day to get a parking
space and miss the worst of the traffic.

Proactivity is about having a future-orientation that is executed in the
present. Paper planners, or electronic ones, can help. But you can write
down or type into your phone all the plans you want if you don't choose to
execute the plans. After a while, proactivity can become a habit and you
cease to even recognize it as such. For example, years ago I learned to put
my clothes out the night before a workday. My husband sets the coffee pot
up before going to bed. These are small things but they save loads of time
and more importantly, stress. Much of the stress we feel is self-inflicted
from poor planning.

It is common for textbooks on transitions for first-year students in college
to contain a chapter on time management. In place of a separate chapter
or appendix, we will include some online resources. Inventories, filling
out sample weekly calendar/schedules, and tips on time management are
very helpful, but they start with this attitude of proactivity and some of
the mental processes discussed in the Part 2, specifically self-efficacy and
locus of control. Now is the time in your life to realize that there are urgent
things and important things in your life, and those will change as you go
through various seasons.

Urgent means that for whatever reason the task must be done very, very
soon. Important means that it is central to your values and to your
reaching your goals. Urgent means the task or activity demands your
attention now; important tends to mean it will demand your attention
long-term. Some things are simply urgent, but not important; some are
important but not urgent; some are neither, and some are both. The
diagram on the next page is often used to show that comparison.

Many of you have family and work responsibilities. Being a student is
one of your many roles. This means balancing priorities; you have more
things in your life that are both urgent and important. For that reason,
Exploring Public Speaking  355  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                               College Student

using tools such as planners are a must for you. As a friend of mine says,
"Everything takes longer than it takes," so be realistic about trying to pack
too many activities into your day. For your health and good relationships,
you need to plan "margin" in your life, time in the day that is not packed to
the full. That time will probably be taken up by the urgent and semi-urgent
things that come up that you can't plan for or expect.

Here are some resources that can help you with time management:

Resource 2

Resource 3

Resource 4

In conclusion, time management is more about self-management than the
clock. You can't really manage time--it keeps going forward, no matter
what we do. You can only manage your own goals and behaviors, and
college life will bring the importance of that home to you.

Part 2: Learning to Learn

Author: Barbara G. Tucker, Professor of Communication, Dalton State
College

        "Remember, in business and in life - success is earned from
         learning how to do things that you don't like doing." (Llopis, 2012)

One of the most important things that you will learn in college is how
to learn. Why does that matter? Because learning will be one of our
jobs in the future. No matter what profession you eventually enter after
your formal education--social work, nursing, accounting, social media
director, elementary school teacher, business manager, respiratory
therapist, banker, or one of many others--you will continue learning new
procedures, new policies, new techniques, new ways of thinking. Your
employers will expect you to attend training. You may decide to change
careers completely or slightly and have to learn new skills. Software and
technology change constantly. Many of you will eventually want to earn a
graduate degree.

Psychologist Herbert Gerjuoy said many years ago, "Tomorrow's
illiterate will not be the man who can't read; he will be the man
who has not learned how to learn." This quotation has often been
attributed to the futurist Alvin Toffler, who used it in his book Future
Shock from the 1970s. These men's words were prophetic, although they
could not have foreseen all of today's technology.

Of course, not every learning task will be the same as the type you do in
college. However, the truth remains that you are only beginning to learn
as an adult, and this is the time in our life where you can focus on learning,
on understanding the process, on how you best learn, and how you can
expand your repertoire to learn better.

There are many theories about how we learn. While in some cases they
contradict, for the most part they complement and supplement each other
because they concern themselves with different aspects of the learning
process, either the physiological effects of learning on the brain and body,
the social aspects, or the personal and psychological effects.

Thanks to magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), other medical science, and
the growing field of neuroscience, we know much more today about how
we learn. We know that learning creates a physical change in the brain
as synapses grow. We know that this happens not by passive reception
or exposure to information but by our effort. We know that memories
are formed by passing from a short-term category to long-term through
rehearsal, usage, and other efforts.

We understand how attention works and that distractions inhibit learning
rather than helping it. While you think listening to music may help you
Exploring Public Speaking  357  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                College Student

study, it probably is not, and your open laptop in class is distracting the
students behind you. In fact, the idea of multitasking is a myth. You may
think you can do several things at a time, but you are actually cutting
the efficiency and quality of the work you are doing. In other words, you
might get some things done when you multitask, but you won't do them as
quickly or as completely or as well.

We understand now that intelligence is malleable (change-able, flexible)
and that a person with a fixed mindset about learning (those who say they
are just born to be good at a skill like math, music, or writing) will face
frustrations and obstacles in comparison with those who have a growth
mindset. A growth mindset sees one's failures in a learning task as ways
to find new methods for learning, not as a stopping off point in learning.
Also, to the advantage of all college students who sometimes feel like their
heads are going to explode, we know that learning is not a zero sum game.
Learning one thing does not mean it has to displace something else. Your
brain is an organ that is developing new and more intricate connections; it
is not a box that will only hold so much. We also know there are different
kinds of knowledge and different kinds of intelligence, and we know there
is a distinct difference in learning and processing between novices and
experts.

We also know that some of the common ideas about learning do not have
much evidence. One of them is learning styles. You have probably taken a
test that classified you as a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner. While
there is nothing wrong with being classified in such a way, there is no
evidence from scientific studies that you will learn better if your instructor
teaches to your learning style. Unfortunately, I have heard many students
over the years attribute their failure in a class to the professor who didn't
teach to their learning style. What the students did not understand is that
we learn through all styles (visual, print, hearing, and activity) depending
on the demands of the learning tasks.

You did not learn to drive a car simply by reading about it or looking at
videos (print, visual). You had to drive around in a car and listen to the
instructor (kinesthetic and auditory learning). Think about learning how
to ride a bicycle--same scenario. On the other hand, learning to speak
a foreign language requires auditory and visual input, not just one, and
is enhanced by movement. It would be better for you to use all four
modalities than to pigeonhole yourself and limit your learning to a certain
modality. As Steiner and Foote (2017) stated,

         Like other labels, learning style labels may contain a grain of
         truth. A student who prefers to learn auditorily may find studying
         more productive when her notes are spoken aloud into a recording
         device and revisited later. But she may also find that when
         studying for a geometry test, drawing diagrams (visual) and
Exploring Public Speaking  358  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

         physically manipulating shapes on paper (kinesthetic) work best
         for her.

In fact, it's just as important what you do with the information after it is
accessed (enters your mind) than how it gets in there! As a college student
and developing adult learner, you will want to be aware of what learning
tasks require, especially what they require of you in terms of effort,
attention, and time. You will want to notice what you are doing when you
learn and even when you do not learn as you hoped to. You will want to
think about and talk about how you learn best because using language
is part of the effort behind creating those synaptic connections. These
behaviors are called metacognition, or "thinking about thinking."

This need for metacognition is why your professors will often ask you to
turn to your partner and discuss some of the lecture material, such as
what was unclear- "the muddiest point"--or to compare notes you have
taken. It is why your instructor might have you look at the questions you
got wrong on that midterm exam and figure out why you got them wrong--
what processes did you go through to get that answer, and where, perhaps,
did you get off track. It is why your professor might give you a pre-test at
the beginning of the course to see what your pre-conceptions about the
material are.

Of course, learning is not just about adding knowledge but also reshaping
your understanding and approaches. For an example, I'll use public
speaking. Students come into the class with ideas about public speaking
that they have to "unlearn." One is that they cannot do it, because of bad
past experiences or fear. Another is that all they have to do to be a good
speaker is be funny, even silly. Another might be that public speaking
is not an important skill, or that public speaking is just reading to an
audience. As another example, science instructors often see that their
beginning students have faulty ideas about science as a field of knowledge
as well as about specific scientific facts. Their goal is not just to fill
the students' minds with scientific facts but to think like scientists, to
understand what the scientific process involves and to apply that process
in new ways.

All this is to say that one of the things you will hear over and over again,
and one of the things that is a major difference between high school and
college, is "time on task." College learning, because it is "higher" in terms
of the thought processes your professors want you to engage in, takes time.
You cannot jot off a ten-page paper in a couple of hours. You cannot study
for a midterm for an hour the night before. Well, you can try, but how
successful you will be, in terms of really learning and earning good grades,
is up for grabs.

Six theories of learning I would like to present here that will be of value to
you as a student are Bloom's/Krathwohl's/Anderson's taxonomy, Albert
Exploring Public Speaking  359  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                College Student

Bandura's self-efficacy, self-directed and self-regulated learning, the
usefulness of mindset, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, and
Kolb's experiential learning cycle. What matters with each is that learning
is effort. While learning can be enjoyable, the old "learning is fun" adage
gives the idea that it is easy and that it shouldn't require much effort. It
learning does take effort, the erroneous thinking goes, then something
must be wrong. On the contrary, learning is hard work.

Recently I signed up for an online course with an organization that
credentials online courses. The organization's purpose is to help
instructors create excellent courses and to train college personnel in
applying excellent standards to the course. I have taught online for almost
twenty years but wanted to learn this organization's system. It proved to
be more challenging than I planned.

Because I had many years of experience in teaching online and reading
about how to do it and design classes, I found I had to put aside some of
my attitudes and ideas because of the philosophy and approach of this
organization's system. I had to "unlearn" some of my former ways of
thinking about online teaching and course design. To "unlearn" doesn't
mean to forget, since memory is not something we can just erase like
deleting a file from a computer. Due to my willingness to do that, I walked
away with a deeper understanding of good online course design. I was also
able (and this is another aspect of college learning) to transfer or apply
that knowledge to my traditional classroom teaching.

What is one of the things I "unlearned?" I like to put lots of extra resources
in my online class, as in "when you get a chance, this is something
interesting to read." I "unlearned" that that was a good idea. It just
confuses the students, and unless it directly meets a learning objective or
outcome, it does not belong with all the other materials. What I might do
in a regular classroom doesn't translate to online, not in all cases. That was
a hard lesson for me because of my personality--I like to give students lots
of choices! But it was a good one to learn.

In that personal learning situation I see each one of the six theories
mentioned above. I see that I had to go up the taxonomy, and I had to
be stretched into a new zone. I had to believe that my failure on the first
assignments (yes, I failed them!) was not because I couldn't learn but that
I had to--and could--find new strategies. I also had to regulate my time
and work on the class when I was mentally prepared, and I had to reflect
on my experience to learn. Let's talk about each one in more detail.

Bloom's taxonomy was created in the 1960s to help teachers recognize that
all learning was not the same and happened in an upward movement. This
is a typical reproduction (source: Wikimedia.commons) of the original
"taxonomy," which means "a scheme of classifications." In this case, it is
classifying learning tasks.
Exploring Public Speaking  360  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

Later, in 2001, the model was updated to use verbs rather than nouns
and emphasize the activity of learning. (Also from Wikimedia.commons)
This configuration turns the triangle (or rhombus) upside down but other
versions keep it like the one above.

The important thing for you to get from this is that your instructors
will have some learning tasks at the bottom--remembering facts or
concepts, such as being able to recreate lists of information on a test, and
understanding, such as being able to define the concepts in your own
words . However, in higher education we move higher up the taxonomy.
You will be asked to apply the learning, and then do new things with it.
You will also be asked to learn a greater volume of information for tests, in
most cases, than what you have been used to in high school.

So in a history class, obviously you will have to remember dates. Then
you will have to be able to explain or define an historical concept such
as Manifest Destiny. Then you will be asked to apply, such as "Did the
Exploring Public Speaking  361  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                 College Student

concept of Manifest Destiny influence a president's behavior?" In this case
the instructor may have never addressed that question specifically in class;
you are supposed to take the concept and compare it to what the president
did and said. Those are the lower levels, and it is possible that those will be
your major learning tasks in your first year or so of classes, although not
entirely.

However, as you progress, you will be asked to:

     Analyze (taking apart, contrasting and comparing parts): "What are
       the beliefs behind Manifest Destiny and where did they come from?"

     Evaluate: Assess how a concept or practice stands up to other criteria,
       standards, or philosophies: "Does Manifest Destiny violate the U.S.
       Constitution in spirit or in letter?"

     Create: Develop a new thesis from the materials you have learned.
This is not to say you will be asked to do all six levels of the taxonomy
in anyone class; in fact, that is unlikely. But I introduce this for you to
understand what your instructors are trying to do. If you come into class
with the pre-conception that you will be learning lots of facts and taking
tests on them, that is only partly true. You will be expected to operate
more at the applying, analyzing, and evaluating levels.

The second theory we will examine is that of Mindset. This theory
is based on the work of Carol Dweck, a psychologist from Stanford
University in California, and it has encouraged a great deal of research on
learning. It is simple, "elegant" as some say, but also has a number of parts
and offshoots.

Learning is work, sometimes hard work. You do not learn a task primarily
because you are inherently good at that task; you learn it because you work
hard in the right way. Learning researcher Angela Duckworth shows that
experts--the really skilled--spend an average of 10,000 hours becoming
that skilled person. For example, concert musicians and professional
athletes do not approach their tasks as "I am just talented at this" and let it
slide. They constantly practice and keep working on skills.

A person with a fixed mindset does not realize this and thinks that ability
in a skill and the ability to learn that skill are inborn; you either have it
or you don't. They take failure badly and take success almost as badly. "I
succeeded because I am just talented" and "I failed because I'll never be
any good at this." They might not try new things but prefer to stay safe at
the things they are "good at." They may get too much self-worth from what
they think is inborn ability or from other people's comments about "how
intelligent Dylan is" or "how gifted Jamie is."

A person with a growth mindset sees learning as possible and due to hard
work. They will try new methods to learn because they don't see having
the skill as either "born with it or not." Also, a person can change their
mindset; it would be against the theory to say someone could not change!

Version 4.2
                                College Student

Thankfully those who are trained to recognize how their fixed mindsets
are affecting them can change to a growth mindset. Finally, children (and
adults) should probably not be praised for being "smart" or "gifted" but
instead for "working hard," "finding new ways to do things, " and having
perseverance or endurance. (From https://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/
about/)

Closely tied to the idea of mindset is self-efficacy, which is "one's belief
in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task"
(Bandura, 1977). Self-efficacy is not just self-confidence, but is related
to beliefs regarding specific tasks. Self-efficacy is tied to success in many
endeavors, and to resilience and locus of control, which are also a large
part of mindset. A person who believes that ability and talent are just
natural and all that matters in success--absent from hard work and
using the right techniques, practice, etc.--lacks self-efficacy. The mindset
approach can help college students because they will be faced with daily
events that can attack their self-worth and lead to dropping out, when
what they often need is to find other ways to approach learning.

For example, let's say that on your first Biology 1107 test you earn a 56.
You say, "This is not me! I don't get 56s on exams! What is going on?" You
now have a choice. You can study exactly the same way for the next exam,
maybe just using more of it or spending longer hours at it. That might
work, and it might not. You can blame the instructor's teaching methods.
That is not going to help, because then your only option is to drop the class,
something you do not want to do because it will become a pattern.
You can say, "I told you so; I stink at science, so I need to drop the class
and change my major so I don't have to take biology." Again, not a pattern
you want to establish. You can do nothing and hope for the best (not a
good option either).

Or you can:

    1. Examine your behavior in the class up to now. This is part of a
        process called reflection. Have you attended all your classes (that
        old myth that you don't need to go to class in college rears its head
        again!) Have you read the material in the textbook outside of class?
        Did you come to class alert, having slept and eaten well? Did you
        look at your notes after class or go over them everyday, accumulating
        knowledge, or did you just wait until the night before the exam? All
        of these are standard things that college students are told to do, and
        it's not because college professors want to control your life. THEY
        WORK.

    2. Go talk to the professor during posted office hours (and don't expect
        them to be there at other times) to ask for help and some ideas for
        succeeding in the class.

    3. Attend the tutoring services offered by the Dean of Students' Office.
Exploring Public Speaking  363  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                 College Student

    4. If your instructor offers outside of class sessions, take advantage of
        them.

The process of reflection is vital to college learning. You start by reflecting
on what led up to the experience, as well as how you felt about the low
grade and even the experience of taking the exam. What was on the test
that you didn't expect? Did you study word-for-word definitions but the
test asked you for applications? Did you memorize lists but it asked you to
put concept in your own words? Was there a whole section of the textbook
that you just skipped?

After reflecting, you have to make a plan for the next time and take action.
It may be that your problem was not the amount of time you spent, but
when you spent it and what you did during the time. For the purpose of
learning and memory formation, repetition (going over the accumulated
class notes every day or several days a week) would be better than what we
call "cramming." Spending ten minutes a day for 21 days (three and half
hours) will be more useful than cramming for five hours the night before,
which is time you might not have that night anyway. You do have ten
minutes every day.

You make a plan, you commit to it, you act upon it, and then you
experience it again. Is there a difference? More than likely, yes. You might
not get a 98 on the exam, but you should be able to approach the exam in a
more organized and in control fashion. And you will have a clearer idea of
how you can learn.

I have just described another theory of learning, one that I particularly like,
Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, pictured below.
Exploring Public Speaking  364  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

As the image shows, this model involves four steps that are cycled
through: Experience, Reflection, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active
Experimentation. The key part is the reflection. Many people like to say
"we learn by experience" but we don't necessarily. We learn by reflecting on
experience and doing something with it. In the model, don't let the word
"Abstract Conceptualization" confuse you. It means, in this case, making a
plan for what will work next time.

Reflection is something we all approach differently. Some of us talk to
reflect (even to ourselves out loud), some write (I am a writer, but I reflect
a lot when I walk my dog every evening), and some just mull it over in our
minds when nothing else is holding our attention There is no right way
to do it, but there are some questions you should ask yourself, or some
territory you should cover in reflection. In order for reflection to be useful,
you should focus on what really happened in the experience as well as
how you felt about it. You should turn the experience around and see
it from other points of view. You should ask, "Is the way I feel about
it, am evaluating it, valid, or am I just seeing one side of it?" You can
question, why and how did it happened? These are only a few questions
that you can use in reflecting. Here is a diagram of questions you can ask
about a lecture, film, or speaker.

What I mean for you to take from this is that reflection is useful for you as
a self-regulated and self-directed learner (discussed below).

Now, a few words here. First, notice that as I was discussing strategies to
improve exam grades, I didn't say "get a study buddy." Study buddies or
study groups are great . . . IF. What are the ifs?

     You know that the person is a good student. While you might think
       that student in your history class is cute and you want to get to
       know them, don't hide asking the other student out on a date behind
       studying. He or she may have gotten a 48 on the exam! By a good
       student I don't just mean someone with a high grade, however. This
      person needs to have good learning habits, take good notes, be willing
       to engage in asking questions, and generally be cooperative.
Exploring Public Speaking  365  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                    College Student

     If you don't commit to serious study and to trying new approaches,
       such as the ones listed above. Research shows mixed results on study
       groups because students use it without changing other behaviors,
       that is, they still don't read the textbook or go over accumulated notes
       every day.

     You have to realize this is a study session, not a tutoring session. You
       have to bring an equal part to the session. If it's just "I want to look at
      your notes because I take bad ones," or "I want you to explain this to
       me," you are just using the other person and not helping them.

     You need to study in a good setting, for example, one that is free of
       distractions, and come prepared (laptop, textbook, paper, etc.)

     You need a plan. It can't just be, "Well, here we are. What now?" You
       can first be sure all your sets of notes are complete, and then you can
       quiz each other, or think up possible questions that will be on the
       test. Research shows that students who can come up with their own
       questions and "self-quiz" do better on tests. Plan to take breaks--we
       really don't study well in two-hour sessions. The breaks should just
       be for bathroom and a drink of water and stretching legs, not as long
       as the session itself!

A second note. Up to this point I have not used the two most important
words about learning in college. Those words are "self-directed" and "self-
regulated." Self-directed learning is learning you choose to do, that you
are invested in and that you direct. The fact that you are in college should
say that you are self-directed, because college is not legally required--we
choose to go. Now, I realize that some people go to college for reasons
other than choice (that is, someone told them they had to in order to get
some kind of reward or avoid some sort of punishment), and those people
usually are unsuccessful. I have heard of students who enrolled in college
because their parents said, "You either go to work at manual labor, go
in the military, or go to college," and college sounded like the best of the
three. That type of student is rarely self-directed.

Self-directed also means that you choose the method of learning and you
decide when you have learned it. In this case, college cannot be totally self-
directed because, unfortunately, the college expects you to learn a certain
amount and show that you have learned in order to get a degree. You
have to get certain grades and take certain courses to even stay in school.
However, you can still be self-directed by choosing the hours that you take
the classes, the professors, the number of hours of classes you take each
semester, and the subject matter of the courses.

The point is that your instructors expect a large amount of self-direction
from you, because you are an adult now and not required by law to be in
their classes. Granted, you may only be in that biology class because two
Exploring Public Speaking  366  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

lab science classes are required for your major, but in general you have
chosen to be there.

I make this point because it relates to an aspect of self-efficacy called
"locus of control." We do better at tasks, generally, when we have an
internal locus of control rather than an external one. In other words,
if I am the one making the choices in my life and I recognize that, my
viewpoint on learning and success will be quite different than if I think I
am just being bossed around by external forces, and therefore a victim.
Locus of control means I take responsibility for my life rather than
blaming others. If I get a ticket for going 15 miles per hour too fast in a 35
mph zone, I might blame the fact that the police officer was "out for me."
That's external locus of control. If I own up to the fact it was my foot was
the gas and I was going 50, that's internal locus of control.

On the other hand, self-regulated learning is more about the actual
behaviors you engage in as a learner. The concept of metacognition
that we mentioned earlier is key here. A self-regulated learner reflects
and recognizes what he or she is doing as a learner and seeks to find
approaches that will make him or her more successful (and that includes
being more economical in use of time and resources). A self-regulated
learner is like an athlete who pays attention to her body and outcomes and
what they are telling her about her athletic performance.

With all this talk of self-efficacy, self-regulation, and self-direction, it may
sound like I am saying that learning is a very individualistic, "lone wolf"
kind of phenomenon. That is not what I want to communicate, only that
ultimately it does boil down, especially in college, to your own choices and
work. However, one of the best parts of college (and one of the downsides
of online classes) is that learning is social. Although Bandura originated
the self-efficacy concept, it is rooted in his social learning theory, which
states that an individual's actions and reactions are influenced by the
actions that individual has observed in others. So, if we have self-efficacy
(also called personal efficacy) it's not because it just sprang from nowhere
or we figured it out on our own somehow magically. It came largely as
a result of accumulated social interactions and observations over the
lifespan.

The good news is, though, that even reading this textbook is a social
situation for learning, as are the classes you are enrolled in this semester--
especially the public speaking class! College allows you to learn in the
best of situations--you can learn from others, directed and regulated by
yourself.

Of course, one of those people in the situation is the class instructor, and
this brings us to the last of the theories. Go back to the beginning of this
appendix and read the quotation that starts it, from Forbes Magazine
online. (Forbes is a leading business magazine.) Mr. Llopis has put in
Exploring Public Speaking  367  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                 College Student

his own words the essence of Vygotsky's theory called "Zone of Proximal
Development," which sounds like something from science fiction but is
really quite simple and useful.

Vygotsky claimed that we learn only when we are given new tasks that
are just outside our ability to do them. If we are given tasks to do that are
within our ability, what's there to learn? Only when we have to stretch
outside the "zone" do we learn. Just like an athlete who will try to beat
his last time or distance, we have to be asked to do something we cannot
do right now in order to learn it. The qualifier is that it cannot be too far
outside of the "zone of proximal development," because the learner will
fail and not really be able to figure out why. Ideally, learning tasks must be
staged as a series of challenges just outside what you can currently do.

Public speaking instructors do this by making your series of speech
assignments longer and more complicated. Your first speech will be short
and probably personal; your last speech will be much longer and involve
higher-order thinking such as found on the Bloom's taxonomy. Your
history instructor in First Year U.S. History will probably not assign you to
write a twenty-page paper. If you are a history major and take the seminar
course before you graduate, you will by that time have the skills to write a
forty-page, in-depth paper with scholarly sources.

It is your instructors' and professors' jobs to structure the classes this way.
It may feel like the challenge is too far outside your "zone." Sometimes, it
is; that doesn't mean you are incapable of the challenge, only that there
are some steps in between that you need to do first. In that case, you might
need to visit the tutoring center on campus and meet with the professor for
extra help.

In my many years of teaching, I have found that sometimes a short
conversation with the faculty member clears up a lot of matters. A
student might just misunderstand what is being asked of him or her and
consequently construe it into a much more difficult task than it is. At other
times a tutor or tutorial videos can fill in the gaps. This is often true with
math or science concepts that are not that difficult but were missed in your
high school education for some reason. The key is not to give up when
the task seems right outside your reach. Your mental "arm" is longer than
you think. Although we really can't make our arm longer, we can build
synapses in our minds that connect neurons and lead to learning.

This part of the appendix has attempted to explain and inspire. By
understanding what really goes on in the learning involved in "higher
education," you will have more tools to reflect on and regulate your
learning. I have emphasized that learning is hard work and should be.
That does not mean college is all drudgery. You have a unique opportunity
to get to know really smart and interesting people in your classes who also
want to learn, and in many cases they will be going into the same fields you
Exploring Public Speaking  368  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

are, so you have built-in networking colleagues. College is about gaining
what is called "social capital" (networks of friends and relationships that
you can draw upon later in life) as well as intellectual capital. Instead of
coming into class, hiding in the back of the room, burying yourself behind
your cell phone until the instructor starts class, turn to someone and say,
"Hello. My name is...What did you think about...?"

Part 3: Reading Your Textbooks and Other

Resources

Communication, Dalton State College

College Reading

Many people do not realize that we read at different rates for different
purposes. For instance, if we are looking for an answer to a question, we
scan very quickly through the material to find the answer, and once the
answer is found, we move on to something else. When we are reading a
magazine for pleasure, we most likely read it quickly, skimming through
the material and slowing down in sections that are especially interesting to
us. We are reading for understanding, but we do not intend to memorize
the material for a later date.

In college reading, we have to read slowly with an intent to remember what
we have read because we know we will be tested on the material in the
future. The most popular method of college reading uses a system known
as SQ3R - Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review. This system has been
used since WWII when it was created by Francis Pleasant Robinson from
Ohio State University and is the most popular method for study reading
used today.

The Survey step of SQ3R is be used to familiarize yourself with a new book
or just a chapter of a book, depending on your goal. If you are looking at
an entire book, you want to review the table of contents to see what the
chapters are about. Many texts have two tables of content, one is general
and short, and the other is detailed. The detailed one will give you the best
overview of the text.

Next, look to see what else the book has to offer. Does it have an index? A
glossary? Appendices of supplemental information? Self-tests throughout
the chapters or at the end of each chapter? Lists of important terminology
for each chapter? Terms defined in the margins? Terms defined in a single
glossary or after each chapter? Boldface printed terms within the chapters?
An introduction to each chapter? Objectives for each chapter? A summary
or outline at the end of each chapter? Knowing what your text has to offer
Exploring Public Speaking  369  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                College Student

can help you devise a study plan for your reading that will be effective
as well as giving you an idea as to what the text and the course will cover.
Having this information allows you to start reading with background
information which improves your concentration and focus, and your
comprehension of the material.

When you use the Survey step of SQ3R to survey a single chapter, you
want to look for and skim the chapter's objectives and introduction. Then
focus on the words in boldface print that divide the chapter into sections
and emphasize the terminology. Browse the pictures, graphs, and charts
and read their captions to see what examples are given of the information
being presented. Look for a summary of the chapter at its end.

Once you have skimmed over for all these aspects, you will have created
background information so that when you begin reading, you are not going
into it cold, and you have improved your ability to focus and concentrate
on the reading as well as comprehend it. This entire step should only take
about ten minutes because you are skimming through the material to
familiarize yourself with its contents.

Once you have finished the "S" and surveyed the chapter, you want to
create questions related to the information that you can answer after
reading. Basically, you want to be able to identify the main points the
author is trying to get across to you. A simple way to do this is to take the
boldface printed subtopics and turn them into questions. For instance,
in chapter one of this text, the first section on page eight is already in a
question format for you. You just have to read to find out what public
speaking is. The second section on page nine is not in question format,
but you can form a question out of it, such as "Why does public speaking
produce anxiety?" Once you have the question, you can read to find the
answer which will give you the important information in the section.

The third step of SQ3R is the Read step which goes hand-in-hand with the
question step, and as you will see shortly, with the Recite step. Your goal in
the Read step is to read actively and answer each of the questions you have
formulated from the section headings. Pause after each section and ask
yourself, "What have I just read and does it answer my question?" If you
find you have understood the section, go back and highlight the key words
and phrases that answer your question.

When you pause and highlight, you are in effect, reciting the information
and entering the Recite step of SQ3R. Since repetition is the key to
remembering what you have read, this step is very effective. To further
your comprehension and memory of the information, summarize it in the
margin of your book. If you find you do not understand or cannot recite
what you have read, you will have to refocus and reread. Perhaps you
became distracted as you were reading or started daydreaming or maybe
the material is so foreign to you that you must reread it to comprehend
Exploring Public Speaking  370  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

it. Whatever the reason, it is important that you understand the section
before moving on to the next section. This Recite step, coupled with
repetition, is important if you want to build neural pathways to keep the
information in your brain.

The last step of SQ3R, Review, is completed after you have read and
highlighted the chapter in its entirety. This step can be done in different
ways depending on your learning style. If you are an auditory learner, you
will want to read over your high-lighted information aloud because your
hearing ability is your strongest learning sense. If you are a visual, tactile,
or kinesthetic learner, you will want to write out (tactile, kinesthetic)
the information on paper to reread (visual). Maria Montessori, who
created the Montessori schools, stated, "The hands are the instruments of
man's intelligence." In essence, she believed that the hands were directly
connected to the brain, so writing out the highlighted information is
particularly effective to use for further review. You could write out the
information and then study it aloud, too. This would incorporate all of
your senses and bombard your brain with the information, making it more
memorable.

The Review step must be repeated at periodic intervals because only
through repetition will you build neural pathways for the information that
will allow you to remember all that you have read and studied. Once you
have achieved comprehension of the material, repetition and review are
necessary if you want to be able to pass a test on what you have read. SQ3R
promotes meaningful reading and test preparation which results in higher
course grades.

Concentration

Concentration is essential when reading college textbooks and studying for
exams. Poor concentration is more the result of a lack of internal direction
than it is the result of external direction. You must have a positive attitude
and be prepared to be actively involved with the materials you are reading
and/or studying. Self-testing or reciting as in the recite step of SQ3R is
crucial.

When trying to improve your concentration, keep the following in mind:

     The greater your interest in a subject, and the stronger your purpose
       or motivation in reading, the deeper your concentration will be. Many
       times the preview step in the SQ3R system can perk your interest in a
       subject or help motivate you to learn more.

     The ability to concentrate must be acquired. It takes effort and
      practice. You want to read and study with an intent to understand
       and recall.
Exploring Public Speaking  371  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                               College Student

     Make sure you are working in a proper environment. Have good
       lighting, a suitable noise level with minimal distractions (put your
       phone away), plenty of air, and comfortable clothes and seating. Only
      you can drive away distractions. If you have something pressing on
      your mind that you need to take of first, do so, so you can concentrate
       on the work at hand.

     Have a well-defined purpose in reading. Think--why am I reading
       this?

     Do not try to concentrate when you are very tired. You will be wasting
      your time and become discouraged when you can't recall what you
       have just read or studied.

     Find the time of day when your mind is most active and receptive to
       do your serious reading and studying. Reading at the same time in
       the same place every day will help you to form a reading and studying
       habit that will increase your powers of concentration.

     It helps to take a "thinking break" after each paragraph or chapter
       subheading. In SQ3R, this is when you recite the main points of what
      you have been reading. If you can't recite the main points, perhaps
      you were not concentrating.

Again, reading a college textbook is a different process than thumbing
through a magazine or reading your favorite novel. Using the SQ3R
method and seeking to improve your concentration will make the time
spent in reading your textbooks more worthwhile.

Part 4: Effective Memorization

Author: Ms. Cathy Hunsicker, Emeritus Associate Professor of
Communication, Dalton State College

Effective Memorization

Many students tend to be able to recognize information, but not recall
information. They frequently think that when they cannot recall a correct
answer that they have forgotten it, when in reality, they never really knew
the information, they could only recognize it. Recognition occurs when
you are able to arrive at a correct answer after you have been given a
number of answers to choose from, such as in a multiple choice test. Recall
involves remembering information without any choices or cues; that is,
without the aid of recognition. Essay questions and even short-answer
questions put an emphasis on this skill.

Thus, do not study just to recognize information; study to recall
information. In addition, you should always ask your instructor what
kind of test you will be taking. Is it objective, meaning multiple choice,
Exploring Public Speaking  372  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

matching and true/false, or is it subjective, meaning short answer and
essay. Knowing what the test will entail will aid you in studying the
information correctly.

General Principles:

Intend to remember. Tell yourself you will recall this information because
you want to remember it.

Learn from the general to the specific. In essence, build a framework or
create context first. Superior, Erie, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario mean
nothing if you don't identify them as the Great Lakes first.

Make the information meaningful by creating associations. Create a
concept map of the main points and supporting details of what you have
read or are trying to remember. Concept maps show the relationships
between ideas and make memorization easier. They also allow you to
create a "picture" of what you are learning. Pictures are easier to recall
than lists of words or outlines because they allow you to visualize the
information. In addition, when you try to remember lists or outlines, you
have a tendency to recall the beginnings and the endings and confuse the
information in the middle. An example of a concept map is on the next
page.

Study actively. Look for answers, recite the material aloud, create
flashcards, or write notes, and test yourself.

Recite and repeat, the more often the better. Overlearn the information.
This means once you think you know the information, test yourself one
more time.

As with increasing your concentration, reduce interference. Find a place
to study where you won't be distracted. Turn off your phone and put it out
of sight.

Keep a positive attitude. Find something that connects you to the
information or motivates you even if you think the subject is boring. Tell
yourself you will learn this information because you need to pass this
course in order to fulfill your goal of graduating.

Space your studying. Distribute your learning over hours or days.
Studying a little at a time is more effective than cramming.

Use all of your senses. Look at it, say it, listen to it, talk about it, and write
it. Use the material in as many different ways as you can. Create flashcards,
concept maps, timelines, charts, short lists, summaries, and self-tests.

Group items in groups of seven or less. For instance, your social security
number is ten digits, but you tend to recall it in three parts or groups

                                                                               College Student

(i.e. 123-45-6789). We tend to remember seven groups of information at a
time.

For information that is difficult for you to recall, use a mnemonic device.
For instance, make up an acronym, a rhyme or song, or an acrostic. These
are described below.

Acronym: The word scuba is an acronym that stands for Self, Contained,
Underwater, Breathing, and Apparatus. The word homes stands for the
Great Lakes: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior. SQ3R is
another acronym: Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. These are
popular acronyms, but you can make up your own acronyms by taking
the first letter of each of the words you want to recall and making a new
word to use as a memory tag. Absurd and silly words are especially easy to
remember.

Suppose you needed to remember the six listening faults: daydreaming,
closed-mindedness, false attention, intellectual despair, memorizing, and
personality listening. You would take the first letter of each meaningful
word; in this case, D, C, F, I, M and P and create a new word or phrase,
such as PC DIMF or DC PIMF. The word or phrase doesn't have to make
sense, it just has to be memorable. When you have your test in hand, take
a moment to write down PC DIMF in the margin. When you come to the
question that deals with the six listening faults, you will have a memory tag
all ready to aid your thinking. If the list of items to be remembered has to
be in order, you will be limited in what you can create, so you might want
to create an acrostic instead.

Have you ever noticed that when a song comes on the radio or TV, you can
easily recall the words? Create a jingle or a song of concepts to aid your
memory. Perhaps you are familiar with the jingle:

         Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest
         have 31 except February, it's a different one. It has 28 days clear,
         and 29 each leap year.

An acrostic is another effective memory device. A popular one you may be
familiar with is "My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas."
This acrostic, which is a sentence using words with the same first letter as
the words you are trying to recall, is a clue to the planets in order from the
sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and
Pluto. The six listening faults could also be recalled using an acrostic. For
instance, I may call proper friends daily. I for intellectual despair; M for
memorizing; C for closedmindedness; P for personality listening; F for
false attention; and D for daydreaming.

Keep in mind that mnemonic devices should not be overused. They are
intended just for information that is difficult for you to recall. Many times
people will recall the mnemonic device they used years after memorizing it,
but not be able to recall what it stands for. Roy G. Biv is a popular acronym
that many people recall, but don't remember that it stands for the colors
of the rainbow in proper order; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo,
and Violet. Thus, limit the number of mnemonic devices you use when you
are studying.

Part 5: Test Anxiety/Speech Anxiety

Author: Ms. Cathy Hunsicker, Emeritus Associate Professor of
Communication, Dalton State College

All students experience some test anxiety - a fear or worry about having
to take a test. When the anxiety is normal, it raises your alertness and is
productive. When the anxiety is severe, it can cause mental interference
which will make concentration difficult and make you easily distracted. It
also can produce physical symptoms, such as restlessness; "butterflies in
the stomach"; accelerated heart beat and/or breathing; nausea, sweaty
palms and a headache, among other symptoms.

The worst part of severe test anxiety is that it causes a mental block
which makes it difficult to focus on the task at hand and remember all
the information you have studied. If you are very anxious about a test
and have studied effectively, you can still do poorly on the test if you are
unable to control your anxiety.

The most important step to take to control anxiety is to be prepared. You
need to self-test and practice the information repeatedly to make it your
Exploring Public Speaking  375  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                                College Student

own. You also need to keep your perspective and not let your emotions
interfere with logic. Consider why you are anxious. Are you anxious and
afraid because of self-defeating thoughts? If you think you will do poorly,
you are setting yourself up to do just that.

You must keep a positive attitude and talk to yourself. Say, "I have
studied for this test and even though I may not know all the answers, I
do know most of them, so I will earn a good grade;" or in the case of a
speech, "I have researched this speech effectively, and I have practiced
this speech numerous times in front of my friends and family, so I will
be able to deliver it successfully in class." Use your imagination and
visualize yourself being successful. See yourself acing the test or delivering
your speech calmly and in control. Imagining yourself successful in a
situation sets you up to be successful as long as you have completed all the
requirements to be successful, i.e. studying and practicing.

The last technique to controlling text anxiety is to learn to relax. If you
find yourself breathing heavily and upset about the test or speech, take a
little time and count your breaths for a minute. A breath is considered one
intake and one outtake. Next, slow down your breathing and count your
breaths again. The fewer breaths you take, the more your body will slow
down. If you are anxious, you are probably taking fifteen to twenty breaths
per minute; whereas, if you are relaxed, you can limit yourself to three or
four breaths per minute without holding your breath. This little exercise
can help you focus and relax before you take a test or give a speech, or
during a test if you find your anxiety is worsening.

Another exercise you can practice consists of starting out in a comfortable
position. Loosen your clothing if necessary. Then, beginning with your
toes, tighten your muscles to the count of ten, and then release them from
the tension. Next tighten your muscles in your feet, again to the count
of ten and release. Continue moving slowly up your body, tightening
and releasing. As you are doing this, breathe deeply and slowly. This is a
good technique to use on test or speech day before you get to class or just
after you arrive. This technique can be used whenever you feel yourself
becoming anxious, when you can't sleep at night, or as a refresher between
study and practice sessions.

If you find your mind is blocked during an exam or just before you are
to give your speech, close your eyes, take a long, deep breath and let it
out slowly. Concentrate on your breathing, so that you can feel and hear
yourself breathe. Don't allow yourself to worry about the exam, speech,
time, or tension. Repeat once and then return to the test or ready yourself
to give your speech. Keep in mind that being able to make your mind
and body relax takes practice, so try these techniques in non-anxious
situations. As you become comfortable with them, try them in anxiety-
producing situations.

Part 6: Test-taking

Author: Ms. Cathy Hunsicker, Emeritus Associate Professor of
Communication, Dalton State College

In many classes, the large part of your grade, and thus your success, will
be from high grades on exams. These pointers will walk you through
preparing and taking exams.

The first step to test-taking is to study. If you are prepared for the test, you
will be less anxious and more apt to score a high grade. What should you
study?

Key terms, definitions and examples: It is not enough to know the
terminology and what each new vocabulary word means. You need to be
able to provide an example or explain how the word fits into the subject
you are studying.

Enumerations or lists of items: Lists of items make excellent test
questions, especially the kind that read, "All of the following are related
EXCEPT..." These questions demand that you know the entire list and be
able to identify the one item that does not apply.

Points emphasized in class: If your instructor repeats a concept in class
several times for emphasis, he is giving you a clue that you will see that
concept on a test. Study it and know it.

Reviews, study guides, flash cards, PowerPoints: Many instructors
provide tools to increase your learning and help you study. If your
instructor provides reviews, study guides, PowerPoints and/or flashcards,
use them to your advantage. This is information your instructor has
designated as important to know.

Questions from quizzes and textbook chapters: If your instructor
administers regular quizzes on the material, save the quizzes for future
study. There is a good chance you will see those questions or similar ones
on the midterm or final. Many textbooks offer questions at the end of
each chapter. Ask your instructor if studying these questions would be
beneficial or not.

General Tips for Studying for Exams

Get a good night's sleep. If you are tired while taking the exam, your focus
will be weak, and you are more apt to make mistakes. Being well-rested
will make you more alert during the exam.

Don't cram. Schedule regular study times. The optimum way to study is to
review the information you have read in your text and heard in your class
on a daily basis. This can be just a quick reading through the information,
Exploring Public Speaking  377  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                               College Student

but the repetition will make the concepts stick in your head. If daily is
not feasible, schedule time to study your text and class notes on the days
the class meets at a minimum. Looking over your notes as soon after
class as possible increases your memory of the material and gives you the
opportunity to clarify what you have written. Studies have shown that the
longer you wait to review your notes, the more you will forget. In fact, you
can forget half of what you have learned in just an hour if you don't review!

The week before the test, you will need to schedule daily study times.
Break up the information into workable parts. Study part one the first
night. The second night review part one and study part two. The third
night review parts one and two and study part three. Continue studying in
this way to keep the information fresh in your mind for test day.

In addition, take breaks while you are studying. When you come back from
your break, review the material you were focusing on before the break
and start studying the new material. Break, review, study provides many
beginnings and endings to your studying which is beneficial because we
tend to remember the beginnings and endings of information and fudge
up the information in the middle.

Take your books, pens, pencils, paper, etc. to class. In short, be prepared
to take the test. Responsible college students have the necessary
equipment to succeed in school ready every day, not just on test days.
In addition to showing responsibility, having what you need with you
provides a feeling of confidence because you are ready.

Be on time for the exam. It goes without saying that being on time to
class shows respect to the instructor and your other classmates. Being on
time also allows you to be more relaxed for the test. Rushing in late and
worrying about whether you will have enough time to finish the test will
weaken your focus and concentration.

Sit in a quiet spot and don't talk about the material. Every exam day, you
will find a group or groups of students hurriedly trying to make themselves
remember the concepts they should have been studying all along. They
tend to be frenetic as they ask each other questions and look up answers
in the text. You have studied and the information is all in your mind. Don't
sit near these folks and join in their frenzy. Keep to yourself. You have put
the material in your mind in a logical fashion and don't need to upset your
thinking by talking with these students.

Read all of the directions on the test carefully. Just because the questions
appear to be the usual multiple choice or true and false doesn't mean you
are to answer them the usual way. Sometimes instructors want pluses
and minuses instead of trues and falses or T's and F's. If you answer the
questions using a method different from what the directions state, your
answers will be incorrect.
Exploring Public Speaking  378  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

Budget your time. Don't spend so much time on a single question that you
can't finish the test. Mark the troubling question and come back to it if and
when you have time.

Ignore those people who finish before you do. You are not in a race.
Students who finish quickly either really know all the information or don't
know any of the information. You may not know all of the information, but
you will know most of it because you studied. Use your time wisely and
review your test if you finish before time is up to make sure you haven't
made any "stupid mistakes." Use all the time you are given.

Answer the easy questions first. Answering the easy questions first tends
to build your confidence as you proceed through the test. In addition,
these questions may provide clues to the more difficult questions.

Mark the troublesome questions so you can look at them again later.
Many times troublesome questions become clearer after reading and
answering other questions on the test. Just be sure to keep track of the
questions you have deemed difficult, so you can go back to them later. It
is usually wise to select an answer to those difficult questions before you
move on just in case you don't have time to return them.

Answer all the questions. If you leave a question blank, it is wrong. Guess
if you don't know the answer. A guess at least gives you a chance at getting
the question correct.

If you don't understand the question, state the question in your
own words. If this doesn't clarify the question, ask the instructor for
clarification. You can't answer a question you don't understand.

Always review your answers before handing in your test. However, do
not change any answers unless you are certain you have made a mistake
and answered incorrectly. Perhaps you accidently marked the wrong letter
choice, or you misread the question. In these instances, changing your
answer is wise. Otherwise, your first inclination is usually the right answer.

Additional Tips for Multiple Choice Questions

Use process of elimination. Read all of the choices and cross out those
choices that are definitely false or incorrect, and choose from the answers
that remain.

If unsure of an answer, even after using process of elimination, pick one,
so you have an answer on your test, but mark the question to come back to
later. This way, if you run out of time, you will still have an answer and not
a blank.

Watch for qualifiers, such as, all, most, some, no, always, usually,
sometimes, never, great, much, little, more, equal, less, good, only, bad, is,
Exploring Public Speaking  379  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                               College Student

is not. Keep in mind that few things in life are always or never, so phrases
such as, most of the time or rarely are more acceptable answers.

If one answer choice is a paraphrase of another answer choice, both
choices are incorrect.

Additional Tips for Matching Questions

Read all of the items to be matched to understand the possibilities. Fill in
all the matches you are sure of and then go back and choose answers for
the difficult ones. Make sure you note which answers you have used, so
you can keep track of what you are doing.

Additional Tips for True and False Questions

Watch for qualifiers, such as, all, most, some, no, always, usually,
sometimes, never, great, much, little, more, equal, less, good, bad, is, is
not. Keep in mind that few things in life are always or never, so phrases
such as, most of the time or rarely are more acceptable answers.

If any part of the statement is false, the entire statement is false.

Additional Tips for Essay Questions

When studying for an essay test, anticipate probable questions beforehand
and create outlines for the answers for memorization.

Read the questions carefully and answer what is being asked. Often essay
questions consist of several questions in one. Answer all of them.

Jot down a brief outline in the margin before writing out your answer, so
your answer is clear and organized.

Write a clear, organized essay. Begin by paraphrasing the question. Then
introduce your main points and supporting details. Remember, each main
point must have supporting information. Use transitional words, such as
first, second, next, then, however, finally and also to connect your ideas.
Last, be sure to proofread your essay answer for errors and legibility.

Part 7: Avoiding Plagiarism

Author: Ms. Amy Mendes, Lecturer in Communication, University of West
Georgia

Plagiarism in a problem in many classrooms. It is a problem for students,
since plagiarizing robs them of learning opportunities and can get them
in serious trouble. It is a problem for teachers, since it leaves them unable
to tell how much a student really knows and causes them to have extra
administrative work to deal with students who plagiarize.
Exploring Public Speaking  380  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

Unfortunately, it is also common. Some researchers estimate rates of
cheating in undergraduate classrooms at over 80% (McCabe et al., 2001a,
2001b; McCabe & Trevino, 2002; Dawkins, 2004; Callahan, 2004;
Whitley, 1998). This statistic includes other types of cheating, but we can
deduce from it that plagiarism is common. And some researchers say that
committing plagiarism in college can be a predictor of dishonesty in the
workplace later in life (Hilbert, 1985; Lucas & Friedrich, 2005). Failing
an assignment or a class is a bad consequence, but if this sort of behavior
continues, it can ruin one's career.

One reason that plagiarism is such a problem is that students don't have
a good understanding of what it is. Although students may articulate
some understanding of plagiarism, and that it must be avoided, they do
not understand the purpose of citation itself. They may only think of it
as a required convention of academic writing, rather than as a means
of learning and contributing to an ongoing accumulation of knowledge
(Lofstrom, 2011).

Some researchers have found that students feel confused by the rules, and
express fear that they may accidentally fall into plagiarism even when
trying not to, or even to accidentally echo a phrase previously encountered
and mistake it for their original thought (Ashworth, Bannister & Thorne,
1997). This is consistent with other's findings that students cannot identify
plagiarism when given examples, do not know how to paraphrase and cite
(Marshall & Garry, 2006; Yeo, 2007; Pecorari, 2003).

How do we teach about plagiarism?

The good news is that simply educating students about plagiarism helps
reduce it (Landrau, Druen & Arcuri, 2002). But, a complicating factor
in the public speaking classroom is the confusion that exists for some
students about citation standards in verbal communication (Holm, 2002).
Some students who may exhibit appropriate citation behaviors in written
assignments fail to do so in speeches.

In a recent study (Mendes, 2017), student respondents on a plagiarism
survey indicated some interesting things about their understanding of
plagiarism. First, many respondents specifically used the terms "stealing"
or "theft" and "words." The implications of this usage are that these
students focus specifically on others' words, but not necessarily on
thoughts, ideas, or conclusions. However, another significant minority of
students used "thoughts" in their answers, indicating a more thorough
understanding of citation requirements. Another important group
of words that came up in the study was "knowing," "intentional," or
"purpose," indicating that plagiarism behaviors are always intentional (and
that perhaps unintentional plagiarism does not count).
Exploring Public Speaking  381  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                                                               College Student

Below are a series of activities that will help you reach a better
understanding of some important ideas about plagiarism:

     How to use quotation marks.
     When and how to paraphrase.
     How to cite information from multiple sources.
An important thing to remember about quotation marks is that you
shouldn't use very many. Unless there is important technical language, a
direct quote you need to reference, or a significant phrase, it is better to
paraphrase the information you use, rather than directly quote it (more
on paraphrasing later). If you are quoting something, the a proper citation
should include the quoted material and a parenthetical citation (Author's
last name, Year of publication). Anytime you are going to use more than a
couple words in the same order as the reference text, go ahead and add the
quotation marks - but ask yourself if you could rephrase the idea so that
you use different words. DO NOT just leave off the quotation marks!

Paraphrasing is when you take the information from a source and put it
in your own words, usually be combining it with information you already
know, or by explaining how the information is relevant to the topic you are
writing about. It can be more difficult that you expect, because sometimes
once you have read the original author's phrasing, it is hard to think of a
"better" way to say it. Think instead of how you will be telling us something
about the information - why is it important, how it relates to your topic or
argument, whether it agrees or disagrees with other information in your
speech.

Read the following passage, and from the information provided, take 1
quotation and 2 paraphrased sentences:

         Cricket will be joining the crowded U.S. professional sports
         landscape as part of a $70 million licensing agreement between
         the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) and
         Pennsylvania-based Global Sports Ventures, LLC. The move
         is a significant first step in growing the popular sport in the
         U.S., which has the second highest viewership of cricket in the
         world behind only India. More than 1.4 million people in the U.S.
         watched the ICC World Twenty20 competition won by West Indies
         earlier this year.

         Cricket was a popular American sport before the Civil War, with
         rules that were formalized by Benjamin Franklin in 1754. George
         Washington played cricket in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1778
         and the first international competition in any sport was actually
         a cricket match between the U.S. and Canada, according to the
         USACA. The multiyear licensing agreement means a franchised
         Twenty20 (T20) professional league will be established within
         the next year or so. There are ongoing talks about the number of
Exploring Public Speaking  382  Appendix B: Succeeding as a
Version 4.2
                                College Student

         teams, the cities in which they'll be based, they facilities in which
         they'll play, and the creation of player contracts for both men and
         women (Matuszewski, 2016).

Sometimes you will be combining information from more than one
source in one paraphrased statement. Using the 2 passages below, write a
sentence that contains information from both in paraphrased form.

         What happens, though, when a child with talent and enthusiasm
         has nowhere to play? The U.S. only has one purpose-built ICC-
         certified cricket ground, at Central Broward Regional Park in
         Lauderhill, Florida. In 2015, the Cricket All-Stars, two teams
         captained by Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne, two of cricket's
         best-recognized names, played three exhibition games at Citi
         Field in New York City, home of the New York Mets, Minute Maid
         Park in Houston and Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, two other
         baseball venues, using drop-in cricket pitches for games of 20
         overs a side. (Kakade, 2017)

         An Indian-American cricket enthusiast has announced plans
         to build as many as eight cricket stadiums across the US at an
         estimated cost of $2.4 billion to professionalise the game in the
         country. The eight proposed stadiums, each having a capacity of
         26,000 people in New York, New Jersey, Washington DC, Georgia,
         Florida, Texas, Illinois and California, would create as many as
         17,800 new jobs in the US, said Jignesh (Jay) Pandya, chairman of
         Global Sports Ventures (Press Trust of India, 2017).

Hopefully, this practice exercise has made it easier to understand when
and how to cite, paraphrase, and combine sources. Your instructor can
answer other questions you have.

Appendix C: Public

Speaking Online

In 2019 as we were looking toward a revision of Exploring Public
Speaking, we realized that one area of public speaking that our readers
might run into is "speaking online." Although traditional face-to-face
public speaking has a 2500-year history and thousands of research articles
to support it, speaking online is a relatively new procedure. In late 2019
and early 2020 the world was introduced to a new coronavirus, COVID-19,
and millions upon millions of lives were changed. Most colleges and
universities in the U.S. went to remote or online instruction, and two years
out, the face and practice of all levels of education have been markedly
changed. We've all sat through numerous meetings on Zoom, Google Meet,
Microsoft Teams, and other types of webconferencing platforms, and
many of us have decided on their relative merits.

This appendix will attempt to give some guidelines for this new mode of
public speaking, gleaned mostly from business communication sources
such as the Harvard Business Review. The websites we used to compile
this appendix are given at the end of it. Of course, we have gone through
a long period of using them, but we also know that a great deal of "online
speaking" could be improved. So this chapter is not changed significantly
from the 2020 edition.

All online speaking is not created equal. You might take an online
class that requires you to send a video of yourself giving a speech for a
grade. You might be participating--or leading--a "webinar," which is a
meeting or presentation over the Internet using a tool such as Blackboard
Collaborate, Citrix, GoToMeeting, Adobe Connect, or one of many other
webconferencing tools such as those mentioned above. These have become
very common in the educational and business world because they save
a huge amount of money--employees, students, and learners can meet
without having to travel to another location.

With this growth in popularity and now the extreme need for them brought
upon by the pandemic, we have a growth in problems and common
behaviors, or misbehaviors, in webconferencing and thus online "public
speaking." Much of the advice on webconference public speaking comes as
antidotes to the worst practices that have developed in them, which are:

    1. the audience's multitasking (and thus not fully attending to the
        webinar)

    2. the audience's being bored to death and going to sleep (which I
        confess to)
Exploring Public Speaking  385  Appendix C: Public Speaking Online
Version 4.2

Both of these conditions come from the fact that the communication is
mediated and that in many cases the speaker and audience don't see each
other. Even when the participants use their web cameras (which doesn't
always happen), the screen is often covered with a slide and the speaker
is invisible. Therefore, the speaker has to depend on something else to
address the listeners' temptation to multitask or nod off.

Preparation for Online Speaking

First, recognize that this is a different type of venue. You have two main
tools: your voice and your visuals (slides).

If monotone and monorate speaking is horrible for face-to-face speaking,
it is truly the "Kiss of Death" for web speaking. The key word is "energy"--
an energetic voice has variety and interest to it. Since we tend to have a
lower energy level when we sit, some experts suggest that web conference
speakers stand to approximate the real speaking experience. This
suggestion makes sense. As we have mentioned repeatedly through this
book, preparing means practicing your speech orally and physically, many
times. Audio-recording yourself during your practice on your smartphone
or other device is a good first step, followed by critically and honestly
thinking about whether your voice if listless, flat, low-energy, and likely to
induce snooziness.

Second, your visuals. Most of us are tempted to put far too much text and
too many graphics on the slides, and since the slides are the primary thing
the audience will see (rather than your full body), the temptation is even
stronger. As one expert on web speaking suggested, if your presentation in
the workforce is likely to be graph, data, and information heavy because
it's all information the audience must know, send the information in a
report ahead of time. We've mentioned before that speeches are not good
for dumping a great deal of information on audiences.

Therefore, keep your visuals simple. They do not have to have lots of clip
art and photographs to keep attention. One rule business speakers like
to use is the "10-20-30: rule: No more than 10 slides, no more than 20
words on the slides, and no font smaller than 30 point." Using 30 point
font will definitely minimize the amount of text. Inserting short videos and
planning interactivity (such as polls, which some software supports) are
also helpful.

Also in the realm of preparation, avoid two other problems that are
common in webinars. Since some of your presentation might be visible, be
sure your background is "right." Many people perform webinars in their
offices, and let's be honest, some offices provide backgrounds that are less
than optimal. They are either messy and disorganized or have distracting
decorations. In other cases, you could be sitting in a neutral place with a
blank wall behind you, but that setting can have its own issues. One writer
Exploring Public Speaking  386  Appendix C: Public Speaking Online
Version 4.2

talks about a speaker who wore a white shirt against a white background
and almost disappeared. Of course, some platforms allow for a background
scene behind the participants, but sometimes these cause a "ghosting"
effect to the person's image.

It goes without saying that the web speaker must be master of the
technology, not be mastered by it. Technology messes up. That is a fact
of life. One of the sources for this appendix was an archived video of a
webinar about web speaking by an expert; during the webinar, his Internet
connection was lost! Even if the connection is strong, the speaker must
know what buttons to push on the software. For this reason, it might be
a good idea to have an "assistant" who handles the technology and makes
sure it works so that you can focus on the communication.

Experts give a few other preparation tips:

    1. Make sure you will not be interrupted during the webconference.
       This can be extremely embarrassing as well as ineffective. You have
        probably seen the priceless video from the BBC of an interview with
        an expert on Korea. His children photobomb the interview and then
        the mother tries to clean up the damage. It is hilarious, but the same
        situation won't be for you. Lock the door, put a big sign on the door
        not to be disturbed, and turn off the phones.

    2. Have notes and anything else you need right at hand.
    3. If you can be seen, be seen--use the technology to your advantage so

        that you are not an entirely disembodied voice talking over slides.
Finally, in preparing, think humor. Humor is a great attention-getter (see
Chapter 7 on factors of attention). Cartoons, short videos, funny anecdotes,
and visual humor can help you work against the audience's temptations
to multitask or daydream in a webinar. There is a limit and it should be
tasteful and relevant, but humor might be one of your best allies. Plus, it
might increase your own energy level and fun with the webinar.

During the Web Speech

One of the helpful suggestions from the business writers used for this
appendix was to start on time. This might seem obvious, but if you have
ever been in an online meeting or webinar, it's harder said than done-
mainly because participants log on at the start of the meeting rather than
early and it takes a while for the technology to kick in. Therefore, one
suggestion is to have a "soft" introduction for the punctual and a "hard"
opening for the late-comers. The soft intro could be the fun, attention-
getting one (video, interactivity) and the hard one the "this is why the topic
matters let's get down to business" opening.

It goes without saying that you as the speaker should be online well
before the beginning of the meeting, and ready to go technology- and
presentation-wise.
Exploring Public Speaking  387  Appendix C: Public Speaking Online
Version 4.2

Web speaking is often scheduled for a longer period of time than a face-
to-face speech, which does not add to attention level of the audience. For
this reason, your presentation should include time for questions and input
from the audience. However, this should be planned at intervals, perhaps
between main sections of the speech, so that the speaker isn't interrupting
at inconvenient times.

Going deeper, perhaps we should ask the fundamental question of purpose.
What is your intent in this webinar speech? To educate? To persuade/
sell? To contribute to or facilitate a decision? Something else? Everything
else you do comes from that intent or purpose, just like your face-to-face
speech comes from the specific purpose speech. What do you really want
to accomplish from this meeting?

The other fundamental question is about your audience. Who are they?
Where are they? In fact, in some cases the audience is in a different time
zone, and that really matters in how a listener responds.

Other experts suggest the following:

    1. Along with standing up for your presentation, smile. People can hear
        a smile even when they don't see you.

    2. Your anxiety does not go away just because you cannot see everyone
        in your "web audience." Also, you might not have ever met the
        people to whom you are speaking. Be aware of the likelihood of
        anxiety--it might not hit until you are "on air." As Ron Ashkenas
        says, "Anxiety in speaking is like static on the radio."

    3. In your use of periodic questions, be specific. The typical "Any
        questions?-pause- let's go on" is really pretty ineffective. First, it's
        not directed or specific, and second, people need time to formulate
        their questions and articulate them. Even saying, "What questions
        do you have?" is better, but even better is to ask specific questions
        about what you've been addressing. Many times you can forecast
        possible questions, and use those.

    4. The issue of a question-and-answer period brings up a logistical
        question. Some participants will question orally through the web
        cam set-up. Others, with limited technology, will use the chat
        feature. It takes time to type in the chat feature. Be prepared for
        pauses.

    5. Remember the power of transitions. Many people think that slides
        don't need transitions because, well, they change, isn't that enough?
        No, it's not. The speaker needs to tie the messages of the slides
        together.

    6. Verbal pauses can be helpful. Since one of the things that put
        audiences to sleep is continual, non-stop flow of words, a pause can
        get attention.

    7. Look at the camera, not the screen. You will appear more
        professional in those cases where the audience can see you.
Exploring Public Speaking  388  Appendix C: Public Speaking Online
Version 4.2

Ending

As mentioned before, webconferences and webinars can go long--don't let
it. End on time. Allow participants to email you questions if needed, but
don't take advantage of people's time by entertaining questions longer
than the scheduled time. Software allows for recording and archiving, so
the audience should know how to access the recording.

Speaking for an Online Class

This writer teaches an online business communication course where she
requires either a face-to-face (if possible) presentation or one done online.
In these cases, instructors usually want the presentation given in front
of a live audience of a prescribed number of people and/or in a venue
like a classroom (not the student's living room). Many public speaking
instructors do not believe this option is as good as an in-class speech, but
if you are in this situation, here are some tips.

    1. Film your whole body--not just your head and shoulders.
    2. Do tech walk-throughs and make sure your camera is working well

        and picking up your voice.
    3. Make sure you can get the recording to your instructor. You probably

        will not be able to just send it through email because the file will
        be too big. You will have to post it to the cloud or to the learning
        management system in some manner.
    4. Wear appropriate clothing. Not being in class may tempt you to
        wear something too informal. During the pandemic and sheltering-
        in-place, we public speaking instructors saw students in pajamas or
        not wearing shoes during recorded speeches; one of the authors had
        a student video where the young male student was shirtless. This
        might be an opportunity to go a step beyond in your clothing. Make
        sure, also, that it looks good on camera in terms of color and lighting
        in your setting. Some patterns do not look good on camera.
    5. Along that line, since you probably won't have professional lighting,
        get the room as bright as you possibly can, but do not point the
        camera in the direction of a bright light. The light should be coming
        from behind the camera. Likewise, if you are in a webconference,
        keep the light source behind your computer screen, not behind your
        head.

Conclusion

As mentioned before, this subject is an evolving one. These tips and tactics
should help not just avoid the major problems but also cross the finish line
into an effective presentation.

Appendix D: Funny Talk:

The Art and Craft of

Using Humor in Public

Address

What is so funny about public speaking? Well, nothing really. On the other
hand, a speech that includes some timely and well delivered humor can
be especially gratifying for both speaker and audience. Dottie Walters
said "Begin with a laugh and end with a tear." The judicious, strategic,
and appropriate use of humor in speaking can help the audience have a
positive feeling about: 1) the Subject, 2) the Speaker and 3) the Speech
itself. Many people are hesitant to use humor in speeches for a variety of
reasons. Some people think that humor is never appropriate for speeches.
Some people shy away from it because they do not feel that they are funny.
Some people do not use it because they are afraid if no one laughs it is
another chance to be rejected. Some do not use it because it may take a
bit of extra work to include relevant humor in a speech. You should not be
afraid to use humor. With the right planning, preparation, and practice,
you can be an effective purveyor of the comic arts. You may find that both
you and your audience will be better for it.

Becoming proficient in using humor to connect with audiences and get
your message across is not easy. It takes quite a bit of study and practice.
Grady Jim Robison noted, quite correctly, that "Humor is not easy-it just
looks that way when well done." Many people will say that they cannot
tell a joke or do not have a sense of humor. Using humor, whether a
joke, funny story, or other bit of amusing material is a skill which can be
developed. There may be some people who are more naturally adept at it,
however nearly everyone can learn how to inject a bit of humor into their
speeches.

Scholars and practitioners have studied the value and challenges of using
humor in public speaking for many years. Consider the information in the

Humorous Speaking Tips

Having seen both the value and the complications connected to humor use
in speeches, please examine the following tips that weigh both the positive
and negative aspects of humor in public address.

Positive Aspects

     Humor is an effective attention getter. You have just a few seconds
      to make the audience want to hear more. Humor can be a wonderful
      tool to do exactly that. If you can make the audience laugh or smile at
      the very beginning, then you will have them anxiously awaiting what
      you have to say next.

     Humor is an effective attention keeper. Audiences can drift away,
      especially in an age when attention spans are shrinking. Sometimes
      you have to rein them back in. You can do this with a bit of humor.

     Humor can be used to break the monotony. Sometimes you will
      be dealing with a technical or tedious bit of information that requires
      a lot of explanation. When this happens, people may begin to get
      restless. Perk them up with some humor.

     Humor can be used to help your audience remember. There
      is substantial research which supports the idea that information
      retention is aided when connected with a piece of humor or a good
      story. The key is to make sure that it is actually connected to the
      information you want them to remember.

     Humor can be used to help your audience have a positive
      feeling about the message and about you as a speaker. They
      will likely also have very positive feelings about the event itself and
      about themselves. Humor can be used for affinity building with your
      audience. The more they like you or feel connected with you, the
      more open they are to your message.

     Humor can be used to diffuse tension or to soften the blow of a
      serious or controversial point. Sometimes you will have to make
      a point that your audience needs but may not want to hear. You can
      use humor to make that point. You can deflect criticism with humor.
      Both presidents Kennedy and Reagan were masters of this. Both used
      humor to deflect criticisms of their age when they ran for president.
      Opponents thought John Kennedy was too young to be president
Exploring Public Speaking  393  Appendix D: Humor Appendix
Version 4.2

      and Ronald Reagan was too old. Their humor obviously worked. As
      William K. Zinsser said, "What I want to do is make people laugh so
      that they'll see things seriously."

Negative Aspects

     Humor can offend. It is best to avoid humor that uses sexist, racist,
      or demeaning language. Avoid profanity and vulgarity and sexual
      references. You should generally avoid partisan political humor
      unless you do not mind risking losing half of your audience. Be sure
      that your language is context-appropriate. Speaking at the Kiwanis
      club is not the same as speaking at the comedy club.

     Humor can make your topic seem trivial. The use of too much
      humor, especially irrelevant and silly humor, may cause your
      audience to lose sight of the importance of your topic. Consider how
      much and what kind of humor to use, particularly when dealing with
      sensitive or controversial topics.

     Humor can be mere filler. When you eat a meal, it is important to
      eat a balanced diet and remember to eat your vegetables. Dessert is
      delicious but should not be the entire meal. Think of humor as the
      dessert or as side dishes and not as the entre.

     Humor can be difficult to translate or understand. If the
      audience contains several people who do not share your native
      tongue or national identity be careful that you do not use humor that
      may not be easily translated by them. Word play can be especially
      challenging in this situation.

     Humor can be culturally inappropriate. Some gestures, words,
      or phrases may have different meanings in other cultures. In the
      U. S. the thumbs up sign means "all is well." In some countries it is
      considered a vulgar and offensive gesture.

     Humor can be irrelevant. If the humor does not connect with the
      greater message, it can become a distraction. Remember, you do not
      just want them to laugh, but to consider your entire message very
      carefully. They may become annoyed or fail to understand the point
      you are trying to make.

     Humor can be unfunny. Sometimes humor falls flat. It may be that
      they have heard it before or they do not get it, or they just do not find
      it funny. Remember, humor is subjective. People laugh at different
      things and for different reasons. Sometimes they are preoccupied
      with other realities of life. Do not be disheartened. Move on to the
      next piece of information in the speech. Do not keep repeating the
      joke or try to explain to them why it is funny. They might be insulted
      and you are wasting valuable speech time.
Exploring Public Speaking  394  Appendix D: Humor Appendix
Version 4.2

As you can see, using humor in your speaking is not necessarily easy, but
it is well worth the investment of time and energy. Stewart Harral noted,
"Get a laugh and you've got an audience!" It will take some planning and
some practice. One of the things that worries beginning speakers the most
when it comes to humor use is that they think they must prepare original
material and become professional standup comedians or humor writers.
This is not the case. Certainly, if you have an aptitude for creating humor
then develop and nurture that talent and apply it to your publics speaking.
Original, fresh humor that comes from a speaker's experience is always
appreciated by an audience.

On the other hand, you need not feel as though you must create amazing
pieces of comedy when there is much good, relevant humor available
for you to use. Remember that humor is not just joke-telling. In fact, for
most speeches jokes are not really the best kind of humor to use. You can
use amusing stories, light verse, funny lists, comical visuals, etc. Be sure
to give credit to the source. The more you develop this skill, the more
comfortable you will become. You may even find that you are a gifted
humorist. At any rate, your audience will likely appreciate the effort.

E.5 -- Reference List

E.1 - Citation

Citing your sources is part of using information. While there are many
citation styles used by different disciplines, this appendix focuses on APA
style.

Citation (in any style) has many functions; it:

     allows you to support the claims you make,
     gives credit to the source of the information, and
     allows your audience to locate the information if they want to learn

       more.
The practice of citation is inseparable from research, because new
developments always build on existing knowledge. No individual knows
everything there is to know about a topic, which is why research involves
examining what is already known.

Engaging with the ideas of others is a way of adding your voice
into a conversation about a topic. This can include agreeing with
others' perspectives, building on existing ideas, or introducing a new
interpretation or counter-argument.

                        comes from you, such as your opinion.

                        When in doubt, it's best to cite your source.

                        E.3 - Elements of citation

                        There are two main elements of citation: the brief in-context citation, and
                        the full reference entry.

                        In-Context Citation

                        You may be used to citing in text, and while citing in speeches works
                        differently, the same principles apply--you want to ensure that your
                        audience knows where you found the information.

                        You can use both quotation and paraphrasing in speeches, and for
                        either, be sure to provide the details about the source when you use the
                        information.

                        Quotation

                        Since quoting means using someone else's exact words, you should
                        indicate that you are using a quote. Examples of how to do this are:

                        "As legendary football coach Vince Lombardi said, `Winning isn't
                        everything, but wanting to win is.'"

                        "Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh said, and I quote, `I would rather die of
                        passion than boredom.'"

                        Paraphrasing

                        Paraphrasing, or restating a source's ideas in your own words, is another
                        option. Be sure to acknowledge the author, source, and date of the
                        information you use. This can be accomplished in various ways, such as:

                        "During the December 27, 2017 episode of 60 Minutes, correspondent Lara
                        Logan described the practice of airlifting rhinos by helicopter to protect
                        them from poachers."

If APA style is new to you, it has a few intricacies that you may want to
know:

Tips on formatting reference entries in APA style

     Authors' names are credited using their first and middle (if one is
       given) initials only. You do not need to list credentials such as Ph.D.,
       M.D., etc.

     Within a reference entry, authors are listed in the order they list
       themselves, even if it is not alphabetical.

     The title of a source (article title, book title, etc.) is capitalized as
       follows: the first letter of the title and the first letter of the subtitle are
       the only words capitalized, except for where grammatically required
       for individual words, such as proper nouns or acronyms.

Tips on formatting a references page in APA style

     Once you've ensured that the individual entries are correct, you'll
       want to make sure the text on the page is double-spaced, and only the
       first line of an entry is aligned to the left margin. Subsequent lines of
       individual entries will be indented 1/2 inch; this is called a "hanging
       indent."

     The reference entries will be listed in alphabetical order on this page.

Appendix F: Research
with Dalton State Library
Resources

While Chapter 5 gave you some basic information about conducting library
 research, this appendix was written specifically for Dalton State students
 to provide additional details about using Roberts Library. The Roberts
Library home page can be found at daltonstate.edu/library.

"GIL-Find," the Library Catalog

 GIL-Find is the name of Roberts Library's catalog, and it provides a
 searchable listing of all the books, e-books, and resources like audiovisual
 media and government documents owned by the library. Access to the
 library catalog is available from the library's home page.

You can search the library catalog using keywords about your topic. The
 search results pages will show materials in all formats, and if you would
 like items only in a particular format, you may narrow the search using the
 facets on the left side of the screen. This "Refine my results" section also
 lets users narrow their search by date, author, subject, and more.

Each item listed on the results page gives you the information you need
 to access these sources. For items physically available in the library, "Get
 it" lets you know the location, call number, and item status. If you are
 trying to view an e-book or streaming media, "View it" provides links to
 full access. The library's catalog has a variety of helpful features, including
 an integrated option to order books from other schools if the Dalton State
 copy is checked out.

Users can log in to GIL-Find using their MyDaltonState credentials to save
 searches and items for future reference, and see their checkout history, as
 well as renew items online.

GALILEO

 GALILEO, also accessible from the library's website, is a portal to
 hundreds of databases, each containing hundreds of journals, each journal
 consisting of hundreds of articles, which means that there are millions of
 possible sources in GALILEO. What you need is probably there; it's just
 a matter of finding it. GALILEO takes a little more time and effort than
 using an Internet search engine, but it will provide you much more reliable
 information.

Informative Speech on Types of Coffee Around

the World

By: Samantha Gentry

Specific Purpose: To inform my classmates of specific types of coffee
drinks from around the world.

Introduction: Do you ever just need something really warm to drink? Have
you ever been so sleepy that you couldn't keep your eyes open without
help? Did you know that according to Consumer Reports that about
62% of us drink coffee every day? As a daily coffee drinker, I can attest
to wanting and needing to drink coffee every day to keep away the awful
caffeine headache. Coffee is not just a beverage drank here in the United
States; people all around the world drink billions of cups of coffee every
day. There are many different kinds of coffee drinks out there.

Thesis/Preview: According to RoastyCoffee.com there are over 43 different
types of coffee drinks from all around the world. These drinks include:
Turkish Coffee, Caff Crema, and Irish Coffee.

    I. Turkish Coffee is one of the oldest methods for preparing coffee.
              A. Turkish coffee was first introduced to the Ottoman Empire
                    in 1543 from Yemen.
                        1. While being introduced in Istanbul, a new method of
                              preparing coffee was established.
                        2. The coffee beans were roasted over a fire, finely
                              grounded, and then boiled into water.
               B. TheSpruceEats.com explains that Turkish coffee is named
                    for its special brewing method.
                        1. Turkish coffee traditional not sweetened, but if it
Exploring Public Speaking  424 Appendix I: Sample Outlines and Formats
Version 4.2

                             sweetened the sugar is added before the boiling.
                       2. Also, it must be served with foam on the top.
Transition: Coffee beverages can be named for their preparation style like
Turkish coffee, but also for their appearance like caffe crema.

    I. Caff crema is one of the first types of espresso drinks.
              A. It gained popularity and became primarily served in
                    Switzerland and Northern Italy in the mid 20th century.
                       1. It is a long espresso meaning there is more water
                             than regular espresso.
                       2. Caff crema has 180ml to 240ml of water compared
                             to the 25ml of water normally used to make
                             espresso.
              B. Despite its name, Caff crema does not contain any form of
                    cream or dairy.
                       1. According to Jonathan Morris, researcher and
                             author of The Cappuccino Conquests exhibit, the
                             Gaggia Classica machine of 1948 revolutionized
                             espresso by creating this drink.
                       2. The pressure of the machine created a creamy foam
                             at the top of the espresso resulting in the name Caff
                             crema.

Transition: Classic coffee and espresso drinks are popular and enjoyed
around the world, but so are cocktail styled coffee beverages.

II. Irish Coffee is a cocktail twist on traditional coffee.
              A. According to Good Food Ireland, this coffee cocktail was
                    first created by a chef named Joe Sheridan.
                       1. Sheridan created Irish coffee in the 1940's at Foynes'
                             Airport; he was looking for ways to keep passengers
                             warm while their planes were being refueled.
                       2. The first Irish coffee was served to American flyers;
                             they asked, "Is this Brazilian coffee?", in which,
                             Sheridan replied, "no it's Irish Coffee."
              B. Sheridan mixed black coffee with whiskey and topped it
                    with whipped cream.
                       1. Irish coffee of today is a mixture of whiskey, sugar,
                             and black coffee with a topping of whipped cream.
                       2. Today people all over the world are drinking Irish
                             coffee to keep them warm.

Conclusion: Coffee is one of the most popular beverages drank around the
world every day. According to The National Coffee Association in 2010
Americans drank on average 3.1 cups of coffee a day, and the average cup
size is 9 oz. This means that on average Americans are drinking 27.9 oz of
coffee per day. Turkish coffee, Caffe crema, and Irish coffee are three types
of coffee beverages that are being drank every day.

Persuasive Speech on Reading During Leisure

Time

By: Samantha Gentry

Specific Purpose: To persuade my fellow classmates on the importance of
reading during leisure time.

Introduction: Raise your hand if you have read a book outside of a class
requirement within the past year. Did you know that according to the
American Time Spent survey of 2017 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Americans who read for pleasure has declined by over 30% since 2004? In
2004, about 28% of American ages 15 and older read for pleasure; in 2017
that number was down to about 19%. Less men are reading for pleasure
than women with a whopping 15% of men reading for fun and about 22%
of women. Hello, my name is Samantha Gentry, and today I'm going to
persuaded you why reading for pleasure is good for you.
Exploring Public Speaking  426 Appendix I: Sample Outlines and Formats
Version 4.2

Thesis/Preview: Reading for pleasure and as a leisure active has many
benefits for your mind, body, and soul. Three of the benefits include:
improved brain health, relieved stress, and improved empathy skills.

    I. Reading is a fantastic activity to help maintain and even improve
          your brain health.
          1. As many of us may be aware, as we begin to get older and age,
                our physical bodies begin to decline, but so do our brain and
                mental activity.
          2. A study published by Neurology, a peer-reviewed neurology
               journal, showed that people who read throughout their
                lifetime had a slower decline in memory compared to their
                peers who did not.
          3. When you are reading, specifically fiction books, your brain is
                having to make connections; over time these connections for
                new pathways between the four lobes and two hemispheres in
                the brain. Over time these new pathways help promote quicker
                thinking and help defend against cognitive decay.

Transition: Reading is like exercise for your mind. It also serves as a stress
reliever.

II. There are many ways to reduce stress. Why is reading one of them
you ask?

          1. Well according to a study by the University of Sussex in 2009
                found that reading for just 6 minutes can reduce stress level by
                up to 68%.

          2. Reading is such a large part of going through school and at
                many jobs; it is hard to find the benefits of it.

          3. When you are immersed in a new world of a fiction novel
                or learning about one of the greatest leaders in history in a
                biography book, you are focusing your mind and body to think
                beyond the stress of your everyday life. Reading also helps
                reduce your heart rate and eases muscle tension.

Transition: Everyone needs a little stress relief in their life. They also need
to learn how to become more empathetic.

III. Being able to show empathy and understand the mental and
emotional states of those around is an important skill to forming social
relationships.

          1. A study by Bal and Veltkemp in 2013, showed that over a
               week's time readers who were emotionally transported into a
                fiction story felt a change in their empathy skills.

          2. When you are immersed in an emotional book, you are able
                to feel what the characters are feeling and think what they are
                thinking. This helps you to begin to understand how those
                around you are feeling about situations you may actually never
                face in your own life.
Exploring Public Speaking  427 Appendix I: Sample Outlines and Formats
Version 4.2

          3. If you are wanting to be a more empathic person, make sure
                you read fiction books over nonfiction because literary fiction
                had a more significant impact than nonfiction.

Conclusion: According to Caleb Crain, a writer for The New Yorker, there
are many reasons why Americans don't read; from actives on computers,
to cell phone scroll, to the king of them all television watching. However,
there are many benefits to reading. These benefits include improved brain
health, relieved stress, and improved empathy skills. So please understand
that no matter how boring or how much of a waste of time it may seem to
you, reading books for fun is good for you. Thank you.

"Writing a Proper Outline"

General Purpose: To Inform

Specific Purpose: To inform my class how to write a proper outline.

Central Idea: A proper form of outlining includes the correct formatting of
main points, connectives, and a well written introduction and conclusion.

Introduction

It's shocking how many students in speech class do not know how to write
a proper outline. Statistics taken in Ms. Correll's two speech classes show
that 95% of students did not know how to use the proper outline format.
The cause of this ineptitude is still not certain, even though the format was
clearly explained in class, and it is also fully explained and exemplified in
the text book. The goal of this speech is to inform each of you the proper
way to write an outline by including the correct formatting of main points,
connectives, and a well written introduction and conclusion. By doing so
your audience will have a much clearer understanding of your speech and
it will also result in a good grade!

(Transition: Let's get started on how to write out the main points.)

Body

     I. The main points are the central features of your speech.
               A. The main points should be arranged strategically.
               B. The main points must always be in complete sentences.
                        1. The sub-subpoints should also be in complete
                              sentences
               C. The main points must use a consistent pattern of
                     symbolization and indentation.
                        1. The sub- sub point will begin with the number 1.
                        2. The second sub-sub point will begin with the
                              number 2

(Internal Summary: Let's pause for a moment to summarize what we have
found out so far: Main points are the central feature of our speech. They
Exploring Public Speaking                    430 Appendix I: Sample Outlines and Formats
Version 4.2

must be arranged strategically and written in complete sentences and use
a consistent pattern of symbolization and indentation.)

II. Connectives are important to transition from one main point to the
next.

              A. Connectives will include transitions.
              B. Connectives will include internal previews.
              C. Connectives will include internal summaries.
              D. Connectives will include sign posts.
(Internal Preview: I will now focus on the importance of writing a
proper introduction and conclusion and some ways in which to grab the
audience's attention.)

III. A proper introduction and conclusion will make your speech
exciting and memorable.

              A. A well written introduction will include your specific
                    purpose and central idea.

              B. An introduction should only make up about 10-20% of your
                    speech.

              C. An introduction should gain the interest and attention of
                    your audience.
                       1. A startling statement is a good way to arouse
                             interest.
                       2. Asking a rhetorical question is another way to get
                             your listeners thinking.

              D. A conclusion should only make up about 5-10% of your
                    entire speech.

                                         E.  A conclusion should reinforce the central idea.
                                         F.  An exciting conclusion will help to make your speech more
                                             memorable.
                           Conclusion
                                                1. You may end with a quotation or a dramatic
                                                      statement.

                                                2. You may refer back to the introduction.

To conclude, I hope that I have shown you the proper way to write an
outline. This includes the proper labeling of main points, connectives,
and how to write a proper introduction and conclusion. Writing a proper
outline is the basis of a well-organized speech. By implementing these
steps it will ensure that your audience will not be confused, and it will also
result in a good grade and put a big smile on Ms. Correll's face.

Sample Format 3

Title (if desired; not necessary)
Exploring Public Speaking  431 Appendix I: Sample Outlines and Formats
Version 4.2

 Specific Purpose: To (verb) (the target audience) (the specific content.)
(Verbs would include to inform, demonstrate, convince, explain, describe,
persuade, motivate, entertain, inspire, delight, or define.)

Introduction: (The introduction is written out in paragraph form.
Use some sort of attention getting device as discussed in Chapter 9. The
introduction should be written after the body of the speech is prepared.
It should be about 10% of the total speech time, and there should be a
 clear bridging statement between the attention-getting technique and
the thesis/central idea. Practice the introduction so that you know it
particularly well.)

Thesis or Central Idea: This sentence makes it very clear to the
 audience what you intend to accomplish in the speech and/or what
position you intend to defend.

Preview: This portion serves to inform your audience of the plan that you
will follow in order to explain, demonstrate, expose, or prove your thesis/
 central idea. It is a signpost to the major ideas of the speech. The central
 idea and the preview might be contained in the same sentence.

     I. First Main Idea, Step, Argument, or Reason used to explain, prove,
           or demonstrate thesis
               A. First Division of First Main Idea.
                        1. Supporting Material such as statistic, quotation, fact,
                              narrative.
                        2. Etc.
               B. Second Division of First Main Idea
               C. Etc.

(Note 1 - Phrase Roman numeral and A, B, C, etc. units of outline as full
 but brief sentences. For example, not "Heimlich's list of symptoms," but
"Dr. Heimlich offered a reliable list of choking symptoms.")

(Note 2 - Phrase units directly. I should be able to look at the preparation
 outline and have a fairly complete idea of your content. For example, not
"I will talk about symptoms" or "Tell audience choking symptoms," or
"Give symptoms of choking.")

(Note 3 - Quotations, stories, statistics, and their sources need only be
noted, not written in full detail.)

(Note 4 - Main ideas are ideas, not supporting materials.)

(Note 5 - If you have A, you must have B; if you have 1, you must have 2,
 etc.)

Transition: These are bridging statements that inform the audience that
you are moving to a different main step, point, or argument in the speech.
Include them between I and II, II and III, etc.
Exploring Public Speaking  432 Appendix I: Sample Outlines and Formats

II. Second Main Idea, Step, Argument, or Reason needed to explain,
prove, or demonstrate thesis

              A. Sample Content
                       1. Sample Content

  2. Etc.
  B. Etc.
Transition:

III. Third Main Idea, etc. Speech should have at least 2 and no more
than 5 main points/ideas/steps/arguments.
Conclusion: Write out the words you will use to close the speech.
It should include a summary of your main points. Avoid saying "In
conclusion" or similar phrases. It should be a little shorter than the
introduction (5-10% of speech). Practice it well also.

Appendix J: Case Studies

Chapter 3

Jennifer should probably have thought first about whether her topic really
fits the audience, the context, and the assignment first. It might be that
her audience will be very interested and informed by the topic of why the
United States no longer uses the gold standard, and if she wrote a paper
on it for history (and presumably got a good grade and did good research),
she will know more about it than the rest of her class. In the history of
the U.S., it is an important topic, but she will have to spend some time
explaining why and how it currently affects the audience, the economy,
trade, inflation, etc. It might be that the topic is too big (too much
material) and she should focus on a subtopic of it.

As far as the sources are concerned, since she has read the sources, she
can still use them, but she will want to be careful not to take her paper
and basically deliver it, in an outlined or oral form, to her class. One,
her instructor might use originality detection software, and she will be
caught, and her college may have a policy against "self-plagiarism." It is
questionable ethics for her to use the paper twice. Second, a speech is not
a research paper, and again she needs to think about the purpose, context,
and audience. The history professor knows about the subject already and
gave Jennifer the assignment so she would learn about economic policies
of the past and how to write a good history research paper. The classroom
audience, and the instructor in the speech class, aren't looking at the
assignment in the same way. Also, Jennifer will need to cite her sources
differently in an oral medium.

In regard to Beth's problem, Jennifer should empathize with Beth but
firmly tell her she can't give Beth her outline or sources. Perhaps she can
help Beth brainstorm about a good topic for her class. The situation will
most likely end up badly for Beth and Jennifer if they share the outline.

Chapter 4

Possible Answer to Case Study One

Since Mitch's purpose is informative, he should not do #5. Since his
audience knows little about the sport, #1, #6, and #8 probably do not
apply since the audience does not have a base of knowledge to build on.
He will have to do research for the speech, so #7, #9, and #10 might work.
Since he has so much experience compared to his audience, #2, #3, and #4
might also be good topics, and they are not entirely separated: you have to
have equipment to play, and you have to know the rules to start playing.
Exploring Public Speaking  434  Appendix J: Case Studies

Version 4.2

             Mitch decides to base his speech on this specific purpose statement: To
             explain to my classmates how they can begin to play tennis. Central Idea:
             Although it may look like a sport for accomplished athletes, you can begin
             to play tennis this weekend with some basic knowledge and equipment.
             (Preview) In this speech I will explain the equipment, the court, the play,
             and the scoring of a tennis game.

             Possible Answer to Case Study Two

             The stakes for this scenario are even higher than for Mitch. Bonita
             wants this position and wants to do a fantastic job on her interview and
             presentation. She decides to be informative in her general purpose. She
             knows she should mention some of her past projects in her speech as
             examples of her use of and knowledge about social media, and she knows
             the big question in her audience's mind is "Will this candidate bring
             value and improvement to our communication processes?" At the same
             time, she does not want to come on too strong, so she decides to focus on
             how the three largest social media platforms of Twitter, Facebook, and
             Instagram could be used to enhance the organization. Also at the same
             time, she decides that 5 minutes is not long enough to use all three, so she
             decides to just discuss Twitter.

             Specific Purpose: To describe for the hiring panel how the nonprofit
             organization could use Twitter to fulfill its mission.

             Central Idea: Twitter's unique characteristics as a social media platform
             can contribute to the organization's mission by reaching a wider audience,
             engaging younger audiences, and using visuals.

             Possible Answers to Case Study

             The answers here are fairly unlimited, since these topics are still very
             broad. First Roberto would want to focus them some more. These are just
             a few suggestions, but you and your class should discuss pros and cons of
             each option you come up with individually or as a group.

Chapter 7

Terrence could conceivably use all the different types of supporting
materials, but since this is a persuasive speech, he should focus on the
persuasive ones. Also, since he's asking a lot of his fellow fraternity
members in terms of time commitment, he should be serious and do his
homework. Although Habitat for Humanity is well-known, many do not
really know what they do and how their "builds" work. He would need
statistics as far as numerical data on how many people in the area are
helped by Habitat and the costs involved, and what would be reasonable
goals for the fundraiser. He should have testimony of people who work for
the organization and who have been helped. What else might help him be
persuasive? Perhaps examples of past open-mic nights that had earned
good amounts of money for a cause.
