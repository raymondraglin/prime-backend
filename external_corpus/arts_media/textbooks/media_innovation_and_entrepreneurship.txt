Jan Schaffer

The Case for Learning about Media Entrepreneurship: An Important
Gateway to Your Future

If you are enrolled in a journalism or communications program, you should shudder if your
school never teaches you how to post stories to a content management system.

You should flinch if you hear the word "convergence"1 dominating course offerings but never
hear about design thinking or audience-engagement strategies.

And while you should pursue grammar literacy, be wary if you are not learning how to
parse the language and patterns of disruptive innovation, particularly the media disruption
happening in front of you daily.

As U.S. journalism and mass communications programs revamp to prepare you to succeed in
today's rapidly evolving media landscape, there is--bar none--no better place to embrace and
refine nearly every skill you will need to know than learning about media entrepreneurship
and innovation.

In the course of envisioning, prototyping and launching, you will integrate multimedia
production, social media distribution, design thinking,2 data collection and analysis, and
audience engagement strategies.

As added benefits, you will develop business skills, begin to understand how to develop a
product, how to discover customers, and how to manage all these activities so that you can
deliver a new entrepreneurial startup. Or you may go the intrapreneurial route and spearhead
a new venture inside your existing media organization.

The Time Is Now

Face it: You will be stepping into a world where media entrepreneurship is at an all-time high.

Hundreds of downsized journalists are watering community media deserts by launching
hyperlocal news startups. Scores of statewide nonprofit news ventures are bringing back
accountability journalism to state capitals. Startup founders are embracing single-topic niche
sites, doing deep dives into climate change, health care, arts and culture, public education, and
more. And, of course, venture capitalists have turned the likes of Vice, Vox and BuzzFeed into $1
billion-plus unicorns,3 so confident are they of a return on their investment.
x JAN SCHAFFER

Of course, all of these initiatives not only need your journalistic skills, they also need outreach,
social media sharing, ad sales, contact databases, event planning, membership drives, grant
proposals, and the creation of regular quarterly or annual reports to let supporters know what
they have accomplished. That's where innovations in public relations skills are critical.

How can there be so many new media ventures starting up at the same time legacy news
organizations wring their hands, erect paywalls, and cut their way to attempted profitability?

Clearly, something more than new business models is at play here. It's important for you to
learn about this.

It's clear that media entrepreneurs are articulating some new value propositions for their
audiences. Nowadays, entirely new breeds of journalism are emerging from the imaginations
of news entrepreneurs: mission-driven journalism, restorative narratives,4 soft-advocacy
journalism,5 solutions journalism6 and activist journalism. Moreover, new media ventures
are reaching out and engaging audiences in fresh, new ways, often building robust civic
communications ecosystems.

In learning about media innovation, you will be part of the creative process and a contributor
to these new trends.

So why should you learn about media entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation?

Skills With a Purpose

Let's count the ways:

Advancing Digital Smarts

To create a media startup, be it a website, an app, a tool, or something else, students have
to know how to create a minimum viable product, update it, monitor metrics, and employ
various social distribution platforms to attract users. Instead of learning these skills as end
goals in themselves, you will integrate them in the context of turning your ideas into a venture
imbued with your passions.

Identifying Opportunities

Entrepreneurs meet success when they have identified a need in the marketplace, a job to
be done--one that no one else is doing. Or one they think they can do better. Craigslist
identified a job to be done in classified advertising; Facebook in social sharing; Google for
search; YouTube for video; Sirius for satellite radio. Again and again, mainstream media comes
up missing in action in recognizing these possibilities. Media entrepreneurs, however, are
identifying gaps or problems and using design thinking to craft solutions. If you want to be a
media player, this is where a lot of the action is.
                    FOREWORD xi

Engaging Audiences

It's not enough to build a startup. An entrepreneur must find ways to engage a target audience
to become successful. Whether that's social media, crowdsourcing, commenting, news games,
virtual reality, drones, or augmented reality, you will learn that media has to be more than
a commodity these days. Media ventures have to be participatory experiences to find a
following.

As news entrepreneurs quickly learn, engaging audiences is more involved than counting web
page views or social media shares. The depth of engagement is what will convert readers into
donors, advertisers, content contributors, or volunteers, as we found in J-Lab's 2012 report,7
"Engaging Audiences, Measuring Interaction, Engagement and Conversions."

Engagement might entail hiring a graphic artist to do a before-and-after visualization8 of a
streetscape to invite a community to consider redevelopment options, as UrbanMilwaukee.com
did in 2009. It might involve launching niche newsletters9 on numerous topics as The New York
Times has done. Another option is webcasting10 civic meetings as Nowcastsa.com does in San
Antonio.

Developing Data Skills

To be sure, students need to learn how to collect, analyze, and visualize data to do enterprise
reporting. A media entrepreneurship student, however, will also learn about the need to gather
data to report on the outcomes of any grants or donations or to measure impact of stories.
And you will see that you must build contact databases to even begin to send out a newsletter,
produce events, or launch a crowdfunding campaign.

Building Revenues

Courses in the business of media have long been overlooked in many communications
programs. A grounding in media entrepreneurship will challenge you to figure out how to
build a business with multiple revenue streams to help sustain and grow activities. And it can
teach you that there are other creative opportunities in the media world than simply enjoying
the act of writing.

Pitching Ideas

Good ideas go nowhere if you can't convince others of the merits. Pitching is a skill that can
attract advisors or investors to a startup. But the same skill can attract an editor's support for a
story idea or an intrapreneurial initiative that begs to be launched inside a media organization.
Media entrepreneurship courses will require you to distill your ideas into a cogent framework
that identifies needs, opportunities, and challenges.
xii JAN SCHAFFER

Different Definitions

Be sure you understand what your school means by media entrepreneurship before you
enroll. A spring 2016 survey11 of educators teaching media entrepreneurship courses revealed
striking disparities in how professors defined the field. I conducted the survey for CUNY's
Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism. Some respondents saw media
entrepreneurship as starting a project that can be monetized. Others saw it as using
multimedia tools to tell stories. Still others defined it as building a freelance business. Go for
the programs that prepare you to envision and establish a new idea.

There's some other good news about media entrepreneurship and innovation programs. They
can help reassure your parents that you will have excellent job prospects in the future.

Media entrepreneurship programs can play a key role in preparing you for many different
futures. They can be the fulcrum for the ultimate Gateway Degree,12 one that can get you a job
just about anywhere, not just at a news outlet or a public relations firm. Integrating research,
writing, digital, and business skills, as media entrepreneurship programs do, opens the doors
to careers in startups, nonprofits, the diplomatic corps, commercial enterprises, the political
arena, and tech giants, in addition to law and medical school.

That's because participating in such a Gateway program means you've learned how to generate
a specific outcome.

It also means you've opened the door to many new definitions of success that you can achieve
as a graduate.

PREFACE FROM THE EDITORS

Michelle Ferrier and Elizabeth Mays

Web phenomenons such as Google and Facebook were started by student entrepreneurs.
Google began in March 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both
Ph.D. students at Stanford University. No one could have ever guessed that the algorithm-
powered Google search engine, invented for a university library, would become the world's
most powerful search engine. Facebook was created in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg,
a psychology major at Harvard University, who simply wanted to create a way for
upperclassmen to check out incoming classmates on the Web. Now this once-modest social
network made $9.1 billion dollars in the second quarter of 2017 in advertising revenue alone.1

In 2000, Michelle Ferrier taught her first multimedia journalism course at a small, liberal arts
college. The course required students to create an online business, then use their multimedia
skill sets to develop a prototype and win their first customer. Students developed solo business
ideas like a regional bride guide, a boy scout online education site for earning merit badges,
or a takeout taxi service. Students learned HTML, web marketing, and usability testing skills.
They figured out how to generate revenue with their businesses. And they learned to think like
innovators, solving problems and creating solutions that worked for their customers.

As the Internet disrupted the business of journalism, an entrepreneurial mindset emerged
as the must-have job skill for recent journalism graduates to help reshape the journalism
and mass communication industries. In response, forward-thinking journalism and mass
communications programs sought to cultivate this entrepreneurial mindset by making
entrepreneurship a staple of their curricula. Today, many faculty in media, communication
and journalism programs have been tasked with teaching entrepreneurial journalism, media
innovation labs, business of journalism, or media entrepreneurship.2 In some degree
programs, this manifests as a full class. In others, it surfaces as a module or modules within
existing course topics-reporting, media management, audience engagement, student media,
and others. Educators have also created graduate programs, competitions, and other structures
to advance media entrepreneurship within the curriculum.

In her foreword, Jan Schaffer mentions a spring 2016 survey3 that revealed educators teaching
media entrepreneurship courses defined media entrepreneurship quite differently. "Some
respondents saw media entrepreneurship as starting a project that can be monetized. Others
saw it as using multimedia tools to tell stories. Still others defined it as building a freelance
business," Schaffer writes.
                                                                                                                                     PREFACE FROM THE EDITORS xv

But as educators who've been tasked with teaching entrepreneurship, we wanted a textbook
that explained entrepreneurship in the context of the disruptions and opportunities in media
and journalism. There was no one seminal text that covers the key concepts of media
innovation and entrepreneurship that media, communication, or journalism students need,
especially as the development of content and technology businesses is very different than
traditional brick-and-mortar entrepreneurship.

When we embarked on this project, it was our aim to build the resource we ourselves needed,
and make it freely available for use to others teaching media innovation and entrepreneurial
journalism courses across the globe. While the original text was built with the needs of such
courses front of mind, we have intentionally made the book modular, and open, so that parts
of it can serve related courses, and be built upon.

The Rebus Community, a Canada-based publishing company, allowed us to experiment with
an open textbook format, meaning the textbook would be created collaboratively and live
as a dynamic document for others to share, remix, and reuse. Published under the Creative
Commons CC BY4 license, this text will be remixable, expandable, and easily updated, with
attribution to original authors and contributors.

The first version-itself a "minimal viable product or MVP,"-was available to instructors for
beta testing in their classrooms in Fall 2017. Students and educators were (and will continue
to be) able to send feedback to the authors and editors. This input was incorporated into the
"official" Version 1.0 release of the book in December 2017.

For now, Version 1.0 is envisioned to include a dozen chapters. The text is structured to move
students from ideation to securing funding. The work can be used as a whole or in standalone
modules. Version 2.0 (spring 2018) will build on this and add a chapter on Project Management
and Team Leadership, as well as new sidebars. It will also incorporate feedback that didn't
make the deadline to get Version 1.0 into print-on-demand in time for spring. (These changes
will be added into the online version sooner, as they come in.) With Version 3.0, we will include
instructor resources such as activities, ancillary materials, case studies, and more.

We'd like to thank our collaborators from across the globe, to the educators, students, and
entrepreneurs who engaged with us on Facebook groups, in private conversations, or on our
webinars. This textbook is much richer because of the diversity of ideas and experiences you
contributed.

And because we believe in eating our own medicine, we will continue to listen to you, adapt,
and add to this textbook, ever ensuring that we are meeting your needs as media innovators
and entrepreneurs.

What is CC BY?

For educators and for students, the CC BY license has many benefits we think you'll appreciate,
a few of which we'll highlight here:

        It observes the 5Rs.5 You won't have any license limitations or restrictions in allowing
          students to do what you want them to do with the text. They can read it, they can
          download it, you can have your bookstore print it, all without fear of legal
          repercussions. It's also not gated behind an email opt-in or an expensive access code
          that students need to purchase. And it won't suddenly become unavailable based on
          the publisher's whims.

        No barriers to access. The textbook will be freely available in the numerous formats
          students ask for-publicly on the web, downloadable as an ebook, printable as a PDF.
          And we'll be taking care to make the textbook accessible, not only for those with
          disabilities, but also taking into account the multiple modalities (mobile, offline, etc.)
          through which students desire to study.

        It won't make your students #textbookbroke. It will be available free (though we will
          also make a print version available at a price not much above cost for those who

ENTREPRENEURSHIP

     "So as I use the text, each week I'm more enamored with how it is EXACTLY WHAT
     I NEED -- this is the first time I've had such a cohesive, insightful and spot-on
     set of relevant readings, with just the right links and context setting that weave
     together this very particular journalism-based mindset. Every other semester I've
     had to cobble together from business sources, from entrepreneurship sources, from
     technology industry, then trying to make it make sense for students and tie it all
     to what's happening for journalism right now. And the intrapreneur/entrepreneur
     aspects makes room for a diverse class -- who care deeply about the fate of the
     industry, but aren't necessarily trying to launch a product. I already loved the project
     abstractly, but in weekly use, I really really love it. It's all the things. Great vision and
     nuance and context on this. There is nothing like this text anywhere else." -- Dana
     Coester, Associate Professor, West Virginia University Reed College of Media

     "I just really get it ... because we could rearrange our curriculum and just focus on 4-5
     chapters per course, depending on how it makes sense to break up the coursework but
     then courses could be built to the prof's expertise...or to resource availability. You're
     making the IKEA of information." - Mark Poepsel, Assistant Professor, Southern Illinois
     University

     "Congratulations on delivering a book I've been thrilled to use in class." - Amy Eisman,
     Director of the Journalism Division, American University.

     "This is an excellent resource for journalism educators who strive to give their
     students a broad understanding of the new ecosystem of the profession, or who want
     to encourage students to pioneer new forms of journalism for the 21st century. This
     book fills an enormous void and will be snapped up by many instructors. The open-
     source format is particularly useful. Students will be able to access this important
     material without paying a fortune and editors will be able to easily update the text to
     incorporate new knowledge as it emerges in this quickly evolving discipline." - Kelly

DEVELOPING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
MINDSET

Mike Green

The twenty-first century ushered in an era of rapidly evolving new technologies and
disruptions of consumer behavior across all industries. New entrepreneurial opportunities
were born amid the chaos of industry responses. Barriers to entry were lowered or obliterated.
New, fast, and nimble competitors entered the markets. And a new economic paradigm was
introduced to media companies that would leave many print news organizations struggling.

  View data and charts1 from Pew Research Center's Newspapers Fact Sheet, part of its State of the News Media report. The Media
  Deserts Project2 also has maps showing the decline of local newspapers in various regions.

On the employee level, industry disruptions have changed what a career means. Since 2004,
the industry has contracted 37 percent, from more than 65,000 reporters and editors employed
in 2004 to just 41,400 in 2015 (the last year of available data collected by Pew Research and
published June 1, 2017).3 Behind those data is deeper insight; Pew Research will need to gather
information for the next publishing cycle because the News Media Alliance (NMA), formerly
Newspaper Association of America (NAA), can no longer supply it.4 Accurate industry
research is another victim of the industry-wide upheaval.

No one can expect to get hired anywhere in the country and work for the same company for
most of their careers until retirement. That's a twentieth-century concept rendered obsolete
in the first decade of the twenty-first. For media, this is especially true.

Dog Eat Dog

Buying and selling of media companies is consolidating the landscape. The plummeting value
of major media properties, like the 140-year-old Washington Post (founded in 1877) that sold
for $250 million5 in 2013, can result in a sale for less than digital newcomers like Huffington
Post. Huffington Post was born in 2005 and sold for $315 million6 to AOL in 2011.

While the Graham family nurtured a multigenerational national media operation for about
68 years that was built on a foundation of award-winning journalism, Arianna Huffington
started a blog and generated more market value from it in six years than the Graham family
                                                                                                                 DEVELOPING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET 3

could manage from the Washington Post in decades. In case you're inclined to think AOL
overpaid for Huffington Post, in 2015 the telecom company Verizon bought AOL and all of its
media properties for $4.4 billion. By contrast, The New York Times Company was worth $1.8
billion7 on the market at the time AOL was purchased. Meanwhile, startup media company
Vox, at fourteen years old, was valued at $1 billion in late 2016.8 Today, AT&T hovers over
Time Warner (which owns CNN) waiting for the government to approve its $85 billion offer.9

The media industry has changed, and journalism is changing too. Gone are the days of college
grads cutting teeth at the local level and honing their reporting chops before embarking on a
series of tours, from low-wage local jobs to regional, and up the career ladder to higher pay
with national news chains. Gone too, is the wall of demarcation that divided the production of
editorial news content from the business of operating a media company.

Local media used to be the trusted place where consumers learned about their schools, city
council, sports teams, and happenings in their community. But the consolidation of media
across the nation has reached the local level. And corporate ownership of local media has
ramifications for journalists. Sinclair Broadcast Group is on the verge of purchasing10 the
Tribune Media Company this year. This purchase is sending tremors across the media
landscape due to its size and scope.

Before the Sinclair deal can be confirmed, allegations11 of political bias by the company have
been raised. These include requiring stations to carry "must run" segments produced by the
corporation and mandatory insertions of political commentary into local news broadcasts.
The ability of corporations to purchase media in local markets in bundles is having an impact
on the integrity of the journalism profession. The evolution of the industry, as it is being
disrupted by new media and new players, introduces uncertainty in the media market and
changes the dynamic of the career trajectory for journalists entering the profession.

Death of Past; Birth of Future

Newspaper Death Watch12 keeps tabs on the decline of the news industry, noting that 15 major
city dailies have shuttered since NDW started tracking in 2007. The loss of 15 major daily
newspapers in the past 10 years doesn't inspire confidence in the future of the media industry.
Lying in the grave alongside those relics are also notions that journalists are dispassionate
objective observers, set apart from the communities they serve. Gone too is the standard of
objective robotic reporting. The way journalism will be conducted in the future will look
different than it did during the past century.

It's important to note: journalism is not dead.

The craft and industry are evolving. And technology is playing a key role in that evolution.
Both the media industry and its truth-seeking, storytelling, content-producing members will
continue to play a vital role in society. However, the double-digit profits that made the
4 MIKE GREEN

former newspaper landscape an influential and prosperous "Fourth Estate" have evaporated
along with the attention span of audiences. The sudden disappearance of financial scaffolding
provided by the advertising industry, which enabled the profession of journalism to grow, has
caused the collapse of media companies and the loss of thousands of journalism jobs.

Today, even under the recent renewed interest in journalism that national newspapers are
seeing due to the public's concerns with "fake news," the media industry is racing to keep
up with technologies and new consumer behavior that have transformed a centuries-old U.S.
industry in a decade. And the most unnerving revelation of all is that this new era of tech-
innovation driving the evolution of media is in its infancy.

Economic Evolution

Journalists who wish to survive in this new era must think beyond the boundaries of an
employee performing tasks for an employer. The industry is filled with underpaid and
overworked professionals who do their best work because of their love for journalism and
service to the public. Ironically, it is this passion and love for the work that fits in the next
phase of journalism in the twenty-first century.

Today, journalists must consider themselves as more than masters of their craft, whether they
are writers and editors, photographers and videographers, television producers or newsroom
managers. Every journalist who intends to make media and/or journalism a career must
consider their role as either an intrapreneur or entrepreneur.

These terms are so important that we'll define them here.

     An entrepreneur is someone with a market-driven pursuit of a conceptual idea, who
     seeks a viable business model that succeeds in a target market.

     An intrapreneur is an employee who innovates and thinks entrepreneurially to
     develop new lines of business, programs or products within an existing organization
     or corporation.

It is important to understand how and why the era of entrepreneurship arrived and will
remain. The national economy has transformed itself three times over the past 100 years.
America was once a profitable agrarian economy and land ownership was the key to prosperity
in the nineteenth century. With overseas wars in the twentieth century came the need for
mass production and an evolution of America into a manufacturing economy. Ownership of
a factory and the means to production was a pathway to wealth. Manufacturing included the
production and dissemination of information as news. And journalists were needed to gather,
edit, and produce the content.

With the introduction of venture capital investing as an industry in the late 1960s, the buying
                                                                                                                 DEVELOPING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET 5

and selling of businesses became a profession by the late 1990s. Another evolution of the
U.S. economy occurred. America had given birth to a creative, knowledge-based, tech-driven
innovation economy.

By the turn of the twenty-first century, this "new economy" (as it was initially called; today it is
known as the "innovation economy") began to reward disruptive ideas in the marketplace, and
the marketplace is global. With the advent of the Internet and collaborative technologies that
continue to emerge from global connectivity, the age of information exploded.

Investors began to view the growth of teams of entrepreneurs starting their own companies as
high-risk, high-reward opportunities for investing capital. This kind of direct investment into
a young company is rewarded in an exchange for a portion of ownership. When the company
grows and attracts buyers, the investors will get their share of the purchase depending on the
percentage of shares they own in the company. This direct investing into startup companies,
typically by angel investors13 (individuals and/or groups who invest their personal funds),
accounted for more than $21 billion in 2016, according to the Center for Venture Research.14

One of the major impacts upon the media industry since the turn of the century was the
number of digital media startups,15 fueled by money from investors and venture capitalists.
Niche markets were targeted by new digital platforms such as Techcrunch, Venturebeat,
Mashable, ReadWriteWeb, and others leveraging the power of journalism to cover new areas of
the economy. In addition, journalists, laid off from their legacy media jobs, started hyperlocal
online news sites, small geographic regions where they focused the news on a zip code,
neighborhood, or city/town. These hyperlocals were bootstrapped startups, for the most part,
that relied on self-funding, or friends and family to start. CJR maintains a database16 of such
sites. With the growth of mobile usage, mobile applications and other new technologies in the
hands of consumers, the need for content has exploded17 over the past few years. Adding to
that explosion are new technologies such as virtual reality (immersive) and augmented reality
(blended real and imagined). Learn the difference.18 These new platforms require the skill of
storytellers to produce content that engages consumers.

The hope of getting money from investors is one of the drivers that's motivating creative
storytelling solutions. But entrepreneurship isn't only about chasing those dollars, but rather
pursuing the journey of giving the industry a solution based upon an innovation. However,
without startup funding, ideas can die in the minds of innovators. The age of startup
companies was fueled by laptops, tablets, smartphones, and software apps that keep making it
easier for anyone with a connection to the Internet to develop a website to get their idea into
the marketplace quickly.

Media was one of the first industries to feel the disruption of fast-paced, tech-driven
production, and dissemination of information in the hands of millions of people. The ability of
almost anyone with a computer, software, and the Internet to produce the written and spoken
word, photos and video, and upload it to the world to consume became a challenge to the
6 MIKE GREEN

media industry. Industry executives learned that anyone with a blog, a comment, or a tweet
on the Internet could compete with the journalism profession for attention of the masses. Yet,
that was the reality. A YouTube star19 could be born in the bedroom of any home. And media
would have yet another player in the market competing for attention in a 24-hour daily cycle.

That initial recoiling by media was a mistake. It opened the door to early adopters of new
publishing platforms, and the race was on to grab market share in the digital space. While
media companies challenged the quality and accuracy of content being produced in America's
basements, bedrooms, and garages nationwide, entrepreneurial ventures developed as digital
media platforms for this content. Since the turn of the century, hundreds of media platforms
have entered the market to compete with the "legacy" media. Ironically, social media platforms
like Google and Facebook understood the power of online engagement with audiences long
before legacy media began to switch their business model from print distribution of news
products to invest in development of digital platforms that encourage audience participation
versus passive consumption.

Entrepreneur or Intrapreneur?

Journalists eventually began to understand the power they had to establish a brand, develop
a platform, and connect with an audience. And, as the media industry contracted, journalists
turned to entrepreneurship, as self-employed freelancers and CEOs of new media ventures.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather now produces content for his News & Guts20 platform.
Former CNN news anchor Soledad O'Brien produced the series Black in America, which aired
on CNN. When she was fired in 2013, she took the series with her. O'Brien had established
a brand of matter-of-fact journalism during her career at MSNBC, CNN, Al Jazeera America,
and HBO. After CNN, she transitioned from journalist to founder and CEO of Starfish
Media,21 where she retains ownership of her brand and continues to produce content for
broadcast media, like HBO and her own platform, MatterofFact.tv.22

Of course, not everyone is able to be the CEO of their own company. But in this era of
innovation, there are no guarantees of a twenty- or thirty-year career with one employer
or even in one industry. Even those who fear entrepreneurship must learn to think like an
entrepreneur while serving as an employee. An employee with an entrepreneurial mindset is
known as an intrapreneur. And these are the most valued and coveted kinds of employees.
Let's take a look at the definition of an entrepreneur and examine why employees prefer
intrapreneurs.

     "Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources currently
     controlled," said Johnathan Holifield, former NFL player, attorney and author of the
     critically acclaimed book, The Future Economy and Inclusive Competitiveness.23
     "That's how Harvard professor Howard Stevenson describes it, which underscores my
     own passion for it. Entrepreneurship is about the relentless pursuit of opportunity
                                                                                                                 DEVELOPING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET 7

     that results in business formation, educational attainment and everything else worth
     having."24

Simply put, entrepreneurs are innovators. They are creative problem-solvers, critical thinkers,
collaborators, and calculated risk-takers. They are sacrificial, tenacious, motivated, and driven
toward measurable outcomes. They are team players and team leaders. Entrepreneurs pursue
their goals with passion and determination to succeed, despite obstacles.

                      An entrepreneur is someone with a market-driven pursuit of a conceptual
                          idea, who seeks a viable business model that succeeds in a target
                                                           market.

Social entrepreneurs are a unique type in that they seek to introduce solutions into the
marketplace that produce both profit and measurable social impact.

The entrepreneur is engaged in a process of creating, innovating, monitoring, measuring,
tweaking, pivoting25 (shifting strategy when necessary) ... and all the while searching for a
formula that delivers market adoption with a desired return on investment.

Contrary to the experimental world of the entrepreneur, a business owner is managing the
operations of a proven business model. One example is becoming a business owner through
purchase of a franchise operation and getting the training to run it based on an established
model for that business. While this approach still contains a certain amount of risk, the
experience of the franchise corporation helps reduce the risk of the investment made by the
franchisee owner to offer a more solid foundation from which to launch. Learn more26 about
the difference between an entrepreneur and business owner.

Of course, entrepreneurs don't necessarily make good business owners and managers. Given
their penchant and passion for creativity and constant search for a business model that works,
too often startup CEOs who are stuck in the mindset of the entrepreneur find themselves
tweaking a business that doesn't need it. This is a problem venture capital investors find in
some startups that have successfully penetrated a market and competed for a share of it.

Investors who write multimillion dollar checks to provide the company enough cash for it to
grow will often ask the startup CEO to step aside and assume a different role in their own
company. This is due to the need for the CEO to manage the process of scaling up the company
based on the successful business model. The former CEO, who still yearns to innovate, can
do so within the company without detracting from the core business model. Thus, he or she
is now in the position of being an employee with an entrepreneurial mindset. This kind of
employee, the intrapreneur, is valuable to any company that seeks to remain innovative and
keep pace with what is happening in the industry.

In the near future, all journalists will decide whether they are intrapreneurs or entrepreneurs.
8 MIKE GREEN

And yes, you can be both. At different times in a journalist's career, both will be valued traits
that generate opportunities in-house and in the marketplace.

Given the nature of a changing landscape, journalists who leverage their entrepreneurial
mindset to identify problems and offer solutions will make themselves invaluable to the media
company. At the same time, every media company will be impacted by the market and need to
make decisions that can result in layoffs. Journalists who prepare for such an inevitability will
have generated opportunities outside of their employer's shop.

Innovation: Sustainable & Disruptive

Inside media companies, the quest to keep up with the changing nature of the industry is a
constant challenge. New technologies and innovations (new tweaks on existing products and
services) are changing consumer behavior, which affects how media reach their audiences.
Journalists are asked to do more to ensure their content is produced in multiple formats
for multiple platforms and screens. Virtual Reality (VR) is a new technology, complete with
hardware for immersive engagement of media content. Alternately, Augmented Reality (AR)
is less invasive by incorporating something new into existing technology used by consumers.
An example would be the game Pokemon Go.27 Using a smartphone, anyone who knows
how to use the camera and the phone's GPS can instantly play the game, which inserts an
imaginary character into real-world scenes, as viewed through the camera. Thus, Pokemon
Go's augmented reality is an innovation of existing technology, rather than a new technology
altogether.

Today's media consumers are primarily digital and view media across a variety of screens,
ranging from television to laptops and tablets, to smartphones (the preferred screen of younger
audiences).28 The Internet is a visual medium, which means audiences prefer video and photos
to long-form prose on their screens. Consider what it's like to read a lot of text on the
television. That's a recipe for losing an audience. The same can be true for smaller screens.
That said, there are ways of presenting articles to audiences in readable format via any screen.
But each year, media must consider how the behavior of their audiences changes and adapts.
This is known as sustainable innovation.

An example of sustainable innovation is CNN's Great Big Story startup, which began inside of
CNN. Bloomberg's June 20, 2017 article,29 "CNN to Invest $40M in its Video Startup Great
Big Story," illuminates the point.

CNN's investment in Great Big Story is one example of a fast-moving convergence in television,
where traditional channels are pouring money into online startups to make shows for a
younger, cord-cutting generation of millennials and Gen Z. Recent research from the Pew
Research Center indicates that in the 18-29 age category, mobile usage is 100 percent in 2017,
with 92 percent having access to a smartphone. NBCUniversal, for instance, has invested $400
                                                                                                                 DEVELOPING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET 9

million in BuzzFeed and $200 million in Vox Media. Recently, Time Warner said it would invest
$100 million in making shows and buying ads on Snapchat.30

It may seem odd that CNN would invest in a media venture separate from itself. But consider
the benefits. CNN's investment is growing its younger audiences31 (25-35-year-olds) and
opening a new market, like NBCUniversal's investments in BuzzFeed and Vox Media. The risk
taken is by the startup entity. The capacity for the startup to respond to market demands
and experiment with new ideas far exceeds a large corporation's capacity. Remember that
corporations operate on proven business models while entrepreneurial ventures are in search
of a business model that delivers the desired return on investment. Great Big Story already has
found an approach in the market and is delivering a return on investment to CNN in a period
of time. As the startup grows, it will become yet another valuable asset of CNN, its investor.
If Great Big Story is sold via a liquidity event32 (i.e. merger and acquisition or initial public
offering), CNN will benefit.

Throughout the life cycle of the startup, from development to market impact to sale, CNN
will benefit. As the challenge to generate profits in the media industry grows difficult, and
with more non-journalism players jumping into the media industry (technology companies,
telecom and cable operators, app developers) and competing for market share, more pressure
is placed upon media companies to pay attention and continue to be creative in how they
gather, produce, and deliver content to their audiences, as well as how they engage their
audiences in participatory journalism. The ability to sustain a competitive level in the media
marketplace depends directly upon the priority placed on creativity that can lead to
marketable products, services, and increased audience engagement.

Journalists should always be on the lookout for innovation in the market. Not just the
journalism/media market, but the advertising/marketing industry as well. When these markets
are hit by a disruption that impacts existing business models, changes will occur as companies
adjust to the disruption. That adjustment can take many forms, but one is layoffs. The
advertising industry is a volatile landscape that is evolving today. As technologies enable
major advertisers to dispense with third-party ad agencies and go direct to the consumer of
their products and services, media companies suffer a loss of revenue. And since most media
operate on an advertising business model, the loss of that revenue means cuts in expenses. That
domino hits the newsroom.

But disruptions in the media and marketing industries are also doors of opportunity waiting
to be opened. Consider the fact that with more screens (and here comes the growth of virtual
reality and augmented reality) there is a need for more content. With more cable channels,
there is more need for broadcast material. With more corporate brands seeking to tell their
story to consumers in a way that holds some integrity, they need the skills of professional
journalists. Storytelling is the most valued commodity across all platforms of distribution.
Stories inform. Stories influence. Stories have impact. Stories move people to feel and act on
10 MIKE GREEN

their feelings. The media and marketing industries, regardless of how they evolve, and how
quickly they evolve, will always need storytellers.

Journalism is changing. But that's not a bad thing. Remnants of the familiar remain. But the
landscape is evolving. And while no one has a clear vision on where this industry is headed,
the doors of creative opportunity are expanding. And that empowers both entrepreneurs and
intrapreneurs to contribute their innovative ideas to help steer the industry into the future.

DIGITAL MEDIA ON THE RISE

Mark J. Scarp

Recent developments in the U.S. media business have seen print continue its decline while
digital media outlets continue to capture a greater share of the market for news media
consumption and income.

In 2018, U.S. daily newspaper circulation fell 8% for weekday editions and 9% for Sunday
papers.1 The Pew Research Center said that meant weekday circulation dropped to 28.6
million while Sunday circulation fell to 30.8 million since 2017. Pew estimated U.S. digital
weekday and Sunday circulation to be up 6% and 8%, respectively, over the same period.

More newspapers have recently cut back on staff and scope or even closed entirely, creating
"news deserts" in some areas, where few to no sources of local news continue to exist.
Meanwhile, digital media startups continue to emerge, with some established digital startups
fading while others are on the rise.

One of the more notable recent small-market newspaper closures involved the
100,000-circulation The Vindicator newspaper in Youngstown, Ohio. The family that owned
the paper since 1887 announced it would close in August 2019,2 citing financial difficulties
that at first had them unsuccessfully seeking a buyer.

Perhaps the most poignant recent newspaper closure was not really a closure, but a merger that
resulted in the layoff of 65 staffers3 of the Times-Picayune of New Orleans when the paper and
the news website NOLA.com merged with the Advocate of nearby Baton Rouge, the Louisiana
state capital. Poynter.org reported that of the 65 laid off, 19 said they intended to stay working
in journalism in New Orleans, with 10 of those planning to work for the merged newspapers.

Starbucks, where for years millions of coffee drinkers could find print editions of The New
York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today as well as local papers at its more than 8,600
U.S. outlets announced in July that it will stop selling national and local newspapers starting
in September, the Seattle Times reported.4 The Times quoted a company spokeswoman who
cited lower single-copy sales.

Upheaval was not merely visited on legacy outlets these past months. In a July 2, 2019, article
by Jon Allsop titled "Another Brutal Week in American Journalism," the Columbia Journalism
Review said during the week prior to the article about 3,000 news industry employees were
either offered buyouts or were laid off,5 including workers at two among the most well-known
14 MARK J. SCARP

names in digital media. Citing several sources, CJR described layoffs of hundreds of journalists
at digital standards Vice and Buzzfeed as well as at several outlets owned by Verizon, Gannett,
McClatchy and GateHouse, among others.

Mic Network Inc., another digital entity, survived but at a fraction of its former value. It was
sold to Bustle Digital Group in November 2018 for $5 million,6 far less than its valuation of
$100 million only two years before.

For a legacy media company, acquiring a startup can be strategic-helping to expand their
digital audience across platforms. Cable concern Altice USA purchased business news
streaming service Cheddar for $200 million in April 2019 in an all-cash arrangement.7

Some startups have recently attracted well-known names not previously known for their
affiliation with digital media. In January 2018, former Hewlett Packard CEO and onetime
California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman was appointed CEO of Hollywood movie
mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg's NewTV.8

Emmy-nominated actress Sofia Vergara of ABC's Modern Family joined Fox executive Emiliano
Calemzuk and Luis Balaguer, her longtime business partner, in a venture called Raze,9 "which
they describe as a mobile platform for editorial and video content that will appeal largely to
young Latin American audiences."

And the industry continues to innovate and evolve. Old and new media found common ground
as The Associated Press and Civil Media Company, a blockchain startup, became partners
in a blockchain solution for tracking the flow of content enforcing licensing rights.10 The
arrangement enabled AP to license its content to the 14 newsrooms comprising the Civil
network. Marketexclusive.com quoted a statement by Civil that through the partnership it
"hopes to promote ethical and high-quality journalism." Indeed, digital startups could well
carve out space in a marketplace that itself is becoming more digital, but it remains to be seen
how many will thrive and how they will accomplish it.

and Mass Communication, where he teaches a class called "The Business & Future of Journalism."

THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF MEDIA'S
UNICORNS

Melanie Faizer

Only three media companies -- Buzzfeed, Vice Media, and Vox Media -- meet the definition
of a "unicorn," or a startup valued at more than $1 billion. The three have very different growth
stories (see the chart below), but they all have attracted large, young and returning audiences -
and major investors, both public and private.

Publicly traded companies (whose capital comes from stock markets) often invest in proven
startups with a goal of eventually integrating them (or one of their products) into the company.
Disney, for example, intending to benefit from Vice's cable TV launch, invested $400 million
in the company in 2015. At about the same time, NBCUniversal, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Comcast, invested $400 million in Buzzfeed to facilitate a television partnership, and also
invested $200 million in Vox.

Private investment, though, has a different end game. Private equity is a large infusion of
money (often in the hundreds of millions) by investors who raise those funds from institutions
and wealthy individuals. (Compare that to venture capital - a type of private equity - which
tends to flow to earlier-stage startups and takes a smaller financial stake.) Private equity firms
(such as TPG, which invested $450 million in Vice Media in 2017) take a large, long-term
stake in a more established company with a goal of eventually selling the company or stake
at a substantial profit. In the newspaper space, for example, private equity (and hedge fund)
deals have become more commonplace, as evidenced by the 2019 purchase of Gannett by
GateHouse Media,1 whose holding company, New Media Investment, is managed by Fortress
Investment Management.

Unicorns typically have three options to satisfy their public and private investors, namely:

          1. Selling shares to the public in an initial public offering, or IPO. But like all
          companies that grow fast and feel pressure to generate revenue, Vice, Vox and
          Buzzfeed have experienced setbacks.2 All three companies have struggled with
          profitability, and all have laid off employees. Buzzfeed has been criticized for allowing
          advertisers to influence content; it has also struggled with public perception of its
          seriousness as a news producer. Most recently, its workforce unionized, creating
          more internal conflict. Vice suffered from accusations of fostering of a `boy's club
                                                                                                               THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF MEDIA'S UNICORNS 17

          culture' that resulted in Shane Smith's departure as CEO. Circumstances like these
          can erode confidence in the companies' focus and sustainability, and thus weaken
          prospects for a successful IPO.
          2. Selling the company (in whole or in part) to another company, but to date, none of
          the legacy media companies already invested in these unicorns has taken the plunge.3
          3. Remaining private, as they are now, but private equity investors will at some point
          expect a return on their investments. This puts a privately held company in a
          challenging position, forcing it to rely on a limited pool of private investors to grow
          (as opposed to selling shares to the public), and as a consequence, limiting its liquidity
          and growth potential.

Despite having achieved scale and visibility, the long-term prospects for these unicorns
remains up in the air.4

DEADLINES OR DEPTH? THE MODEL OF
`SLOW NEWS' STARTUPS

Melanie Faizer

Since the internet stole the comfortable ebb and flow of the morning paper and the evening
newscast, the news cycle has become less like a wave and more like a waterfall. Journalists and
audiences are drowning in breaking, negative news.

One antidote, and a trend over the last decade, is a deliberate focus on content over speed,
embodied by publishers of long-form content not subject to daily deadlines like Tortoise
Media,1 Delayed Gratification,2 The Correspondent,3 the Atavist Magazine,4 Long Play,5 and
Republik.6

Slow news, a term coined by scholar Susan Greenberg in 2007,7 is a philosophy: a deliberate
rejection of the fast, homogenous, and mostly depressing mass-produced and algorithm-
driven news. With slow news, many startups are unchaining themselves from technology and
reclaiming an influential role, if not as the traditional agenda-setter, at least as "discussion
leader," writes journalism educator Jay Rosen.8

Slow news isn't just about publishing less often. Just as the slow food movement encourages
consumers to learn about the origins of their food, slow news is a practice in community-
building, and in creating stories with quality and forethought, whether positive, solutions
oriented, investigative, or explanatory. (Arianna Huffington was among the first to espouse
slow, positive news.)9

The business model relies less (and often not at all) on advertising, and more on a deeper
level of audience involvement -- think "active member" instead of "passive subscriber." Some
examples:

        The Scottish investigative outlet The Ferret10 invites paying members to vote on
          editorial decisions at member events.

        Switzerland's "reader-owned" Republik dubs itself a media cooperative, language
          evoking the food co-op.

        De Correspondent consults readers for expertise and brings them into the reporting
          process.
20 MELANIE FAIZER

        Tortoise Media invites members and guests to join "live, unscripted conversations"
          with its staff.

        Positive News11 offered community shares in its crowdfunding effort, resulting in a
          media co-op owned by its "reader-investors."

        Canada's Discourse Media12 taps members for both story ideas and funding.

The trend toward slow news has not gone unnoticed by legacy media. Umbrella organizations
like Solutions Journalism (in the U.S.), and the Constructive Institute (in Europe) are
supporting intrapreneurial efforts, providing resources to media organizations to help them
practice "calmer" and more contextualized journalism.

"Over and over again, we've seen traditional newsrooms taking out low-value coverage and
focusing energies on higher value coverage," says Tina Rosenberg, a co-founder of Solutions
Journalism.

Startups are experimenting not only with audience relationships, but the very concept of time
in news. Although fast (and negative) news is necessary - to protect ourselves and to learn
from mistakes,13 the fixation on breaking news has hurt the industry. The routines of reporters
"have become fixed in materials and practices," writes Mike Annany,14 but those routines are
"not recipes for how news time should work." Slow news producers, in other words, might
improve journalism by confronting the accepted journalistic regimens that value speed and
volume over depth and deliberation.

TAKING RISKS AND BUILDING RESILIENCE
ON THE PATH TO INNOVATION

Dana Coester

Finding Joy in Taking Risks

"We don't know what will happen, but let's try this!"

Resiliency--the ability to weather change and bounce back from failure--is an essential
mindset for entrepreneurs. In innumerable blog posts and articles, industry leaders describe
resilience as a cornerstone to innovation, frequently citing Thomas Edison's famous quote: "I
have not failed. I have just found ten thousand ways that won't work."

Resilience is more than a buzzword; it's a survival skill. And it's a skill that you will need
to develop to become successful at navigating today's dynamic business environment. With
predictions suggesting that today's worker may hold more than twelve jobs in their lifetime,
you will need to build your capacity for resilience for the future. Sometimes you are forced to
be resilient when dealing with an uncertain or difficult situation, such as losing your job or
having to relocate. But while life experiences lay the groundwork, here are a few additional
perspectives you can explore to build on your core of resiliency.

"The future is on top of us."

One of the first steps in building resiliency is to fully appreciate the magnitude and pace
of change that technology drives across almost all fields. This insight will even give you an
edge over entrenched leaders, who continue to underestimate the pace of change1 in their
industries. Read carefully and internalize this bold statement about exponential change from
Ray Kurzweil's now cult-classic 2001 essay, Law of Accelerating Returns:2

"Human culture will change in the next 100 years as much as it has changed in the past 25,000 years."

According to Kurzweil, the default setting within organizations for anticipating change is
based on an intuitive linear view of progress--the idea that change happens at a steady and
predictable pace with just a few dramatic turns. This false perception results in consistently
underestimating change, which can happen at a far more accelerated rate. In fact, Kurzweil
                                                                                  TAKING RISKS AND BUILDING RESILIENCE ON THE PATH TO INNOVATION 23

described the far-reaching implications of what the "acceleration of acceleration" would mean
for industries grappling with technology-driven change, anticipating the profound disruption
to come in the years since 2001.
The gist is that all exponential change is flat for a very long period of time--but exponential
change always reaches a point where the graph becomes vertical.

We are at the point where the curve goes vertical.
You may ask, why does 100 years from now matter if you're just looking to start your own
business a few years from now? If you were on this curve back in 1980, and you were making
plans for your future, you can see that the location of the future was exactly where you'd expect
it--far off on a gentle and still relatively flat slope.
But if you're at the point where the graph becomes vertical, you need to ask yourself, "Where
does the future lie now?"
A young media college student in an entrepreneurship class recently answered that question,
by saying: "The future is on top of us."

"We don't know what will happen."

John Keefe, a "bot developer" and product manager at innovative startup publication Quartz,3
24 DANA COESTER

teaches classes in innovation and evangelizes "DIY hackery" as part of the maker community.
The maker movement represents a thriving community of hobbyists and entrepreneurs alike
who conduct home-grown, DIY experiments in technology and product development as well
as other creative problem solving that helps drive innovation across industries.

Keefe says experimenting take takes trial and error, and that innovation by nature is a risky
prospect. He challenged himself to risk failure repeatedly in his public experiment "Make
Every Week,"4 where he built a new DIY "thing" (almost) every week for a year.

"Being creative might lead to failure," Keefe says, "but it could lead to something awesome."

Fellow Innovator-in-Residence Sarah Slobin, formerly of Quartz, currently at Reuters, echoed
this failure-friendly mindset as she led a team of students to produce a mobile-first reporting
project...before there were any models for mobile-first reporting. At a particularly rough
moment when uncertainty about project outcomes was at a peak, the students' engagement
and enthusiasm faltered. Slobin took a tough-love approach AND shared her own
vulnerability. She called a time-out with the class and challenged them: "Do you think when I
come into work every day that I know exactly what's going to happen or that I know exactly
what I'm doing or how to do it? What are you afraid of?" There's no place for fear of failure in
innovation, she said. "If you see failure on the horizon...run toward it."

In Keefe's case, being creative led to breakthroughs in groundbreaking sensor journalism,5
new job opportunities and a book,6 but it was also a valuable exercise in acclimating himself
to taking risks. Not unlike embarking on an exercise regime, acclimating yourself to potential
failure through repeated exposure to trial and error on a small scale helps build resilience.

For Keefe, these serial experiments included working with students on a beta sensor-reporting
project as part of an experimental journalism class he taught at West Virginia University. Each
week he said to students:

"We don't know what will happen...but let's try this."

As simple as that statement seems, it bears breaking down and repeating, because it captures
attributes of innovation you can start to emulate now. When you say out loud to your
classmates or teammates, "We don't know what will happen, but let's try it," you are helping to
build a culture of resiliency and a safe space to experiment in that moment. Here's how:

"We don't know what will happen..." expresses:

        a matter-of-fact expectation that uncertainty is a given
        a transparent acknowledgement of vulnerability without anxiety or shame
        that you're willing to risk asking questions that don't have answers

"But let's try it..." expresses:
                                                                                  TAKING RISKS AND BUILDING RESILIENCE ON THE PATH TO INNOVATION 25

        an eagerness to conduct hands-on experimentation
        a commitment to being collaborative and inclusive
        joyful curiosity

Confronting the reality of accelerating change empowers you to prepare for a different kind of
future than the one your predecessors faced. Building resiliency gives you a remarkable edge
for both anticipating, and navigating, the many changes to come.

FROM THE FIELD: Q&A WITH A YOUNG
INNOVATOR

Dana Coester

 From the Field

  "Fail fast." "Fail often." "Reward failure." It's easy to evangelize a fast-fail philosophy in spirit, but it
  may be especially difficult in the classroom--after all, an F in college is not exactly a badge of honor.
  Add to this millennials' oft-cited propensity for perfection, desire to please and conform, and you
  don't exactly have a recipe for high-risk innovation. Although some studies have painted a portrait
  of this generation as risk averse,1 and evidence suggests2 Gen Z may be even more risk-averse
  and practical-minded than their predecessors, many young entrepreneurs are pushing back at that
  assessment.

  Meet Jillian Clemente, a member of the Young Innovators program3 at West Virginia University
  pursuing a dual major in Journalism and Wildlife and Fisheries Resource Management. She is also a
  two-time veteran of the Media College's Innovators-in-Residence Experimental Storytelling program,
  where she worked closely with John Keefe and inventors at MIT Public Lab in her environmental
  sensor work, helping to pioneer new projects and classes in the College's "Maker Lab." She is also
  a member of Launch Lab, which is the University's business incubator for student entrepreneurs. As
  a young entrepreneur juggling multiple passions, she shares firsthand what it's like to jump into the
  deep end and offers some advice to fellow students.

 What's your advice for fellow students on cultivating resiliency and taking risks in their
 entrepreneurship journey?

  Ask for help!

  I've needed teachers and leaders to help me up quite a bit, and I've learned that it's okay to ask for
  help, whether you're starting from scratch, or starting over again. It can be scary to do something new

  from scratch and maybe come out with no tangible new "thing," but I can promise you the process is
  worth it.
  Acknowledge the fear. Now throw it away.
  Fear is dumb. Innovate because you want to, not for anything else. Don't do it to impress people and
  don't take more than you can handle. If you're doing the work for the right reasons, you'll be pleased
  with the process and the project as a whole. There's never a reason to worry that "nothing will come
  out of it." Something positive always comes out of it.
  You are going to fail, but you're not a failure.
  First, know your worth as a person--you yourself are a unique innovation. Now give it your all. The
  end result may not be a "success" as in "hey, this thing works," but it will be successful in giving you
  problem-solving skills and insight into your resilience as a human being. Try listing out your new skills
                                                                                                             FROM THE FIELD: Q&A WITH A YOUNG INNOVATOR 29

  after a project or experiment (regardless of its "success" or "failure") for your resume, and you'll be
  pleasantly shocked.

  Accomplishments can be tiny--hey, look, you MADE something!

  Remember when you gave your parents a drawing and they got so excited about how amazing it was,
  even if it wasn't perfect? Get that way about your own accomplishments, no matter how small. It's an
  achievement to make one component of a final piece. Yes, there are always more miles to travel, but
  you did something. You made it to a goal and, in a field of so many unknowns (um, innovation), it's
  the showing up, the tiny steps, the trial and error that makes way for expertise and breakthroughs.

  Groups are good.

  Don't shut people out--listen to all. Pride is an idea killer. Plus, if an idea doesn't work, you'll still have
  some backups to test out, too. Also, acknowledge the introverts and extroverts. Some people may
  need longer breaks alone to perform best.

  Have fun.

  You're choosing to spend your time doing these things. Choose joy. Enjoy the process. Enjoy the
  failures. Enjoy collaboration and the betterment of yourself and, possibly, the world.

WHAT'S AN INTRAPRENEUR? AND HOW
DO I BECOME ONE?

Interview with Ebony Reed

In this interview, Elizabeth Mays interviews intrapreneur Ebony Reed for a class on Business &
Future of Journalism. Ebony Reed is director of innovation and the RJI Futures Lab at the Reynolds
Journalism Institute and an associate professor at University of Missouri-Columbia. Previously she was
director of business development for U.S. (local) markets at the Associated Press. Reach her on Twitter at
@EbonyReed.

Q: Can you give our readers some ideas of the types of projects or initiatives or
interesting things that you've done as an intrapreneur in news organizations?

ER: Sure. About three years ago I was working as a regional sales manager for the Associated
Press, and we started to place more emphasis in the local markets on selling to nontraditional
news customers, which were startups and also companies that aren't even in the news business.
That included some companies that were doing things with artificial intelligence and needed
news to put the metadata that's on it, maybe companies that wanted to use news for
competitive intelligence, just a variety of use cases. And so my job at that time was to drive
that new business and to look for those new markets and to grow that revenue, which grew
about a million dollars year over year in that time that I was in that role. I worked with 24 sales
representatives across the U.S. that were working in their local markets driving the initiatives
that I was identifying.

Q: How did you get tapped as an intrepreneur to begin with? You have a series of
intrapreneurial roles on your career path, but you didn't walk into a newsroom as an
intrapreneur, did you?

ER: Right. Part of it was luck. Part of it was fate. I was working for the Associated Press as a
deputy bureau chief. That's how I was recruited into the AP in June 2010 from the Detroit News.

I was 90 days into my job and the AP went through a re-organization and said, "Hello all of you
bureau chiefs. We're now changing your jobs, and you now have a complete focus on revenue
and we're removing you from being involved with the news report and the news operation.
32 INTERVIEW WITH EBONY REED

You'll come into headquarters in October. You'll get trained from the Harvard Business School,
and that'll be your new job."

So I was asked at that time whether or not I wanted to continue down that path, or whether I
wanted them to find me [another] place. I just sort of embraced the opportunity that had been
placed in front of me and I just said, "You know what? I've got a master's in media management,
I have a father that was a longtime advertising executive on the buy side, I've got an uncle that
is a VP of operations for one of the largest urban radio station chains in the U.S.," and I just
said, "I'm just going to go with this and see what happens." And so to my surprise, I actually
was pretty good at sales and then that opened the door to people listening to me about new
products and services.

The other thing that I did was that I wasn't quiet about my ideas. The AP had a business plan
competition. I had an idea for a mobile political product. At the time it was something that
AP wasn't doing and I put forth my idea and I was one of the top 12 global finalists in that
competition. So that really got the attention of senior management within the organization to
want to hear my ideas and listen to them, even though the AP didn't make the product.

Q: From your perspective, what does it mean to be an intrapreneur in a news
organization?

ER: To me it means that you have new ideas about new ways to do things. It may be that you
have new ideas about creating an experience for your digital clients or your digital users, or it
may be that you have a new idea tied to a new product and service, and that you can say, "This
is how this ties into our core mission. And it's new and it's different, and this is why we should
do it." I think being able to understand the revenue piece too is really key, because at the end of
the day, all of these media companies really need to be able to make revenue.

Q: How would you encourage young people who have great ideas and are afraid
they won't be listened to by others within the organization?

ER: So I hate to link everything back to revenue, but that's so much of the big piece. So right
now, I'm doing advertising sales as a manager at the Boston Business Journal, which is part of
American City Business Journals, and I would say while I'm not on the product team there, if
I have an idea about something that's new that we need to do in this market, I can move that
idea forward by linking it to how much revenue potential I see. I know that my boss and her
bosses want that from me, expect that from me, would be open to that. So what I would say is
to anyone that's considering a proposal for something that's new, I would just say how solid is
your business case? What is the value proposition? Why should this media company do what
you're proposing? Are you saving them time, are you saving them money, are you saving them
both? There has to be an element to it that has a benefit that's tied to financials and it's not just
cool and fun.
                                                                                                   WHAT'S AN INTRAPRENEUR? AND HOW DO I BECOME ONE? 33

One of the questions I would have, and that I think students should ask, is who else in the
organization is doing this and why do we think that this will work inside of this organization?
Because really what you're doing is you're almost building a business, building a product,
building something that doesn't exist anywhere else inside the organization and if you don't
have the support from the top down, you're just kind of spinning your wheels.

Q: Why do you enjoy this kind of a role? That sounds like hard work and a lot of
numbers. What are the best and worst parts of being an intrapreneur in a media
organization today?

ER: So my work on the advertising side ... technically I'm not in the newsroom, although I
work for a news company. I would say that the best part is recognizing that the work that I'm
doing to make things fiscally strong and financially strong is ensuring that great journalism
gets to continue happening at the organization where I am and for the industry.

I would say one of the hardest parts of this type of work is when you're a reporter, when you're
an editor, everyone wants to talk to you. Everybody wants to tell their story. Everybody has
something they want to say, but when you're on the revenue side, it is hard. It is tough. We get
a lot of no's. I tell my team, "We need three times as much revenue in our pipeline to be able to
hit our revenue goals." What that means is, is if we're doing outreach to 100 prospects, in the
back of my mind I only think 25 to 30 of them are going to be warm towards us. That means
we have a lot of people telling us no. That's just a part of the job, but at the same time, when
you come from a side of the house where everybody is warm and engaging and wants to talk
and then you come over to this side, it's a totally different experience. Totally.

Q: Do you think hearing the word "no" is really unique to that advertising side or do
you think that's also part of just being in journalism? Shouldn't my students be
prepared to have some sort of a thick skin?

ER: They will definitely hear "no" in other parts of their work, even if they're not working full-
time on the revenue side. What I would say to that is when people say no, what I say to my team
is then your next question is why. If they said no, ask why. Is it because the idea isn't realistic?
Is it because the resources are not there? Is it because they don't think the revenue would be
there, and if so, why?

Then when it's even not clear after that, ask for an example. It's another way of really getting
down to the nitty gritty of what the issue and how you can make your proposal better so that
maybe it could become a business plan that could be utilized.

Q: What traits do you think would make someone a good fit for news organization
intrapreneurship or media intrapreneurship? Or what traits would make them
34 INTERVIEW WITH EBONY REED

someone who's a better fit not to do that and just to be a newsroom employee and
what traits would make them better to be an entrepreneur than an intrapreneur?

ER: Let me separate the two terms first. So, entrepreneur means of course, you're starting your
own company, you're solely responsible, you're going to employ yourself and other people, and
it's all on you. Intrapreneurial is you're inside of a big organization. So to some extent you
like working inside of a big company. Maybe you like the resources that it provides. Maybe
you like having the amount of colleagues you can bounce ideas off of. Maybe you like having
the credibility of the name of where you work, but you're inside of a big organization. So to
me, one of the first big differences is that the intrapreneur is very comfortable and okay with
moving through that maze of that larger organization. The entrepreneur might like a much
more flat organization to work within and might not want to deal with the level of bureaucracy
to get decisions made.

When you're intrapreneur, you've got to not only put forth new and creative ideas, but you've
got to also really, really understand the organization you are maneuvering within politically.
You've got to understand it from a fiscal perspective. You've got to understand how it fits into
the greater context of the industry as a whole, which an entrepreneur has to understand too.

Q: Do you have any rules that have held true about pitching your ideas throughout
organizations or are your pitches very specific to each organization?

ER: I think it really depends on the organization, and I think it depends on the organization's
mission. I think it depends on who the players are within the organization. I think it depends
on timetables, how long you would take to get something crafted that's new. So I don't have
any set ground rules. What I would say is that I have never put forth an idea inside of an
organization where someone did not ask me what is the timetable to get this off the ground,
what are the resources that you need, and what is the revenue potential? That's something
that's been part of every conversation.

Michelle Ferrier

     "Creativity, as has been said, consists largely of rearranging what we know in order
     to find out what we do not know. Hence, to think creatively, we must be able to look
     afresh at what we normally take for granted."
     -- George Kneller, author of The Art and Science of Creativity

How do you know if your good idea is the next big thing? Whether you are an intrapreneur,
working within an existing business, or an entrepreneur looking to create a business startup,
or a student creating an idea for a class project, this question is the one that should drive you
to find answers. Unfortunately, it is not a question that can be answered on its own. It takes
answering a bunch of other questions of your potential customers, of your own motivations,
and of your idea as well. Two key qualities required to begin this journey include curiosity
and creativity. As a communicator or a student at a mass communication program, you should
already possess an innate curiosity about people, storytelling, and problem solving. Creativity
is a skill that can be cultivated as an individual or as part of group or team exercises, to
develop unusual connections, breakthroughs in processes, or insights that lead to product
development. Often, the journey to a good idea begins with asking "What if?"

Ideation is the process of coming up with an idea. It is using creativity and questions like
"What if?" to imagine ways something can be done differently. The ideation stage is critical
to ensure that you are generating good ideas from the start. It involves seeing problems
and opportunities, brainstorming around the problems you identify, and doing research to
test your assumptions about the market, your customers, and your idea. Refining that initial
idea involves assessing the market, looking at trends, and asking questions (and more
questions)--and learning from potential customers, investors, and research whether your idea
is a good one. The design process consists of a series of steps to test assumptions and ideas.
Ideation falls within a larger design process that begins with understanding who you are
serving; empathizing, understanding, and defining the needs of that target audience; then
ideating around what is needed (Figure 1):

In the Stanford School Design Thinking Process, there six stages to design1:

        Empathizing
        Defining
        Ideating
38 MICHELLE FERRIER

        Prototyping
        Testing
        Sharing

                                Figure 1. Represents six areas of design as defined by the Stanford School of Design Thinking Process.

According to 2012 research by Harvard Business School instructor Shikhar Ghosh, 75% of
venture-backed startups fail.2 Ideas are like opinions--everyone has one. If the founders of
those failed companies could have answered that question as to whether their idea was the
next big thing...well everyone wants that guarantee. But entrepreneurship is risky. Startups are
risky. You and your team are using your time and your intellectual property (ideas) to create
something new. Generating a great idea from the start is part of a larger set of success factors
such as the expertise of the founders, the competitive landscape, speed to market, and other
factors.
These other success factors include:

        The composition of the team itself;
        The execution of the concept. Is the team adaptable, effective and efficient?
        The structure or business model shows a clear revenue path and immediate revenue

          stream;
        The structure of funding; and
        The timing of the idea and its entry into the marketplace.

What ultimately matters most is not the idea, but the ability of the team to work together,
execute and test an idea, and get their idea out into the marketplace. So the ideation stage is
about minimizing the risk of failure by coming up with ideas that the world needs or wants.
Successful startups begin with a quality idea, one that is novel, encapsulates a "truth," and will
have good barriers to competitors.
Students will often come to me and say, "I've got this great idea, but I'm afraid to share it
because someone might steal it." I often coach students that their fear is preventing them from
finding other teammates, coaches, potential investors, and mentors. Timing and execution are
                                                                                                                                                            IDEATION 39

king; ideas, well, everyone has one. So if you're hoarding your ideas, you are limiting one of
your key assets, which is timing.

  Is an idea something that can be protected? Ideas themselves cannot be copyrighted, but original expressions of
  ideas in a tangible medium can earn legal protection. Review the following resources to understand what can and
  can't be protected under U.S. copyright, patent or trademark law.

But what if you don't have a great idea? How do you practice stretching your imagination to
be more creative? And what is creativity anyway? A recent article in the alumni magazine for
the University of Central Florida6 spoke to the entrepreneurial culture that has been a part
of the DNA of the institution since its founding as a technical school in 1963. Administrators
and faculty from all types of disciplines were asked to weigh in. Michael Pape, Dr. Phillips
Entrepreneur in Residence, says creativity is the hunt for an answer to a secret:

     "Creativity is a process of bringing something new into existence that challenges
     prevailing assumptions. It's fundamental to human existence. To challenge prevailing
     assumptions, you need to discover secrets." Pape says "to observe, embrace chaos, and
     try to frame it into form, you might uncover those secrets in the process."

Rick Hall, production director for the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, says that
creativity is a teachable skill.

     "Creativity is really just your ability to associate two disparate ideas in a way that
     others haven't thought of before. You've got to proceduralize creativity. And never let
     a good mistake go to waste."

I once interviewed a student at the University of Pittsburgh who got involved in
entrepreneurship because he thought himself to be someone who was creative.

     "I always wanted to pursue new ideas," he said. "It just seemed like the current system
     is kind of rigid in the sense that the older you get, the more you have to start pruning
     away some of your ideas and get a more precise focus. And for me, I kind of like things
     open-ended, and I like to really explore all these ideas that I feel is like part of one big
     puzzle. And when you put that together, that's how you get the best products because
     it draws from a number of inspirations."
40 MICHELLE FERRIER

Scanning the Environment

Pape says the creative process begins with observation. As a curious journalist, I am always on
the lookout for problems, opportunities and new ideas, observing what is happening around
me, listening to what my neighbors are talking about, and what people are struggling with in
their everyday lives. And as Hall suggests, we can "proceduralize creativity" by increasing the
juxtapositions, the opportunities for the collisions of disparate ideas that might spark the next
idea.

As an avid reader and a bit of a science geek, I am always scanning publications inside and
outside my field that feature innovations in science, medicine, technology, and journalism such
as Wired, FastCompany, and Scientific American. First, I'm learning about innovations and how
others leveraged their ideas into businesses. Second, I'm learning how founders adapt their
ideas as they learn. Third, I begin to see the world through others stories, experiences, and
disciplines that help me to "look afresh" at the world as George Knelle suggests.

Scanning the environment like this is what led me to create Troll-Busters.com in 2015 as
I observed what was occurring in social media spaces online and the challenges of women
journalists and journalists of color in maintaining a voice online in the midst of targeted online
harassment. While the idea began because of my own personal experience and the current
news of Gamergate attacks,7 I quickly validated that this was a common experience among
journalists and media organizations. The idea for TrollBusters was validated initially by the
response from female journalists themselves at a hackathon. However, we quickly began diving
into global scholarly research that further pointed to the scope and scale of the problem we
were addressing.

Through deep interviews with women journalists, we discovered a reluctance to report abuses
and a lack of knowledge about what to do next after an attack. The interviewees also talked
about the lack of support from peers and management. We started by developing awareness
campaigns and online courses that made visible what was happening all over the world and
helped women journalists take control of their own protection and speak up about the online
harassment they are experiencing.

Look to the work of futurists and others who attempt to predict the future of technology,
education, manufacturing, and other fields. Amy Webb,8 founder of the Future Today Institute,
examines trends in technology, media, and communications. In her new book, The Signals are
Talking,9 she says there are "signals" that everyone can watch for, beyond what is covered in
the technology press. She says "It's not like there's a singular source where you would go to
find the unusual suspects at the fringe. Instead, it's a series of guiding questions she uses in her
explorations:

        Who do I know of that's been working directly and indirectly in this space?
        Who's funding this work?
                                                                                                                                                            IDEATION 41

        Who's encouraging experimentation?
        Who might be directly impacted if this technology succeeds one way or the other?
        Who could be incentivized to work against any change?
        Who might see this technology as just the starting-off point for something else?"

Then the curious, like Amy, get going. They start asking questions. And reading. And listening.

The New Media Consortium started asking these questions of its employees, who were trying
to keep up with the changing technology landscape. They realized that many policy makers,
industry leaders, innovators, educators, and others struggled to keep up with technology
trends. They started the NMC Horizon Project10 to chart emerging technologies and their
implications for teaching, learning, and creative inquiry. (Note: They have ceased operation,
but the reports11 are still available. Accenture, a strategy and consulting company, creates a
technology trends report. Its 2017 Technology Vision12 report details disruptive technology
trends and deep industry knowledge. CBInsights tracks trends across multiple industry sectors
including automotive, financial tech, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, AR/VR, and
other technology areas.

In the media field, I've mentioned publications like Wired and FastCompany that provide a
deep dive into media and technology innovations. The Pew Research Center13 offers deep
research into social, religious, technology, and media trends and usage. Other media-focused
publications include MediaShift, TechCrunch, Mediagazer, and VentureBeat.

CrunchBase is a database of startups, product development timelines, funding rounds, and
other information. Add in subscriptions to online newsletters for the startup and
entrepreneurship world like Entrepreneur and Fast Company, Inc. and others to keep an eye out
on emerging, competing ideas in the market. Find these types of sources and scour them to
cultivate new ways of seeing the world, the first step to creating innovative ideas.

Thinking Creatively With Human-Centered Design

LUMA Institute defines human-centered design: "Human-Centered Design (HCD) is the
discipline of developing solutions in the service of people."14 Human-centered design (HCD)
is being adopted now by more organizations, strategists, and development practitioners and
has been taught in places like Stanford's D-School (Design School). HCD views people as the
core focus of design and development. According to LUMA Institute,15 which works with
organizations seeking to innovate:

     "Every story of a good innovation -- whether it's a new product, a new service, a new
     business model or a new form of governance -- begins and ends with people. It starts
     with careful observation of human needs, and concludes with solutions that meet or
     exceed expectations."
42 MICHELLE FERRIER

When I teach innovation, I separate the Human-Centered Design process into three phases:

          1. Inspiration Phase: Learn directly from the people you're designing for as you
          immerse yourself in their lives and come to deeply understand their needs.
          2. Ideation Phase: Make sense of what you learned, identify opportunities for design,
          and prototype possible solutions.
          3. Implementation Phase: Bring your solution to life and eventually to market. And
          you'll know that your solution will be a success because you've kept the very people
          you're looking to serve at the heart of the process.

Individuals, teams, and other groups use brainstorming and ideation to come up with better
ideas -- ideas that speed processes, ideas that create new products, ideas that create
innovations, and ideas that solve problems. But usually that activity happens in a vacuum --a
team sits around a whiteboard coming up with ideas. With human-centered design, inspiration
comes through exploration of actual people, their problems, and their needs. So ideation is
like an incubator for experimentation. The better you become at asking questions of potential
customers and getting them answered quickly, the better you can be at shaping your idea into
something that meets a need.

Ideation also involves knowing your outcome/deliverable. If you are creating ideas for a
student competition, you'll want to know the rules and what the judges will be evaluating.
Some competitions give you the problem you are attempting to solve. Your measure of success
will be in how closely your idea aligns with the competition goals. I've often judged student
competitions where there are different rubrics. The simplest I've used asks founders to ask
themselves three questions:

          1. Feasibility: Can we do this?
          2. Viability: Should we do this?
          3. Desirability: Do they want this?

The most valuable design sits at the intersection of these three questions and will help guide
you in positioning your ideas to meet market needs.

The rubric I developed for an international innovators cup competition provides a good
template to use to determine if your idea is innovative:

        Presentation was compelling, easy to understand, and described the problem and a
          "fresh"? solution.

        Meets the threshold for innovation. Judges should be guided by the reality that truly
          transformational innovation is rare. Incremental innovation is more the norm but is
          equally valuable in our competition so long as it provides an inspired solution to the
          challenge that has been posed.

        Takes full advantage of new media tools, platforms, technologies, and applications in
                                                                                                                                                   IDEATION 43

                          Figure 2. Three criteria often used for judging competitions: Desirability, Viability, and Feasibility.

   use today. These might include things like interactive design, gaming, geolocation-
   based tools, informational graphics, and all aspects of social media, etc.
 Addresses the problem within its context. It should demonstrate that it is offering an
   idea or approach that is supported by facts and/or research and demonstrates an
   understanding of today's media and communication landscape, including familiarity
   with any similar products, apps, or services.
 Understands possible roadblocks, competition, and need for a sustainable advantage.
   The solution shows an understanding of the roadblocks that need to be overcome, the
   competition, and how the solution can be sustainable.
 Provides a solution that clearly describes its main features and benefits and presents a
   valid value proposition with the key activities clearly outlined.
44 MICHELLE FERRIER

I also added this "diversity enhancement" component to the competition questions to ensure
student teams thought about and integrated the needs of underserved and underrepresented
users/customers/audiences in their solutions.

        Solution embraces diverse viewpoints, populations, or audiences. The solution
          realistically includes the potential to expand media diversity, including serving
          underserved populations:

Later in the chapter, we'll look at specific team exercises to get your group thinking
expansively, increasing the juxtaposition of disparate ideas, and generating ideas that we
can test. But first let's examine the media landscape and see if we can find interesting
juxtapositions and questions that can help us find novel ideas.

The Media Innovation Landscape

Media innovation and entrepreneurship brings together journalism, technology, and business
to create new projects inside and outside of traditional media organizations. For the media
industry, there are significant opportunities in the disruption to business models and
technological changes. This seismic shift in the monolithic news and information business
has created a landscape that has allowed new forms of journalism and technology to emerge,
driven by innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. The report "The Big Thaw: Charting
a New Future for Journalism" by Tony Deifell of Q Media Labs16 details the new competitive
landscape for today's media enterprises (Figure 3).

As Deifell's report describes, this disruption can be seen as opportunity. Each of the four
areas: new competitive landscape, new sources of value, new distinctive competencies, and
new business models presents challenges, questions, and spaces providing fertile ground for
new ideas. His four questions challenge us to continue to look to the media industry and
communication professions for opportunities by asking ourselves:

          1. How are media organizations structured to capture value?
          2. What needs can be met, problems solved, or desires fulfilled?
          3. How is the landscape changing?
          4. What new capabilities are needed to succeed?

For example, look under "New Competitive Landscape." The media industry has had to
respond to new devices and convergences. Existing companies have had to innovate and
design products to maximize the mobile experience for users of their content and products.
Think about news apps such as BBCNews17 for traditional news entities that expanded their
existing brand into a new device. We can also point to startups like FlipBoard,18 a tool
designed solely to solve the problem of making reading content easier on a mobile device.
Mike McCue, the founder of FlipBoard, says he never intended to start another company
after he sold his prior company TellMe to Microsoft. His new company started by asking
                                                                                                                                                            IDEATION 45

the question "What if?" that started him thinking about redesigning the web interface from
scratch.
The mashup of disciplines and technology yields new forms of media entrepreneurship. The
chart from The Big Thaw: Report on New Competitive Landscape, p.11 (Figure 4) shows the new
media paradigm that is driving these changes.
It was at the intersection of three disciplines -- business, nutrition, and journalism -- that
I developed the idea for LocallyGrownNews.com, which won a News Media Women's
Entrepreneur grant of $20,000 from the McCormick Foundation in 2009. The idea --
Women's Community News Franchise -- provided the infrastructure--technical, education,
writing, publishing, software, and advertising support -- to develop online community news

and information franchises. Citizen journalists and community members can focus on what
they are most passionate about -- building their community conversation through good local
information and networking.
The business structure for LocallyGrownNews.com came from the franchise business model
of providing services and growing a prototype model. The content topic came from the local
food movement that was gaining favor nationwide. Geography and journalism became my way
to solve the problem of access to fresh, local food. How could I help people live a local food
lifestyle through LocallyGrownNews.com? By providing a website with information about
                                                                                                                                                            IDEATION 47

local producers, farmers markets, and timely alerts of seasonal goods, I was able to solve the
problem of getting good information about the local produce market to my audiences. I'd
found a niche at the intersection of the growing local food movement, distributed networks of
content creators, services, and a need for good information.19

Defining the Problem Space

Before you design a solution, you need to know what problem you are trying to solve. I
often have students who want to create startup ideas that solve a personal problem. One
of my students wanted a better way to share music. Another wanted to create a way to
earn Boy Scout merit badges online. However, each of these students needs to define the
problem space to determine whether their solutions--online education and peer-to-peer
recommendations--were really a problem for other people. In other words, is this problem a
pain point for just you or are there others? Is there a real problem with a large enough market
that needs a solution? To define the problem space, we need to start with a more expansive
view of what we are dealing with to determine what might be the best solution.

Remember the three questions we asked earlier in the chapter?

          1. Feasibility: Can we do this?
          2. Viability: Should we do this?
          3. Desirability: Do they want this?

At this point in the process, we are trying to answer the desirability question...Do they want
this? So we have to define who is the "they" in this question, and then brainstorm to discover
the "this" or solution in the question we want to test. We can use human-centered design
to experiment and match our solutions to customer needs at the sweet spot in the center of
feasibility, viability, and desirability.20

Working the Problem Space

So let's say you are trying to develop concierge college admissions services. That's the business
you want to create. But what is the problem you are trying to solve? Often, students jump to
a solution before diving deeply into understanding the problem space. Who is experiencing
pain? Is it painful enough that people are seeking solutions and willing to shell out money?

Stanford University's D-School has developed exercises for brainstorming and developing
ideas. LUMA Institute and IDEO.org are two additional companies that help organizations
think more expansively and deliver ideas that meet human needs.

Stakeholder Mapping

To visualize who is impacted by the problem you are trying to solve, you can use a stakeholder
map to get a sense of the problem space, the actors in it, and who your solutions might address.
For example, students in a social media class were attempting to create tools and strategies to
reach out to potential undergraduate students for college admissions. Of course, they started
with the pain points and perspective of high school students having recently been in the search
for colleges themselves. However, by identifying other stakeholders that play a role in the
admissions process, the students were able to identify other pain points and possible solutions
that addressed parents, admission counselors, and other stakeholders in the map (Figure 6).
To begin, you need stickies and limited drawing ability. Also a large blank canvas of paper.

          a marker.

        Independently, team members are invited to brainstorm potential stakeholders in the
          problem space. In our example above, we went beyond the college organization to
          look at the role of parents, high school counselors, government agencies, and others
          play in the college decision process. Individual work should be given about one
          minute.

        Collectively, the team goes through its stakeholders, identifying commonalities and
          defining the roles more clearly by adding a visual element or a speech bubble to
          suggest what the person may be saying or thinking. These stakeholder stickies are put
          up on the blank canvas by consensus of the group.

        Organize the stakeholders by grouping entities that are linked by geography or
          processes. Use lines to draw relationships between stakeholders. For example, a line
          between parents and the financial aid office of a college might be drawn with dollar
          signs on it.

        Discuss in the group where there are breakdowns, pain points, and other places where
          innovation might help to solve the problem. These discussions can then be used to
          refine who the customer might be for your efforts -- students, parents, college
          administrators, etc. -- and who will pay for your solution.

        Select the stakeholders that you will continue to ideate around as potential customers.

Statement Starters

One exercise, found at LUMA Institute,21 is designed to ask "What if?" types of questions:
open-ended questions that become the jumping point for brainstorming. Sample statement
starters include: What if_____? or How might we_____? These statement starters are then
attached to the problems you've identified in your stakeholder mapping exercise.
Brainstorming then happens around the problem you've identified.

IDEO has a design kit22 with many examples.

Other Tools You Can Use

        IDEO's Design Kit resource23 will help you work with students in brainstorming
          exercises like the Mash Up which encourages students to think outside of the box to
          create brilliant proposals and solutions.

        Check out this collection of Human-Centered Design methods24 you can use to guide
          students in the ideation phase.

        LUMA offers an online platform25 to help people implement Human-Centered
          Design using LUMA's "flexible, repeatable and easy-to-learn" system of Human-
          Centered Design.

Validated Learning

Eric Ries of The Lean Startup advocates "failing fast." What he's suggesting is that teams
quickly move through the ideation stage to customer discovery and testing phases, tossing out
assumptions and ideas that fail to meet customer needs.
52 MICHELLE FERRIER

IDEAS  BUILD (CODE)  MEASURE (DATA) LEARN

You and your team will engage in a process of validated learning...confirming your
assumptions through user testing, research, interviews, or ethnography. You may also build
test sites or "smoke tests"--fake websites that walk users through the solution to see if they will
pull out their wallet and buy (but don't use your real domain name for these tests). You may
pivot or change ideas after getting feedback or may find yourself back at the empathy stage,
gathering more information about the problem space before creating new solutions. The idea
is to stay lean and iterate quickly through ideas: build, measure, and learn.

With validated learning, you can test your value hypothesis -- the value proposition that you
are offering to your customers -- or your growth hypothesis, how you intend to scale your
company by testing new markets, or types of users. A hypothesis template looks like this:

     We believe that ______ will cause [the users] to [do this action/behavior] because of [value
     proposition].

An example might be:

     We believe that an augmented reality shopping app will cause brick-and-mortar shoppers
     to walk into stores more frequently because of the urgency and proximity of the deals and
     discounted offers.

Hypotheses are tested using the traditional research methodologies and a prototype or
minimum viable product (MVP) of your idea. A prototype is a reduced version of your actual
product or service, featuring just key features or functions. Version One of your product has
every feature and function that users might need. A prototype can be developed in a few hours
or days, while your first full version may take months.

Your team will define the hypothesis, determine how you will test the hypothesis, and assess
what you learned from the results. Developers use A/B testing to try two different solutions
and see which one gets the best response. This testing might be two different designs of a home
page, testing color schemes or even two different solutions.

Before you spend valuable time and money rolling out a product that no one needs, a prototype
and idea testing can help refine your ideas and discard or enhance your product or service
features.

SWOT Analysis

Once you have identified the problem your group intends to solve, you must ask if another
product already addresses it. If so, how? Conduct a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities, and Threats) analysis from the point of view of the competition. (Download a

    You've come up with an entrepreneurial idea. Now, how do you identify and find customers for it? The next
    chapter, Customer Discovery, will help.
CUSTOMER DISCOVERY

by Ingrid Sturgis

Summary

This chapter focuses on a fundamental dilemma for entrepreneurs: How to identify your
customer or market, or in this case, your readers, viewers or listeners. To develop a successful
media company, entrepreneurs must know who the audience is and how to reach it. Making
the exercise a bit more tricky today is that the customer for news and information is very
different than in the past. Influenced by an ever-evolving media ecosystem, today's audience
or customers are not just in a single place. They hang out on social media, use smartphones
or gaming devices, or even watch streamed programming on television, sometimes all at once.
Understanding the new media ecosystem will help entrepreneurs to understand who they are
trying to reach, the scope of their business venture, and how to best allocate financial and
human resources.

                                        Learning Objectives

             Understand the new media ecosystem and how disruption and convergence has reshaped the
               media marketplace.

             Conduct effective audience research to define your customer and understand the differences
               between segments of the audience.

             Develop a systematic approach to identify and understand the needs of your customer.
             Identify and refine a target audience for a media product.
             Develop skills to discover market demographics and build your customer's psychographic profile.

AND TECH STARTUPS

Ingrid Sturgis

What Is a Media Ecosystem?

Derived from the physical science term ecosystem, which describes the interdependence of
organisms and their physical environment, a media ecosystem is the system of
interdependency among media-related entities such as newspapers, magazines, radio,
television, as well as the Internet, and user-generated content, including blogs, audio and video
platforms, social networks, and communications devices such as tablets and smartphones.

To define the new media ecosystem, you have to go back in time to understand what the
media business was like before the Internet (Figure 1). Back then, the high costs of traditional
publishing-- paper, printing presses, newsroom personnel, unions, equipment, and
distribution--ensured a high barrier to entry for would-be newspaper publishers. Scarce
resources allowed publishers to control all levels of the news production process, including
distribution and sales. They also created an environment that helped advertising agencies
grow. Advertising became one of the primary revenue streams for publishers to offset the
expensive production process. Reporters and editors were the gatekeepers who determined
what stories and information would be covered and disseminated. Customers were observers.
They consumed what they were given. Their input with the publishing process was typically
as part of a community board, if a news organization had one, or as writers of letters to the
editor to complain or praise the coverage of a news story. In the days of mass media, news and
information content was designed to be delivered to the largest audiences, whose attention
and engagement fueled the ecosystem.

In the mid-1990s, the Internet began to upend the newspaper business. The digital, interactive
technology spurred the convergence, or merging, of mass media including print, television,
radio, the Internet, and telecommunications into a digital format. Barriers like million-dollar
printing presses had kept competitors out of the marketplace for content and audiences.
With digital products, the barriers to entry into the marketplace fell. Today, anyone can be
a publisher, or as professor Jay Rosen1 of New York University put it, "the people formerly
known as the audience now have some control of the message and access to dissemination."
Everyone is contributing to this larger media ecosystem. The advantages for mass media
                                                                                                 CUSTOMER DISCOVERY FOR CONTENT AND TECH STARTUPS 61

publishers have shrunk dramatically, creating a fundamental shift in the balance of power
between traditional media and its customers. Traditional media is no longer the gatekeeper
of news as new voices and niche content continue to grow online (Figure 2). Social media
platforms and online tools have allowed customers to talk back, talk to each other, as well as
create, share, and alter information outside traditional media organizations (Figure 3).
The social media space has spawned much of the disruption of the distribution model of
publishing. Peer-to-peer technologies have dislodged industry "middle men" and challenged
many media industries including music, software, and other fields like travel. Innovations in
digital technologies disrupted media spaces, connecting consumers to each other in spaces like
eBay and etsy.com or in streaming music spaces like Pandora or in the recommendations and
review sections of websites like Amazon and in forums like Reddit.
The 2017 Conversation Prism Version 5.0 (Figure 4), is an ever-changing attempt to visualize
these social networks and spaces emerging on the web. The graphic, originally created in
2008,2 maps the evolving "conversation space" that includes such digital behemoths as
Facebook and Twitter, but also new spaces and innovations in areas such as the quantified
self where we digitally capture human body functions through wearables or virtually compete
in a run with friends. The Conversation Prism Knowledge Wiki3 created by Dr. Michelle
Ferrier and her undergraduate students at Ohio University provides a deeper look at each of
those tools and platforms in the prism and includes a general overview of the tool/platform,
the history of the space, the technological events that caused the tool to emerge, as well as
current and future challenges. Each area of the prism is explored more fully, including a pro-
con analysis of the top tools in each area and their functions, along with user personas of those
using the tool and target audiences.
In the past decade, the digital revolution has transformed the media, disrupting traditional

methods of reporting, distribution, and news presentation. The development of high-speed
Internet-connected tablets, smartphones, touch-screen displays, large screens, and small
monitors provides content creators with an evolving array of platforms on which to imagine,
redesign, and create innovative multimedia news products. Worldwide adoption of social
media--Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and others--has changed
the flow of information and redefined the media ecosystem. The shift is more than just losing
market share to the latest fad in widgets; it has expanded the media ecosystem.
Today, like a thriving wildlife habitat, there is a dynamic news ecosystem made up of many
people, organizations, Internet Service Providers, and media companies working to meet
the news and information needs of communities. For example, Jeff Jarvis,4 director of the
Tow-Knight Center at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism,
resides in New Jersey, where he says the media ecosystem, "has a growing and disorganized
                                                                                                 CUSTOMER DISCOVERY FOR CONTENT AND TECH STARTUPS 63

hodgepodge of sites, services, communities, and individuals that operate on various platforms
with different motives, with more or fewer resources, and with business models from none to
not-for-profit to hoping-for-profit to profitable. They all contribute to a larger ecosystem of
information in the state and its communities."
In addition, new social media platforms and technologies are continuing to reshape the media
landscape. In the content space with the proliferation of niche and individualized content and
the technology and new devices and network spaces, new media startups continue to shape a
very different digital information culture and marketplace.

Define the Market

What to call your customer: Or is it the audience or the public?

A customer is the person who buys what you are selling. The audience are the people who see
your work. The audience is generally larger than your customer base and may include some of
your customers. Users are the people who engage with your publication through digital media
and technology.

How do you go about learning what your empowered customer or audience wants? The
first step is called "customer discovery."5 The objective is to refine the problem you are
solving for the customer and to determine which market segment is the target of the solution.
The market segmentation graphic shows that your idea may target any of these market
segments--demographic, psychographic, behavioral, or geographic--individually or in
combination (Figure 5):

Figure 5. Main Bases of Segmentation

For example, Blavity6 founders Morgan DeBaun and Aaron Samuels knew they wanted to
create a community for black millennials and multicultural influencers. They identified both
a demographic and a psychographic market segment underserved by other media companies.
The two founders developed some basic assumptions about their customer and identified the
problem they needed to solve for the customer. They were then able to turn those assumptions
into hypotheses that they could test.

They were able to tap into several prevailing assumptions and trends:

        African-Americans millennials were valued as trendsetters and influencers in popular
66 INGRID STURGIS

          culture as well as "early adapters" of new technology--early adopters who remix and
          adapt current technologies.
        African-Americans were frustrated by a low level of inclusion of Blacks in television
          programs, advertising and point-of-purchase communication; and,
        African-American-oriented news media were losing circulation and struggling to find
          advertising revenue.

As a result of its sharp content focus on surfacing the voice of this underserved community and
the use of digital technologies to develop its content platform, Blavity has grown to become
one of the fastest-growing digital media outlets on the web, reaching nearly 7 million users
a month7 since its launch in 2014. DeBaun and Samuels say their focus on user-generated
content, video, and a custom-designed backend, offers a space for black millennials to own
their story and share their perspective.

These founders are practicing what entrepreneur and author Johnathan M. Holifield calls
"inclusive competitiveness," which he defines as "a framework that allows businesses to
capitalize on the potential of underserved audiences to help fuel the next generation economic
vitality in a way that is more inclusive and durable."8

Inclusive competitiveness, Holifield says in his 2017 groundbreaking book, seeks to tap the
talents of diverse, disconnected workers, including blacks, Latinos, women, and residents of
low-income communities, to participate in the global innovation economy.

Conducting Market Research

Audience analysis is a key component of customer discovery. Good product or service
solutions come from a human-centered approach to design. Likewise, the business model
will evolve as you explore your customers' needs. Identifying your initial target market will
help you more clearly define the scope of your project and plan for the first several years of
operations. It also will help you figure out how to allocate your scarce resources--time and
money. For an entrepreneur to be successful, they must have a firm perspective of the people
they are trying to serve, including their needs, habits, aspirations, and environment.

To engage in audience analysis is easier today with all the demographic resources available
online. There are a number of market research reports to help entrepreneurs refine
segmentation, consumer preferences, as well as compile demographic profiles that can help
them discover motivations and buying patterns.

Websites such as Forrester,9 eMarketer,10 Pew Research Center, Nielsen, and American Press
Institute offer demographic data that can be used to get a better sense of the digital skills,
income, lifestyle, and news and entertainment habits of your target market. The data provided
by these organizations--some of which is released for free--can be used to fill in demographic
and psychographic information about your potential users.
                                                                                                 CUSTOMER DISCOVERY FOR CONTENT AND TECH STARTUPS 67

For example, entrepreneurs can start with gathering demographic information, such as age,
ethnic background, income, gender, and more from the U.S. Census Bureau,11 which offers a
birds-eye view of demographic trends in everything from the economy to entrepreneurship to
workforce and population shifts. Similarly, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)12 focuses
on the economy by providing relevant data on issues such as economic growth, regional
economic development, inter-industry relationships, and the United States' position in the
world economy.

For media research, Pew Research Center13 is a think tank and an excellent repository of
trends and data on news and information, audience engagement, social media, and emerging
news providers. The American Press Institute14 has developed a tool called Metrics for News,
content analysis software that helps publishers better measure audience engagement. Local
Independent Online News (LION) Publishers15offers workshops to help small publishers to
develop skills to build their audiences. Kantar Media16 offers international consumer insights
for advertisers, agencies, and media owners to reach key consumer audiences. In addition
to its focus on online and offline consumer behavior, attitudes, and media consumption,
Kantar specializes in sports, healthcare markets, and new technology. Finally, Nielsen17 offers
information on consumer trends and habits worldwide.

Creating User Personas

Now that you have discovered the demographics of your audience, you have a good idea as
to whether your customers are using the devices you are designing for, whether they use
other media, and where they are located. But this data is for your whole target audience. How
can you focus on the needs and design for your "ideal user"? User personas are tools that
entrepreneurs can use to drill down into the ideal audience member and add psychographic
information such as behaviors and lifestyle information. According to HubSpot, a company
that provides social media marketing, content management, web analytics, and search engine
optimization services, demographics explain who your customer is while psychographics
explain why they buy.18

Usability.gov, a leading resource for guidelines and best practices in user experience
online, says the purpose of personas is to "create reliable and realistic representations of your
key audience segments for reference."19 When used as part of a strategy called user-centered
design or human-centered design, personas can help to tell the story of your customers' needs.
They also help to define your brand and your mission, as well as how to market your site.
Often, a user persona will include demographic data like "50-year old, African-American
female, married, earns $75K a year," as well as specifics like "picks children up from school
at 3 p.m. and drives to after-school activities three times a week." Some teams give their user
personas names and even draw or find an image that represents their ideal customer. The goal
is to know how your ideal user goes about his or her life and how your product or service will
intersect with their lifestyle.

Entrepreneurs must learn to dig deeply into their customers' media consumption habits.
Consider:

        Information needs. What information or activities will serve the user's needs? Will
          they need to perform online transactions to purchase products, such as event tickets?

        Research modes. Where does your targeted user search for information? How do
          they prefer to access information?

        Expertise. Is your targeted user knowledgeable about the information you provide?
          Or do they need explainer videos with background information, like those provided
          by Vox?20

        Technology. How will users access your information? Will they use mobile devices or
          laptops? Will they be comfortable with the latest technology trends or will they need
          help navigating to new technology on your site?

How do you develop psychographic information for user personas? Many large corporations
use observation. This can take the form of field trips or site visits to meet their customers
where they are likely to be. For example, cosmetic companies will visit college campuses
during homecoming to meet students they view as their target market. Essence magazine holds
a music festival in New Orleans every year with empowerment and editorial meet-and-greet
sessions to develop a deeper understanding of readers' needs. Local newspapers often attend
community events like weekly farmers markets to meet their customers. Others conduct focus
groups where potential customers discuss their interests, activities, and opinions.

But it does not have to be that organized. As media entrepreneurs, you can use your journalism
training to meet and interview potential customers everywhere from the grocery store line
to the car wash to the street fair to collect information to create user personas. Interview
them about their reading and shopping habits. Do they read magazines or read stories via
smartphones using Snapchat? Do they access the web via tablet or laptop? Do they send email
or text messages? Do they binge-watch on Netflix or seek out must-see TV? Ask about their
values, personal goals, opinions, hobbies, interests, shopping habits, entertainment interests,
and lifestyle. Use their answers to develop a solid understanding of your audience.

User Persona Tools

Once you have identified where you want to conduct your psychographic research, consider
the information you need to build your profiles. There are a number of resources to help
develop psychographic user personas. Smashing Magazine21 offers a closer look at personas.

Behance,22 a creative talent website, has a helpful tool to help entrepreneurs envision features
and services that would benefit specific users. Marketing company XPLANE has created the
Empathy Map, a tool that can help to create a user focused profile. XPLANE's worksheet
focuses on getting at what's most important for your customers--defining their goals and
aspirations as well as their preoccupations. It also asks about their environment and influences
                                                                                                 CUSTOMER DISCOVERY FOR CONTENT AND TECH STARTUPS 69

as well as their behavior toward others. The Empathy Map worksheet23 focuses on six
questions that media entrepreneurs can use to develop strong psychographic profiles.

          1. What does your customer think and feel?
          2. What does your customer hear?
          3. What does your ideal customer see?
          4. What does your ideal customer say and do?
          5. What are her pains, fears, frustrations, obstacles?
          6. What are her gains, wants, needs, measures of success?
Two important elements that should not be overlooked in developing these personas are
culture and language. The U.S. Census Bureau forecasts major demographic shifts that can
significantly impact businesses serving consumers. According to Johnathan M. Holifield,24
diversity remains a strong economic driver and entrepreneurs must adopt a strategy that
embraces diversity through inclusive competitiveness.
In addition, media entrepreneurs must also make sure to take into consideration their target
customers' media habits. For example, when talking with a young man working as a cashier at
Target, a media entrepreneur was able to learn that he was a student at a local college. He said
he thought print publications were going extinct and digital was the way to go. He got his news
and information from ESPN and GQ channels using the Snapchat app on his smartphone. If
you are targeting a customer like him, choosing the right platforms to reach him is important.
Here is a very basic user persona based upon what we know about the ideal customer for a
women's magazine (Figure 6):

                                                     Figure 6. Psychographic profile of a young online magazine reader.

Here is what a set of user personas might look like for a general interest newsmagazine (Figure

Check Website Analytics

Once your site is up and running, you can examine the data from the content to get a good
idea what has moved people to click, call, or buy. Basic tools like Google Analytics25 can give
a snapshot of the user, as will Facebook or Twitter26 analytic tools. Other more commercial
marketing analytics include HubSpot,27 Alexa, Chartbeat, and Viafoura.

The Wall Street Journal online media kit28 uses information gathered from the commercial
analytics tool comScore Media Metrix. In this sample from the first quarter of 2017,29
WSJ.com gathered information from users who visited the site on its digital platforms in the
past 30 days with a household income of $100,000 or higher. According to the media kit,
WSJ.com reaches top management and has a reach of 42 million digital readers per month,
all seeking news and information critical to their businesses and personal lives. Their users
are made up of more men than women with an average age of 43. The users have an average
household income of $242,000 and an average net worth of $1.5 million. Most have graduated
from college and slightly less than half are considered millionaires.

Do a Competitive Analysis

A competitive analysis allows you to unearth your direct and indirect competitors. You may
think you're competing with a known competitor (let's say another media outlet in your same
niche) but on the Internet, everyone has the potential to be your competitor for audience. This
is especially true when we think about "search," meaning when potential users are looking for
a product like yours. Where do they end up?

If you have a Google Adwords account, you can use Google's Keyword Planner30 tool without
placing an ad. You can also get data from Google Trends,31 though if your product is in a less
mainstream niche, it may not be helpful.

With paid software, such as SEMRush32 and SpyFu,33 you can see what your potential
audience (and your competitors' existing audience) is searching for that is resulting in traffic
to their site.

For instance, on SpyFu, you can type in the URL of a competitor's website and the software
shows you its organic competitors on the Internet.

Let's say you were the editor of Entrepreneur magazine. You could type in
https://www.entrepreneur.com and find out that your competitors not only include Inc
Magazine but also bplans.com. You could see which keywords are especially valuable
(attracting lots of traffic). And you can see where your keywords intersect, and where you're
72 INGRID STURGIS

doing better and worse than competitors at capturing an audience interested in topics relevant
to your media business and outlet. You can sort and use this information to determine where
it might make sense for you to add content to serve the needs of your niche (as demonstrated
by search) and compete better in search.

These tools are also useful if you do paid advertising to attract people to your site. They let
you see whether competitors are placing PPC (pay-per-click) ads, and in some cases, the best-
performing PPC ads themselves.

All of this competitive intelligence can help you make decisions about your editorial narrative
and content direction, as well as your ad strategy and marketing in general. We'll talk more
about Marketing in the Marketing & Analytics chapter.34

Conduct a User Survey

You can gather information to validate your assumptions by conducting a survey. It is another
useful source of information on potential customers' habits, needs, and consumption patterns.
Surveys can be designed and distributed online, or conducted by telephone or in person.
Research gleaned from surveys allows you to see similarities among target users. For example,
a survey may reveal that many of your users take yoga classes. Your research may show
that millennials indicated an interest in trap yoga, that seniors seek chair yoga, or that men
are trying bro yoga. A survey can help identify your audience's needs. You can then use the
survey information to fine-tune your unique value proposition and distinguish your product
from your competition. For example, The Texas Tribune describes itself as the "only member-
supported, digital-first, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans--and engages
with them--about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues."35 According to
a report by Southern Methodist University journalism Professor Jake Batsell for the John S.
and James L. Knight Foundation, "Earning Their Keep: Revenue Strategies From the Texas
Tribune and Other Nonprofit News Startups,"36 The Texas Tribune conducted an audience
identification survey in 2012 that revealed that most of their readers were college graduates
who voted in the last election and that half had household incomes of more than $100,000.
This research helped the Tribune raise $300,000 from one sponsor to reach its affluent,
intellectual audience. Instead of seeing itself as a competitor to other local news organizations,
the Tribune calls itself a supplemental news source for Texas. Where other news organizations
have cut back on statehouse coverage, The Texas Tribune covers it and supplies it to newspapers
around the state. The Tribune's unique value proposition is that it is filling a need that was
going unmet for its audience (readers) and it has made customers of competitors by providing
in-depth political coverage.

Now that you have acquired your audience, what can you do to keep them and make them pay
for your products and services?37
                                                                                                 CUSTOMER DISCOVERY FOR CONTENT AND TECH STARTUPS 73

1. Create opportunities for in-person engagement.

Face-to-face events help to develop audience loyalty, according to Batsell.38

Some examples include The Texas Tribune Festival, which engages Tribune readers as well
as sponsors and advertisers. The events can include readings with local and well-known
authors, meet-the-staff sessions, coffee shop or interest group meetups, summer festivals, or
discounted group outings. The idea is to deliver unique experiences, Batsell says, that are
worth the time. The payoffs can be building trust with your audience as well as increased
online engagement and corporate support.39

2. Crowdsource the news.

Use your users as a news resource. User Generated Content is any type of content -- text,
YouTube videos, audio, testimonials, tweets, Facebook posts, etc. that has been created by
unpaid contributors, which publishers may distribute on their sites and use to promote their
brands.

For example, Off The Bus 201240 was an Open Reporting initiative of Huffington Post and
News Assignment to cover the 2012 election. It encouraged readers to attend political events,
record them, and submit them to the online publication. Twelve thousand people signed up.
Public participation gave readers an inside view of the projects that the site was reporting on,
spurred reader trust, and improved communication with its audience. Using readers in this
way can help build trust and develop a stronger story because the user may have some access
or knowledge that the news organization does not. However, be careful of online commenting.
Some news organizations have had to find improved ways to manage the troubling comments
that arise from some stories.

3. Serve a niche.

Social media technology allows news organizations to serve a narrow, but passionate niche.
Called passionate verticals, this niche can be defined by geography or interests. One example is
SCOTUSblog, a law blog that focuses on the Supreme Court of the United States (abbreviated
as SCOTUS) by tracking live cases as well as maintaining an archive of cases argued before the
court. Written by lawyers, law professors, and law students, the site leadership also live-blogs
court decisions and hosts symposiums with influential experts on important court cases.

4. Develop alternative story forms.

Advances in technology have made it easier and more affordable to give your targeted audience
new interactive experiences that can spur engagement and keep them on-site longer. Use of
gaming techniques and data-driven graphics and immersive video projects can give users an
74 INGRID STURGIS

opportunity to explore a subject deeply or to provide entertainment. For example, the New
York Times garnered praise for "Snow Fall,"41 an interactive, seamless multimedia blending
of video, photos, and graphics in a series about an avalanche. Similarly, Wired magazine's
"Cutthroat Capitalism" game42 brought home the geopolitical social and economic issues that
drove desperate Somali fishermen to hijack and capture ships for ransom. Both interactive
projects entertained and informed readers as well as provided professional buzz for the work
of the news organizations.

5. Develop paying customers for your product.

There was a time when newspapers relied on advertising for most of their revenue. A trope
was that readers would not pay for content, and many news organizations opted to make their
content free to everyone online. As their online audiences grew, many media entrepreneurs
were hesitant to ask them to pay. That mindset has thankfully passed. Now sites like the New
York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post feature "metered" pay walls that give users a
glimpse of their news product and entice them to pay after a certain number of views. Other
media entrepreneurs have used crowdfunding to raise money for their sites and others offer
modest subscription rates, which indicate readers are willing to pay for news. But users paying
for news may not be enough to fund a project. Media entrepreneurs have to develop a variety
of products for their audience. They can include events; special news products, such as special
commemorative issues; access to specialized data; access to technology tools; and company
promotional and branding souvenirs.43

Once you learn how to identify and understand your customer, you will gain an invaluable
skill that will serve you greatly as an entrepreneur as well as in other endeavors. Overall, be
willing to adapt and change as your market evolves and grows.

TECHNOLOGY PLAYS

Geoffrey Graybeal

Dive In

A business model helps to clarify a company's main purpose, such as who they're serving,
how they help, and how the company can sustain its operations. A business model is distinctly
different from an organization's strategy, which typically addresses product, pricing, and
marketing decisions. A formal business plan, however, may include some of these elements as
part of the company's long-term goals and objectives.

                                                                              (e.g. revenue
                                                                              streams).

Each business model is unique to a company. There is not an industry-wide business model per
se although companies may coalesce around a dominant company's successful business model
and seek to emulate it.

Business models provide a rationale for how a business creates, delivers, and captures value,1
and examine how the business operates, its underlying foundations, and the exchange
activities and financial flows upon which it can be successful.2

A business model canvas is a tool to map out and plan the different components to a business
model. The components vary based on the canvas tool you use, with the most widely used one
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 85

developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur in the book Business Model Generation, or available
online through a series of customizable tools and canvases available for a fee on
strategyzer.com.

      Figure 2. This image is licensed CC BY-SA 3.0. The Business Model Canvas is included here with permission from Strategyzer. Download the canvas at
                                                          https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas.

The Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas blocks3 include revenue stream, customer segments,
value proposition, cost structures, channels, key activities, key partners, key resources, and
customer relationships.
Early on, your greatest focus should be on the right side of the canvas because:

        These are in many ways the most critical aspects of starting a new venture (customer
          segments, value proposition, channels, and revenue streams).

        The most fluid (revenue streams, channels, and value propositions will likely differ for
          the differing customer segments and as you iterate and pivot throughout the
          customer discovery process could change).

        It follows a logical temporal order (there's no need to focus on the costs of building a
          company if you won't have customers).

In a follow up to Business Model Generation, the Strategyzer team created a second canvas, the
86 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

Value Proposition Canvas. Value Proposition Canvas4 is a new tool that pulls out the customer
segment and value proposition blocks of the business model canvas and encourages more in-
depth exploration of those blocks to achieve "fit" between the two. The Value Proposition
Canvas tool looks at customer pains, gains and jobs-to-be-done on the customer side and
painkillers, gain creators, and products and services on the value proposition side.

A revenue model focuses on an organization's revenue streams, e.g., how a company will
make money, whereas a business model also concerns itself with other issues such as who
the product is serving, how it is distributed and promoted, and key partnerships used in
implementing it. In short, a revenue model is just one component of a business model. A
typical business model has multiple elements (nine in the case of the Osterwalder and Pigneur
model). A revenue model is primarily focused on how a company will make money.

For traditional legacy media outlets, such as a newspaper, revenue streams typically
encompassed advertising and consumer payment either through subscription or alternate
payment methods like single-sale purchases.

Hayes and Graybeal (2012) provide an overview of categorizations of online business models
from the late 1990s to late 2000s from scholars and industry practitioners, including many
online content plays. Revenue models were the most common components found in all forms
of business model classifications. Value streams and logistical streams were also equally
important in e-commerce models.5

Think of a business model canvas as an ideation tool to help brainstorm and flesh out your
startup concept. The business model is a more adaptable, flexible tool that can be used to
formulate the ideas that would later be fleshed out in a more formal business plan.

A business plan is a formal document, presented to prospective investors, that typically
includes elements such as an executive summary, business description, marketing strategy,
and competitive analysis. A business plan may also include a business model canvas as
supplemental material in an appendix.

You should usually develop a business model before a business plan. But before you get to
a business model, first and foremost, you need an idea. There are numerous resources for
brainstorming activities and entrepreneurial processes to help develop an idea and flesh it out
to be "market-ready." (see previous chapter on Ideation6) Original ideas are sometimes hard to
come by.

Early research into competitors helps as a starting point. Who else has had this idea? Has this
idea been tried before and failed? That's not necessarily a dealbreaker. As renowned media
economist Robert Picard notes, just because an idea failed at one point in time, under a certain
set of circumstances, that doesn't mean a failed idea can't be revisited.7

Another entrepreneurial startup truism is that no matter how great your idea may be, if no one
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 87

will use your product, then you're dead on arrival. So startup ideas need customers to become
a business. Thus, the various entrepreneurial processes, whether that is business model canvas
tools, lean startup principles and methodologies, or other approaches, focus a great deal on the
customer.
The Osterwalder and Pigneur book describes a process of creating a customer empathy map
to distill down your ideal target customer. Bring to life an individual, and delve into his or
her fears, dreams, aspirations, and what she or he does in the everyday life. After identifying
your target customer, you can begin to segment your audience. But start with an individual
customer, idealized or actualized, and distill deeply into that customer profile.8

   Figure 3. Empathy map by Paul Boag, Copyright Boagworld, used with permission. https://boagworld.com/usability/adapting-empathy-maps-for-ux-design/

The Customer Empathy Map is an idealized portrayal of your fictionalized target customer,
the most promising candidate from your customer segments. Give him or her a name and
demographic characteristics, such as income, marital status, and so forth, before delving into
the pains, gains, thoughts, feelings, and surroundings of this individual you bring to fruition.
This is an approach that has long been used in media and communication fields such as
advertising and strategic communication. Advertisers and marketers often create customer
personas-fictional, generalized representations of ideal or existing customers-as part of
campaign plans, pitches, strategy, and creative concept delivery.
When you peel away the language used to describe business models, the early startup planning
stages come down to asking a series of questions. Another popular framework used in
88 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

entrepreneurial circles when it comes to formulating a business model for a startup concept is
that of desirability-feasibility-viability.

This forces the entrepreneur to address broad questions about the startup concept.

Desirability: How desirable is the product? Who will use it and why?

Feasibility: How feasible is this idea? What are the costs to make it? How practical is the
concept?

Viability: Will this idea remain viable? How will it make money? How will it be sustained over
time?

These questions then begin to connect together to form a narrative about where the startup
concept came from, who it serves, why it's needed, how it will make money, and how it will be
sustained in the future.

Business Models

Although there is not a single definition to the term business model and usage varies widely,
in standard business usage a "business model" can denote how costs will be covered as well as
how a business creates and delivers value for itself and its customers, including the ways in
which products are made and distributed. Academic strategists tend to use the term business
model to describe the configuration of resources in response to a particular strategic
orientation.111213

Most people are familiar with Business to Consumer models (also referred to as BTC or B2C).
In a Business-to-Consumer model, the business primarily provides services to consumers.
Many of the common media content plays are considered B2C. Newspapers, television shows,
films, and video games are primarily B2C companies. Many apps that individual users
download and then consume content from are B2C. Because media companies are typically
providing content that is of value to consumers, they look like a B2C, however, they use the
attention of those consumers to sell advertising space to businesses, effectively operating as
a B2B. Business to business to consumer (or B2B2C or BtoBtoC) is another prominent e-
commerce model, that combines Business to Business and Business to Consumer in a complete
product or service transaction.

Nascent startup Shine, which officially launched its inspirational text message service in
Spring 2016, is an example of following a classic Business-to-Consumer model. (Full
disclosure: I taught one of the founders.) Through automated texts, Shine delivers daily self-
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 89

help, encouragement and advice to its subscribers via either SMS or Facebook Messenger.
Anyone can use the free service, but it is primarily aimed at millennials and about 70 percent
of users are female.

On the Brooklyn-based company's one-year anniversary in April 2017, the Shine team
announced that it had obtained half a million users. Co-founders Marah Lidey and Naomi
Hirabayashi raised $2.5 million to further develop Shine in a funding round led by Betaworks
and Eniac Ventures, and including Female Founders Fund, Felix Capital, Comcast Venture,
BBG Ventures, The New York Times, and Ed Zimmerman.

They want to expand the service to be included on other platforms like Line and WeChat.

The problem Shine tackles is that "self-help is broken" and its value proposition addresses
in part what is known as "the confidence gap," often cited as a barrier that holds women
back when it comes to advancing in their careers, raising money, investing, and planning
retirement.

Shine has four pillars it is built to address: mental health, confidence, daily happiness, and
productivity.

In 2015, Hirayabashi and Lidey began to focus on turning their idea into a reality. The two met
at and worked together at DoSomething.org, a youth-oriented global nonprofit organization.
They conducted a closed test with 70 individuals before publicly releasing Shine in beta in
October 2015. They formally left DoSomething.Org in April 2016 and Shine was born.

While the messaging service is free, the company has experimented with adding revenue
streams through additional consumer services. Shinevisor provides advice and guidance from
real people who are certified life, career, and school coaches. That service currently runs
$15.99 per week billed on a 12-week basis. Shinevisor is an early effort of Shine to add
additional services that bring in revenue, as multiple revenue streams are most often needed
for a company to succeed.

While Shine, apps and a majority of content plays are primarily B2C, the other predominant
business model is that of a Business to Business, also commonly referred to as B2B or BTB.
Whereas Shine is a business whose product serves customers, in a Business to Business model,
a company primarily serves other businesses, not individual consumers.

MailChimp, an Atlanta-based company, began as a B2B in 2001. More than 15 million people
and businesses around the world use MailChimp. MailChimp enables many B2B marketing
transactions. A leading marketing automation platform, MailChimp sends more than a billion
emails a day. MailChimp's primary customers were businesses that used the platform to send
marketing emails, automated messages, and targeted campaigns to its individual users.

Historically, media companies that provide analytic services have sold that data and analysis
90 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

to other businesses. Bloomberg's financial terminals sold to businesses around the world is a
classic example of a B2B service.

Kng, Picard & Towse (2008) also note "elements of different business models can be combined
[so] in that sense, every business model of a company is unique."14 For those reasons, a business
model can be a source of competitive advantage, with business model design and product-
market strategy serving as complements, not substitutes.15 Strategy functions like an architect
creating a homeowner's design, while the detailed floor plan based on choices in the design
process would constitute a business model design.16

When you go to get funding for your startup (more on this in a later chapter),17 having an
understanding of your business model will come in handy.

Regulation

Media are among the handful of industries that face industry-specific policies and regulations
that other businesses do not face. The broadcast industry is regulated in the U.S. through
the Federal Communication Commission. The print media industry is impacted by certain
postal and governmental notice regulations. Banking and pharmaceuticals are other industries
that face such industry-specific regulations. Reduced barriers to entry, promotion of trade,
promotion of small enterprises, and regulation of consolidation and concentration are among
some of the policies and regulations media must face. Media strategy can be influenced by
these environmental factors, firm factors, industry factors, and media-specific factors, among
others.18 Some regulation can hinder startups.

That's why policy is one of the domains of enabling an entrepreneurial ecosystem.
Government supports can come in the forms of tax breaks and incentives, regulatory
frameworks, venture-friendly legislation, institutional investments, financial support, and
policy initiatives.19 Regulation and policy limitations to the strategic choices available to
media companies are two examples of media-specific characteristics.

Regulation can help or hinder incumbents or startups based on policies that are set. For
example, regulations pertaining to net neutrality have been debated for years, with many
startups of the past decade arguing that without net neutrality they would have faced
disadvantages instead of the environment that enabled them to grow and prosper. Many
technology startups, for example, banded together in July 2017 to form a protest over FCC
proposals to eliminate Obama-era net neutrality rules. Y Combinator, a popular technology
startup incubator, was among the backers of the protest, along with companies like
Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Amazon, and Reddit.

Government policies can also support entrepreneurship. Some U.S. cities have staff dedicated
to innovation and entrepreneurship. New York City for example uses revenue from its film
and television projects to fund media entrepreneurship efforts like the NYC Media Lab.
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 91

New York City's media and tech startup scene, so-called "Silicon Alley," is no longer confined
to a small alleyway in NYC's financial district and is more of a concept than a location. Media
companies such as Google and IAC/InterActiveCorp make up part of NYC's media ecosystem.
In 2012, the Center for Urban Future proclaimed that NYC witnessed over 1,000 media
startups including Tumblr and Mashable.

During this time, NYC was also witnessing the growth of media cooperative working spaces,
accelerators and incubators including New York University's (NYU) Polytechnic Institute
Tandon Future Labs supported by the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
During this time Mayor Bloomberg advanced tax breaks and funding opportunities for media
startups in NYC as part of his five-borough economic plan.

The NYCEDC, in a public-private partnership, also helped launch the NYC Media Lab in 2010.
The primary goal of NYC Media Lab is to connect the media industry during the dot-com
revival in NYC and colleges and universities in the area to advance media entrepreneurship.
The consortium, which includes Columbia University, New York University, The New School,
the City University of New York (CUNY), the IESE Business School, and the Pratt Institute,
work under the NYC Media Lab umbrella to generate media research and development
and advance media entrepreneurship. The Combine serves as NYC Media Lab's incubator
and its main goal is to position NYC as the media capital of the world by advancing and
launching "one-of-a-kind" media and communication technologies. Specifically, the Combine
aims at supporting and growing media startups from faculty and students from collaborating
universities with a high potential to launch. The Combine is funded by the NYCEDC, the
Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, and NYC Media Lab's corporate members.

Some current projects include an experiment with metadata extraction from book
manuscripts for Audible, a market research project for MBA students in New York City on
augmented reality products for Hearst Ventures, an augmented reality fellowship in design
and engineering through Bloomberg and Lampix, and a virtual reality fellowship for Viacom
NEXT.

Many European countries also provide funding for entrepreneurial initiatives. In 2004, the
Flemish government established iMinds, a digital research center and business incubator
to focus on information and communication technology. The European Union and other
European nations routinely fund innovation and entrepreneurial projects.

Applicable Techniques

Content Models

Revenue streams are a common element of most definitions of business models, particularly
ones used to address electronic commerce.20 Many online news business models, historically,
92 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

have been similar to traditional business models, as subscription, advertising, and transactional
are the most common categories of online business models.2122

Advertising and subscription still remain the most dominant forms of revenue streams used
in most content business models. Content plays involve the creation and dissemination of
content, such as news or entertainment, which users will want to receive.

Here's an example to help you better understand what I mean by a content company. There's
an excellent episode in the first season of Startup,23 the podcast about creating a startup from
Gimlet Media in which the founders, Alex Blumberg and Matthew Lieber, debate whether
Gimlet is a content company or a technology company. In the episode, Gimlet Media thus
far has gone the route of being a content company. The company produces content--in
this case compelling podcasts--that are then distributed on other technology platforms, such
as through Apple or Spotify. If Gimlet became a technology company, it would launch a
proprietary podcast-playing platform. For comparison's sake, Spotify provides a platform for
streaming audio but does not produce the content--the music, the songs, the podcasts that play
on that platform.

See the additional resources included at the end of this chapter for lists of many revenue
streams for many digital media, mobile, and e-commerce companies.

Some of the most common forms of revenue streams used in content companies include:

Subscription

When the newspaper industry moved into online content delivery, many companies initially
gave its content away online for free. Within the past decade or so, most newspaper companies
have offered digital-only subscriptions and bundled online delivery along with the traditional
print product. Within the United States, the leading paywall system was developed by
PressPlus. Paywalls offer users a certain number of free page visits, before being blocked with
subscription, the primary means to gain additional access.

Many digital media companies that offer content, particularly those that offer content that
compete with traditional companies such as newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters, have
implemented a Paywall approach. A paywall can be hard where the only way to access the
content is to pay for it, usually through a subscription, or soft, where the user is given a certain
number of free visits or views per month before being asked to subscribe.

Another common subscription model used for content and technology plays is that of a
freemium model. Under a freemium model, access to basic content is free, but users can
choose to subscribe to premium content for a fee that provides improved access (such as an
ad-free experience) or additional services. The online music streaming service Spotify is a
classic example of a freemium model, with basic access to ad-supported music online available
for free, with monthly premium subscriptions for a fee. Dropbox is another commonly used
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 93

digital startup that relies on a freemium model. The cloud-based file storage service offers free
storage up to a certain amount, and charges a monthly fee beyond that.

Membership is another subscription model. Under a membership model, the content can
either be free or paid, but users who purchase a membership receive perks and bonus
materials, exclusive access to supplemental materials, and so forth. In many instances, these
content companies have been focused on a certain content form (technology, politics, sports)
rather than general interest publications. Musician fan clubs and sporting teams are classic
examples of non-digital content entities that excel at offering memberships. That same model
is applied to media companies, typically ones that diversify their offerings through some of the
other miscellaneous revenue streams discussed later (such as events and conferences; archival
data, etc.).

Classic subscriptions, of course, are the most prevalent. Netflix is probably the most well-
known media content company that offers access to its content through monthly subscription
options. As previously mentioned, some media companies offer subscription access based on
content delivery mechanism (online, mobile delivery/web, all access).

Increasingly, more and more entertainment content is being sold through subscription
packages, with over-the-top services independent of cablevision subscriptions being offered
for individual channels (HBO, Showtime, ESPN) or in packaged bundles (Sling, Hulu, Amazon
Prime, etc.).

Advertising

There are various forms of advertising for content and technology companies, with many
forms specific to the delivery mechanism and form of the company. Traditional legacy media
companies sell local direct advertising (newspapers, broadcasters), classified advertisements,
sponsorships (most common in broadcasting) and are part of national advertising networks,
among other forms.

Advertising networks are still prevalent for digital media content and technology companies,
alongside selling direct advertising on various platforms. Native advertising, the use and sale
of microsites dedicated to paid clients, the use of Google AdSense, and the sale of Outbrain-
style links to external sites are common on web-based content and technology plays.

Content and technology companies can sell display advertising, search advertising, video ads,
text/SMS advertising, mobile and digital forms of advertising, and location-based advertising
among other forms, particularly in the mobile space. Content and technology startups can
also develop their own proprietary forms of advertising content based on the system. For
example, Twitter developed and sold promoted tweets and sponsored ads in its platform.
Sponsorships, particularly used in podcasts, are another form of advertising available for
content and technology plays.
94 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

Mobile advertising ("in-app ads" and "mobile display" ads) and variations of charging for
content are the most prominent ways traditional media have sought to monetize content thus
far, but there are many other alternative business models under consideration, including free
and paid SMS alerts, social media platform distribution, and free applications.

Sponsored Content

One sometimes controversial revenue stream is brand storytelling, or advertisements that
are written in the form of articles in the "voice" of the publication, and displayed alongside
regular editorial content. Brand-sponsored content typically falls under the larger umbrella of
"native advertising" as the ads appear "native" to the environment in which they're displayed.
Many top traditional journalistic outlets have an entire team or division dedicated to creating
sponsored content for brands (e.g. New York Times' T Brand Studio, HuffPost's Partner
Studio, Washington Post's WP BrandStudio, Conde Nast's 23 Stories and Forbes' BrandVoice).

Transactional/e-Commerce

Content and technology plays often employ various forms of transactional, or e-commerce
revenue streams. Some of these allow for an in-between option for users who want access to
content, whether that be one-time or more, but don't want a full subscription option. Let's
explore some of the most common.

Micropayments

Micropayments are small payments, typically $5 or less, for an individual piece of content.
Every time you buy an individual song from Apple for download, for instance, you've made a
micropayment. The iPod popularized the consumption of individual forms of music, chiefly
song downloads, disaggregating individual song purchases from complete albums.

Virtual currencies can be a form of micropayment, typically employed within videogames or
on online platforms, such as Facebook or Twitch, where users are making individual small
purchases for virtual items, such as increased game playing ability, items used within game, or
donations to other users.

Newspapers, magazines, and other forms of micropayments for news and digital delivery
of content were tried unsuccessfully in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with companies like
Flooz, Beenz, CyberCash, Bitpass, Peppercoin and DigiCash just a few examples of failed
micropayment companies from its first era.

From about 2010 or so onward, additional efforts at micropayments have had varying success,
usually within various regions. Blendle, a Dutch-based online news startup, has probably had
the most success at selling access to individual news articles and magazine content, both in
Europe and the United States.
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 95

Kachingle, CarrotPay, Knack.it, and Ganxy are a few other companies that offered various
forms of micropayment platforms for content companies to utilize in recent years.

My colleague Jameson Hayes and I developed theoretical modified micropayment models for
news and media content that introduce the ability for users to microearn for sharing content in
addition to having to micropay for it but there are no functioning platforms that fully execute
that conceptual vision.2425 Many tend to agree that micropayments must be used in tandem
with other revenue streams and can't alone sustain a media operation.

Failure itself is widely embraced by the entrepreneurial community, as the entrepreneurial
process encourages and promotes a series of failures along the way that lessons can be learned
from (pivots, etc.) Entrepreneurs have even held annual FailCon conferences in which speakers
share entrepreneurial failures and lessons learned in cities around the world.

Failure doesn't mean an idea can't be revisited. Micropayments were tried unsuccessfully
in the 1990s, but with the advent of Blockchain and Ethereum digital transactions have
found more success in recent years. With the creation of browsers like Brave, some predict
micropayments and digital transactions to become more mainstream in the not-too-distant
future. Management and economics scholars have predicted that blockchain has the potential
to transform intellectual property and content licensing, access to information and digital
goods, and increase the value of curation of digital content. They envision artists who license
music on Apple or Spotify being able to easily track how many times songs are played by
consumers, backers on crowdfunding sites obtaining royalties each time a song is played,
digital goods priced and delivered using a blockchain for payment, contract enforcement, and
authentication.

Some newspapers abandoned early efforts at digital subscriptions and for the better part
of two decades the industry norm was free online content. Now, of course, digital content
payments have been adapted by many companies. Blockchain enables an easy ability for
micropayments to be implemented in a browser where users could pay a single subscription
and navigate between different newspapers.

Donations

Some media organizations, such as The Guardian, allow for direct donations from readers.
These outlets may make a direct plea on their homepage, or at the beginning or end of articles.
Donations are also much more commonly used in nonprofits as outlined in the next chapter,
but soliciting donations from users can also be done by for-profit media ventures.

Merchandise

Whether you're a nascent startup or a more established company, selling merchandise with
your company's brand, name, logo, and slogans can serve as an additional revenue stream in
96 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

addition to serving marketing purposes. T-shirts, mugs, keychains, and hats are commonly
sold merchandise. Google, for example, has a physical store on its main campus that sells all
sorts of Google-branded merchandise. Companies can also sell merchandise online.

Some other forms of e-commerce:

Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding, defined as "an open call, essentially through the Internet, for the provision of
financial resources either in form of donation or in exchange for some form of reward and/or
voting rights in order to support initiatives for specific purposes." offers a novel way of funding
projects.26

Crowdfunding involves creators of a project soliciting donations from funders, or backers, of
the project, through an online platform that features the project request.

Five basic kinds of crowdfunding models have attained widespread reach: donation-based,
pre-purchase-based, reward-based, lending-based, and equity-based.27 In donation-based
crowdfunding, the backers support a particular cause with no expectation of any kind of
returns.28 However, in reward-based crowdfunding, the backers are provided with non-
monetary benefits in exchange for their support. Kickstarter and Indiegogo are the most well-
known and commonly used rewards-based crowdfunding platforms.

A pre-purchase model is similar to rewards. A backer receives the product the entrepreneur
is making, such as a music album. Lending-based crowdfunding platforms offer a loan to
small-scale lenders with an expectation for a return on capital investment. For instance, Kiva
is the most premier lending crowdfunding platform that operates in 66 countries. Equity-
based crowdfunding is that in which the backers receive an equity or stake in the profits
of the project they have invested in. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of
2012 allowed equity funding in the U.S. for the first time. Title III of this act allows small-
sized business owners and entrepreneurs to retail investment that was previously restricted
to select accredited investors and potential investors on various Internet-based crowdfunding
platforms.

Crowdfunding gained popularity somewhere in the late 2000s. Since then it has shown
unprecedented growth and is particularly common among startup entrepreneurs and
investors. Circleup, Equity Net, AngelList, and Wefunder are examples of some popular
equity-based crowdfunding sites.

Retail/Marketplace

One revenue stream for media startups could come from a "digital retail mall" or "transactional
experiences" like shopping purchases through a digital credit card or online payment system.
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 97

Group Buying

Popularized and most well-known by the startup Groupon, this method provides discounted
deals en masse to groups of consumers who scoop up the coupon-like savings that can be
purchased and used at a later date.

Applicable techniques

Technology Plays

Many of the models previously mentioned for content plays (subscription, advertising, and
transactional) are also applicable for technology plays, and we'll discuss some miscellaneous
categories beyond the Big Three for both.

One of the considerations for technology plays is the distribution mechanism, whether the
product is available online, or mobile, some combination of the two, or neither. If the
technology play is an Internet-dependent one, such as an app, then the choices are whether it
is accessible through the mobile web (HTML5 is a common tool), or proprietary app stores.
If it's an app, then you must decide whether it will be formatted and available in Apple's iOS
format or Google and Android capability. Many universities and cities hold appathons or
hackathons that bring together interdisciplinary teams to work on the creation of an app and/
or the business plan and pitch for an app concept over a weekend. These are useful and can
help flesh out some of the necessary steps and considerations for startup tech plays. Look for
such efforts at your university or city. MediaShift also sponsors a popular hackathon several
times a year that brings together students, faculty, and professionals from universities across
the country.

If you are creating an app, decisions include whether the download is free or if you charge
a one-time download fee. Then, you can consider some of the above-mentioned revenue
streams, such as subscription, and mobile advertising.

Some other revenue models commonly employed in technology plays include:

Auction

eBay is probably the most well-known auction site, where users can post items for sale and get
bids from other users.

Sharing Economy

Apps and websites that take advantage of the sharing economy have proliferated in recent
years. Also referred to as the collaboration economy, this business model is predicated on
98 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

collaboration, whether that is sharing an apartment or home (as is the case in Airbnb), sharing
a ride (Lyft or Uber), or sharing office space (coworking spaces).

Miscellaneous revenue streams for both content and technology plays:

Events/Conferences

Mainstream media outlets like The New York Times excel at organizing live events and
conferences as an alternative revenue stream, but startups can also do the same. Media
organizations sponsor live events, such as conferences and banquets, and charge a fee to
attend.

Foundation Funding

See resources elsewhere in this textbook for lists of foundation funding sources. Many nascent
entrepreneurs and media startups have benefited from foundation funding in the past. The
Knight Foundation historically has been a large funder of media entrepreneurial efforts. The
Lenfest Institute for Journalism is a new funding source for entrepreneurial journalism efforts.
And organizations like the Kauffman Foundation and VentureWell fund entrepreneurial
efforts writ large. Grants and competition prizes from foundations focusing on
entrepreneurship are worth exploring as a funding source.

Sell Archival Access

Content companies who have created archives of past content can sell access to the archives to
users for a fee.

Sell Data and/or Analytic Services

Analytics are usually more of a B2B play, where the business sells access to user data and
analytics to other companies. In some instances, companies can sell analytic tools and services
to users as well.

Licensing

Commonly used in technology plays, licensing as a revenue stream involves licensing out some
form of proprietary technology, such as software or analytics tools, for use by other companies
for a fee.

Conclusion

This chapter has introduced the concepts of business model, revenue model, and business plan.
You should have an understanding of what comprises a business model and business plan,
                                                                                                 BUSINESS MODELS FOR CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS 99

some common revenue streams used in traditional media companies, and revenue streams
available for content and technology startup plays, along with the role regulations and
government can play among startups. You can start to develop the business model for your
startup concept by sketching out the basic idea and its target customer, then identifying how it
will make money through one or more revenue streams discussed in this chapter.

                                                             Exercise

   TRY IT: NAPKIN SKETCH

    Sketch out the start of a startup concept on the back of a napkin.

    I would encourage doing this assignment after you've developed a customer empathy map and have a target
    customer segment in mind for your concept.

    Address the following questions in your napkin sketch:

               1. What is your idea (concept) and why is it valuable (value proposition)?
               2. Who will it serve (target customer)?
               3. How will it make money (revenue streams)?

    For the first question, you'll want to keep it succinct. The equivalent of a 140-character or less tweet is a good
    starting point. This forces brevity, as does using an actual napkin for this exercise. There's only so much space
    on a napkin.

    Napkin sketches are a commonly used brainstorming tool. The napkins at Walk-Ons Bistreux and Bar, a sports
    bar started by Louisiana college basketball players in 2001, include the original napkin sketch for the sports
    bar concept.

    When my Lede, LLC cofounder Jameson Hayes and I first sketched out our idea for a news micropayment
    business model, we did so on a napkin over beers and fried pickles at the Blind Pig Tavern in Athens, Georgia.
    While the napkin sketch is somewhat of a clich, I can attest firsthand that when inspiration hits you have to
    use whatever you have handy to put it on paper- even if that is in fact an actual napkin.

    If your concept is a content play or a technology play, you may want to mention that as well.

    The napkin sketch and brainstorming activities, such as the customer empathy map, are good tools to begin
    the process of formulating a business model for your startup concept. The customer segments and revenue
    streams are two of the nine blocks for the business model canvas tool anyway.

    This chapter has discussed a number of different revenue streams and business models that are ideal for
    media startup companies. You can pull one or more revenue streams from some of the models mentioned in
    this chapter for the third question.
100 GEOFFREY GRAYBEAL

    Value chiefly what's referred to as the value proposition, is also important to consider. This directly connects
    to the customer segments. What value will you offer the customer? Essentially this also addresses the "why?"
    question. Why you? Why would anyone use this product and/or pay for it? What value is offered?

    Before fleshing out additional blocks of the business model canvas, it's useful to continue to ask and answer a
    series of questions.

    Chris Guillebeau's book, The $100 Startup, provides a nice resource in the form of the one-page business plan.
    You're encouraged to answer each question on the form with one to two short sentences.

FROM THE FIELD: REFINING OUR
BUSINESS PLAN WAS THE KEY TO
ATTRACTING OUR FIRST INVESTOR

Dalton Dellsperger

 From the Field

  When I first had the idea of what would be our company, TownWave,1 I never imagined I would have
  to break it down into such detail that would eventually match up with a traditional business model.
  We started with a lean startup canvas model, as most startups do, and expanded it from there.

  My team's biggest struggle was identifying our value proposition. As a "web-based artist/music
  discovery platform," we were going into an oversaturated market of social sound platforms that all
  ideally promised the same thing for their customers. We had to differentiate ourselves in our business
  model canvas from the start to ensure we would not make the same mistakes as our competitors.

  At the same time, we had to make sure we were identifying our market properly and knew how we
  would eventually pitch ourselves to a board of investors. Once we found an interested investor, my
  partner and I started to create a detailed business plan, filled with information and research from
  our potential customer market. Some of the information gathered included amount of time people
  spent searching to discover new music, their preferred platform for music discovery, and the average
  amount of time listeners spent listening to music each day.

  Finding data and information that proved there was a need for our product in the industry was
  the most important part for our investor. Investors don't care how much a company believes in its
  projected success, you must provide them with numbers that back up your claim and give the investor
  confidence they are investing in something special.

  We had to conduct our own polls and research studies to prove that there was a massive market of
  opportunity for our company to thrive in. Our business plan is single-handedly the most important
104 DALTON DELLSPERGER

  document we have ever worked on. It's roughly 30 pages of one single idea, TownWave, broken down
  into claims that our product will deliver on its promise, which is all backed by research. We were
  offered $200,000 for 33% equity in our company from an angel investor and though this was exciting
  news for us, we eventually turned down the offer and continued with our app's development. We
  felt giving away such a high percentage of our company that early in our company's development
  was not right for TownWave's future success. Since then, we have been developing our product into
  something much greater and have since been offered multiple investments of $100,000 for 10%
  equity, which valuates our company much higher than the original offer would have. We are now in
  the process of releasing our finished product into the market and using SAFE agreements ["simple
  agreements for future equity"] to lock down a few investors to help us push our product into the hands
  of millions of listeners and artists.

FROM THE FIELD: MAKING STUDENT
MEDIA SUSTAINABLE

Gretchen Macchiarella

  INSTRUCTOR NOTE: This sidebar was added for fall 2018, and is not yet reflected in the print edition.

  Unlike their industry counterparts, college media organizations don't have investors to please or
  dozens of chain-owned properties to consider while dealing with the industry's shared problems
  of how to monetize and become financially sustainable.1 Most student media organizations are
  nonprofit corporations or divisions of the university directly. Their structures play a major part in the
  way that innovation plays out. For the sake of simplicity in describing some of the distinctions, we will
  focus on the student media organization that would have once been called the student newspaper but
  now might encompass many publications with little or no ink involved.In the first part of this decade
  the loss of advertising revenue at college newspapers was clear2 but the only solid solution usually
  proposed was for universities to begin funding the operations. Next came a round of reducing print
  circulation and other general cost cutting. In 2014, the trickle of papers cutting their print publications
  became a deluge3 and digital reliance has since become the norm. That put those papers on the same
  path of many industry organizations, unable to make up lost revenue from print editions with digital
  advertising.Innovation and an entrepreneurial focus has changed that at many student media groups.
  These organizations can't count on what used to work, especially for independent publications.Duke
  Student Publishing Company, publisher of The Chronicle newspaper, made a standalone visitors
  guide website, created a housing database called NearDuke.com, and added sponsored social media
  advertising. This year, with buy-in from the board of directors and a sizable investment, The Chronicle
  launched an advertising agency within their organization. It will bring in close to $60,000 in new
  revenue, according to General Manager Chrissy Beck. She tells her students they have to keep trying,
  change the strategy along the way, and be ready to fail.

  "It helps us be super flexible, and I think that creates a sense of innovation and trying," she said.
  "Because we have to."

Disrupting Student Media From Within

Student media organizations are not immune from the disruptions faced by the larger journalism
industry. When coffers got low, student media organizations got creative:

Looking for Innovation in Student Media Looking for Innovation in Student Media

Instead of shrinking, the Iowa State Daily Media Group has grown from 70 student employees to
more than 200, and it now reaches more of the community. They recently considered starting a
subscription box for alumni that would deliver local production, and of course, the newspaper.

"If you want different results you have to do things differently," General Manager Lawrence
Cunningham said.

At Cal Poly, the Mustang Media Group in San Luis Obispo, Calif. hosts an annual event with advertisers
passing out food samples and coupons on campus. The Iowa State Daily Media Group created
a dating contest that brought couples together and sent them on sponsored dates. Advertising
agencies, social media management, sponsored podcasts - these nimble media organizations are
considering revenue options that once would have been far outside their scope.

Paul Bittick, general manager at Mustang Media, has changed his entire focus in the past five years.
He said at least 75 percent of the organization's sales are not in the regular print product, but in
coupon books, events, or sponsorships of live streams. This year he is making a calendar to send
home with visiting parents sponsored by wineries and other attractions trying to entice the next
extended family visit.

"Our job is to train these students is to go into the media organization of today, not the ones I left,"
Bittick said.
                                                                                               FROM THE FIELD: MAKING STUDENT MEDIA SUSTAINABLE 109

In our examples so far, Mustang Media Group at Cal Poly is a division of the journalism department,
while Duke Publishing and the Iowa State Daily are independent nonprofits. Other recognizable
publications include the Daily Wildcat, which is part of the larger area of Student Media, a largely
self-supporting campus auxiliary that is part of student affairs at the University of Arizona. The
Missourian is the most well-known professional collaboration, with students coming from the School
of Journalism at the University of Missouri.

Beck says she wouldn't trade Duke Student Publishing Company's status as an independent
newspaper for any amount of university funding or support. She feels she is running a business, with
the autonomy to make big changes.

"I can make a decision today and it happens tomorrow," Beck said.

Two major elements impact how innovation happens: where the bulk of the money comes from and
who gets a say in new ventures or changes.

If the majority of the funding for the basic needs of the organization are covered by the university,
there is less perceived need for innovation. More important, the money coming in might be specifically
earmarked or tied to legacy functions. For example, there may only be money for printing and not for
developing an app.

For those with close campus ties, the power structures can be complex. A campus club that produces
student media cannot choose to start selling T-shirts if that isn't part of its charter. But an auxiliary
might be able to get the usual fees waived to allow it to use the campus mascot to promote a
standalone sports website.

In a recent analysis of a national survey of college newspaper advisers,4 Dr. David Bockino found
that student media that displayed an entrepreneurial orientation and that a closer connection with
the marketing and sales departments also tended to provide more journalistic autonomy. "This result
perhaps suggests a greater flexibility within the papers' infrastructure, that is, newspapers more
concerned with economic fluctuations, such as changing media habits or increased competition,
have more incentive to provide their students the leeway to solve such problems compared with
newspapers less concerned with changes in the audience."

At Iowa State Daily Media Group, Cunningham said he has pushed to make innovation and "crazy
thinking" part of every day. The student leadership group is often asked to assume there are no limits.
The process is part of creating a learning environment as close as possible to the growing demands
of the media industry.
110 GRETCHEN MACCHIARELLA

"We bridge the gap between what students learn in the classroom and what they will be expected to
know in the marketplace," he said.

Overcoming the Challenges

The level of work and focus can be hard to sustain. Cunningham said after four years of adding
publications and trying new ideas, the team has slowed down. And, with new revenue sources coming
in, the need to do something, anything, has decreased as well.

The most common challenges to creating a culture of innovation were professional staff burnout, low
tolerance for risk, a constantly changing student staff, and pressure from faculty members or alumni
to stick with the traditional.

"The students, who are well-intentioned, sometimes are the ones holding us back," Beck said.

Longstanding institutions like The Chronicle can feel like a heavy responsibility for students barely
out of their teens. They don't want to be the ones who let a venerable institution die. So Beck, and her
counterparts, push many of the changes themselves and then let the students run with it. Over time,
the student leaders loosen up and get more flexible.

"I am still hopeful they are going to come up with the next cool great idea," Beck said.

Structures

No two student media organizations are the same. Some have journalism department classes that feed them
reporters while others are tiny student clubs that recruit from all comers. Many are nonprofit organizations
that are independent from the universities they serve, but these may still get student fees or access to
campus space and resources. Their advertisements might be sold by a full-time staff of professionals or only
occasionally by a student volunteer. Each college student media organization has its own recipe, with a dash
of this and a heap of something else.

The following chart gives a very rough categorization of the types of student media organizations. Each lists
characteristics like funding sources, oversight structures, and benefits.

FROM THE FIELD: WRITING A BUSINESS
PLAN & BUDGET

John Dille

 Build a Business Plan & Budget

       "A goal without a plan is a wish-"-old management adage

  If the value proposition is the compass, the business plan is the roadmap, and the budget and the
  metrics used are the waypoints that guide the promised goals home.

 What's in a Business Plan?

  There is no one specific template every investor expects when they ask for a business plan. But
  usually, a business plan will include some combination of the following:

         What you want from investors (aka your "ask")
         A clear summary of the business, its product and the market you will serve (key activities,

           value propositions and customer segments from the Business Model Canvas)
         Financial information about the business--pricing, revenue, P&L, cash flow, return on

           investment, and pro forma (three-year) budget (cost structure and revenue streams from the
           BMC)
         Background about your company, its history and legal status, and the team
         A bit on your "secret sauce" that will enable you to be competitive (key resources, channels,
           customer relationships, key partnerships from the BMC)
         The metrics by which you'll measure success
         Whether and why the business is worth doing or investing in financially

  Today's media marketplace is an on-demand, platform-specific landscape with a myriad of options
  available to consumers. Anyone in the media business these days knows the chaos that surrounds
  it and the search for new and more creative methods to monetize its content. Planners must be
114 JOHN DILLE

  responsive to these historically disruptive conditions. Whatever plan you start out with, you'll probably
  iterate and maybe even pivot to respond to user and customer needs and changes in the marketplace.

  That said, having a flexible business plan remains central to the success of any project.

  What follows is a look at the essential financial components of a basic business plan.

 Developing a Pro Forma Budget

  Assuming we have the other parts of the business plan in place, it is the budget process that can give
  the business plan the credibility and durability that both operators and investors seek.

  The pro forma budget for new content or product is usually on a three-year schedule. From start to
  some level of market acceptance or rejection, three years provides a reasonable look. It is the last
  step in making the plan real. It is the quantification of the strategies and tactics included in the plan.
  Inasmuch it must ask, indeed force, the questions that engage the issues facing the enterprise.

  The budget employs metrics that must be selected to accurately evaluate performance as well as
  offer tools that can guide actions that result in meeting desired goals.

  Media lives at the convergence of the organization's ability to create compelling and relevant content
  and its skill at converting it to money. The organization must do this in a digitally created on-demand
  landscape and in a marketplace whose players are moving at an uneven pace.

  Still, fundamentals remain and the need to retain existing customers, upsell them where possible, and
  to constantly recruit new ones persists. The repeat customers are critical.

  There are four primary components to a pro forma budget.

  REVENUE -- For our purposes we should think of revenue, not as one big number, but as the sum
  of a collection of smaller numbers. Revenue is the result of two numbers, for example, number of
  units, broadcast spots or ads or whatever times the price per unit sold. That then holds true for every
  income stream the operation offers the market.

  A newspaper historically has had two primary sources of revenue: advertising and circulation sales or
  subscribers. In the digital space this converts to clicks and paywalls.

  The real challenge facing media outlets and their revenue is monetizing smaller audiences in a way
  that remains of value to the advertiser.

         All sources of revenue
                                                                                                 FROM THE FIELD: WRITING A BUSINESS PLAN & BUDGET 115

                    These can be from third parties, such as advertisers, or directly from consumers. Go to
                    the chapters on Business Models and Nonprofit Models for ideas on potential sources
                    of revenue.
       What is the durability of these revenue or income streams?
                    How often do buyers buy?
       What are the pricing models?
                    What exactly are the buyers buying?

                               * Content
                               * Access to this content's consumers?
                               * What will the profiled buyer pay? More, less or the same as competitors?
                    If the marketplace competition is such that it will not support the desired price, is the
                    value proposition still viable? Or can it be adjusted without disrupting the cost model?
                    For decades media has priced on a Cost per Thousand readers/viewers/listeners basis.
                    That model is now under attack as being imprecise and inadequate. This too, is under
                    re-evaluation.

The message here is that the budget process must remain nimble enough to accommodate change
quickly should the need arise.

COST STRUCTURE -- All costs associated with the designated project. These include outsourcing
costs as well as internal payroll and other costs used to fund the operation.

                    Fixed and variable costs
                               * Media has traditionally been a high fixed cost business. This means that
                               regardless of the number or consumers, readers/viewers, the cost to produce the
                               content is essentially the same.
                                            * Office rent or insurance would be fixed costs.
                                            * The cost of producing content will vary based on the volume and type of
                                            content you produce, and whether you use full-time or freelance
                                            employees. However, as a media business, you will always have this
                                            overhead.
                               * A building contractor, on the other hand, would hire carpenters and buy
                               materials only when he had a building to construct.

                    Costs will vary depending on strategies chosen in the business planning process.
                               * Some elements of an operation may be higher. For example, an enterprise
                               focused on building a specialized product may have higher service costs than an
                               operation offering a one-size-fits-all product.
                               * The budget will need to take this into account.

METRICS -- Metrics used to measure performance are critical. If they are not employed in sync with
116 JOHN DILLE

  the business plan they can provide not only incorrect information but misleading data and flawed
  conclusions.

                                 * Some metrics look back and are used as performance indicators. Income
                                 statements produced monthly include the predetermined budget for comparison
                                 between what revenues planners thought would come in versus what actually
                                 did happen.
                                 * Retrospective information, for instance when comparing a monthly budget to
                                 actual costs, answers the question, "how'd we do?"
                                 * Equally important are metrics that predict success. For example, sales
                                 managers know that the number of sales calls made by a seller of media on
                                 existing or prospects matters. There is a direct correlation here. Sellers who
                                 underperform usually aren't making enough calls. This metric can guide an
                                 operation. Similarly, if a seller is selling, but his or her orders aren't priced
                                 correctly, the total revenue generated will be insufficient.
                                 * With this kind of predictive data, management can direct actions of employees
                                 and others to the desired goals.

  PROFIT or MARGIN -- Revenue minus Expenses equals Profit.

                                 * Was it worth it? This is the question asked by all concerned. How did our effort
                                 on this project compare to what we could have done?

                                              * Investors in particular ask this, but operators do as well.
                                 * Breakeven analysis and Return on Investment are two more important data
                                 points available from the information created in the pro forma budget process.

                                              * What do we need to do to break even or not lose money?
                                              * What is the ROI on this course of action vs. our next best alternative? For
                                              instance, would we sell more advertising if we priced it at $2,500 instead of
                                              at $5,000?
                                              * Or, in harsh reality, whether the project should be undertaken at all.

  All of this is at the heart of the business plan and is the "reality check" any plan requires.

The rise of digital media in the new millennium has triggered an irreversible plunge in print
advertising revenues. Consequently, the newspaper industry is shedding jobs. By mid-2016,
the American newspaper workforce alone had lost about 20,000 jobs2 over the previous 20
years, and most in the industry expect that trend will continue. With ad-supported mass media
mired in what seems to be a permanent cycle of disruption, a growing number of journalists
have shifted their career path toward nonprofit news, a realm that traditionally has depended
on more altruistic forms of funding such as memberships and philanthropic donations.

The Institute for Nonprofit News,3 founded in 2009 by 27 investigative news organizations,
had grown to more than 120 members by mid-2017. And in the aftermath of the 2016
U.S. presidential election, the nonprofit news sector--a category that includes public radio
and television stations, established investigative newsrooms, and newer startups covering a
specialized topic or region--saw an unprecedented surge in donations4 from readers and
foundations hungry for independent watchdog journalism. In March 2017, The Center for
Investigative Reporting, the Center for Public Integrity and ProPublica each received $3
million in grants from the Democracy Fund and First Look Media, prompting Inside
Philanthropy to proclaim in a blog post headline: "It's Official: Donald Trump is the Best Thing
That's Ever Happened to Nonprofit Journalism."5

Seven-figure grants can pay for plenty of accountability journalism, but news nonprofits can't
pin their long-term survival on big checks from foundations. The term "nonprofit" generally
means that an organization exists to fulfill some sort of social purpose, not to make money for
corporate owners. But the bills still need to be paid. If you talk business strategy with any of the
civic-minded entrepreneurs who run news nonprofits, you'll quickly hear a common theme:
"nonprofit" is not, by itself, a business model--it's simply a tax status. Yes, once they clear a
lengthy review by the Internal Revenue Service,6 nonprofit news organizations benefit from
501(c)(3) status, which exempts them from certain taxes and enables them to collect charitable
donations. Still, tax-exempt status brings no automatic guarantee of financial success. To
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 119

stay afloat, today's news nonprofits must constantly seek revenue from a diverse array of
sources including corporate sponsorships, events, subscriptions, and crowdfunding while also
cultivating new members and philanthropic donations.

This chapter will explore revenue strategies that have worked for nonprofit news outlets in
the digital age. We'll begin with an in-depth look at The Texas Tribune, which over the past
decade has gained a reputation as a national model for nonprofit news. Later in the chapter,
we'll explore best practices in revenue strategies as pursued in recent years by the Tribune and
many of its peers in nonprofit news.7

Earning Their Keep: The Texas Tribune

The Texas Tribune launched on November 3, 2009, with seventeen employees and the mission
"to promote civic engagement and discourse on public policy, politics, government, and other
matters of statewide concern." It has since grown to fifty-three employees and now has more
full-time statehouse beat reporters than any other U.S. news organization.8 The Tribune
has collected a heap of national and regional awards, including a 2017 Peabody Award9
shared with fellow nonprofit ProPublica for a collaborative investigation revealing Houston's
vulnerability to a Katrina-caliber hurricane. It also has raised more than $40 million through
a combination of donations, memberships, corporate sponsorships, events, and other sources
of revenue. It all adds up to a diversified business model that funds the work of a growing and
respected newsroom.

What lessons can be gleaned from The Texas Tribune's journey? How much of the Tribune's
experience is unique, and to what degree can its revenue-generating prowess be replicated by
other news outlets? For a year, these questions guided my work as a visiting research fellow10
funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

While based in the Tribune's Austin newsroom from August 2013 to July 2014, I investigated
best practices in the business of nonprofit news. I sat in on staff and board meetings, conducted
interviews with employees, and also visited some of the Tribune's nonprofit news peers
around the country. The fellowship afforded me unusual access to directly observe the Tribune
as it evolved beyond its startup roots and adopted business strategies designed to build an
enduring organization. Meanwhile, my travels to other news nonprofits enabled me to
compare and contrast the Tribune's revenue strategies with those of its peers.

If there are generalizable lessons to be learned from the Tribune's experience, they do not add
up to a rigid recipe but rather a handful of strategic concepts that other news startups might
consider. This much is clear: Among the past decade's wave of nonprofit news startups, The
Texas Tribune stands out as the most aggressively entrepreneurial.

The sheer scale of what the Tribune has achieved in Texas may not be replicable to other
settings. But other nonprofit news outlets may wish to emulate some of the tactics that
120 JAKE BATSELL

have propelled the site's success. Among the most replicable concepts are revenue diversity,
entrepreneurial creativity, and a shared sense of editorial and business mission.

The Birth of The Texas Tribune

The story of The Texas Tribune began in late 2006, when software investor John Thornton
began researching how his Austin-based venture capital firm might profit by acquiring stakes
in financially troubled newspapers. As Thornton dug into the news industry's changing
economics, he became convinced that public-interest journalism--which had been subsidized
for decades by a now-vanishing system of mass media advertising--could not survive as a
stand-alone product. His interest in journalism shifted from a potential business opportunity
to a philanthropic pursuit.

Observing the diminished presence of mainstream media outlets covering the state Capitol,
Thornton donated the first $1 million to start a nonpartisan news source. During the spring of
2009, he formed an official corporation and quickly applied to the IRS for tax-exempt status,
which was granted within months and, crucially, enabled the Tribune to raise funds as a public
charity. (Other aspiring news nonprofits during this era were not as fortunate when seeking
tax-exempt status from the IRS, which was baffled about how to handle these new entities.
Some startups who began under these shaky regulatory grounds waited in vain for nonprofit
status, ultimately either dying in infancy or partnering with an already established nonprofit
organization that could act as a fiscal sponsor.11 The lesson, once again: nonprofit is a tax
status, not a business model.)

To lead the new venture, Thornton enlisted his friend Evan Smith--who, as the longtime
editor of Texas Monthly magazine, brought deep connections within the state's political,
business and media circles. The pair teamed up with another veteran political journalist, Texas
Weekly editor Ross Ramsey, and the three co-founders assembled a talented crew of young
reporters and developers during the summer of 2009.

The Tribune then embarked on a remarkable fundraising spree to bolster the initial $1 million
from Thornton. Boosted by the journalistic credibility of Smith, Ramsey, and a cast of rising
stars poached from legacy newsrooms, the fledgling nonprofit landed a flurry of five- and six-
figure sums from an array of wealthy donors and foundations (including $250,000 from the
Knight Foundation).12 It also signed up more than 1,400 members who contributed at least
$50 each, and around sixty corporate sponsors who pitched in at least $2,500 apiece. By the
end of 2009, the Tribune had raised roughly $4 million.

Proving the Concept During the "Runway" Phase

The initial $4 million fundraising haul provided vital early breathing room for what Thornton
called a two-year "runway" phase--a period during which the Tribune would need to prove the
value of its journalism while figuring out its long-term business strategy.
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 121

Somewhat unexpectedly, the site's early traffic magnet was its series of searchable databases,
which allowed readers to easily snoop through government employees' salaries, contributions
to political campaigns, and state prison inmates' convictions and sentences. The databases
were controversial to some readers, who considered them an invasion of privacy even though
they contained public information. But the databases were undeniably popular--at one point
during the site's first year, they were drawing three times as many pageviews as traditional
news stories. And each curious click created more digital impressions for corporate sponsors'
messages.

Offline, the Tribune launched a series of events that expanded the site's visibility. Tanya Erlach,
hired from The New Yorker to serve as the Tribune's full-time director of events, developed
a morning event series featuring on-the-record interviews with high-profile political figures.
The events--hosted by Smith, a skilled questioner with his own PBS interview show--drew
a strong following among political insiders, attracting crowds of as many as 200 to 300
people to a downtown ballroom directly across from the Tribune's offices. And these events,
underwritten by corporate sponsors, were free to attend regardless of whether one was a
Tribune member.

From the start, Thornton sought to wean the Tribune from philanthropic support as soon
as possible. In an early brochure distributed to potential supporters in 2010, a chart labeled
"The Texas Tribune's path to self-sufficiency" predicted that within three to four years, the
site would no longer require major gifts from donors and foundations. Instead, according
to the chart, three equal revenue streams would sustain the Tribune: memberships, specialty
publications, and corporate sponsors and events. However, even as the Tribune's journalism
gained prominence across the state, it soon became clear that those revenue categories were
not developing quickly enough to keep the Tribune afloat.

Accelerating Business Capacity

During the latter half of 2010, the Tribune made a series of adjustments designed to ratchet
up revenue. Thornton agreed to donate another $1 million--but this time, in the form of a
matching grant that would kick in whenever the Tribune landed major donations of $5,000 or
more. As executive editor Ross Ramsey recalled, "You've got to raise a million to get a million.
The most important part was raising the million."

Smith brought in a new director of business development, his former Texas Monthly colleague
April Hinkle, who as the magazine's publisher had more than two decades of experience
selling advertising to the state's corporate crowd. "He said, `I want your for-profit brain for
my nonprofit," Hinkle recalled. One of her first moves was to expand corporate sponsorships
beyond the basic $2,500 level offered during the Tribune's launch phase. Originally, Tribune
sponsorships offered little more than a tax write-off and a rotating logo box on the site's
homepage, but Hinkle began to develop more comprehensive programs that included event
sponsorships, more visible logo placements and other customized elements for a higher price.
122 JAKE BATSELL

Hinkle said her singular mission upon joining the nonprofit was "using all Tribune assets I
could possibly get my hands on to create custom programs."

Around this same time, the Tribune also sought to boost membership revenue by introducing
an "editor's circle" program focused on securing multi-year pledges. The circle program,
which requires a three-year commitment of up to $5,000 annually, created a stable pipeline of
support. "It was really genius in a box in terms of revenue growth," said Maggie Gilburg, the
Tribune's former director of development. And on the news side, the site struck a syndication
deal with The New York Times to provide eight stories a week for the iconic newspaper's Texas
editions.

These were all promising revenue developments, but by the end of 2010 the Tribune remained
heavily dependent on philanthropic support. Nearly two-thirds of the Tribune's $2.25 million
in overall revenue that year came from individual donors and foundations, according to
internal figures.13 Earned revenue--an industry term referring to self-generated income such
as corporate sponsorships and events--remained a much smaller part of the mix.

Building Entrepreneurial Momentum

Two factors in 2011 helped the Tribune build more entrepreneurial momentum. During the
spring, the site for the first time covered a state legislative session, which in Texas convenes
only once every two years. Hinkle's revamped sponsorship packages offered businesses and
institutions a new, more targeted option to get their messages in front of a politically savvy
audience during the urgency of a session. Corporate sponsorships more than doubled from
$306,000 in 2010 to $637,000 in 2011, according to internal figures.

Perhaps even more significantly, in September the site hosted its first annual Texas Tribune
Festival, a weekend-long bonanza for policy wonks that drew more than 1,300 attendees to the
University of Texas campus. The festival--organized by events director Erlach, who previously
ran a similar festival for The New Yorker--featured big-name keynote interviews and panel
discussions, along with networking at cocktail receptions and trendy food trucks. Ticket sales
helped cover costs, but festival sponsorships accounted for the biggest windfall. The festival,
combined with more than 40 additional events throughout the year, pushed annual event
revenues to $702,000, more than tripling the total from the previous year. The festival grew
even bigger in 2012, offering forty-five sessions and 150 speakers on topics including health,
race, and criminal justice. Attendance climbed to nearly 1,700, and sponsorships for the three-
day festival approached $400,000. "It's just a real you-have-to-be-there vibe that we've been
able to create," Erlach told me at the time. The growth of the festival pushed total yearly event
revenue to almost $900,000.

Also in 2012, the Tribune tallied enough major philanthropic donations to fully redeem
Thornton's $1 million matching pledge. But earned revenue was beginning to drive the
business model. That year, for the first time, revenue from corporate sponsorships and events
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 123

(together, roughly $1.9 million) surpassed major donations and grants ($1.8 million).
Memberships rose to $510,000, nearly equaling the total raised during the previous two years
combined. After adding in syndication, subscriptions, and other revenue sources, the Tribune
hauled in more than $4.5 million overall.

The trend continued in 2013, as sponsorships and events each topped $1.1 million. The
Tribune Festival, a growing juggernaut, swelled to nearly 2,500 attendees and produced more
than $700,00014 by itself. By the end of its fourth full year, the Tribune raked in a total of $5.1
million from a balanced assortment of revenue streams: 45 percent from sponsorships and
events, 34 percent from philanthropic sources, 13 percent from memberships, and 8 percent
from syndication, subscriptions, crowdfunding, and other sources.

It was a dramatically different financial formula from its first full year, when foundations
and wealthy donors supplied nearly two-thirds of the Tribune's annual revenue. And by the
end of 2016, the Tribune's annual revenue had swelled to $6.9 million from roughly the
same combination of sources: 45 percent from sponsorships and events, 40 percent from
philanthropic donors, 11 percent from memberships, and 4 percent from syndication,
subscriptions, and other sources. While philanthropy provided the initial boost and continues
to be crucial, the Tribune gradually has figured out ways to earn more of its keep.

New Challenges--and More Scrutiny

The corporate sponsors15 fueling the Tribune's transformed business model--companies,
lobbying firms, universities, advocacy groups--all have their own agendas at stake in the world
of state government. While these sponsorships have accelerated the Tribune's revenue growth,
they also have triggered scrutiny from media watchdogs.

In February 2014, Austin-based political author Jim Moore, a former journalist, published a
series of blog posts denouncing the Tribune's financial model as fundamentally "corrupted."
"What believers hoped was going to be a watchdog has turned into a lapdog by taking big
dollars from lobbyists and corporations," Moore argued.16 Commercial media, of course,
have long battled similar perceptions that their news coverage was beholden to advertisers'
interests. But as veteran Texas journalist and professor Bill Minutaglio would later observe,17
Moore's four-part attack--entitled "The Trouble With the Trib"--underscored "how fine a line
the brave new world of nonprofit journalism has to tread in the search for viable business
models."

The Tribune always has listed all financial contributors on its site, but the criticism from
Moore and others accelerated a series of changes18 that editors had already been considering
to improve transparency. Corporate sponsors would now be listed not only by name, but also
by the specific amount of their sponsorships--a higher degree of disclosure than practiced by
most, if not all, of the Tribune's nonprofit peers. In addition, disclosures would be appended to
any story that mentioned people or institutions who had given the Tribune more than $1,000.
124 JAKE BATSELL

Also, event descriptions would include language to reinforce that sponsors "do not have any
role in selecting topics, panels or panelists."

A point often overlooked when discussing the ethics of fundraising for nonprofit news is
that, collectively, an expanding roster of corporate sponsors dilutes the ability of any single
financial backer to wield undue influence. In one instance I watched unfold in the newsroom
during the spring of 2014, Ramsey, the site's co-founder and executive editor, agreed to
moderate a corporate forum in Dallas in exchange for an honorarium to the Tribune. The week
before the event, organizers sent the Tribune a list of 10 pre-scripted questions for panelists.
Ramsey objected, making clear that he would moderate only if he had discretion over the
questions. "They wanted a paid performance, and we don't do that," Ramsey said. The company
found another moderator, and the Tribune lost the honorarium. Both sides moved on. It's just
one example, but it highlights how diverse revenue streams and journalistic integrity can help
protect a news organization from the whims of any particular financial supporter.

In recent years, Tribune has sought to widen its audience while also doing everything it can
to monetize the diehard politicos who already read it every day. The Tribune has developed
strategies to extract more revenue from its most loyal followers, raising the subscription price
for its insider political newsletter and offering VIP experiences at the Texas Tribune festival.
It hired its first chief audience officer19 and created a sister op-ed site, TribTalk,20 whose
content consists of volunteer submissions and clearly labeled "paid placement" posts authored
by corporate sponsors.

The sheer scale of what The Texas Tribune has achieved may not be replicable in the world of
nonprofit news, at least at the regional and local level. The Tribune has uniquely benefited
from a generous founding investor who combines a venture capitalist's business acumen
with a personal passion for public-interest journalism; a charismatic CEO with a well-honed
public presence; and, of course, the "everything's bigger in Texas" effect. Texas is a vast, pro-
business state whose 27 million residents also share a distinct sense of cultural identity. In
other areas of the country, even the most dedicated founders of local digital news outlets have
ultimately succumbed to "founder fatigue" -- in May 2015, after nine years of running the
community news site DavidsonNews.net in North Carolina, editor David Boraks announced the
site's closure in a farewell column: "We're in debt, we're exhausted, and it's time to go."

Still, fellow news nonprofits may wish to emulate some of the tactics that have propelled the
Tribune's success. Below, I have outlined key elements of the Tribune's business model that are
most likely to be mirrored elsewhere:

        Persistent focus on revenue diversity. From the outset, Thornton sought to establish
          multiple streams of revenue, a strategy he jokingly called "revenue promiscuity"21
          during the Tribune's early days. It's worth noting, though, that the Tribune's eventual
          mix of revenue sources took a different path from the initial vision of drawing equal
          support from only three revenue streams--memberships, specialty publications, and
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 125

          corporate sponsors and events. As it turns out, sponsorships are generating more
          money than the Tribune's founders anticipated, while memberships and specialty
          publications have been slower to develop. Philanthropy continues to play a crucial
          role, and new sources of revenue (crowdfunding, for example) have emerged. The
          percentages constantly will change, but the Tribune's experience emphasizes the
          importance of constantly seeking a diverse mix of revenue sources.
        Entrepreneurial creativity and customization. The Tribune has been relentless in
          unearthing new ways to pay for its journalism. Over the years, its revenue
          experiments have included a sponsored "TweetWire" widget on the homepage that
          features curated Twitter posts by elected officials, newsletter sponsorships, podcast
          introductions on the weekly "TribCast," and even sponsored breaking news alerts.
          April Hinkle, the Tribune's chief revenue officer, said she considers the Tribune's
          media kit22 to be more of a conversation starter than a take-it-or-leave-it menu. She
          works with prospective sponsors to develop customized packages--sometimes
          including event sponsorships--that suit the sponsor's needs. "Every single thing really
          becomes custom," Hinkle said. "I don't think we would be as successful today if we
          weren't willing to be flexible ... People invest in what they need, and not what we
          want them to buy."
        A shared sense of editorial and business mission. The Tribune's organizational
          culture fosters collaboration between the editorial and business staffs, in contrast to
          the church-versus-state model historically followed by legacy media. Reporters and
          editors host and moderate panels during events, especially the annual festival, and are
          encouraged (but not required) to promote membership drives on their own social
          media accounts. Business-side employees sit in on weekly news meetings for a better
          understanding of what the newsroom is up to. When the Tribune launched its sister
          op-ed site, TribTalk,23 in 2014, staffers from several departments--news, art, tech and
          business--worked together for months to design a site that would clearly distinguish
          between volunteer guest columns and "paid placement" advertorials. Over time, the
          newsroom and business side have developed a mutual sense of trust underpinned by
          the Tribune's nonprofit mission. "My first year here, I tiptoed through the newsroom,"
          Hinkle said. "But I think we've kind of grown together."

Best Practices in Revenue Strategies For Nonprofit News

Four principal revenue streams dominate today's landscape of nonprofit news: corporate
sponsorships, events, philanthropy, and memberships.24 The proportional weight of these
revenue sources varies widely, depending on a news organization's particular scope, mission,
and local circumstances.

                      "There's no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to the right sources
                       of revenue," the Poynter Institute wrote25 in 2016 after spending a year
126 JAKE BATSELL

                        visiting nonprofit news outlets around the country. "Test out different
                      approaches and consider what opportunities are unique to your mission,

                                                  audience and location."

Sponsorships and Underwriting

One way to subsidize nonprofit journalism is by courting corporate and institutional sponsors
who are looking to reach a more influential audience than a general-interest publication can
offer. The Texas Tribune is widely regarded as a standout performer in this area--in 2016,
the Tribune generated more than $3 million through corporate underwriting and sponsored
events--but many other news nonprofits are pursuing similar strategies. The next section
will consider specific revenue strategies for events, but here are some general sponsorship
principles as practiced by the Tribune and several of its peers.

        Know your audience and sell its value. Nonprofit, mission-driven news
          organizations are uniquely positioned to connect sponsors with an educated and
          engaged audience. But to convert audience attention into sponsorship revenue,
          potential sponsors need evidence to be convinced that a site's readership is worth
          their money.

In May 2012, The Texas Tribune conducted its first audience identification survey,26 which
drew 872 responses in two days. The site found out that 91 percent of its readers are college
graduates, 96 percent voted in the last election and 52 percent have a household income of
more than $100,000. That's a smart, affluent audience that appeals to potential sponsors and
advertisers, so the Tribune trumpeted the survey's results in its media kit.

"It's a very specific kind of audience, definite intellectuals," said Hilarie Houghton, executive
communications consultant for BlueCross BlueShield of Texas, which through mid-2017 had
spent nearly $800,00027 on Tribune sponsorships, including events like the Texas Tribune
Festival.

VTDigger.org, a political news site in Vermont, conducted a similar audience survey that quickly
attracted more sponsors. By the end of 2013, corporate underwriting had risen to more than
40 percent28 of VTDigger.org's annual revenue. "It's made a huge difference for us, because
we're able to show sponsors that our readers are very civically engaged," said founder and
editor Anne Galloway, noting that the survey found her site's readers "are involved in their
communities on many different levels--they're churchgoers, they're volunteers at schools,
they're very politically active. More than 95 percent of them vote every year."

        Provide ways for sponsors to make fuller arguments. In Southern California,
          nonprofit organizations wanting to reach the Voice of San Diego's29 civic-minded
          audience have long raised doubts that a banner ad could effectively get their point
          across. "It wasn't enough space for them to really explain and educate people about
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 127

          their mission," said Mary Walter-Brown, Voice of San Diego's publisher and chief
          operating officer.

So in 2014, San Diego's pioneering online news startup quietly debuted a native advertising
program30 aimed at fellow nonprofits. The program, called Partner Voices,31 publishes
article-length "partner promos" that are either paid for by the nonprofits themselves, or on
their behalf by a corporate sponsor. Voice of San Diego's editorial staff has no role in producing
the promos, which carry a monthly fee of $1,500 and are clearly labeled as sponsored content.

Voice of San Diego is one of several nonprofit news outlets to recently join the wider media
world's adoption of sponsored content,32 also called native advertising. Display ads are
confined by the boundaries of the box, but sponsored content allows advertisers more room to
make their case--an intriguing option for policy-minded organizations whose arguments and
causes are difficult to boil down to a snappy slogan.

Making fuller arguments to an influential audience is a key selling point for The Texas Tribune's
op-ed site, TribTalk, which launched in 2014 and offers "paid placement"33 slots to corporate
sponsors. The Tribune charges $2,750 for a three-day run on the TribTalk.org homepage,
although permalinks for sponsored content stay up indefinitely. April Hinkle, the Tribune's
chief revenue officer, said she pitches TribTalk's paid placement as an opportunity "for
thought-leading organizations to be able to post and lead a discussion" beyond what banner
ads can provide.

When tapping into new revenue sources like native advertising, it is crucial for nonprofit news
outlets to clearly explain how such initiatives support their mission, according to Kevin Davis,
formerly the executive director of the Institute for Nonprofit News.34 "Make very clear what
type of organization you are and why you're doing this, because there is a different level of
scrutiny for nonprofits," Davis said. "Go to the ends of the earth to say, `We are a nonprofit, we
are mission-driven, and this is an authentic way of furthering the mission--not just making
money.'"

Events

Live events have emerged as an increasingly popular revenue stream for both nonprofit and
for-profit news outlets. Since 2013, events have generated more than $1 million35 per year for
The Texas Tribune while also building community and creating a library of video news content
for its site. Here are some of the common event practices36 followed by the Tribune and many
of its peers.

Seek out corporate sponsors.

You don't have to sell tickets to make money from events. In fact, nearly all Tribune events are
free, other than its three-day festival.37 Pitch events to corporate sponsors as a way to get
128 JAKE BATSELL

their name in front of an influential audience. Underwriters, advertisers or donors who
already support your site are a logical place to start, because your organizations already have
a relationship. And think early, because corporate budgets tend to be planned months in
advance. Keep in mind, however, that sponsors may be more interested in sponsoring a series
than a single event. "It's much harder to go to someone and say, `This is a one-off,'" said Tanya
Erlach, the Tribune's founding director of events. "Their brand lives on if it's over and over
again."

When determining sponsorship rates, Hinkle recommends first sketching out a tentative P&L
(profit and loss) report that factors in the event's costs, likely attendance, and potential revenue.
If, like the Tribune, you promote the event in advance and publish video or audio afterward,
be sure to factor that into the calculations. Hinkle said the Tribune's event sponsorships
range from $3,000 for a single event to six-figure amounts for a series of events that include
custom topics. And before you book a pricey hotel ballroom, explore a partnership with a local
university, museum, or nonprofit organization that might be willing to provide space.

Build in a networking element.

Any successful event needs a compelling program, of course. But networking might be an even
bigger draw. And for sponsors, Hinkle said, having the opportunity to invite clients and VIPs
is an added plus. "You just have to make it so they have to be there--this is a can't-miss, it's a
must-attend on their calendar," she said. Also, make every effort to gather attendees' contact
information, whether through RSVPs or a simple box at the check-in table to drop off business
cards. "If you can get an email address from somebody that's already showed up, that's your
repeat customer," Erlach said.

Consider virtual events, too.

NJ Spotlight,38 a political news nonprofit in New Jersey, generates most of its earned revenue
through a series of in-person roundtable events.39 But the site collected an extra $20,00040
in 2013 by hosting three sponsored webinars41 on topics including offshore wind power,
electricity and health care. Kevin Harold, NJ Spotlight's publisher, said the webinar format
works best for a sponsor looking to make its case on a complex state policy issue that "begs a
platform to get into the granular nature of it."

A reporter or editor moderates each webinar, which lasts about an hour. Sponsors present a
slideshow, then answer questions posed by the moderator or the virtual, real-time audience.
The pitch to sponsors, Harold said, goes something like this: "You have a content-rich story to
tell. We have an independent flag. We will challenge you on things that you say, but we'll give
you a platform to say them."
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 129

Don't be afraid to monetize the fun factor.

For the past decade, pioneering nonprofit news site MinnPost42 has hosted an annual variety
show called MinnRoast,43 during which the state's politicians and journalists "gently skewer"
one another through songs, skits and stand-up comedy. In 2014, when I attended MinnRoast44
at a historic theatre in downtown Minneapolis, the event raised roughly $160,000. Joel
Kramer, MinnPost's CEO and editor, noted that the Twin Cities region is saturated with
serious events run by civic-minded organizations such as Minnesota Public Radio, the Citizens
League and the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. From a strategic
standpoint, Kramer said, MinnPost thought a fun-themed event had a better chance to attract
sponsors and ticket sales than more straight-laced affairs. "You've got to find a spot that's
empty, that's open," he said. "And nobody was doing it. ... Most events in town are very serious.
They talk about the mission, you know, they all have a silent auction. I go to many of them,
and I believe in the causes, and we donate money. But they're a bit on the somber side. So we
wanted to distinguish ourselves in that way."

Memberships

Membership drives for nonprofit media have evolved far beyond volunteers taking pledges
over rotary phones. Some public radio and TV stations still host on-air telethons, but today's
nonprofit news outlets seek pledges through multi-channel membership drives that include
websites, social media, e-mail, and in-person events. Memberships remain an important part
of the revenue mix for nonprofit media. Running an effective membership program is a
complex, never-ending endeavor, but here are some core strategies that have helped produce
success.

Define "the ask."

Are you asking people to join primarily based on benefits they will receive, or is their
membership simply a vote of confidence in your mission? The Tribune offers modest benefits
ranging from monthly newsletter updates to invitations to VIP events, but its membership
strategy45 mostly focuses on selling the value of the Tribune's public-service journalism. "It's
really a philosophical ask: Please support our mission at the level that's most comfortable for
you," Gilburg said.

Investigate West, a nonprofit news site based in Seattle, entices supporters to upgrade their
basic, $10-per-month memberships by offering tiered benefits46 including invitations to
house parties with staffers for members who join the $25-per-month "Deadline Club."

Plan ahead.

The Texas Tribune begins preparations for membership drives47 months ahead of time. After
settling on a campaign theme, messaging is catered to five modes of delivery: email, social
130 JAKE BATSELL

media, direct mail, the site itself, and membership events. (Email tends to be most effective,
because people on distribution lists have shown some form of previous support or interest.)
The Tribune seeks buy-in from the entire organization, inviting employees to membership
happy hours and circulating pre-written social media statuses that staffers can share.

While membership programs are a year-round commitment, the action heats up considerably
as the calendar year comes to a close. "For nonprofit fundraisers, the entire fundraising
calendar revolves around year-end campaigns and planning starts in the summer, if not
sooner," advises48 nonprofit news consultant Jason Alcorn. For example, the Maine Center for
Public Interest Reporting begins formal preparations for its end-of-year fundraising drive in
August, according to publisher Naomi Schalit.49 By October, board members are jotting down
personalized notes on appeal letters, which go out in late October and early November to allow
time for follow-up before the year concludes.

Push for automatic or multi-year pledges.

One-time donations are lovely and appreciated, but recurring donations are a golden goose. In
2015, monthly giving to nonprofits grew at a faster rate than one-time donations, a trend that
Alcorn called50 "great for nonprofits that can now plan around a predictable, stable revenue
stream." The Tribune's membership program51 defaults to recurring payments (annual or
monthly) rather than one-time donations. Its "editor's circle" program, which asks supporters
to pledge up to $5,000 annually for three years, also has proven to be a substantial revenue
source.

Evaluate the returns.

Cultivating and maintaining a membership base is a monumental task. For some nonprofit
news organizations, the costs to staff, promote and maintain a membership program may not
be worth the effort. It's important to weigh the expenses against the returns. "If you hire a
person for X, and they bring in less than X, then it's not worth it," Gilburg said. One solution?
Pooling resources. In late 2016 and early 2017, with funding from the Democracy Fund, five
nonprofit newsrooms banded together to form the News Revenue Hub pilot52 to manage their
end-of-year membership drives together, led by the Voice of San Diego. The five newsrooms
raised nearly $300,000 in addition to tens of thousands more in future commitments. The
pilot was so successful that Voice of San Diego announced it would spin off53 the Hub into
a separate venture aimed at coaching and guiding news nonprofits through the membership
process. "If all newsrooms do their part to address the crisis creatively, we can share lessons
learned and build a new system that is more sustainable in the long term and more accessible
and accountable to the people it's meant to serve," wrote Scott Lewis, Voice of San Diego's CEO.
                      NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 131

Philanthropic Giving

Even as the nonprofit news sector finds creative ways to generate more of its own revenue, "the
fact is, there's not a business model--definitely for nonprofits--without donations," said Brant
Houston, board chair emeritus of the Institute for Nonprofit News. A 2017 data analysis54
published by Columbia Journalism Review found that 10 foundations collectively donated
$500 million to journalism nonprofits from 2009 to 2016. The Knight Foundation ($142
million) was by far the leading institutional donor for nonprofit news, followed by the Ford
Foundation ($74 million) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ($64 million).

Foundation funding requires carefully cultivating and maintaining relationships, meeting the
guidelines of specific grant programs, and many other interrelated factors.55 When it comes

to seeking major gifts from individual donors, here are a few commonly followed practices:

Cultivate your community's network of business leaders.

This is especially important in the initial phases. The Tribune's initial $4 million fundraising
campaign included a bipartisan list of high-profile donors, which brought the Tribune
credibility while also funding its early operations. Joel Kramer, co-founder of MinnPost, said
aspiring news entrepreneurs often focus entirely on the journalism, underestimating how
important it is to recruit local business leaders to back their venture. "You do need connections
in the community--and I'm talking now about business, revenue-side connections, not
journalism connections," Kramer said.

Persuade existing members to give more.

Once your news organization has established a track record, your next major donor may
come from your own membership roster. The Tribune makes a habit of identifying existing
members who may be willing to move up to a major donation. "We're developing a donor base,
and we'll move those people down the line," Gilburg said. "From their earliest contribution, the
connection deepens."

Use donations to develop long-term sustainability.

Philanthropic donations probably always will constitute at least some part of the revenue
mix for nonprofit news. But ideally, each grant or donation can help a news organization
build business capacity that makes it more self-reliant. "As we got grant money in, we never
saw that as a long-term proposition," said Anne Galloway, founder of VTDigger. "We saw
it as, essentially, like venture capital--a way to get a certain distance with our project to
attract a certain number of readers so we could get to a point that we could launch a strong
membership campaign and attract enough underwriting to reach a level of sustainability." A
grand experiment along these lines is now unfolding in Philadelphia, where newspaper owner
Gerry Lenfest gave $20 million in 201656 to create a hybrid nonprofit/for-profit structure
132 JAKE BATSELL

called the Institute for Journalism in New Media. Lenfest also donated the city's two main
newspapers, the Inquirer and Daily News, to the new nonprofit institute, along with the $20
million in seed money. The goal behind the new structure is to stabilize the papers' finances
(for now, anyway) while executives develop strategies for long-term sustainability.

Supplementary Revenue Streams

In addition to the four central sources of funding for nonprofit news discussed above, a
number of supplementary revenue streams also offer promise. Here are three areas where
news nonprofits are generating some extra dollars:

Crowdfunding

When looking to fund specific projects or staff positions, it's worth considering a
crowdfunding campaign. During the fall of 2013, the Tribune's inaugural Kickstarter
campaign57--for equipment to stream live video coverage of the 2014 Texas governor's
race--tallied $65,310, plus a matching pledge of $10,000 from the Knight Foundation and
another $10,500 in checks. Rodney Gibbs, the Tribune's chief innovation officer, said the
campaign succeeded largely because it had a clear, focused call to action that was amplified
on social media by employees and supporters. The Tribune turned to crowdfunding again in
2014 and 2015 to raise money for special investigative projects58 and in 2017 to hire a new
"community reporter"59 to forge relationships with readers across the state.

The more novel the idea, the more likely it is to capture crowdfunders' attention. In 2014,
fellow nonprofit San Francisco Public Press launched a Kickstarter campaign that more than
tripled its original goal of $10,00060 to expand its citywide network of bicycles to distribute
the print edition of its newspaper.

For some digital news startups, crowdfunding has served as the initial spark for a more
enduring, membership-driven business model, particularly in international settings. The Hong
Kong Free Press61 and Spain's El Espaol62 both were created in 2015 as a result of successful
crowdfunding campaigns that drew tens of thousands of supporters. And De Correspondent,63
an investigative news site based in Amsterdam, launched in 2013 with a record-setting
Kickstarter campaign, tallying $1.7 million in thirty days.64 De Correspondent now boasts more
than 50,000 members65 who pay 6 Euros (roughly $7) per month to directly support a style
of news that publisher and co-founder Ernst-Jan Pfauth calls "an antidote to the daily news
grind." The site's business model is completely ad-free, which Pfauth says is liberating:66
"Instead of viewing members as target groups for advertising, we can focus on serving our
readers' interests. Instead of starting ad-heavy sections like travel and career, we can make
editorial judgments based solely on the importance of a subject. Rather than hunting for page
views, we hunt for great stories."

De Correspondent is a for-profit venture--it caps profits at 5 percent, reinvesting the remaining
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 133

95 percent back into its journalism--but its ability to convert an initial crowdfunding
campaign into a thriving community of members67 has drawn considerable interest from the
nonprofit world. The site, which plans to expand into the United States in 2018, is working
with New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen on a public research project68 to
develop and share best practices for news membership models. "The Correspondent knows
things that local, nonprofit and specialized news sites in the U.S. can benefit from as they turn
to readers to support them," Rosen wrote69 in Nieman Journalism Lab. One of these lessons,
international editor Maaike Goslinga told me, is that building trust with members can serve
as its own "currency" to support journalism. "I'm not saying that De Correspondent has all the
truths or that everyone should have our model," Goslinga said. "But we can sense that a lot of
people read us because they trust us." The crowdfunded model, Goslinga said, builds trust with
readers because "you are free from the pressure of corporate donors--and that means that you,
as the journalist, have the complete freedom to write whatever you want, because we're not
dependent on clicks."70

That degree of journalistic independence appeals to Kevin Smit, a 20-year-old Dutch college
student studying biotechnology. Smit signed up for a monthly De Correspondent membership
in June 2017 after following the site on Facebook for more than a year. "It's real journalism,
like it's supposed to be," Smit told me, recalling several of the site's investigations, including
an in-depth video analyzing the debt of the Dutch government. Smit said De Correspondent's
business model is, in fact, a major reason he has grown to trust the site. "How they're formed
through crowdfunding means that you don't have one interest--you don't have that lobby, or
this company supporting you," he said. "It's people paying 6 Euros a month for the articles."

Syndication and Partnerships with Newsrooms and Universities

For four years, The Texas Tribune shared content with The New York Times as part of a
syndication deal that brought in several hundred thousand dollars. That collaboration with
the Times ended in 2014,71 but the Tribune also has other syndication clients, including a
textbook publisher. (The site's daily news content is offered for free to news organizations
throughout Texas.)

The California-based Center for Investigative Reporting charges a yearly flat fee for the rights
to republish its stories and videos. But when it comes to particular projects, syndication fees
are determined according to a sliding scale based on audience size, platforms used (print, TV,
online) and whether a syndication partner contributed editorial resources. "We have to kind of
tailor it to the partner," said Meghann Farnsworth, CIR's former director of distribution and
engagement.

For news nonprofits with limited audiences, partnerships with commercial newsrooms can
broaden the reach of their reporting while also generating revenue. Investigative Post, a
nonprofit in western New York state, produces stories for Buffalo TV station WGRZ-TV
in exchange for an annual fee ranging between $50,000 and $100,000, according to a 2017
134 JAKE BATSELL

report72 published by the American Press Institute. As Nieman Journalism Lab73 explains,
partnerships like these "benefit both sides: The commercial publishers get expert reporting in
specific areas that they don't have time to devote resources to in their own newsrooms, while
the nonprofits get extended reach for their work (and, hopefully, money, too)."

Creative partnerships with public media organizations and universities also can help save
money for news nonprofits. In San Diego, inewsource, an investigative news nonprofit, shares
office space and resources with the KPBS newsroom on the campus of San Diego State
University. In exchange, inewsource provides KPBS with news content but remains
independent. "We operate as a self-standing investigative unit," editor Lorie Hearn told me in
2014. Such arrangements can invite scrutiny, however -- in 2015, after inewsource published a
series of investigative stories about a local attorney, a group affiliated with the attorney filed a
lawsuit challenging the lease agreement between inewsource, KPBS and the university. The suit
was dismissed,74 but the episode highlighted the risk that a school can assume when allowing
a news organization to operate on campus. Unflattering coverage of the host university can
trigger tensions as well: In 2014, The Lens, a news nonprofit in New Orleans, lost its offices75
at Loyola University after publishing a story critical of Loyola's president.

Conclusion: Operating as a Mission-Driven Business

During the year I spent at The Texas Tribune, I found that in many ways it functions much
like any metropolitan newsroom: Reporters spar on the phone with state agencies over public
records requests, interns hustle to churn out quick daily stories, editors bug reporters about
deadlines while shuffling between meetings.

But perhaps more than any other nonprofit news startup, the Tribune aggressively and
unapologetically operates at all levels as a mission-driven business.76 News, art, and tech
staffers are mindful that their livelihoods depend on successful events and membership drives,
so they actively promote the Tribune in person and on social media. Business staffers tout
the Tribune's editorial content when making their pitch to potential sponsors, donors, and
members. It's a bold, self-promotional mindset that sometimes borders on overconfidence,
but it stems from an understanding throughout the organization that, ultimately, the Tribune
needs more revenue to stay in business and carry out its public-interest mission.

This shared sense of purpose is important, because digital news startups need proactive
financial strategies if they hope to survive. Another nonprofit news startup, the Chicago News
Cooperative, shut down operations in 2012--partly because it failed to develop business
capacity that could sustain its excellent journalism. "I think that was one of my mistakes, was
not to invest in business management," editor and founder James O'Shea told me77 in an
interview, candidly admitting that he had overspent on journalism. "We've come to a point in
journalism where the business side and the editorial side are much more `one' than they used
to be," O'Shea continued. "Journalists have kind of got to get with it and understand that, and
                                                                                                                             NONPROFIT MODEL DEVELOPMENT 135

begin practicing that and exercising their judgment in a way that really makes sure that if it's
going to be done, it's done right and it's done under sound journalistic principles."

The same year O'Shea shut down his newsroom in Chicago, another high-profile experiment
in nonprofit journalism -- The Bay Citizen in San Francisco -- merged with the Center for
Investigative Reporting78 after failing to build a sustainable business model despite an initial $5
million in startup funding from investment banker Warren Hellman.

For decades during the era of legacy media, the traditional church/state separation between
editorial and business departments allowed journalists to insulate themselves from the
financial realities of their profession. Today's news nonprofits cannot afford to subscribe to
that worldview. They must, of course, behave transparently and ethically to maintain trust
with the public. But by operating as mission-driven businesses, news nonprofits can enjoy the
benefits of philanthropic support while simultaneously building out a diverse array of self-
sufficient revenue streams that will ensure their long-term survival.

      children and animals. News nonprofits usually aim to convince the IRS that they fulfill an
      educational purpose by disseminating accurate, verifiable news content to the public. See Jeffrey P.

Tribune managers to track year-by-year trends in revenue growth. These internal figures should not
be confused with yearly financial reports to the IRS, also known as a Form 990, which are prepared
according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Tribune's internal figures
deliberately exclude revenue associated with a large one-time foundation grant -- for example, the
Knight Foundation's $1.5 million grant to the Tribune in 2013 -- in the interest of providing
consistent ongoing comparisons to previous years.

FROM THE FIELD: THE KNOXVILLE
EXPERIMENT

Coury Turczyn

 The Knoxville Experiment: A Footnote to Nonprofit Journalism

  Attempting to launch a newspaper in the 21st century must be an awful lot like what entrepreneurs
  experienced starting up steam-powered-car companies1 in the 20th--the product may still work, and
  even offer a few nice advantages, but it's not what most customers want anymore. So, being at odds
  with consumer trends (and, ultimately, the course of history), you're most likely doomed to failure.
  Why, then, did a small group of editors defy all logic with their 2015 launch of the Knoxville Mercury?

  Well, not unlike those belated pioneers, we had a lot of passion for a crazy idea: Let's publish
  a newspaper owned by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit--that way, it would earn revenue with traditional
  advertising, but could also potentially benefit from tax-deductible donations to its parent organization.
  With two distinct revenue streams, we might just be able to pull off the anachronistic act of printing a
  weekly paper in the smartphone era.

  Why even bother, you ask? That requires a little background: When the E.W. Scripps Company
  planned its merger2 with Journal Communications in 2014 (creating the Journal Media Group, a
  publisher of newspapers that would in turn be sold off to Gannett3 two years later), it decided against
  including one of its smaller, meagerly profitable properties: Knoxville, Tenn.'s Metro Pulse. Acquired by
  Scripps in 2007, the previously independent alt weekly had a steady client base of local businesses,
  particularly in arts, entertainment, and dining (not to mention multiple national awards for its stories
  and design). But Scripps' accountants did not deem the publication worth all the trouble of continuing
  under the new corporate scheme, so after 23 years Metro Pulse, along with its employees, suddenly
  got the ax.

  Yet the paper's readers still existed, and they wanted it back. Furthermore, some of them were willing
  to pay to see a new publication launched--including a few large donors who specifically wanted it
  in print. So, the funds to start a newspaper were available--but how to sustain it once it was up and
  running? Everyone knows that print advertising is in a death spiral.4 Meanwhile, the nonprofit models
144 COURY TURCZYN

  for journalism consist mostly of news-only websites--but our readers also wanted us to continue
  the alt-weekly staples of arts and entertainment coverage, plus opinion and comics and puzzles.
  Neither direction alone would appear likely to generate enough income to keep a weekly newspaper
  in business. But what if we combined them?

  Thus, three of us former Metro Pulse editors decided to take a crack at devising a hybrid nonprofit
  model:5 a taxable, not-for-profit publication owned by a local 501(c)(3) educational nonprofit called
  the Knoxville History Project.6 (Not having to report to a disinterested, out-of-state corporate manager
  would be an added bonus.)

  While unusual, this is not a completely unheard-of arrangement. Smithsonian magazine, for example,
  is part of Smithsonian Enterprises, which is a nonprofit division of the Smithsonian Institution. The
  nonprofit Poynter Institute, a journalism school, owns the Tampa Bay Times in Florida. However, those
  are both longstanding nonprofits that later started or acquired those subsidiaries; we were starting
  both entities at the same time, a more complicated process. Nevertheless, armed with an experienced
  tax lawyer and lots of paperwork, we were able to win the approval of the Internal Revenue Service.

  We began our endeavor with a Kickstarter campaign7 in December 2014 that raised over $60,000 for
  the paper's launch. Combined with larger private donations and other fundraisers, the paper began
  publishing in March 2015--and our plan for the future initially hinged on those two main revenue
  streams.

         Traditional ad sales: Nonprofit media can't sell advertising with calls to action (live
           performances, happy hours, retail sales, etc.), which is the bread and butter of most alt-
           weekly papers. But by registering as a taxable not-for-profit with the state of Tennessee, we
           would be able to sell regular ads rather than just "sponsorships," such as those you hear on
           public radio. (And, of course, we'd pay tax on the income from those ads.)

         Tax-deductible donations: The educational nonprofit Knoxville History Project was
           established by former Metro Pulse columnist Jack Neely with a mission to research and
           promote the history of Knoxville. Its primary vehicle to fulfill that mission would be the
           Knoxville Mercury, which would often print columns and articles about Knoxville's history.
           KHP would launch the paper and help support it financially by taking out full-page
           educational ads that also presented Knoxville history.

  So, the idea was this: We'd sell print and digital ads like any other newspaper, but we'd also make
  appeals to large donors who wanted to support independent journalism in Knoxville. These may be
  foundations or individuals who prefer their donations to be tax deductible--in which case, they could
  make them to the KHP, whose board would in turn decide how to best allocate the funds to the
                                                                                                           FROM THE FIELD: THE KNOXVILLE EXPERIMENT 145

paper. And here's where we came to the tricky parts, a series of catch-22s that made continuing our
existence even more difficult than we had expected.

First, the KHP's lawyer determined that only 25 percent of whatever it raised in funding could go to
the paper, lest it appear to the IRS that the nonprofit was acting as a "front" for a for-profit business.
One solution to that would be to raise a huge amount of money, enough that one-fourth of it would
be sufficient to help fund the paper. This did not occur. So, instead, the KHP bought services from the
Mercury: advertisements.

Second, explaining this ownership arrangement to potential donors was rather complicated: "A
501(c)(3) owns your newspaper?" "Yes, so if you want to make a tax-deductible donation to support
the paper, it will have to go through the KHP first, and then its board of directors will decide what to do
with it--most probably buying an ad contract with the paper." "Hmmmm...." And trying to describe this
relationship in print was even more awkward--we couldn't simply say, "Support the paper with a tax-
deductible donation to the KHP" because then it might appear that the nonprofit was just a conduit to
the newspaper.

Third, avoiding those nonprofit hoops by asking readers for direct (non-tax-deductible) donations also
became complicated. While we were able to spark the passion of readers to start the paper, it became
much more difficult to constantly reignite that excitement year after year to continue the paper. Each
fundraiser we held collected less money than the one before it. Unlike donating to public radio or TV,
giving money to a newspaper is still a new, odd concept for most people, and we never figured out a
good way to "normalize" it. (We really needed the services of a professional fundraiser, for which we
had no budget; we were editors and designers and ad reps, not development directors.)

Fourth, paying your staff and your freelance contributors reasonable rates will require a good-sized
budget if you're attempting to produce a professional, credible news source. (Unfortunately, many
of our once-loyal advertisers from Metro Pulse opted out of supporting the Mercury--more than we
expected.) While dropping the paper edition and going all-digital may sound like the easiest way to
cut expenses, our printing and distribution bill was actually far less than our payroll. (We had six full-
time employees and two part-timers.) And, in our experience, online ads for a niche website in a small
market would not come close to paying for much of anything, let alone our payroll.

For two years,8 we produced an excellent, award-winning local paper--just the sort that every
commenter says we need to keep communities engaged in our democratic society. Unfortunately,
there were not enough people who wanted to help pay for it. As a hybrid, we were neither fish nor
fowl--not exactly a business that would interest investors (since all the profits would go to the KHP),
and not exactly a nonprofit that would qualify for most national or regional journalism grants (since
we were still a business rather than a nonprofit ourselves).

  What's the solution for the industry? News as a for-profit business is becoming more and more
  difficult,9 and most nonprofit models are still working themselves out. However, Philadelphia's
  newspapers have set themselves on a promising direction forward10--but it's predicated on finding a
  very wealthy person with a strong interest in local reporting to fund a multi-million-dollar endowment.

   EXERCISE: BEING A MEDIA NONPROFIT

    Learn more about the real-life logistics of being a media nonprofit.

    One of the most common questions students have about nonprofit models is how they are different from a for-
    profit company. In both cases, an organization needs to make more in revenue than it spends. However, there
    are differences in that:

             The organization's mission and purpose are more important than profit.
             Ownership and leadership are different. (Unlike a business, no private person can own a

               nonprofit-they are led by a board of trustees or board of directors.)
             Any excess income at a nonprofit is not distributed to shareholders or owners, but rather reinvested

               in the organization's operation.
             When a nonprofit is a 501(c)(3), it may be exempt from certain taxes and it may also offer its donors

               the opportunity to make tax-deductible donations.
             A 501(c)(3) can't attempt to influence legislation or political campaigns.

    The Balance does a great job of answering the question "How Is a Nonprofit Different from a For-Profit

Introduction

You don't have to create your own media outlet or technology company to be an entrepreneur
in the journalism or communications space. You may want to sell your services on a
contractual basis to companies who need them. Freelancing is one valid means of
entrepreneurship that is ideal for those who don't want the commitment and rigidity of a full-
time job, but want to work in the industry on their own terms.

 From the Field

 My Freelancing Story

  By Elizabeth Mays

  When I graduated from grad school, I started my career as a freelance writer and editor, and for three
  years I did nothing else. My ability to sustain this line of business didn't just happen. I had laid the
  groundwork before graduating. While I was in grad school, in my spare time between work, school and
  homework, I sent lots of queries out to magazines (it was the 1990s). Occasionally, an editor would
  respond: "We're going to use your article, and we're going to pay you this much." I was studying to
  be an actor, and I had a professor who used to say "If you're working, you're good." I was working, I
  thought, so I must be good at this writing and editing thing.

  After graduation, I moved to New York. I was still straddling acting and publishing, until I was struck
  with a paralyzing health issue on the eve of an audition for "Rent." I was temporarily debilitated. Then,
  just after I'd recovered, I got a phone call from a New York magazine publisher I had pitched a story
154 ELIZABETH MAYS

  to while I was in grad school. "We're going to use your article, and we'll pay you this much," she said.
  "Oh, and can you do this other story for us too?" In that moment, I knew I was a writer, not an actor.

  I eventually found some more writing and editing gigs, most of them much less glamorous (including
  a stint as a certified professional resume writer). Magazine work wasn't all that glamorous either-the
  jobs I got offered were sometimes 1- to 2-day turnarounds with a dozen interviews to coordinate. But
  for three years, I did nothing but freelance to earn my income as a sole proprietor.

  One of the many misconceptions I had about freelancing was the amount of control I would have have
  over my time. Yes, I got in my share of hikes in wine country. But ultimately, it was essential for me
  to be working on the client's timeline, and the highest paid jobs went to the earliest bird on call, so I
  made sure to be the earliest bird on call.

  Eventually I burnt out and I took my first "real job" in journalism, then another, moving up the ladder
  until I once again couldn't stand working for someone else anymore. I quit my job days after the crash
  in the late 2000s to do my own thing. I had once done an eloquent eulogy for a family cat that died,
  so at the time, I thought I would sell pet eulogies. As you can guess, that didn't pan out. However, that
  business turned into a successful business that I still own today. Before leaving my job, I had made
  my preparations and formed the business (an LLC this time) before jumping ship. I easily found my
  niche in two areas: editing (where there was less competition than in writing) and resume writing (a
  position that thrives when the economy crashes).

  Freelancing was a flexible career as I went back to school and earned a second master's degree,
  which added multimedia and digital media entrepreneurship to my skill set. I was offered a job before
  I graduated, and ended up in a stable education job for more than six years, during which I quickly
  realized that I wanted to work for myself again. Although I had a full-time job, I bootstrapped my
  business as a "side hustle," working four freelance gigs on the side at any one time. I worked nights,
  weekends and holidays, squirreling away every dollar I could as a cushion to go back out on my own.
  Finally, one of those gigs turned into a part-time client, with the same client offering me a second gig
  at a second business. Together, it was enough to venture back on my own.

  I've gone from sole proprietor to small business corporation, but I'm still a consultant. My next focus
  will be to figure out a "scalable entrepreneurship" piece of my business: that is, a product that does not
  rely on me performing a service, but that can be sold without my interference in the transaction. Think
  classes or books. The goal will be to provide a passive stream of revenue alongside all the consulting
  I do.
                                                                       FREELANCING AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CONSULTING AS BUSINESS MODELS 155

 Rules of Freelancing

  I'm often asked how to keep a constant stream of incoming projects as a freelancer. The secret is
  delivering value. Put yourself in your client's shoes. What do they need from you? In my experience,
  these are some rules to live by, whatever your niche:

         Deliver reliably (do what you say you will) on your commitments.
         Be on time.
         Be thorough, not sloppy.
         Communicate.
         Don't be a pain in the butt to work with.
         Anticipate your client's needs.

Creating Value: What's Your USP?

When I was a resume writer, I used to ask people, "What's your magic power?" By this, I meant
the thing they did differently and better than everybody else who performed essentially the
same work function. For a business, the term for this is "unique selling proposition."1 A USP
explains how your product is different from and hopefully better than the competition's. This
is similar to a "unique value proposition,2 which focuses more on the benefits people receive
from working with you. As a freelance consultant, you are your business, and you'll need
to figure out the USP or "magic power" that is your service offering. This can be a unique
thing that you do, or the way that you do it. For instance, you might be a journalist with a
certificate in programming; a broadcaster who knows how to do animated explainer videos; a
communicator who specializes in conveying the messaging of clients in a certain industry; or
a photographer who does two-hour turnarounds.

Why does anyone buy an iPhone over an Android? A certain brand of cereal or cleaning
product over another? Because different brands vary in perceived strengths and weaknesses in
the marketplace. You as a professional should have a brand too (and know what it is). To figure
this out, do the following exercise.

                                                             Exercise:

    Mentally line yourself up alongside your professional colleagues like products on a shelf. Now, why would
    an employer reach out and choose you instead of them? Why would you choose you? Think about other
    individuals you know who do what you do professionally, or peers who are graduating from the same classes
    you took and are entering the same industry. Ask yourself: What do you do differently? Is there a facet of your
156 ELIZABETH MAYS

    approach or demeanor, or a specialized skill set you have that makes you more effective? Your USP or "magic
    power" can be a hard skill, a soft skill or a combination of skills.3

How Freelancing Is Different

When you're a freelancer, you're almost always a consultant-a solopreneur or personal service
corporation who takes on gig projects as they come to you. Example: You are a photographer
who gets calls from the newspaper whenever a story comes up in your area and they need
photos fast.

This doesn't mean you will be a sole proprietorship. You can still set yourself up as a
corporation if you want to put another layer of distance between yourself and your business
entity. As a company, it can still be just you performing services. In theory, this makes it less
likely, albeit not impossible, for someone to sue you for personal assets if they perceive your
company has wronged them. Business insurance is another worthwhile step. This is especially
relevant if you do something risky. No matter how careful you are, a career in content comes
with the potential for someone to accuse you of libel, privacy invasion, copyright violation,
errors and omissions, or other hazards. Depending on your personal income situation (as well
as whatever is decided in potential legislation on tax reform) being a business could have tax
advantages, or if you have the wrong type of business, it could leave you paying higher taxes
and/or double-taxed. A CPA and fiduciary are best to guide you through the ramifications and
provide advice for your personal situation.

Consulting is the act of performing a service in your expertise in exchange for payment. While
you may have expenses, you are generally being paid for your time and services.

This is different from a business in which you manufacture something and sell it to people. But
even if you're mainly a consultant, you can still scale your business by adding ongoing streams
of revenue that supplement your work for clients. Scalable entrepreneurship means you are
creating something once and passively selling it numerous times, with no interference in the
transaction. Example: You create a book once and place it into Amazon for sale. Royalties come
in and begin to add up. Or, you create a software as a service. The system autobills people for
a monthly subscription to use it.

Even a technology startup might still provide consulting services to other companies until it
finds firmer footing and has regular SaaS (software-as-a-service) revenue coming in.

Setting Up Your Business

Regulations vary from state to state, but generally, you will need to fill out some paperwork
before you conduct business. This paperwork will vary regionally (check with your local
                                                                       FREELANCING AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CONSULTING AS BUSINESS MODELS 157

chapter of SCORE or the commerce authority for specific requirements in your state). Here
are just a few of the items you may need to file:

        A trade name or name you are "doing business as"
        Articles of incorporation
        State sales tax license
        City sales tax license(s)
        Tax licenses in other states where you may have nexus
        Federal EIN application (to get a federal employer identification number)
        Employer unemployment identification number
        Business bank account
        New hire paperwork (sometimes even if you're hiring yourself)
        You may need to publish documents like your articles of incorporation in a local

          newspaper.
        Professional licenses (for some occupations)
        Proof of insurance (sometimes required to get certain contracts)
        Your state or municipality may have additional requirements

Here is one example of what's necessary to start a business in the state of Arizona.4[/footnote]
There are likely similar resources available from the Commerce Authority, Corporation
Commission, or similar governing body for your state.

A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure, and in some states you don't even have
to do any paperwork to become a de facto self-employed sole proprietorship. (Again check
your local regulations.)

If you are not a sole proprietorship, you will need to decide on a structure for your business
(S corp, LLC, C corp, etc.-see Chapter 6). There are many options to choose from and each
has its own headaches and dramatically different ramifications as to the percentage of your
revenue that will go to taxes and the legal distance between you and your business. There are
tradeoffs on all these counts. I strongly recommend consulting an accountant or lawyer to help
with your business formation. (Quality business setup services can run as little as $400-$700.)

If you are not a sole proprietorship, you will need to get an EIN from the federal government.
This is an employer identification number that is used for things like corporate tax reporting,
payroll and unemployment taxes, and more. You may also need this to set up a business bank
account. Having it helps to separate your personal expenses from your business expenses too.
Depending on your structure, you may also need to file articles of incorporation, and apply for
state and local sales tax licenses in the regions where you do business. Local regulations may
require you to have a professional license depending on the nature of your services. And you
may need various types of insurance.

Once you're set up, you'll need to track your revenue and expenses and report and remit
federal corporate taxes, federal personal taxes, state corporate taxes, state personal taxes, state
158 ELIZABETH MAYS

and municipal sales taxes, federal and state payroll taxes for any employees you may have,
and federal and state unemployment taxes. Plus, you'll pay into social security (the taxes the
employer usually pays) on the income you receive.

If you don't have time for all this, or the confidence you can manage it accurately, it's wise to
enlist an accountant. If you do something wrong as a business owner, you can't blow it off like
a missed college assignment. Freelancing brings with it a big level of responsibility, and there
can be serious consequences if you're not responsible. The good news is, for all this extra hassle
and taxation, when you're your own boss, you are paying for some of the company overhead
that is "the cost of doing business." Often, you can deduct legitimate business expenses and
reduce the profit that you will pay taxes on. (Again, consult a CPA.)

                                                             Exercise

    Research what's involved to legally set up a small business in your state. Produce a to-do list of the required
    tasks that must be done, in the order they must be completed.

Pricing, Charging and Billing for Your Time

You might think that when you work for yourself, there are no limits to the income you can
make. That's not exactly true. If you're the only person at your business, the hours you have
available to work are finite. To get your maximum salary, multiply the number of hours you
could feasibly work by how much you feasibly bill for those hours.

Do the math and you'll see you can't take on large projects that aren't worth your time. Also
keep in mind that every freelance project has an administrative overhead that you may or may
not be able to bill the client for. So you have to charge enough to make each hour worth your
time.

When you're making those calculations, don't forget that the government could take at least
30% of your profits in taxes (the exact percent depends on your business structure as well as
your other personal income-again, consult an accountant). So you may need to set your hourly
rate higher than you would at a regular employer.

Here's how to calculate your hourly rate. If in the real world your time would be worth
$15/hour, add an extra percentage of that based on the extra taxes you pay for being a self-
employed business owner. Then, divide your monthly health insurance costs (which you'll
have to pay yourself since you don't have an employer) by the number of hours you work
each month to find each hour's portion of health insurance. Then do the same with any other
overhead costs you have. Tack all those on to get your hourly rate.
                                                                       FREELANCING AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CONSULTING AS BUSINESS MODELS 159

Here is a great infographic5 that portrays how to calculate your freelance rate. Or, use this
calculator6 to figure out your cost of doing business.

Speaking of billing, don't forget to do it. When I was an in-house magazine and website editor,
I often found that I would have to remind freelancers to bill me. They were so busy doing their
job as writers that they either forgot to bill me or couldn't find time. Or, they really dreaded
billing because it dragged on their creative energies. This can be a recipe for disaster. You never
know when the contact you work for within a company might move on, making it more effort
for you to remind other people at the company of what you're owed. Don't forget to bill in a
timely way!

Contracts for Freelancing

One good way to make sure you get paid for your work, and to clarify expectations and
minimize the potential for misunderstanding on either side, is to have a contract. They're
a helpful reference point to protect you if something goes sideways-at least you have
documentation of what both parties agreed to. If you ask for a contract and a company doesn't
want to give you one, they're probably shady. Save your talent for another gig.

A good freelance contract will protect both you and the client. But it will probably be biased
to whoever creates it. That's why even though the person commissioning your work will send
you a contract in this business, it can be helpful to have your own to offer as an alternative. It's
worth it to have a lawyer draft a template you can use repeatedly.

While I'm not a lawyer, I can tell you from experience handling freelance agreements as an
editor (and having had my own drafted by a lawyer) that the following points (in addition to
others) should generally be among those addressed in your freelance content contract:

        Scope of Work: What the work or project is that you're agreeing to, with enough
          specifics of the expectations to refer to later if there is a dispute. This is often referred
          to as the "scope of work." It can be helpful if a project runs longer than expected due
          to client delays, or if the client chooses to grow the project and wants you to do more
          than originally agreed to. Or if the client sells their company and the new owner
          suddenly expects you to do something more or different for the same price.

        Compensation: How much you'll be paid for the work, when, and how, and whether
          or not revisions or modifications they ask for are included in the fee, or additional.
160 ELIZABETH MAYS

          (Tip: You want them to be additional.) You might also include a clause re. terms for
          late payment-perhaps you charge interest or a late fee.
        Independent Contractor Status: The fact you are an independent contractor, not an
          employee, that you will pay taxes directly to the government on the income received,
          and that you have control over the when, where, and how of your work. (This is the
          employer's way of stating they don't owe you benefits, they won't lend you office
          space or equipment, they won't withhold taxes, and they don't have to pay employer
          taxes or insurance like unemployment or worker's compensation on you.) On your
          end, it gives you lifestyle control (in return for losing all these benefits and paying
          your own taxes-at a notably higher percentage on self-employment income).
        Rights: A contract will generally specify what rights you're selling-if you sell all
          rights, that means you can't re-release the content you produce somewhere else,
          whether that's for your own website or for someone else who'll pay you to republish
          it. And the publisher gets to keep reusing the content in ways that may gain them
          further revenue. So if you sign away all rights, make sure the fee is worth it. At
          minimum, you may want an exception that lets you put the work in your own online
          portfolio. Often you will be selling First North American Serial Rights, which give the
          publisher the right to be first in publishing your work in North America. Then the
          copyright reverts back to you.
        No Infringement: In the contract, you'll probably have to warrant that you're
          creating original content that doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights (copyright, etc.).
          You may also have to certify that you've ensured the information is accurate.
          Sometimes there will be a clause that says the company will not pay your legal fees if
          something you send them gets them sued. Sometimes there will be a clause that says
          you're not responsible. At minimum, it is good to have a clause that indemnifies you if
          the company edits something in a way that causes legal difficulty for them or you (an
          inexperienced editor changes something in a way that makes it defamatory, for
          example or adds a photo they took from the Internet without having the rights). Note
          that you can be held legally responsible for work you do as a freelancer. You should be
          extra careful to be accurate and abide by media law and ethics. And you may want to
          consider errors and omissions insurance depending on the nature of the content you
          produce.
        Confidentiality: You may have to agree to a confidentiality clause.
        Non-Compete: Some contracts will have a "non-compete" clause. I tell my students
          it's almost never worth it to sign one of these as a freelancer, unless it's at a major
          media brand. As an example, at a magazine I once worked at, most of the writers
          signed a clause that if they quit or were fired, they would never work at another
          lifestyle magazine in that metro. That meant if they left the company, they either had
          to find another profession, or move out of the state to find work. Don't put yourself in
          this position.
        Non-payment: What happens if they don't pay you, or don't pay you in a timely way?
                                                                       FREELANCING AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CONSULTING AS BUSINESS MODELS 161

          It's good to have a clause that reverts any rights to you if this happens so that you can
          try to sell the work to someone else.

Again, not a lawyer. But as a business owner, these are the bare-minimum things I expect to
see in content-related freelance contracts.

Marketing Yourself as Freelancer

We'll talk more about marketing in a future Chapter, so we won't go too in-depth here. But
there are several things you will definitely need in your marketing arsenal as a freelancer:

        Website (You can build something cheap and easy on WordPress.com, or use a
          platform like Wix, Squarespace, or Weebly.)

        Opt-in (It's critical that people be able to give you their email when they land on your
          website, so that you can identify and communicate with the people-aka leads-who
          are potentially interested in your services.)

        Email marketing (You'll need a tool like MailChimp or similar to send emails to your
          audience.)

        Professional social media presence (People need to be able to research, find and
          connect with you -- the professional you -- on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and
          other networks.)

        Content marketing (Content could be anything from blog posts to emails to a podcast
          to YouTube videos or more as long as it's engaging, relevant, and effective at reaching
          and engaging your target audience.)

        Networking (If you get into freelancing because you don't like to interface with
          people, well, you may still have to do some of that in order to find clients.) Local
          industry groups are a low-pressure way to tap into a network if you're not naturally
          social.

Ways to Fail at Freelancing

Freelancing isn't right for everyone, and there are plenty of ways to fail at it:

        As a freelancer your income threshold is capped at the number of hours you work
          times the amount you charge for them. So if you overcommit your hours and fail to
          deliver, or if you charge too little per hour and fail to bring in the necessary income,
          that can put you out of business.

        Taking on a bad contract that traps you in a situation that isn't a great deal for you
          (for instance, a non-compete or an exclusive contract) can be detrimental. Be careful
          about what you sign.

        Freelancing is the delicate balance of finding work and doing the work. If you spend
          too much time cultivating potential clients, you won't have time to do the work you
162 ELIZABETH MAYS

          have. Likewise if you spend too much time working alone, you won't have time or
          energy to add to your client roster.
        Every client you take on has an administrative cost. So shoot for steady clients rather
          than one-time gigs.
        You'll have periods of feast and famine as a consultant and you must be like the fabled
          ant, not the grasshopper7 if you want to win the long game. Keep your monthly bills
          (business and personal) as low as possible and resist the urge to live large.

Weathering the Lifestyle

You might think that freelancing will give you freedom. And it does, to a certain extent. But
even though you're not necessarily out of work if your client fires you, it can be scarier in that
you probably won't have the protections of unemployment insurance or a pool of vacation
days to cash out for a few months off. If you're sick and can't work, you don't earn income.
When you lose a client, you'll have to find a new one to replace them. And that process may
or may not be instantaneous. When you're a freelancer, it's critical to have a financial cushion,
which will help you weather the periods of feast or famine in freelance work.

The secret to longevity? Stay in it. I once had an acting professor who had had a more
successful career than most. One of my friends asked him what the secret was to making it as
an actor. His answer? Just stay in it long enough. You can't compete if you don't play. If you
want to be a freelancer, stay in it. Your clients will come and go. That's okay. Keep looking for
work, doing good work and billing for that work, and you'll be fine.

                                                             Exercise

    Pretend for a moment that you have no choice but to work for yourself. What would you sell as your product
    and service? (Tip: Think about this in the context of where you perceive a need, problem, or opportunity in the
    marketplace and where that opportunity aligns with your unique talents and passions.)

FROM THE FIELD: HOW TO GET AND KEEP
GIGS AS A FREELANCE JOURNALIST

Georgann Yara

 From the Field

 My Story

  You can take the freelance plunge soon after tossing your cap in the air or envision it as a future turn
  in a semi-seasoned journalism career. My path was the latter.

  After 12 years in daily and weekly newspapers, I was looking for something new. I loved what I did and
  freelancing gave me the opportunity to continue doing that with the perks of flexibility with regard to
  the kind of writing I'd be doing and the topics I'd cover.

  By the time I went freelance, I had been in the Phoenix journalism market for 10 years. Word got
  out about my career decision quickly and I got offers immediately. That was in 2006, and I've been
  busy ever since. My experience covering just about every beat from movie and restaurant reviews
  to breaking news and courts came in handy and expanded my potential client pool, which includes
  newspapers, magazines, online publications, and special print projects, i.e. coffee table books and
  bios for award luncheon programs. None of this work, however, has been in public relations or
  marketing.

  First, the good stuff: I love calling the shots, from the hours I work and when I work them to the kind
  of jobs I take and leave on the table. The commute from my bedroom to the living room couch, patio,
  or wherever I want my headquarters to be can't be beat.

  It feels good to skip the full makeup and hair routine every morning, and keep the grown-up clothes
  in the closet. My dry cleaning bills decreased immensely, as did stress amped up by occasional rush
  hour road rage. Running errands on a Tuesday mid-morning is definitely more relaxing than battling
  the crowds on a Saturday afternoon.
166 GEORGANN YARA

  Of course there are a few comforts I miss. A steady and predictable paycheck is one of them.
  Paid vacations are another. If I'm not working, essentially I'm not getting paid. In a newsroom, I
  was compensated for downtime spent chatting with co-workers, perusing the Internet, the cake
  celebrations for co-workers' birthdays or last day at the office, and pretty much every non-work
  activity that consumed 15 minutes or less. That compensation no longer exists. I do budget time into
  my day for non-work tasks -- checking my social media channels, dentist appointments, laundry --
  but I maintain an efficient schedule that allows me to complete all my assignments on deadline each
  week. Is this perfect? No. But it has worked just fine for me for more than a decade. Here are some
  tips to make freelancing work for you.

 Getting Gigs

  Look for new magazines or newspapers around town or in your neighborhood. Those stands outside
  of grocery stores and local magazines in the waiting room at medical offices are filled with potential
  clients. Also, search writing websites that offer jobs. The neat thing is that you can take work based
  in any city as long as the company will allow you to work remotely.

  Being new on the freelance scene, I felt the need to generate clips and credibility as a solo writer and
  get on people's radars. Taking as many jobs as possible to get your name out there is key. I took pretty
  much any gig that was offered to me, regardless of the pay, for the first two years or so. Also, pitching
  ideas does the same. Often, one leads to another. And never underestimate the power of word-of-
  mouth. When you do good work, word travels. When you do bad work, word travels.

  Be open-minded. You may think you know exactly the kind of stories or projects to which you want
  to dedicate your career, but leave the door open to discovering something new. It may be a subset
  of a topic you initially don't care for that you discover excites you. It could be something you never
  thought of that requires you to indulge a creative or pensive side. Being willing to do anything is an
  asset to any writer, especially at the start of a freelance career. Stretching your limits also keeps you
  learning, while keeping burnout at bay.

  Network with other freelancers in the industry -- writers or PR people. Your peers are a great
  resource for jobs, support, and skills. They also know what you're going through and, if need be, can
  commiserate with you about wacky editors or demanding clients. I can't tell you how often a fellow
  freelancer has provided insight and talked me off the ledge.

  These connections also can create a positive job domino effect. An example: a fellow freelancer did
  occasional work for US Magazine. One day, an editor there needed a Phoenix-based writer for an
  assignment but she was unavailable. My colleague gave her my contact info and the next day I was
                                                                    FREELANCING AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CONSULTING AS BUSINESS MODELS 167

scouring the Valley on a hunt for Tiger Woods. My searching came up empty, but I got paid well for
my work and it led to more assignments chasing down leads and rumors involving celebs, which was
a fun -- although frustrating at times -- new experience. When that editor left the magazine and took
over at an online publication, she needed writers. She reached out to me and I was able to do more
projects that paid equally well.

Keeping Gigs

There are two really important things you can do to please your editors.

Deadlines -- always, always meet them. I cannot stress this enough. About halfway through my
freelance career, I was surprised to hear from editors that a significant number of freelancers did not
meet their deadlines. I thought this would be the easiest requirement to meet since it is really the only
factor completely within your control from the start. I believe that my ability to meet deadline -- I only
blew it once and it was by 30 minutes -- has been a huge factor in keeping jobs and getting new ones.
An editor can always clean up copy or ask you to tweak the project, but their hands are tied if they
don't have anything to work with.

Deliver clean copy. If deadlines are the most important, this is second. Learn what style your
publication wants -- AP style or one developed just for the company, for example -- and follow it to
the T. If it's their own style, take a good look at their published articles so you have an idea of what it
entails. And this may sound like a given, but you'd be surprised at how many people overlook spelling
(beware of auto-correct), punctuation, and basic grammar before hitting "send."

The Business Side

OK, here's the practical reality check.

If your spouse has employer-provided benefits, then you can skip this paragraph. If not, employer-
provided health insurance is one thing that freelancers miss. Quality healthcare is tough to get on
your own without a steep price tag. If you're healthy or have a hefty savings account that you can
access if needed, you may be OK. If not, you may need to consider taking a job that offers benefits
until your freelance business is up and running on all cylinders.

Figuring out a monthly budget seems like a no-brainer, but having one that's specific that you will
stick to is crucial when you're not guaranteed a paycheck. It also gives you an idea of what you'll need
to make each month and therefore a rate to offer potential clients. About half of my clients come to
me with a rate, but the other half ask for one. Coming up with a standard rate that made me happy
168 GEORGANN YARA

  without scaring off potential clients was one of the most difficult aspects of settling into being my
  own boss.

  You may not be receiving a set amount every two weeks, but it's possible to generate a base income.
  Try to get regular assignments that provide steady income that you can count on. If you know that
  you'll be getting at least $800 a week for two or three assignments then it'll be easier to craft a
  monthly budget and determine what other jobs you can and should take. For the last five years or so,
  I've had three assignments that are due every week, which gives me a predictable minimum "salary"
  through the busy and slow times.

 The Long View

  Speaking of money and success, determine what that means for you on a priority scale. Over the
  years, I found that money has moved down from the top priority position in my life to the fourth --
  after enjoyment, fulfillment, and time and effort. If pay remains at the top for you, that's perfectly fine.
  Just know that you'll discover how that affects the rest of your priority list.

  That said, try to get a diverse project folder going that is balanced with jobs that pay well and those
  that may not pay as well but that you find fulfilling. Throwing in a pro bono job for a cause that you
  believe in or for a good friend every now and then will give you a fresh perspective too.

  Try not to pack your schedule so tight that if a neat opportunity comes along that you would love, you
  are unable to take it. Early on, I wasn't comfortable keeping a workload with wiggle room. But after
  a couple of years of kicking myself over opportunities lost because I simply didn't have the time, I
  managed to find that sweet spot between steady busy and not too hectic. Eventually, you'll find that
  sweet spot too.

FROM THE FIELD: HOW I DITCHED THE 9
TO 5 AND BUILT A BUSINESS I COULD LIVE
WITH

Lori Benjamin

 From the Field

 My Story

  I started working as a freelance content marketing writer after about 15 years of work in traditional
  marketing and advertising, mostly in the business-to-business software field. So, I come to it from
  a business rather than a journalism lens. Content marketing felt like an enormous (and obvious)
  breakthrough. For years, I'd been asked to write product-focused emails and online ads designed to
  interrupt busy people with a sales pitch. Now suddenly, I had clients who wanted to produce things
  that people would actually seek out and read. What a concept!

  I discovered content marketing after leaving my ad agency job in the city behind and moving to an
  island about two hours north of Seattle and an hour by ferry from the mainland. Commuting was not
  an option. After five years of writing emails for Microsoft clients, I needed to update and sharpen my
  skills. It was 2012, and new ideas, voices, and technologies occasionally broke through the ad agency
  bubble, but were usually rejected in my commercial, business-to-business niche.

  From my first Skype interview as an islander, it was clear I had a lot to catch up on. I began
  investigating marketing blogs in earnest, and found sites like Copyblogger, HubSpot, Seth Godin,
  Content Marketing Institute, and Convince and Convert. I had a decent portfolio, but not much for
  bylined articles, and I was competing against writers much younger than me. At first, all I found were
  clients asking me to work for less than minimum wage: To type fast and think very little.

  Ultimately, LinkedIn turned out to be my most valuable tool. As an "early adopter," I had started
  collecting recommendations around 2007--a great way to establish credibility in a field where almost
170 LORI BENJAMIN

  nothing I wrote had my name on it. I began applying for any and every job I felt qualified for, no
  matter where it was based geographically. Unless the job description said specifically, "This is an
  onsite position," I sent an application. If it seemed like a perfect match, sometimes I applied anyway,
  ending my cover letter with a polite, "I hope you'll consider me as a remote candidate for this position
  or alternatively, for any project work I may be able to help you with."

  After a few months of this, I started picking up work that paid reasonably well. Within the first 18
  months, I was making a decent living writing ebooks and ghostwriting guest blog posts on the very
  content marketing websites I'd been reading. I was over the moon.

  The content marketer's motto: Be helpful.

  "Content marketing" is nothing new, of course. John Deere has been publishing its brand magazine,
  The Furrow, since 1895. Today however, every brand in the world is up against the overwhelming
  information overload that we all experience in our multi-screen, multi-tasked lives. Audience attention
  is the holy grail.

  Because of the Internet and social media, the corporate decision-makers who've been my target
  audience for most of my career increasingly choose to do their own research, reaching out to sales
  only after they're close to reaching a decision. It makes sense for software companies to offer insight
  and context as a part of that research conversation. Not many executives have the time or patience
  for traditional direct mail gimmicks and other interruption advertising tactics.

  Marketing is an exciting field to be in now, because it's changing so rapidly. It's much more customer-
  and data-focused than it was even a couple of years ago--which means that good, effective work
  rises to the fore more consistently. Formats change constantly--in the past year, podcasts and video
  have surged. Virtual reality is on the horizon. But words will always be essential to communication,
  whatever the medium. If you're a disciplined writer with a curious, creative bent and a basic
  understanding of business, you can make it work.

  A few tips, for starters:

         Take a creative writing workshop (or three). If I had a stronger technology or business
           education, I'm sure that would be valuable, but I cannot imagine a better preparation for my
           work than the many creative writing workshops I took in college and graduate school.
           Sitting in a room with my peers, I learned how to give and receive constructive feedback. To
           listen even when the critique I heard caused a spike in my blood pressure. To respond with
                                                          FREELANCING AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CONSULTING AS BUSINESS MODELS 171

  thoughtful, creative rewrites that, as often as not, turned out better than the original. There's
  more than one way of nailing it.
 Choose unpaid work wisely. If you're starting with no portfolio or experience, it may make
  sense to write for people who expect you to work for next to nothing. But it may make even
  more sense to write on a topic of your own choosing and develop credibility and a following
  that way. Go ahead and build expertise in an area with high income potential--but make
  sure you also feed your personal passions. That well of sincere interest and curiosity is
  where the best insights and writing come from.
 You are your client's voice. In high-demand fields, you can make upwards of $100 an hour
  as an established marketing writer, but never forget: Your client is in charge. Don't like the
  feedback you're getting? Take a deep breath and open your ears. Your work is not only
  about whether you can put together sentences that make people sit up and take notice. It's
  most essentially about doing it in a way that accomplishes your client's goals.
 Professional courtesy is crucial. In building client and team relationships, you'll find a
  collaborative mindset and a positive, pragmatic attitude much more effective than quick
  criticism or competitive maneuvering.
 It's okay to fire a client. There's nothing worse than a client who doesn't seem to respect
  your time and effort (unless it's the client who flat-out refuses to pay at all). You will come
  across those people, unless you're very lucky. Set your boundaries early, and keep a list of
  the qualities you expect from clients. Professional courtesy goes both ways.
 You are the boss of you. Don't feel like working? Think you can fudge that deadline and go
  skiing with your friends? As an independent consultant, you have a lot of leeway around
  when and how much you work. But if you commit to a deadline and don't make it, you risk
  losing a client, pure and simple.
 Print it out and proofread it before you hit send. Deliver a document full of typos and
  repetition, and your client will be predisposed to ripping it to shreds, metaphorically
  speaking. Read the print-out one last time before you send it. You'll be amazed at what you
  didn't catch onscreen. Aim for perfection, so your client can focus on the message rather
  than the misplaced apostrophe.
 Client relationships are your lifeblood. When you work remotely, it can be hard to connect
  with people and maintain relationships. But one great connection can truly make or break
  your career. In my industry, people move from company to company constantly, which
  means two things: 1) My contact at Client XYZ could jump ship at any time and I could lose
  the business, and 2) My contact at Client XYZ could bring me many additional clients during
  her career. To develop a stable freelance business, treat people with respect and loyalty
  always. If you sense any issue, head it off immediately by reaching out personally.
172 LORI BENJAMIN

STARTUP FUNDING: INTRODUCTION

CJ Cornell

Overview

In modern entrepreneurship, "funding" is mentioned so often that it almost seems like a
required step in the process. New companies, particularly companies that are developing
brand-new products, often don't have customers or revenues when they start. These startups
need money for product development, and to support the company's operations until revenues
(sales) pay the bills. Often, the more innovative the product, the longer it will take to develop,
or to reach a large market. So a new company needs money to develop and survive during this
innovation startup period.

Anyone who has been exposed to entrepreneurial success stories of the past fifty years--from
Apple, Microsoft and Amazon to Google, Facebook, Uber, and Airbnb--is familiar with the
vital role angel investors, venture capitalists, and initial public offerings played in funding
these multi-billion-dollar success stories. But it wasn't always this way. Prior to the twentieth
century--unless you were starting a new railroad or oil or steel company--most likely your
new business was a small retail business or farming business. For small businesses, there
really was no "product development" and your market was easily identifiable: they were your
neighbors.

In those earlier times, if your business made a profit then you might have some extra money to
expand. Today we call this "organic growth": funding the growth of your new company from
revenues from sales (to customers).

             Discussion/Assignment: Can you identify any modern, successful companies that did not use outside funding to
             develop their product or service before becoming successful?

Most "small businesses" fall into this category: right from the very beginning they have a
product or service they can sell to customers who are very accessible. They don't have to
develop any new product innovations, hire a large team, or spend a lot of money trying to find
customers. Thus, most small businesses don't need outside funding. These businesses can be
started with the founder's personal savings or credit, and grow as revenues grow.

But if your startup is developing something brand-new or cutting edge, or you are trying to
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 177

reach brand-new customers or markets, then it is likely you will need external funding--i.e.,
funding that does not come from the entrepreneur's personal money, or from the company's
revenues. Venture capital, angel funding, debt, grants, and crowdfunding are the most
common sources of funding for early-stage companies.

The Language of Funding

Before we dive into the world of startup funding, you will need to learn some of the language.
Even studying the common funding lingo provides a good introduction and insights into the
startup funding landscape.

Note: The list below is not exhaustive, just some of terms we will use in the next sections.

                startup that has made progress with
                developing a product and attracting
                customers.

There is no set funding path for entrepreneurial startups. The path depends on two factors:
What the startup needs (funding requirements) and the potential return on investment.

        Funding requirements of the startup: May vary wildly, depending on the type of
          company, product, product development costs, and expected time until break-even

        Funding sources: The preferred investment size, industry sector, expected ROI, and
          the total they have available

Many small businesses, and service businesses never need outside funding since they are able
to generate revenue right away. Other startups need significant funding to develop a product
and to grow fast--to dominate a market.

For the former, bootstrap or self-funding may be enough to sustain the operations until
revenues can support the company. For the high growth (usually high-tech) ventures, they
will need significant external investment--in the millions, tens of millions or even hundreds
of millions of dollars. For these companies. the funding path is usually pre-seed/seed funding
to prove the idea or market; then successive Series A, B, C investments to fully launch the
product, market, and expand and grow the company.

STARTUP FUNDING: WHY FUNDING

CJ Cornell

First, let's define funding, in the context of entrepreneurship and startup companies. For the
purposes of this chapter we are referring to external funding.

As an entrepreneur, you might think you need external funding. External funding usually
means:

        Funding (money) exchanged in return for stock in the startup company (equity), loan
          payments (debt), or for a series of payments (e.g. royalties).

        Funding is not the result of the sale of a product or service.
        The startup receives cash (money that can be deposited into the startup's bank

          account)-- as opposed to other products/services the company needs. (For instance: If
          an organization provides your startup with office space, laptops, or servers, this is not
          considered funding).
        Funding is from a person or organization not officially affiliated with the company
          (i.e.,--not an employee, founder, or major customer).

Most other forms of funding would be "internal" or organic funding--from the founder's
family, or from consulting or other revenues. While these are valid and common forms of
funding for startups, they don't require formal or deliberate fundraising activities and
preparations--and the money is not dependent or controlled by sources unrelated to the
company.

When entrepreneurs think about funding, usually their first thoughts are "How much do we
need" and "How do we get funding for our project or company?" And then "Where can we find
funding?" or "Who can we ask for funding?"

And these are the right questions--but in the wrong order. There are more important
questions that need to be asked, and answered, first:

        Why do you need (external) funding?
        What is the unique product or service?
        What specific value will you offer to customers? That is, what is your "value

          proposition"?
        What is your industry category, or product category?
184 CJ CORNELL

        What is your mission?
        What are the risks?

Asking those first questions is more than just an exercise, or soul-searching. The answers will,
in part, dictate "who" you should be asking for funding. The "who" should be aligned with the
"what." Only then should you work on the "how" to secure funding.

Before we focus on the details of startup funding sources, and how to attract and secure
funding, let's first focus on the "why"--but from the perspective of the funding sources.
Knowing why they want to fund a company or project is vital. Your reasons need to be aligned
with their reasons. It the reasons are not aligned, then nothing else matters.

If you need funding to pay yourself a salary, pay back loans, or to merely make sure the
business can pay its current bills then the chances are you will never obtain outside funding.
But if you need funding to advance your product development efforts, launch a new product,
to enter new markets, or to grow and expand then your reasons may be more aligned with
funders' reasons.

             Discussion/Assignment: Can you think of reasons why people, companies, and organizations with money would
             want to be the source of funding for startups and new projects?

Reasons for Funding (from the Other Side of the Table)

When anyone provides support, resources or money to someone else, there is always an
"agenda," or motivation. This is not as devious or as mercenary as it sounds. A parent pays
their child's tuition because they want their child to have a better chance at being happy
and successful. When a person sends money to a political campaign, or for a climate change
awareness group, it's because they feel these organizations will advance a viewpoint or cause
on their behalf. It's still an investment; it's just that the return on investment is not explicitly a
financial gain.

As a founder of a new venture, new startup, or a new project that might become a new
company, your objectives need to be aligned with those of the potential funding source.
Talking about how your revolutionary new blockchain technology is going change the quality
of life in underdeveloped countries is not going to resonate with a local bank that only cares
about loans, interest rates, and collateral.

Every funding source has an intention, motivation, or some kind of potential benefit they
expect as a result of providing the funding. They also want to maximize the chances of success
and minimize risks of failure. In other words, they want to allocate their funding to projects or
companies that have the best chance of advancing their interests.

Here are some of the most common reasons why people and organizations fund new ventures:

                          Funder Motivations Table

Motivation Description of Motivation

Profits Only A pure financial ROI--usually looking for "windfall" profits (significant financial gains--better than almost any other)

Profits,     While financial ROI is the simplest motivation, it is usually not without
within an    other interests. For instance a venture capital firm wants windfall profits, of
"Investment  course, but they also may want to invest in companies that advance certain
Thesis"      industries or technologies. Or they may invest in companies that
             demonstrate a culture of diversity, for example.

Economic The funding organization wants to support new companies that will create
Development new jobs within their region.

Ecosystem The funding organization wants to ensure there are many companies
Development innovating around a new technology or platform.

Strategic    The funding organization is looking for startups working on products or
             technologies, or penetrating markets, that are aligned with the organization
             (usually a corporation)'s goals.

Charitable,  The funding organization is looking for startups that embrace principles
Altruistic   (social, business, etc.) that are aligned with the organization's charitable
             mission (e.g., advancing women's health care issues).

             Because the funding organization's mission is a combination of economic

Industry     development and ecosystem development, it is designed to fund projects

Development that will advance help an entire industry (e.g., Knight Foundation supports

             Journalism projects).

                                    In-Class Exercise

Web Search: Can you name some funding organizations focusing on ecosystem development? e.g., Bitcoin/
Blockchain, Mobile/Android funds. Facebook app funds(s); or, other funding initiatives and organizations that
are not strictly for profit.

Now, let's look at the most common reasons why entrepreneurs seek outside funding for their
projects and companies.

of Proceeds"

Research        Activities exploring new product,                           Usually of very little interest (as the
                marketability, customer demand,                             sole reason)--may be of interest if
                etc.                                                        combined with other reasons

                distribution.

             Discussion: Can you think of reasons why a company--particularly a startup--might want to raise money--even if
             they *have* money?

Before embarking on the funding journey, it's critical to be very self-aware of your reasons
for needing funding, the kind of company you are, and what value you offer. Only then can
you start pursuing potential funders whose methods and mission are aligned with yours.
Otherwise, it's a long, painful, and frustrating exercise in futility--a path many entrepreneurs
take on the road to failure.

Preparation

All funding requires some preparation and pre-requisites (even winning the lottery requires
buying a ticket). Applying for loans requires forms, documentation, and collateral.
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 187

Most funding sources for startups require a set of presentation materials, or a deliberate
application.

Generally all will require:

        Description of a clear market problem/pain you are solving (or a new market
          opportunity you are addressing)

        Clear descriptions of the company and idea (product or service)
        A solid and capable management team
        Customer/market validation:

                                Evidence that you are addressing a big market problem or opportunity
                                Evidence of a market, and evidence of customer traction
                                Any external validation or endorsements

        Product/service innovation (USP)

                                Evidence of product viability (that the innovation will translate into a product)

        Financials--estimates/forecasts of costs, revenues and profits
        ROI potential, growth potential
        Funding request/requirements, use of proceeds

If you're starting a social entrepreneurship venture, then the ROI or financials might not be
a requirement, but there may be more requirements about describing the social impact. Very
early stage companies (idea stage) won't have most of this information. Idea-stage companies
typically seek funding that will help them develop the idea to the point where they will be able
to answer that list of questions.

               1. The startup should be clear on the reasons they need outside funding.
               2. The startup should understand the different sources of funding available (and the motivations of
               each kind of funding source).

               3. The startup should make sure that their reasons are aligned with the funding source's reasons.

STARTUP FUNDING: TRADITIONAL
VENTURE FUNDING

CJ Cornell

Traditional Funding

Recently, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation (the world's foremost organization

focusing on entrepreneurship and education), posted some data on the most common sources
of funding for new companies:1

                         Common Funding Sources for New Companies Table

Source                 Amount Share

Banks and Other Loans  38,059  34.09%

Personal Savings       32,658  30.00%

Friends and Family     6,910   6.30%

Credit Cards           6,756   6.20%

Angel Investors        6,350   5.80%

Venture Capital        4,804   4.40%

Government Related     2,129   2.00%

Other                  11,350  10.40%

TOTAL                  109,016 100.00%

But this data needs some interpretation: It appears that Angel and VC funding (the kinds most
commonly associated with new ventures) barely total 10 percent of all startup funding.

This can be misleading. First: "new company" is not the same thing as a "startup" in the
entrepreneurial sense of the word. The vast majority falling under the broad definition of "new
company" are really small businesses--those that are not developing a new product or service,
nor addressing new markets. Thus, the level of risk and investment needed is much lower than
typical high-technology ventures.

In addition, the chart does not differentiate between the stage of company seeking funding.
In other words, a startup's founder might use personal savings, credit cards, and loans from
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 191

family to get started--but once the startup becomes a company with a more definable product
and market, it's time for other forms of funding.

Venture Funding

In the context of startup ventures and entrepreneurship, funding equals external resources
(usually money), plus some support. External means the resources are being controlled by
individuals, groups, companies or organizations that are not officially connected to the startup
venture. Resources means cash/money (usually), but in many cases resources are other
instruments of value for the new company: a line of credit, office space, retail or manufacturing
space, equipment, supplies, or access to distribution channels.

And since the funding source has a vested interest in seeing the new startup succeed, the
funding often comes with support--in the form of advisors, board members, connection to key
customers or markets, etc.

Attracting and Securing Funding

This is the big question on the minds of most new entrepreneurs. In the beginning, most
aren't too discerning. The type of funding needs to match the type of startup company, and its
situation. For instance, if a startup company feels they can guarantee payback of a $500,000
loan within two years with 20 percent interest--but they approach venture capital firms--it
will be a futile quest. Regardless of if it's a good deal, financially, venture capitalists, as a general
rule, just don't loan money to startups.

                         Money is money, right? And this is the moment when entrepreneurs
                          begin to waste a lot of time and effort chasing the wrong kinds of

                                                           funding.

So, in the following sections, we'll explore the different funding types typically available to
entrepreneurs, and to the companies they create. We'll dive in a little as to "who" the funding
sources are (who controls the money), what interests them, what motivates them, and where
you can find them--so you can understand which sources are appropriate for your company,
how to prepare, attract, and secure the funding.

If you are a student entrepreneur, or someone with just a raw idea (and not a company), then
many of the funding sources described will not apply--at least not yet. But entrepreneurs who
understand the language of funding and the broader landscape will have a distinct advantage
over those who only focus on their short-term needs.

Venture Capital

When it comes to funding entrepreneurial startups--especially high-tech, high-growth
companies--most people think of venture capital. Take any modern, startup-to-billion dollar
success story, and you'll find that the company had significant investment, and help, from
venture capitalists.
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 193

The Venture Capital Industry

Venture capital firms typically manage money on behalf of large institutions (e.g. pension
funds, university endowments) and sometimes on behalf of corporations and extremely
wealthy individuals. VC firms then try to identity and invest in high-growth companies that
will transform the investment into windfall returns. Some quick facts:

        VC fund sizes range from the small (under $150M), medium ($250M to $1B) to large
          (>$1B).

        As a general rule of thumb, VCs know that 4 out of 5 of the companies they invest in
          will fail (i.e. not provide an acceptable ROI), so:

        VCs need companies that are capable of (or have the potential) to generate 20, 50 or
          100 times the original investment in 5-10 years.

        VCs are looking for companies that can scale.

During 20163, total invested: $59.3 Billion in 4,799 deals--broken down as follows:

        Seed Stage: $2.07B in 1,428 deals
        Early Stage: $10.48B in 1,272 deals
        Expansion Stage: $20.65B in 985 deals
        Later Stage: $20.84B in 429 deals

The total invested--$59.3 Billion--is quite a large number--and that is just in one average year.
But looking at the details we see:

        VCs funded fewer than 1,500 seed stage companies (i.e., their first money in).
        And even if you look at all of the "startups," they only invested in 2,700 companies.

          Given the number of companies formed each year seeking funding, it doesn't take
          much to figure out how rare attracting venture capital really is.

But let's take a look at where venture capital is being invested, into what industries and what
kinds of companies, so you can determine if there is alignment with your objectives:

              6                 2,358

VCs predominantly invest in Internet, mobile/telecom and software companies--both in the
number of deals and the amount invested. Note that out of 4,799 total deals in 2016, only 8 of
them were in media. Media received an infinitesimal amount-not even 1 percent-of the total
dollars invested.

Where VCs Invest (Regionally)56

The top five regions for VC investment in 1Q 2017 were San Francisco, New York metro,
Silicon Valley, New England, and the Southeast, according to a recent PwC MoneyTree Report.
National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook Data7 shows that more than half of the
value of first-quarter VC deals was invested on the West Coast.

Not surprisingly VCs invest within the top regional entrepreneurial ecosystems in the U.S.
While not a hard rule, the prevailing wisdom is, if you want VC funding, prepare to move to
Silicon Valley, New York, or Boston.

How to Find VCs

It's easy to search the Web for venture capital firms--most belong to the NVCA (National
Venture Capital Association)--NVCA.org. And VC firms' partners and associates can be found
speaking at local venture/entrepreneur events, sitting on panels, blogging, or writing articles.
Identifying VC firms and partner names is usually not that hard.
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 195

                                                        In-Class Exercise

    Look up the top five venture capital firms and identify one of their partners in your region.

But, as we'll find with almost every kind of investor--the most common (and preferred)
method of connecting to an venture capitalist (or angel investor) is through a personal
introduction. Cold calls or unsolicited emails usually won't get any response.

The most common complaint among young entrepreneurs is that they don't know anyone
who would provide an introduction. But introductions to busy VCs aren't impossible, even for
brand-new entrepreneurs. Many VCs participate at local entrepreneurship events, panels, or
contests and are fairly easy to meet. Entrepreneurs usually interact with other entrepreneurs,
advisors, mentors, lawyers, accountants etc., all of whom may be able to provide an
introduction--directly or indirectly--to a venture capitalist.

How to Determine if VC Funding is Appropriate for your Company

VCs generally like the following conditions for investing in a company.
        Solving a clear market pain, problem (or opportunity)--the bigger the better
        A strong team with clear track record--that can execute on the plan
        An "unfair advantage" over potential competition
        Demonstrating customer traction
        Demonstrating market validation (product-market fit)
        If your startup is weak on any of those conditions, either VC funding may night be the
          right path, or you need to demonstrate how you will address the weaknesses.

                                                      Instructor Resource

             Look up successful companies that got their initial, external, funding from angel investors vs. VCs.
               Discuss the origin stories of Google and / or Facebook.

             Look at case studies where the presence of too much venture capital was cited as the cause of
               failure for a well-known venture. Examples include Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com, Flooz, Color.com, and
               others. Use this list8 as a starting point.

Angel Funding

For earlier stage startups, angel investors are the more likely alternative to VC funding.
196 CJ CORNELL

Some metrics for angel funding for the year 2016:9

        A total of 64,380 entrepreneurial ventures received angel funding,
        from 297,880 active investors,
        for a total of $21.3 billion,
        with an average deal size of $330,185.

How to Find Angels

Given the number of angel investors (or potential angels) out there, finding an angel is a lot
easier than finding a venture capitalist.

In his popular blog "Startup Professionals" blogger, advisor and angel investor Martin Zwilling
offers some concise advice for finding and engaging with angel investors:10

        Angels invest in people, more often than they invest in ideas. That means they need to
          know you, or someone they trust who does know you (warm introduction). For
          credibility, they need to know you BEFORE you are asking for money.

        Angel investors are people too. Investors expect you to understand their motivation,
          respect their time, and show your integrity in all actions. They probably won't
          respond well to high-pressure sales tactics, information overload, or bribes.

        Angels like to "touch and feel" their investments, so they are generally only interested
          in local opportunities. It won't help your case or your workload to do an email blast
          and follow-up with 250,000 members around the world.

        But angel investing is risky and time consuming--so more and more, angels are
          pooling their money and joining groups.

Angel Groups

In 2016, direct investments reported from U.S. angel groups more than doubled from the year
prior:11

        The median size of investment (where angel groups co-invest with other investors) in
          first-round deals was $950,000.

        Groups located in the Northeast make roughly 7 percent of their investments outside
          of their region, while California groups make 43 percent of their investments outside
          their state. Having access to the necessary resources and tools is crucial for the
          success of angel groups looking to invest outside of their region.

        California accounted for 30 percent of all angel-funded early stage deals in 2016,
          followed by the Southeast, New York, and the Northeast, all of which hovered around
          10 percent. Angel groups invested in software (34.3 percent), health care (17.3
          percent), B2B (13.0 percent), Internet and mobile (11.2 percent), and B2C (10.3
          percent). No other industry or sector generated more than a 2 percent share in funded
          deals.
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 197

The most active angel groups with multiple locations or networks included Keiretsu Forum,
Tech Coast Angels, Investors Circle, Golden Seeds, and Astia Angels.

Resources for Finding Angel Groups:

        Gust 12 (formerly AngelSoft)
          This is perhaps the most widely used source of information on angel investor groups.
          Gust claims to have facilitated over $1 billion of investments in 500,000 startups to
          date, via connection through their platform to over 70,000 angel investors in 190
          countries.

        AngelList 13
          AngelList has featured over three million businesses for potential investors in a
          format that is, effectively, a social network for entrepreneurs and angels. They claim
          to have already raised over $560 million for 1,400 startups, primarily in the U.S. and
          Europe. In addition, they serve as a jobs available site for 24,000 startups.

        Keiretsu Forum 14
          This site claims to be the world's largest single angel investor network, with 2,500
          accredited investor members throughout 52 chapters on three continents. Since its
          founding in 2000, its members have invested over $800 million dollars in over 800
          companies in technology, consumer products, health care and life sciences, real estate,
          and other segments with high-growth potential.

        USA Angel Investment Network 15
          This group claims to be the largest angel investment community in the world. They
          have already raised $300 million for startups in the U.S. and across the world.
          The reach is very broad, with a network has 30 branches extending to 80 different
          countries. They have over 785,000 registered members with 140,000 investors and
          650,000 entrepreneurs.

        Angel Capital Association (ACA) 16
          The ACA is the angel industry alliance, which now includes a directory to more than
          240 angel groups and 13,000 individual angels across North America. ACA member
          angel groups represent more than 10,000 accredited investors and are funding
          approximately 800 new companies each year, and managing an ongoing portfolio of
          more than 5,000 companies throughout North America.

Angel Funding

Angels invest in far more early stage companies than venture capitalists. And while the average
investment is approximately $330,000 (for individual angels) and $950,000 for groups--angels
often invest as low as $10,000, $20,000 or $50,000--making them a very attractive source of
funding for early stage ventures.

STARTUP FUNDING: NONTRADITIONAL
FUNDING SOURCES

CJ Cornell

Introduction

These are coined "nontraditional" only because their prominence as viable funding sources has
skyrocketed in the past 10 years. They are indeed becoming mainstream, and even the norm,
for startup funding:

        Incubators and Accelerators
        University Programs and Corporate Programs
        Economic Development (government) Programs
        Grants
        Crowdfunding

In any geographic region, accelerators and university programs compete for startups and
entrepreneurs, so it's not surprising when they each seem to imply that they offer all of the
benefits that the others offer. Yes, there are hybrids--but they still primarily fall into one of the
categories above.

Incubators

Incubators don't offer funding as part of their business model. A rare few (like Plug and Play)
have separate funding programs as part of their Incubators. Co-working spaces, incidentally,
are like very short-term versions of incubators. A rare few (like HubSpot) have some funding
programs along with many other programs for startups. So while there are a few hybrids, as a
rule, incubators are not a source of funding for startups. They are only included on the chart
because entrepreneurs sometimes mistake incubators for accelerators--based on how many
incubators decide to market themselves.

Accelerators

What Are Startup Accelerators?1

Susan Cohen2, a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Richmond and a leading
scholar on startup accelerators, provides a comprehensive definition of the concept:

     Broadly speaking, [accelerators] help ventures define and build their initial products,
     identify promising customer segments, and secure resources, including capital and
     employees. More specifically, accelerator programs are programs of limited-
     duration--lasting about three months--that help cohorts of startups with the new
     venture process. They usually provide a small amount of seed capital, plus working
     space. They also offer a plethora of networking opportunities, with both peer
     ventures and mentors, who might be successful entrepreneurs, program graduates,
     venture capitalists, angel investors, or even corporate executives. Finally, most
     programs end with a grand event, a "demo day" where ventures pitch to a large
     audience of qualified investors.

Brad Feld, a co-founder of TechStars, a global accelerator program, likened the accelerator
experience to immersive education, where a period of intense, focused attention provides
company founders an opportunity to learn at a rapid pace.3

Learning by doing is something that all company founders eventually go through, but it's a
highly inefficient process that drags out over time. The point of accelerators, suggest Feld
204 CJ CORNELL

and others, is to accelerate that process--speeding up the learning cycle in a time-constrained
format. In this way, founders compress years' worth of learning into a period of a few months.4

Startup Accelerators in the United States

Y Combinator5 launched the first accelerator program in 2005, followed closely by TechStars6,
founded in 2006. Both programs have evolved over the years--Y Combinator consolidated its
bicoastal programs to a single Silicon Valley location in 2009 (and in fact as of recently7, has
transformed into a later-stage investor), and TechStars has grown to 21 programs8 worldwide
since first launching in Boulder, Colorado. Still, they remain arguably the two premier
accelerator programs9--or at least among the very best10.

Growth in U.S.-based accelerators took off after 2008. They grew from 16 programs that
year to 27 in 2009 and to 49 in 2010, before eventually reaching 170 programs in 2014 and
holding mostly steady. All told, the number of American accelerators increased an average of
50 percent each year between 2008 and 2014.11

During the 2005 to 2015 period, these 172 U.S.-based accelerators invested in more than 5,000
U.S.-based startups with a median investment of $100,000.

These companies raised a total of $19.5 billion in funding during this period--or $3.7 million
per company on average--reflecting both the relatively small investments made in these early
stage companies by accelerators, and the fact that many go on to raise substantial amounts of
capital later on.12

Where Are the Accelerators?

In terms of their geography, accelerator programs are unsurprisingly concentrated in the
well-known technology startup hubs and major cities of San Francisco--Silicon Valley,
Boston--Cambridge, and New York. These three regions account for about 40 percent of all
accelerators in the United States, and almost two-thirds of accelerator-funded deals between
2005 and 2015.13

However, a good amount of activity is occurring outside of these prime tech hubs. In fact, fully
54 metropolitan statistical areas and four nonmetropolitan regions spread across 35 states and
the District of Columbia have accelerator programs today. A number of surprises show up in
terms of cities with more than two accelerators, including Chattanooga, Nashville, Cincinnati,
Milwaukee, and Honolulu.

The Down Side to Accelerators

Accelerator funding can be very attractive for young companies (or founders with a new
idea)--but it can take a lot of work to prepare and apply--and most of them are extremely
competitive. Not only do they take a lot of work (and even more work, if you get
accepted)--the funding from the accelerator is designed only to last as long as the program
(the bootcamp). Be prepared to drop everything for the next three to six months to participate.
When it is over you will be much better positioned to attract traditional angel or venture
funding, but there are no guarantees.

University Programs

For most students, university funding programs are the best (if not, only) option for funding
their startup ideas, projects and companies. Most larger universities (and many smaller ones)
have specific programs for educating and funding student entrepreneurs. They vary
widely--from grants and competitions, to accelerator-like programs just for students. Usually
the funding is relatively low ($5,000-$10,000 or so), plus other resources--just enough for
students to develop their idea, business model, maybe a prototype, and a pitch.

For students, this remains, by far, the most efficient and effective option for funding early stage
ideas.

Corporate Programs

Corporate programs often resemble accelerators--but often in a highly focused domain,
industry, or market. For instance, AT&T Aspire Accelerator specifically focuses on educational
ventures (usually in technology) and they initially provide grant funding, and a virtual
acceleration/development program with mentors. As one example, the Walt Disney Company
accelerator states14, "The Disney Accelerator is looking for technology--powered startups
from around the world with innovative ideas for products and services in the consumer
entertainment and media space."
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 207

Economic Development (Government)

Economic development programs usually focus on attracting growing companies to the region
via tax incentives. But more and more states and cities are instituting programs to educate,
incubate, accelerate, and grow new venture with funding incentives, and funding programs.

Grants

Grants are (from Wikipedia):15

     Grants are nonrepayable funds or products disbursed by one party (grant makers),
     often a government department, corporation, foundation or trust, to a recipient, often
     (but not always) a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business, or an individual.
     In order to receive a grant, some form of "grant writing," often referred to as either a
     proposal or an application is required.

     Most grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of compliance
     and reporting. The grant writing process involves an applicant submitting a proposal
     (or submission) to a potential funder, either on the applicant's own initiative or in
     response to a Request for Proposal from the funder. Other grants can be given to
     individuals, such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a
     small business. Sometimes grant makers require grant seekers to have some form of
     tax-exempt status, or be a registered nonprofit organization or a local government.

More and more, grants are becoming a viable source for startup funding. A few grant-giving
entities are specifically devoted to entrepreneurship and funding startup companies. Usually
their ultimate goal is economic development for a region or for a specific demographic: e.g.,
funding startups in underdeveloped nations in Africa, or funding inner-city small businesses,
or funding startups founded by minorities. Others provide grants because they have a mission
to support an industry or a cause, and believe that supporting innovative startup ventures is
the best way to advance that cause--as is the cause with the Knight Foundation grants for
journalism and technology.

Journalism's Foundations

(Adapted from The Age of Metapreneurship)16

Right now, thousands of independent entrepreneurial projects are helping to rebuild
journalism's future. Some are experiments in new techniques and products, meant to replace
outdated methods. Other projects are addressing brand new issues, like "fake news" which are
byproducts of our times.
208 CJ CORNELL

All around the world, entrepreneurs are working on components of new journalism, in areas
such as:

        New payment models like advertising, syndication, paywalls
        Tools for easier, more accurate and higher quality investigative reporting
        Richer election reporting, polling, and prediction technology
        Richer data journalism tools
        Advanced fact checking
        "Drone journalism," machine learning, artificial intelligence
        Better tools for citizen journalists, and for integrating with professional journalists
        And of course, social media tools for better reporting, distribution, and reader

          engagement

Knight Foundation

The Knight Foundation, as you might expect from its name, traces its lineage to the founders
of the Knight-Ridder news empire. Today, it is the nation's leading funder of journalism and
media innovation. In fact, many of the university programs in journalism innovation and
entrepreneurship owe their existence (and their names) to the Knight Foundation.

The Knight Foundation is not working on some kind of "moonshot" to save journalism.
Instead, they are placing many small bets on vital experiments--any one of which could start a
chain reaction.

Each year, it sponsors The Knight News Challenge17, which awards several million dollars
in small grants to promising projects in different areas of journalism, or that impact
communities. This is not merely a contest with a prize. The News Challenge is a transparent,
collaborative process of vetting great ideas, funding them--and then sharing the results with
the industry. Some winners become companies, while others are one-off projects or products.
All results--including technology and code--are made available for use and reuse by anyone.

Since 2007 Knight Foundation has reviewed more than 10,000 News Challenge applications
and provided more than $37 million in funding to 111 projects. Winners include leading
Internet entrepreneurs, emerging media innovators, and traditional newsrooms. Their
projects have been adopted by large media organizations and are having an impact on the
future of journalism.18

Here's just one example of a recent grant opportunity from Knight Foundation, the Knight
Prototype Fund,19 to address the spread of misinformation and increase trust in journalism.

Knight Foundation is not alone in offering funding for journalism endeavors. Other
foundations that fund journalism projects include Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation,
Scripps Howard Foundation, and the Democracy Fund, among others. Some foundations with
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 209

similar missions are included in this spreadsheet20 of national grants and competitions for
journalism ventures.

Programs like New Voices and New Media Women Entrepreneurs, funded by the McCormick
Foundation, as well as professional programs like NewU offered through UNITY, Journalists
of Color and with funding from the Ford Foundation, offered startup funding and coaching
for media founders from underrepresented and diverse communities. These programs, now
defunct, were the precursors to the growing accelerator programs in corporations, in regional
spaces and pitch competitions that help get visibility to new media innovations and founders.

Foundations support ventures, individuals, and ideas that align with their mission. If you're
going to seek funding from a foundation, it pays to do the deep dive into a foundation's recent
awards and see what has been funded. Is collaboration a feature of all of the grants? Do they
focus on technological innovation? What are upcoming deadlines? Who is the program officer?
Have a conversation with the program officer well in advance of the deadline expressing your
interest and asking of any additional thoughts they have on what is of particular interest to
reviewers who will be rating the grant. You might ask what they learned from their last round
of funding and whether you can get access to it. All this intelligence will help you open the door
to a dialogue with the foundation officers and offer you a better understanding of whether
your idea aligns with the foundation's goals.

STARTUP FUNDING: CROWDFUNDING

CJ Cornell

Crowdfunding, which barely existed a few years ago, spread to every aspect of society--from
funding creative projects, local civic projects to causes and charities, and of course--funding
startup companies. Today, crowdfunding is an essential part of every entrepreneurship
conversation.

Modern crowdfunding has the following haiku-like definition:1
        An individual or organization,
        on behalf of a cause, a project, a product, or a company,
        solicits and collects money,
        usually in relatively small amounts,
        from a large number of people,
        using an online platform,
        where communications and transactions are managed over electronic networks.

Crowdfunding is one of the great movements of the twenty-first century, and one of the most
powerful. Still in its infancy, crowdfunding moved beyond Kickstarter-like passion projects
and became a major new and disruptive force in investment funding. And just in the last few
years, the crowdfunding movement impelled the U.S. Congress, state legislatures in all 50
states and the Security Exchange Commission to overhaul investment laws that existed since
1934.

Broadly defined, crowdfunding is collecting small amounts of money from a large number
of people. With the advent of social networks (abundance of people on the network),
crowdfunding only recently became practical. But the concept has been around for
centuries--except that with crowdfunding, the people willingly contribute money for a
project, product, or cause that they believe in.

 Crowfunding--a Little History

  The concept of crowdfunding is old. What's new is applying technology--social networks--to the
214 CJ CORNELL

  process. This allows interested supporters from around the globe to support any project, anywhere,
  as long as they share passion and see merit in the project's goals.

  In the early 1880s, France gave the United States a gift: the Statue of Liberty. It was shipped to New
  York City where remained packed in crates for over a year. Why? The New York state government
  would not allocate the $200,000 required to build and mount the statue onto a pedestal (today this
  would be over $2.5 million). Newspaper mogul Joseph Pulitzer ran a fundraising campaign through
  his "New York World" tabloid--offering to publish the name of everyone who donated, to the front
  page. Donors also would get little rewards: $1 got you a 6-inch replica statue and $5 got you a 12-inch
  statue. The campaign went viral. Within six months of the fundraising appeal, the pedestal was fully
  funded, with the majority of donations being under a dollar.

  But this was not the first crowdfunding campaign. For centuries, book authors have appealed to the
  crowd for funding. Kickstarter (the largest crowdfunding site) proudly recounts one of the earliest
  examples:2

       In 1713, Alexander Pope (the poet) set out to translate 15,693 lines of ancient Greek poetry
       into English. It took five long years to get the six volumes right, but the result was worth the
       wait: a translation of Homer's Iliad that endures to this day. How did Pope go about getting
       this project off the ground? Turns out he kind of Kickstarted it.

       In exchange for a shout-out in the acknowledgments an early edition of the book, and the
       delight of helping to bring a new creative work into the world, 750 subscribers pledged two
       gold guineas to support Pope's effort before he put pen to paper. They were listed in an early
       edition of the book.

A Boon for Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs discovered crowdfunding as an efficient and exciting method of funding
innovative product ideas that were too early for investors. Instead, they reached out to like-
minded supporters, early adopters, and technology fans, who were enthusiastic about backing
early stage ideas. The crowd not only contributes money to develop the product--but the
crowd offers something just as valuable: early market validation for the product, and a chance
for the entrepreneur to build reputation and credibility.

Backers embraced rewards-based sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo because they offered
a model that was both engaging and lower risk. Potential contributors discussed the merits
of the project or product with each other and with the founders; they were allowed to pre-
commit to donations at specific, nominal levels--typically $5, $25, $100, $250--with each level
of contribution receiving different rewards. This pre-commitment was important. It amounts
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 215

to a binding pledge. The entrepreneur sets a funding goal and a time limit. If the pledges meet
the funding goal within the time limit, everyone gets charged. Otherwise, no money changes
hands. For early backers, this was a critical feature getting them to embrace crowdfunding.

Later, as backers get more comfortable with crowdfunding, other methods of contributing
proliferated.

Hundreds of crowdfunding platforms emerged since the early success of Indiegogo (2008)
and Kickstarter (2009). It is not necessary to use a third-party platform. Individuals or
organizations can raise funds using their own websites, but they still need to incorporate tools
for sophisticated payment processing, managing contributors--and attracting a crowd.

Hybrids and new categories are emerging: royalty-based crowdfunding--allowing backers
to receive royalties from the product they funded, and litigation crowdfunding--allowing
backers to fund a lawsuit in return for a stake in any resulting monetary judgments.

Today, the latest numbers show worldwide crowdfunding raised approximately $35 Billion in
2015 with the vast majority, approximately $25 Billion, being debt. Crowdfunding followed by
over $5 Billion for donation/reward-based crowdfunding.5

But those figures are for all kinds of crowdfunding campaigns--including those that are
for charity, community, and personal projects. To get a sense, realistically, of the kind of
projects that are funded through the most popular crowdfunding platforms, let's take a look at
Kickstarter--who publishes their data, real-time, for all to see:

Kickstarter Stats

Kickstarter provides raw stats about projects funded on its platform, representing the site's
all-time figures since it launched in 2009, and updates this data every day. View the data at
https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats6. Below is a summary of the data as of June 12, 2017:

Successfully Funded Projects

According to Kickstarter, the majority of successfully funded projects raise less than $10,000,
but a growing number have reached six, seven, and even eight figures. Currently funding
projects that have reached their goals are not included in this chart--only projects whose
funding is complete.

In other words--while there are indeed several multimillion-dollar crowdfunding success
stories, most campaigns--particularly first-time crowdfunding campaigns--bring in a far
more modest figure. For entrepreneurs seeking crowdfunding, well, expectations should be
aligned with reality.

              raising less than $10,000.
                                                        For entrepreneurs, it's important to note:

1. Crowdfunding is usually most effective for startup companies who are able to
deliver a tangible product. Backers donate money in return for "rewards" are really
pre-orders for a physical product.
2. Service businesses and consulting businesses have little chance of being funded on
typical crowdfunding sites.

Regardless of the risks and limitations, crowdfunding remains a powerful new way to fund
new companies and new projects. But it's not free money or easy money. Attracting money
from the crowd takes significant preparation and significant work. However, unlike other
forms of funding, the steps are largely under your control.

Basics of a Crowdfunding Campaign

        Kickstarter, currently the most popular crowdfunding platform, enables "project
          creators" to post project or product descriptions and videos in order to solicit funding
          (in the form of "pledge" contributions).

        Project creators set a fundraising goal and a deadline, usually 30-90 days (with the
          average being 45-60 days).

        Using social media and other promotional techniques, the project owners attempt to
          engage advocates and supporters who pledge relatively small amounts of money.

        The project creators offer token "rewards" as incentives for contributors to donate to
          the project. If the total amount of the pledges meets or exceeds the goal, before the
          deadline, then the "pledges" are automatically collected from the donors.

        Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns are "all or nothing": If the target funding goal is
          not met by the deadline, then no money changes hands.

        Indiegogo is a platform that allows for an all-or-nothing campaign, or a "flexible
          funding" campaign: where the money pledged is awarded to the campaign at the end
          of the time limit, regardless if the goal was met.

Notable Crowdfunding Campaign Techniques and Tips

Indiegogo CEO Slava Rubin offers a few critical tips and tricks for those looking to crowdfund
successfully.7
                                                                                                                                               STARTUP FUNDING 219

        Rubin notes how important pitch videos are to campaigns: "Campaigns that feature
          videos--about the startup and the products--typically raised 114 percent more money
          on Indiegogo compared to those that don't."

        Discussing how "word of mouth" is important to campaigns, Slava shared: "Get your
          inner circle of friends, family and customers to fund you and to spread the news
          about the campaign. This will get the momentum going."

        Noting that organizers should stay in contact with backers, the CEO and co-founder
          of the platform stated:

        "Campaigns that provide updates every five days raised twice as much as those that
          update every ten days or more."

Yancey Strickler, CEO of Kickstarter, points out that Kickstarter campaigns that reach the 20
percent mark have an 82 percent success rate. If you reach 30 percent, you have a 98 percent
chance of reaching your goal.8

     "Think about that: with less than a third of your goal funded, you have a 98 percent
     chance of success. These inherently lopsided results require a lopsided approach: you
     should be putting the vast majority of your efforts on the early or even very--early
     portion of your campaign."9

The implication here is that you shouldn't promote a campaign with 10 percent or 12 percent
funding to strangers. This also includes Facebook fans, blog readers, or your existing user base.
This sounds counterintuitive, but even a die-hard fan can be off-put by poor crowdfunding
performance. It's one thing to mention your new campaign, with one or two small posts, but
don't waste these high-quality leads early on. Save them for when they'll help the most: maybe
before 50 percent, but definitely after you've reached a respectable 20-25 percent."10

        Your first step is to figure out your target audience at least a month before your
          campaign is scheduled to go live.

        Campaign owners often try to target everyone around them (friends, family, co-
          workers, etc.) because they don't invest enough time to identify their target audience
          which gives them vastly expanded reach.

        This lack of focus is certainly not the most efficient way to market a crowdfunding
          campaign. In order to determine the target audience for your campaign stop and
          think about WHO can benefit from your product or your service.11

Then zero in on key demographics of this audience by considering the age range, gender,
income, and education level (as applicable) of the pool of potential crowdfunders who could or
would back your project."

Lessons for Entrepreneurs from Crowdfunding

Kauffman Dissertation Fellow Ethan Mollick at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
220 CJ CORNELL

School examined almost 47,000 projects on Kickstarter that raised a combined revenue of
$198 million.12 Mollick concluded that several factors influence whether a project will
succeed or not:

        The greater the size of the founder's social network, the greater the chance for success
          (particularly Facebook in this case; this is also known as the "be popular" strategy).

        The underlying quality of the projects--those with high-quality, polished pitches are
          more likely to be funded (e.g., use a video; as Kickstarter's website states, "Projects
          with videos succeed at a much higher rate than those without").

        A strong geographic component tie-in seems to increase success (pitching country
          music in Nashville, film in Los Angeles, etc.).

        A shorter Kickstarter duration is better (35 percent chance of success for 30-day
          pitches, 29 percent for 60-day pitches). Mollick noted that a longer duration implies a
          lack of confidence in the project's success.

        Being highlighted on the Kickstarter website is hugely beneficial (89 percent chance
          of success vs. 30 percent for unfeatured projects).

        A large number of creative individuals in the city where the project is based is
          associated with greater success (target these kinds of people).

Research Study from Indiegogo: Crowdfunding Campaign Stats

Indiegogo took a look at the numbers and statistics behind 100,000 Indiegogo campaigns to
see what's working and what's not. They offered several tips for campaigns.13

        They suggest 30-day campaigns. Of successful campaigns they analyzed, roughly a
          third lasted between 30 and 39 days.

        Keep updating your campaign page throughout your campaign with progress updates,
          newly added perks and other successes. Contributors get notified by email when you
          update the campaign, so this is an important way to keep your funders engaged.
          Indiegogo suggests updating your campaign at least four times.

        Indiegogo found that of the 100,000 campaigns they looked at (including those that
          didn't meet their goals), 42 percent of funds were raised in the first and last three
          days. Be ready to start and finish strong.

        Their stats showed that successful campaigns added an average of 12 new perks to
          their campaigns after they launched.

        Don't go solo--campaigns with a team behind them and therefore many networks to
          leverage were more successful.

        Stats showed that campaigns with video raised four times the funds as those without.
          So be sure to include this crucial marketing element.

        Don't limit your efforts to a U.S. audience. The United States, Canada, United
          Kingdom, Australia and Germany were the top five contributing countries to the
          campaigns analyzed.

Equity Crowdfunding

Until very recently--under antiquated U.S. securities laws--it was illegal to offer equity (stock)
to anyone in the crowd. But then the crowd became a movement, and made history.

Now, crowdfunding is also poised to become a growing source of earliest stage equity
financing following passage of the JOBS Act in April 2012. The JOBS Act enabled investors to
use the Web and social media to make investments in entrepreneurs and small and medium
companies.

On April 5, 2012 President Barack Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
(JOBS Act)--a bipartisan bill that was specifically designed to open the floodgates of funding
for emerging growth companies. After nearly four years of regulatory wrangling, the Securities
and Exchange Commission released the final rules, taking effect on May 16, 2016.

Equity crowdfunding is the category with all eyes watching. Not only does the new law allow
for just about anyone to invest in, not just donate to an emerging startup company--it allows
startups to publicly solicit from the crowd. Until May 2016, all this was illegal. Until then,
startups had to make the rounds with VCs and Angels, educate them about their industry,
pitch, get "warm" introductions. Up until then, an engineer, for instance, who might have
recognized the unique potential of a nascent Kickstarter product, could not invest because she
wasn't an "accredited" investor. The VCs and Angels were allowed to become millionaires, but
experts who could spot the early potential were not.

The World Bank forecasts a global crowdfunding market of $96 billion by 202514--far more
than venture capital and angel funding combined.

 Spot.us--Honorable Mention

  Before Kickstarter or Indiegogo existed, there was Spot.us.

  Founded in 2008 by a young--but experienced--journalist named David Cohn15, Spot.us was an online
  product and a company. It no longer exists, yet Spot.us was one of the most important experiments
  to emerge from the Knight News Challenge.
222 CJ CORNELL

  Spot.us pioneered community funded reporting: crowdfunding for journalism. Today, this is an easy
  concept to digest--but in 2008 a lot of people had a hard time understanding the concept. It's the
  innovator's curse.

  Stories began as tips from the public giving an issue they would like to see covered, or pitches from a
  journalist to create a story, including the amount of money needed. Visitors to the website could then
  donate to fund the pitch.16

  If, for instance, a local citizen wanted to see an investigative story on the mayor's past business
  ties with a contractor, they would post the idea to Spot.us. A journalist browsing the site might be
  intrigued, and would agree to research and write the story, for an estimated $5,000. People in the
  community would pledge or donate $20 or $50 each. When the total was met, the journalist would
  write the story. News organizations could obtain exclusive rights by contributing greater than 50
  percent of the funding.

  Without this kind of mechanism, important stories and investigative reports might never have seen
  the light of day. Many services today for freelance writers and creatives--particularly crowdfunding
  sites--owe their existence to the trailblazing efforts of Spot.us.

FROM THE FIELD: FRIENDS, FAMILY AND
FOOLS FUNDING

Francine Hardaway

 From the Field

  Friends, family, and fools. That's who usually funds very early startups. After all, who in their right
  mind would invest money in an unproven product with an unsubstantiated market, often with a single
  inexperienced person at the helm? Think about it: Would YOU give hard-earned money to a stranger?

  I am often contacted by startups who know I've been an angel investor and think if they email me a
  pitch deck and ask me if I want a follow-up meeting that I will enthusiastically reply in the affirmative.

  I never do. And here's the reason. I only invest in people I know. Why? Because that slightly minimizes
  the risk. Only slightly, however. When I make an investment in a startup, I kiss the money good-bye.
  I might as well have lost it in Las Vegas gambling, for the number of times I get a return on my
  investment, and over time I have come to know this. Every person (relative, friend, or just random risk-
  taker) who invests in your venture should be aware of this.

  There are three risks every early-stage investor must know, and every entrepreneur should ignore: the
  product risk, the market risk, and the people risk. If entrepreneurs focused on the risks, they'd never
  start companies. But if investors didn't focus on risk, they'd be broke and on the street.

  The product risk consists of the unknowns surrounding whether the proposed product can be created
  or built at all. Think virtual reality, which has been announced for two decades without becoming a
  product accessible for the average user. To make virtual reality accessible would mean making the
  glasses look like real glasses, and not like something only a dork would wear. And making the focus
  good enough so ordinary people don't get sick after a half hour. And bringing the price down to an
  affordable number. For most of us, $2,500 for a fast computer and another $1,500 for glasses is not
  affordable for an entertainment device.

  Then there's the market risk. Let's go back to the highly-touted virtual reality. Suppose we could afford
                                                                                                                                            STARTUP FUNDING 227

$4,000 for the setup. What would we actually DO with it? With every product, there must be a product
market fit. We must need the product for something to make us overcome our desire to save our
pennies. Food is one of those products.

And last there's the people risk:

       Will this founder be able to make a go of this business?
       Will she stick with it when the chips are down?
       Will this product scale enough to make a return on investment?
       Will a competitor come out of the woodwork before I, the investor, make the 10x return on

         investment that I want to make?
       Will the founders continue to get along well enough to be able to work together? Will the

         product become a business and the business become a company?
       Will the founder create a corporate culture that develops and nurtures new employees?

I always invest in someone whose capabilities for business I think I know well. My first investment, in
one of my former students, was because I knew how tenacious this guy was as a student, and also
how ethical he was as a human being. That investment paid off about 50 to 1. That's extremely rare.
But the next time he started a company, I invested in him again. That's why experienced investors
seem to invest in experienced entrepreneurs.

These three risks -- product, market, and people-together constitute the investment risk. Since you
can't minimize the product and market risk involved in an as yet untried product, the only one that can
be minimized is the people risk.

And that's why investing in strangers almost never happens, and as a startup, you should only look to
people who know you and would bet on you no matter what you did. That's where your family comes
in. Moms want their children to be successful, so they'll gamble where others will not. Sometimes
friends are like that, too. The third group are fools. They don't realize all the risks, and the problem
with taking their money is that they're likely to contact you every day to see if their investments are
getting more valuable.

That is unless they are a special kind of "fool," an early customer. A customer is someone with a pain
so intense that she's willing to take any kind of risk to have it relieved, even the risks described above.
Early stage companies just aren't appropriate for other kinds of investments beyond friends, family,
and fools. Or beta customers.

Truthfully, customers are the best people to fund your startup. They've already got the need, so you
don't have to prove the market to them. And their need is so intense that they're willing to take
228 FRANCINE HARDAWAY

  a chance on an unproven technology. You can sell them an early version of the product and they
  will appreciate it so much that they'll pay for it in advance, which generates the funds for product
  development. Kickstarter works this way. People who contribute to Kickstarter campaigns aren't
  looking for a 10x return on their investment. Instead, they want the product. That's why crowdfunding
  took off--because people truly interested in products like home robots and fitness watches were
  willing to take the gamble that an entrepreneur they didn't know could deliver those products.

  When I teach my classes, I make my students all start a business during the semester. And I ask them
  to find an investor--even if it's a parent and a miniscule investment, just so they learn how to pitch
  and what a great responsibility it is to take another person's money. Or I ask them to find a customer:
  someone who will pay for the product. They panic. But they produce. Which ultimately is what real
  entrepreneurs must do.

FROM THE FIELD: THE JOURNEY FROM
LISTENING TO LEADER

Chris Dell

 From the Field

  Contest funding helped Chris Dell to get his venture, Go Baller, off the ground, but the road to
  sustainability involved some pivots.

  Pivot #1 - From Listening to Questioning (2006-2010) "The College Years"

  During my undergraduate years I had seemingly every person in the world telling my classmates and I
  that we had picked the wrong career path. It was a four-year-running journalism joke that forced about
  half of my class to change majors between 2006 and 2010. My college professors would literally go
  on hours-long rants trying to convince us to leave the journalism field for something else, whether it
  be public relations, marketing, economics, or something more "financially friendly." I took it personally,
  more as a challenge to succeed against all odds. In a profession when many others were getting fired
  or quitting altogether, I added it as a chip to my shoulder and started asking questions back. Why
  were people always asking me "Do you think newspapers will die?" It wasn't the right question to ask,
  yet so many remained stuck on it, as though there were no other options to consider. The answer was
  easy. Just like I had realized about my resume and bachelor's degree: A piece of paper means nothing
  without results clipped and attached. Resumes won't die with paper. They move online to LinkedIn.
  Storytelling and news won't die with paper, either. They will move to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat
  and the next craze. It's crazy to think storytelling could die or news could die. This motivated me to
  wonder why these old ways of thinking even existed in the first place, and how much pushback was
  needed in the media industry against this legacy media mindset.

  Pivot #2 - From Questioner to Practitioner (2012-2014) "Grad School"

  In 2012 I left my family and lifelong home in Florida and moved to New York City to pursue my M.A.
  at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. It was a decision that not many around me endorsed.
230 CHRIS DELL

  Less than a year earlier I told my favorite undergrad professor of my intentions to pursue journalism in
  grad school, and he swiftly "sat me down" for a talk. So much for validation from others, whether that
  meant my professors, parents, or even best friends back home! I had to trust my gut. I wasn't simply
  going to NYC to get another degree - this time there was a purpose and a strategy, a "light at the end
  of the tunnel" so to speak. This light was the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism, which
  for me meant three semesters of grad school before I could even be eligible for the program.

  Pivot #3 - From Practitioner to Founder (2014-2015) "Accelerators & Incubators"

  It is now spring of 2014, and at the Tow-Knight Center each week we visit budding tech startup offices
  and new media company headquarters all throughout NYC, often sitting down with their CEOs and
  top C-level leaders (executives like CEOs, COOs, CTOs, etc.). A month later I attended a Google Startup
  Weekend NYC pitch competition, and my "idea" received the minimum amount of votes (six) out of
  all the pitches needed to move to the next round of the "team-building phase." Then, the minimum
  of two people (out of hundreds) actually decided to join my team and work with me for the weekend
  on "Baller," a new sports app that aggregated viral sports content in one place from every social
  network. After Google Startup Weekend, I applied for and was accepted into "3-Day Startup," an invite-
  only startup weekend unlike Google's where anyone could attend. I took this as my next challenge
  to better improve my pitch and vision for "Baller" as a future tech CEO. My new pitch earned more
  team member requests (seven) than any other pitch that Friday night at 3-Day Startup, just a month
  after the Google event, and we hustled all weekend to put together a final pitch, survey potential
  users, and receive mentoring from top marketers and tech founders in the area. "Always be pitching"
  is the motto I adopted from the founder of the program and a future advisor. A few weeks before
  3-Day Startup I had also applied and pitched successfully to General Assembly's "Client UX Projects"
  program where they choose startups to partner with their students and UX designers to build a
  prototype and new product design. I took this mobile app mockup into our 3-Day Startup weekend/
  pitch and also leveraged it to apply to Bizdom, a seed fund accelerator specializing in sports and
  entertainment technology startups owned by none other than NBA owner Dan Gilbert of the Cleveland
  Cavaliers. The only reason I even knew about Bizdom was from my friend Brendez, whom I had met
  at 3-Day Startup when she was the first to join my team and then actually pitch with me on that
  Sunday. Brendez told me about her organizing an entrepreneurship event in Columbus where there
  was also a "Shark Tank" open casting call pitch happening that same weekend. Not being able to
  afford a roundtrip plane ticket and hotel room for the weekend (I was still living off student loans
  at the time during the Tow-Knight program!) I bought a roundtrip bus ticket instead, arriving there
  at 5 a.m. and leaving at 5 p.m. the same day, using my friend's hotel room to quickly shower and
  change/practice between pitches. Little did I know my pitch would bomb in the sixty seconds I got in
  front of a table trying to convince one of the Shark Tank "TV show producers" of my app's potential.
  Little did I also know that following my bombed pitch, my new friend and colleague Brendez would
                                                                                                                                            STARTUP FUNDING 231

introduce me to an investor who would sit down one-on-one with me to hear my pitch. Then after
passing on my idea (it was too early stage for him) he recommended that I apply to Bizdom and said
he'd personally recommend me to their team. Two months and a rugged application process later,
and I had been invited as a finalist to Cleveland to pitch in front of the Bizdom accelerator/investor
team at the Quicken Loans Arena, home of NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers in hopes of earning $25K for
my startup "Go Baller," which had undergone a name change and product pivot in becoming "a social
discovery app for sports fans." Go Baller become one of ten startups to join Bizdom's 2014-15 cohort,
and a month later I was loading a Penske truck moving my entire life from Brooklyn, New York, to
Cleveland, Ohio.

Pivot #4 - From Founder to CEO (2015-2016) "Episode 2: Reality Strikes Back"

Within a few short months my Go Baller pitch and presentation deck was completely ripped to shreds
by the program's investment team. My startup was a "ripoff of X company they had already invested
in," or "It's just a version of X that doesn't make money." The feedback was brutal, and I took it more
personally than I should have. Pitch after pitch I was denied the chance to appear at Demo Day, the
end event of the program where we present to big-time VCs and investors in the area for follow on
funds, etc. It was the whole point of doing an accelerator program in a sense, and I felt like a failure
because I was only one of two founders in the cohort who weren't allowed to pitch there. What I didn't
appreciate then was the direction in which those failed pitches would take Go Baller. The day after
Bizdom's demo day I won a $20K grant competition for new media startups from the NewU program
funded by UNITY: Journalists for Diversity and the Ford Foundation. The same pitch trounced by
Bizdom advisors was the same pitch that won us another $20K in funding. The rollercoaster took a
turn for the better, right? With no revenue in sight as a free sports app and with limited cash on hand,
we had to rethink our product and recreate our value point from a B2C to B2B platform, going from
a standalone sports app to an enterprise social media software platform. On the app we aggregated
viral sports social media content all in one place. On the platform we did the same exact thing, but
for other businesses on their apps and websites. "Let's do for them what we only wanted to originally
do on our own app, giving others value, to put all of their social media/viral content in one place," we
decided.

Pivot #5 - From CEO to Leader (2016-Present) "Go Baller Media"

Soon after earning the $20K grant money for Go Baller's pivoted pitch and new focus, the money
had dried up. While we had secured commitments and non-verbal letters of intent from top players
and teams in the sports industry, we did not have a finished product to integrate and could only beta
test with them. Then reality actually sunk in. Money was gone. Rent was due. Then two months of
rent were due. Those "888" collection calls started piling up and flooding the phone. I had to suspend
all Go Baller operations, move to back to Florida, and live on couches while looking for a job to pay
232 CHRIS DELL

  my damn phone bill. The struggle was real, both financially and psychologically. Had I failed in my
  quest to become the sports media version of Mark Zuckerberg? Unfortunately I had allowed myself
  to sink into negativity. A few weeks later I received a job as a social media marketing manager and
  a month later was promoted to the company's digital director. A month after that I introduced two
  new revenue streams into this ad agency's business model with mobile website development and
  A.I./logic-based digital forms to turn offline form processes into automated digital smartforms. The
  mental low I had hit only a few months prior to this taught me to be more self-aware than ever
  before. It taught me that it's just as important not to get caught up in the hype of successes than it
  is with the hype of failures. In reality, they are both learning lessons and part of the overall journey of
  entrepreneurship. At Go Baller, we are now a mobile app-turned-media agency that helps brands on
  the go with mobile websites, mobile e-commerce and full-service digital strategies. We currently have
  four monthly agency clients ($2,000+ monthly recurring revenue in total) compared to our past life of
  being a pre-revenue sports app or a social media software company with a beta-phase platform and
  no cash on hand. "Pivoting" is not just about changing your revenue model or mission statement, it
  is most often about challenging your own ego, assumptions and ideas against the feedback of the
  world. It's about thinking for a snap second, then doing and doing and iterating and iterating for the
  long haul. Patience and action must be at the utmost focus, in addition to the self-awareness needed
  to admit your own mistakes and change. If you can create value for someone and maintain that value,
  then you can truly build something people will not only want to use but want to pay you for, for a very
  long time. Patience and action. Action and patience. They might appear to be opposites but are the
  true two skills you need to be able to constantly pick yourself up from failure and move on to the next
  day, to the next pivot. This what being an entrepreneur is all about.

FROM THE FIELD: YOUR KICKSTARTER
CAMPAIGN IS A STORY

Interview with Daniel Zayas by Elizabeth Mays

 From the Field

  Daniel Zayas is a Verified Kickstarter Expert1. He has run numerous crowdfunding campaigns as the
  marketing director for board game publisher Eagle-Gryphon Games, has a prominent weekly blog2
  about successful Kickstarter campaigns and consults regularly to optimize campaigns. Three years
  ago, Zayas was studying at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication,
  where he took two classes on journalism entrepreneurship, much like the ones you may be in now.

  While the road post-graduation led to roles in his field of passion, tabletop board games, Zayas says
  the media entrepreneurship courses prepared him well for what he's doing today.

  He says this was not only because they imparted a foundation in how crowdfunding works for digital
  ventures, but because one of the keys to crowdfunding is storytelling-a central tenet of journalism
  education. Helping your audience understand the value proposition quickly is crucial to converting
  them into funders, Zayas says. "The storytelling aspect of it-the inverted pyramid-that specifically,
  as a broad concept of `hook them early,' is 100 percent applicable to what I do today."

  Zayas says board games make the most money on Kickstarter as a group, which may be because
  crowdfunding in this context is one form of pre-ordering. But Zayas says some core keys to success
  are the same for any Kickstarter project: namely, a clear and compelling story of how your product
  will benefit the funder.

  He offers these tips for media outlets seeking crowdfunding on Kickstarter:

  "The number one rule in crowdfunding is that you need a crowd," Zayas says. "You already need
  someone to care about you or your project." This might be friends and family, your audience from a
  previously successful campaign, or a celebrity voice in the industry who might give you testimonials
  and a shout-out. If you don't have a network already that can bring about 70 percent of the funding
234 INTERVIEW WITH DANIEL ZAYAS BY ELIZABETH MAYS

  for your campaign, Zayas says, you'll need to reach out to some tastemakers who can lend their
  following.

  To fully fund your campaign, Zayas says, you'll need to also attract the "scrollers" who are searching
  for projects on Kickstarter-and capture them very quickly with storytelling hooks. "The idea is that
  people know immediately what they are getting and why it's important," he says. "Not everyone is your
  customer but if you can capture your customers through an ease of understanding, then you will be
  in better shape."

  With media projects, Zayas says there are two models that work the best:

           1. Fund your season of content; or
           2. Fund a specific project.

  Zayas advises against trying to fund your whole business or company as it's too nebulous for the
  funder to care about. "People need to know when they're giving you money what they are getting as
  concretely as possible," Zayas says. "When you say I am funding my business, that is too many steps
  removed from `how am I benefiting?'" Businesses don't lend themselves to stories well enough, he
  says, whereas with a project, you can show how your coverage is going to benefit the potential funder
  directly. The exception might be a media company whose whole operation could be considered a
  project-for instance, coverage of a niche topic or a certain geographical location.

  Zayas notes there are usually some costs to do a successful project. It's important to have great
  visuals, so you may need graphics designed. In addition, a minor investment (even $100) in highly
  targeted paid social media marketing campaigns can pay off exponentially if you are effective in
  targeting it specifically to the types of people who will want your product. Social media marketing,
  using A/B testing, retargeting and optimization, is a low-cost way to do this. If this isn't your specialty,
  you may want to hire someone, but make sure they're an expert in your niche.

  Finally, while your mother may give to your campaign no matter what, remember that you should be
  targeting an audience that will benefit from your project in some way. There's some altruism in being
  a crowdfunder, Zayas says, in that you are helping someone make something that didn't exist before,
  but there's also always self-interest. "You're also needing to see some verifiable proof that it's going to
  exist and that I'm going to 100 percent benefit from this," he says. You have to convince contributors
  that you're "going to do good work that will benefit (their) life.'"

PITCHING IDEAS

Mark Poepsel

To pitch a journalism or media product is to make the case for your idea to an individual or
group in exchange for financial or some other kind of support. Pitching is a dynamic process that
requires you to be of two minds. On the one hand, you need to believe in the value of your idea
and in your team's ability to make it viable. On the other hand, you must also demonstrate a
capacity for change and perseverance as your idea evolves over time in response to feedback
from potential customers and investors. Your pitch must demonstrate that you have a great
product idea, that you have done market and competition research, and that you are willing
and able to scrap key features, even ones you love, if feedback from customers or investors
makes it necessary. Developing a pitch is more than coming up with a great idea for a media
product and shopping it around to investors. It involves ideation, key feature identification and
testing, market research, design and branding work, redesign, and pitch performance practice.
At the heart of the pitch is your promise to develop a successful product, even though you may
not yet know all of the variables that will influence its success.

Let's freeze the conversation for a second for students who are not necessarily interested
in being entrepreneurs. "Why should we study ideation, research, project management, and
pitching?" You should study this because every job involves pitching. Journalists make story
pitches every day and to a growing extent they are expected to provide evidence of engagement
on previous similar stories to justify their pitch. For example, they may need to pull data from
CrowdTangle or Chartbeat to show that stories about a particular bridge under construction
garner a lot of attention and engagement. Stories may not seem sexy at first, but engagement
numbers can help a journalist close the deal.

If nothing else, you will need to pitch yourself and your skills on the job market. If you
treat your career search as a product to be managed, you will ideate potential outcomes in
terms of workplace, location, and job description. You will go into job interviews with a
well-researched plan, good-looking supplementary materials including your resume website,
and you will know what the competition looks like. You need to understand what your "key
features" are as a potential employee. You can refine those and present them well and find a
good market fit for the product, i.e. your professional labor.

Studying how to ideate and to pitch is also fun. It's not a lecture series or a knowledge dump.
It's a guided tour through a process of self discovery, group relationship building, and global
240 MARK POEPSEL

market awareness. Even if you never take your own new endeavor to market, learning how to
ideate and to pitch could and should change your life.

Pitching can happen formally or informally. An elevator pitch, a short two- or three-sentence
description of your idea, is a pitch format you might use to describe your project to a stranger
in casual conversation or to a potential team member at a meetup. It is similar to the log line
in a film project. This chapter is designed for students who are developing formal pitches for
ideas seeking seed funding. For best results, you should already be acquainted with the lean
startup model of product development prior to creating your pitch. Developed by Eric Ries,1
The Lean Startup stresses the value of customer development as its central thesis. In essence,
the book states that the business of lean startups is to learn. You learn by practicing a sort of
customer service science. Lean startup teams hypothesize about what product changes might
work, and they test those changes on real consumers, a.k.a. users, so that the product is always
improving, always moving closer to perfect product market fit. It's an ideal that's not often
attained, but that's the goal, and you need to be able to explain that you understand this concept
and can put it into practice.

You may have begun (for real or in mock exercises) by self-funding the development of
a prototype, a.k.a. bootstrapping, and you should have continued through the "friends and
family" stage of financing where you have sought funding via personal networks, i.e. your
parents, friends, perhaps a rich uncle.

This chapter assumes you have worked through the ideation phase of product development
(see chapter on Ideation) and that you'll continue to make improvements to your product
even as you work on your pitch. Your team demonstrates leadership and change management
skills by showing how your product has already evolved in response to customer development
efforts. Customer development includes doing essential market research, testing features,
and gathering and analyzing design feedback. The best pitches impart these nuts-and-bolts
elements by demonstrating that your team has learned from this feedback and also convey
the team's passion, ingenuity, and perseverance. When your team has done as much product
development and customer development as you can afford, or as time allows during a class
session, you build toward a "big ask," which may be a meeting with investors, a presentation
to a startup competition committee, or a pitch contest, etc. This chapter focuses on preparing
you for that big presentation, but it also briefly covers preparing an elevator pitch and writing
a prospectus paper.

To narrow the scope of the discussion, this chapter identifies six presentation elements that
serve as a starting point for pitch preparation. They are:

        Element 1: Brand identity image and tagline
        Element 2: Problem-solution narrative
        Element 3: Key features and your value proposition
        Element 4: Product-market fit description
                                                                                                                  PITCHING IDEAS 241

 Element 5: Competitive analysis
 Element 6: Financial projections

These are the must-haves for a pitch about ten to fifteen minutes long. Each may be
represented by one or more slides if you are crafting a slide deck or by one or more sections if
you are writing a prospectus. Depending on your product, presentation type, preferences, and
priorities, you should feel free to customize around this framework.

Let's take a look at this example2 of a successful pitch deck deconstructed as it relates to these six elements.

Slide 1: Airbnb started out as "AirBed&Breakfast." Brand identity is established with a sans-serif typeface, use of color, and a clear
tagline: "Book rooms with locals, rather than hotels."Slide 2: The problem statement is straightforward: Travelers need an affordable
alternative to hotels.Slide 3: The solution statement focuses on the nature of the product, i.e. that it's a web platform, and on key
features and how they create value, both financial and cultural capital. Note that key features and the value proposition are already
addressed through three simple slides.
242 MARK POEPSEL

  Slide 4: To establish product-market fit, you first have to have a market. The Airbnb pitch deck notes that at the
  time there were 630,000 users on couchsurfing.com and that there were 17,000 temporary housing listings on
  Craigslist in San Francisco and New York combined in one week. Thus, there existed a large potential traveler pool
  and a large pool of people with rooms for lease, but these groups were in need of a unified platform.
  Slide 5: The fifth slide details the size of the market and Airbnb's share, showing potential for growth.
  Slide 6: Completing the case for product-market fit, this slide shows the attractive user interface and provides a
  mini-narrative for how the product works.
  Slide 7: This slide shows four years' of revenue totals as simple math: 10 million + trips x $20 average fee = about
  $200 million in revenues. This is evidence of product-market fit and whets the investor's appetite for potential
  future earnings.
  Slide 8: This slide shows how Airbnb has already beaten its competition to own the market for certain events and
  to create partnerships.
  Slide 9: Here, investors get the full picture of the competition.
  Slide 10: The financial expectations are pretty well established by this point and were explained verbally. What this
  shows are the barriers to competition expected to help preserve Airbnb's position and future earnings and growth
  expectations.

This chapter focuses first on developing the six presentation elements. When the time comes
to build slide decks, the order, breakdown, and prioritization of elements is up to you. You
are not expected to finish your product before developing your pitch. Rather, it is strongly
suggested that you develop your pitch and your product in parallel.

PRESENTATION ELEMENT #1: Brand Identity Image and Tagline

Your presentation slide deck should begin with a memorable brand image. It can be a logo
representing your product in a stylized way, or it could be a screen grab of your product if you
are particularly happy with the design. It's often a good idea to create a tagline as well. It helps
drive the message home for investors who want to know right away if they see a marketable
idea. From a persuasive standpoint, all you are trying to establish with your first slide is that
this is a great product that many people need that's easy to understand and remember.

Your brand introduction should be kept to one slide and should set the aesthetic tone for the
rest of the presentation. Establish a color palette and stick with it. If you're going to use design
elements such as borders, background colors, or shapes, use them in your introductory slide.
Go with clean, simple design elements. If something doesn't add to your presentation, leave it
out and keep it out in subsequent slides.

As you present the brand image and tagline visually, your talking points should include a brief
description of the team. Don't feel the need to introduce every member right away. The project
manager should introduce the concept and herself or himself, and as the presentation moves
on other members of the team can introduce themselves when it's their turn to speak. There's
no correct way to divide up presentation responsibilities. Different courses and competitions
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 243

will set requirements for the minimum and maximum number of speakers or group members
you should have. Just be sure to keep the introduction slide focused and brief. Whenever
it is your turn to speak, identify yourself. Mention your role and very briefly discuss your
background as it pertains to your role on this project. Holding off on team introductions will
keep your pitch moving.

You should start working on branding at the same time you begin product ideation.
Establishing your brand identity is like selecting your best photo and description for a dating
app. Put only your best face forward. Give investors a single, interesting, lasting image that
they can connect to the rest of your pitch.

PRESENTATION ELEMENT #2: Problem-Solution Narrative

Every product solves a problem. Many entrepreneurial media products solve problems that
users didn't know they had. It's your job to help the investor identify a media-related problem
that many people share and then clearly explain in a story or short anecdote how your product
solves the problem or, if it is not an outright solution, how it alleviates pain associated with
the problem. Look at other problem-solution narratives in advertising and in corporate origin
stories for examples of how to craft a quick, compelling problem-solution narrative.

  Classic Problem-Solution Narratives

           A young man starting high school lacks muscle mass. He drinks milk and gets stronger, earning the
             respect of his classmates.

           Young people, pictured in silhouette, walk around a city looking bored with life. Then, they turn on their
             new MP3 players and start dancing in the streets. Their world is set ablaze in color and sound.

           A man literally turns into Joe Pesci when he gets hungry. He eats a candy bar and turns back into his
             normal self.

These may not be the greatest stories ever told. You're not going to get a National Book
Award for a Snickers commercial, but these are memorable narratives about people who have
a problem that the product in question can solve.

You may want to personalize the narrative as it relates to you or someone on your team. This
is common practice, but don't force it. Often, student media entrepreneurs are caught in a
quandary. They tend to come up with products suitable for their demographic that may not
be massively appealing, or they come up with products for general audiences (read: people of
a different generation). Then students may have difficulties crafting a relatable narrative. Your
preference should be for creating a viable product and telling the product's story as well as
you can. Use your research and communication skills to craft narratives with a great problem-
solution story. If your product is not for people like you, simply identify the type of person
who has this problem or this pain point. Create user or customer personas (see Customer
244 MARK POEPSEL

Discovery chapter3): "fictional, generalized representations of ideal customers." Explain how
your product is a feasible, meaningful solution for her or him. What motivates them to adopt
your product? Tell the story in thirty seconds or less, in three slides or fewer.

By the time you create your pitch, you may have developed a concept and wireframe or
some other mockup of a minimum viable product (MVP). Often the best way to present this
narrative is to tell the problem-solution story verbally while simultaneously demonstrating
on a couple of slides precisely where users need to tap or click to fix the problem. If this is
a semester project for class, you may not have a prototype ready yet, but you should work to
make your mockup look as much like the "real thing" as possible.

Try out different narratives on potential customers as part of your customer-development
research. Keep internal records of which narratives work best. Ask people why these resonate
more than others. You usually do NOT want to spend precious time delving into bullet points
about key features at this stage. You can tell investors how the product works later on in the
pitch. At this point you are simply a brand that solves a problem a lot of people have. Strive to
make the narrative relatable and fun.

PRESENTATION ELEMENT #3: Key Features and Your Value Proposition

During your pitch, consider introducing investors to your key features, your value proposition
and, where applicable, your user interface (UI) at the same time. Key features are the specific
jobs your product or service accomplishes or assists with. A most basic example is that a bowl
is innovative in relation to a plate. Both share the key feature that they hold food. A bowl adds
another feature by holding liquids comfortably. Many innovative media products add several
key features to solve nuanced problems. Limit yourself to developing a small handful of key
features at first. Figure out how they will look and feel and be able to show users how your
product's design is easy to use.

One way to think of your value proposition is as the sum of your key features. How exactly
are you solving problems, addressing pain points? The bigger the problem and the simpler the
solution set, the more impressive your value proposition is likely to be.

At its core, a value proposition is a statement about why someone needs your product or
service. How are you making their life better or making them more wealthy, with "wealth"
being broadly defined?

Answer this question in your presentation visually while stating it verbally. Show investors
your product or your UI and walk them through two or three tasks that can be accomplished
easily. This is a chance to show off your key features and to make your potential investors
understand your value proposition so well they become excited to invest and to bring this
product with these, or similar, key features to audiences.
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 245

Demonstrate your UI or your product's design in two or three slides. You may prefer to simply
show a mock-up against a monochrome background so that the product's design is all that
investors notice. This will make the value proposition pop. Alternately, if you want the slides to
carry over an existing set of design elements from the rest of your presentation, try to make the
color palette, shape, and line selections for your slide background complement your product's
design elements.

Do not feel the need to introduce every feature or to narrate every design choice, but you
should show that you have a good sense of design and that your design will make your key
features easy to find and use.

A popular tool for creating wireframes is Balsamiq.4 You can create mobile and/or web app
wireframes that incorporate realistic design elements such as buttons, menus, and media
players. You can build a wireframe mockup of your application or web application that users
can actually click through and try out. If you work with a clickable wireframe, though, double
and triple check that it functions properly on the device you will be using during your "big
ask." If you're not completely sure that the functions will work, use a static mockup and sell it
with your enthusiasm and with evidence of thoughtful, thorough research. If you are pitching
a tangible media product, e.g. a wearable, you should bring a physical prototype for investors
to try out.

Whatever your combination of digital mockup and tangible prototype is, it is preferable
to show something basic that helps investors understand key features rather than show an
elaborate mockup on which little or nothing works. Stick to the minimum viable product
and keep the mockup clear and simple; however, note that certain startup competitions or
investors may require working prototype sites or apps.

Tips for crafting great-looking, useful user interfaces are abundant online. They usually come
with collections of colors in "color kits"5 that serve as pre-determined palettes, and they will
also include button and menu design styles for you to choose based on the tone and function
of your product. Try out completely different approaches to UI on potential customers. Once
you have narrowed down their basic color and design preferences using stock design elements,
try creating your own color combinations, button styles, and menu designs. Stay within your
users' stated preferences, but apply your own creativity so that you can truly brand your
product as your own.

I allude to the term "iterative development" throughout this chapter, but it merits definition
here. Iteration in innovation refers to building out prototypes again and again-first for the
developers themselves, then for beta testers, and then for a (hopefully) growing audience. At
the root of the concept is repetition, which means the process of designing, building, testing,
seeking feedback, re-designing, etc. continues indefinitely. Think, for example of a common
platform such as Facebook and how many times it has been redesigned since you or the people
you know have been using it.
246 MARK POEPSEL

If you spend even a few months using a favorite platform or app, you will likely see iterations
of its development. What you need to know during the entrepreneurial pitch process is that
iterating can happen while the pitch is being developed. This is normal and expected. You
should seek to iterate based on user data and feedback. Iteration is not guesswork, and it's
not merely trial and error. It's an informed repetitive development process meant to develop a
product-market fit by molding the product to an existing market.

PRESENTATION ELEMENT #4: Product-Market Fit Description

In your team's pitch so far, you have established a brand, demonstrated through storytelling
how it solves a problem, and shown that your team is capable of designing an MVP with a
combination of user input and your own creative design skills. You have shown investors that
you and your team have a valuable idea and the skills to work in a lean startup environment
using an iterative process. Now you must demonstrate how you are going to make money.

The next few slides in your deck should present a brief discussion of product-market fit. In two
to three slides, show how big the market is, show where your product fits, and show evidence
of iterative development according to customer preferences. Your goal is to quickly show the
investors where there is an underserved mass market. Then, you must show that your product
can tap that market and reach real customers. Every aspect of the market you are entering is
fair game for questions from investors. You can head off killer questions by showing a depth
of understanding about the market. There may be many solutions in the marketplace. Do not
ignore them. Explain why your solution fits best. Explain that you're working harder than
anyone else to serve customers by directly testing their preferences.

Marc Andreessen of investment firm Andreessen-Horowitz calls product-market fit "the only
thing that matters."6 Specifically, his commentary is about successful startups and whether
team, product, or market matters more. He argues it's the market. Andreessen says: "In a great
market -- a market with lots of real potential customers -- the market pulls product out of the
startup [original emphasis]."7 None of your creative ideation or inspired design work matters if
you can't demonstrate knowledge of the marketplace. Practicing customer development, then,
is establishing a process where you allow consumers to pull great products out of your efforts.

Fit your market research into your presentation in under a minute. Emphasize the size and
strength of the potential market in a slide. Then, demonstrate that you have conducted careful
customer research to learn what potential users want. You should have data from testing
general product ideas, key feature combinations, and design elements. You should be able
to show quantitative data, probably from surveys, and qualitative data, probably from focus
groups. Present the highlights of customer development in a couple of slides.

Investors only want the summary of this data. Present it in a narrative form. For example: "We
have found that our users prefer our social media app because their friends are using it, and as
the number of friends using our app increases a certain amount, the amount users spend with
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 247

the app increases in correlation." If you're not able to show that level of correlation in your
data, at least be able to show that you are building the most popular version of your idea with
key features that users preferred over all other potential features they were shown.

The visuals you use are up to you, but you must establish that there is a market for this kind
of product and that you've sought to achieve product-market fit by developing a product with
direct user feedback. That's what customer development is all about. For the lean startup, it
cannot be stressed enough how important customer development is. It's not enough to show
that you have had some good ideas. You need to show that you can bring your product and its
customers together. Products evolve, and so do customer tastes, so you need to show that your
team can already work on this product in response to user feedback data.

 Market Research

  Your first task in conducting market research is to define the scope of the media market where your
  product will compete. If you are working on a journalism startup, define a news niche in terms of
  geography and topic. If your news product focuses primarily on one topic, you will probably need to
  cover a wide geographical area, perhaps a national market.

  If you are planning to bring news to a geographical region, limit it in a logical way. You might
  determine a reasonable driving radius around your community and cover the counties and cities
  within, which is essentially what defines a Designated Market Area (DMA) in broadcast news. You
  might wish to focus more narrowly on a single metro area or suburb.

  Use census data to learn everything you can about the people who live in your coverage area. Read
  broadly about the history of the area, its economic background, and its economic future. Plug into
  the local entrepreneur scene long before you launch your media startup because understanding the
  startup market is your key to understanding the economic future of your area.

  Most mass media startups that do not focus on journalism serve as communication platforms,
  games, or information curation/aggregation services. Service-logistics apps of the so-called "sharing
  economy" help people providing specific services to coordinate with others who need those services.
  If your team is pitching this type of app, avoid calling your product the "Uber of" something. Uber has
  become synonymous with corroded corporate culture,8 and it has proven to be a high-stakes global
  gamble for investors. The sharing economy model is a difficult sell because the ideas are cheap and
  execution is expensive. Whatever your product is, you will need to demonstrate that this particular
  shared service is needed. You can't expect to rely on sharing economy research in another sector to
  justify your concept. Nobody needs the "Uber of toothbrushes," or do they?9
248 MARK POEPSEL

PRESENTATION ELEMENT #5: Competitive Analysis

After working through the first four presentation elements, students sometimes think that
their product's value is self-evident based on its key features, its design, and the strength of the
marketplace. There is a tendency to think that because the processes of designing a product
and strategizing about customer development are labor intensive those elements should be
enough to demonstrate a product's value, but investors will look for something more. They
will want to know that your media product is not already available elsewhere, offered by
someone with more experience and an established customer base. You must demonstrate that
your product is unique.

Describe your competition as clearly and directly as possible. Name names. Cite links. Clearly
and accurately describe their relevant products and their features. Describe in some detail
what they do and don't do. Know your competitors as well as you know your own brand. In the
context of where your targeted markets overlap, know them better than they know themselves.
Show that you have looked at trade industry publications detailing your competition's
strategies. Show that you have read, synthesized, and summarized up-to-date industry blogs'
take on your competition, and, most important, show that you understand your competitors'
strategy based on their About Page and design blog, if they have one.

Competitive analysis should be presented in about two slides. Pretending not to notice major
players in the field will get you laughed off the presentation stage. You need to note in one
slide who your key competitors are in the marketplace. You need to explain how your product
or service is unique. What key features do you offer that no one else does? When you have
similar features, how do you prioritize them or present them in ways that are unique or more
affordable or more tailored to a target audience than the options that already exist? Answer
these questions for each competitor.

Demonstrate this knowledge in clean, carefully crafted slides with straightforward
storytelling. Neither overestimate nor underestimate the competition. When organizing this
section of your slide deck, you are going to have to make executive decisions about what
to leave in the presentation and what to cut. Use the "iceberg principle." Present about one-
tenth of the research you have done and be prepared to tailor the competitive analysis of your
presentation for each investor or competition keeping in mind that competitors and markets
are in flux.

Keep the pace quick and have a strategic counter for beating or at least competing with
competitors' strategies. It's not enough to list their related products and the key features of
those products. Identify the brand strategies so that you can anticipate where your competition
is headed. You should be able to answer what you would do if someone new entered the
marketplace doing the same thing you're doing. Explain if this can be prevented. If it can't,
explain with substance how you're performing better than the competition at delivering a
similar product. If that is not possible, you need to come up with a different product. Pivot
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 249

to target a different market or develop a different feature set. It's essential that you don't try
to pitch a product that's already available in the same marketplace (potentially from multiple
sellers with more resources and experience).

You can present your competitive analysis by going through one competitor at a time and
explaining how you will beat each one, or you can go topic by topic, such as "feature set," "target
market," "user interface," "supply chain," "development costs," "outcomes," "branding," etc. and
explain how you will best your competitors on each item. This element of your presentation
can easily get convoluted. You may not wish to address all of these elements. If you do good
customer development work, you can prioritize which of these aspects of the product matter
most to them and limit your competitive analysis discussion based on that research. In this
way, customer development is doubly important. It tells you how to focus your own product
and tells you where to focus your competitive efforts.

Your competitive analysis needs to evolve as you go through the customer development
process. Each time you add or remove a key feature from your product, you must research
who else is doing something similar and alter or amend your presentation to show that you're
aware of them and have a plan to beat them.

PRESENTATION ELEMENT #6: Financial Projections

In about three slides, explain your revenue model, that is, what your customers, advertisers,
underwriters, etc., will be paying and what will they be paying for, as well as the costs to deliver
those products or services. One of the best ways to express your revenue model is to work
with the Business Model Canvas (BMC) (see Business Models chapter for more on this)10
to map out how money will flow through your organization. The BMC helps you to picture
how your startup fits into its financial ecosystem. It enables or forces you to think about who
you're going to work with and how you're going to work with them to get the resources you
need to provide valuable products or services. It helps you to plan to whom exactly you will
deliver those services and how you will deliver them, and it demands that you understand
what your costs are and where your revenue will really come from. The BMC will inform
your estimation of startup costs and operating costs. From those (revenues, startup costs, and
operating costs), you can determine your breakeven analysis according to what your class
syllabus or competition guidelines require. Groups in media entrepreneurship classes often go
through a dozen business model canvas drafts, or more, as they plan and develop their product
and as they conduct customer development. The BMC will help you to decide on a revenue
model and express it in visual form, though the actual visualization should be tailored to suit
your product.

You must indicate how much of your startup funds you have already contributed, if you plan
on seeking other funding sources, and what proportion of the business you are going to hand
over to investors for the amount of funding you request. You should probably share only a
250 MARK POEPSEL

summary of your plan. Spend no more than three minutes presenting realistic, well-thought-
out financial estimates. Again, the iceberg approach may be the best approach.

Investors will want to know what basis you have for your financial estimates and claims.
Often, this is the part of the presentation that generates the most questions from the audience.
Document your sources for any financial assertions you make and be prepared to hand over
more detailed business plans if asked. Make the case that your product is a great investment.
Practice with mentors, friends, family members, and your professors so that you can make the
strongest possible feasible case for funding.

Pitch Deck Examples

An example of a successful pitch is CardLife featured on this11 blog post of the 35 best pitch
deck examples. It is a tracking company that communicates to users, usually business, how
much they are spending on subscription software services. Businesses have a problem. They
subscribe to many software solutions. They do so at different times for different amounts for
plans that may renew automatically year over year or that may increase in price, sometimes
without review. CardLife helps track this expense in order to make it easier for businesses to
balance budgets. This is a business that serves other businesses, yes, but it's also media-related
because it gathers, tracks and presents information in a service that's designed to be easy to
use. It's a time saver and potentially a stress reducer. The slide deck established that this is a
problem for businesses by keying in on one number: 93%. That's the percentage of businesses
that fail to keep track of their software and other subscription expenses. In their pitch, they
note that 1,000 businesses signed up for their service within six weeks of launch, and they
note that they are connecting to a $10 billion industry. Though they cannot plan on receiving
a portion of that particular pie, by being connected to such a large market with continued
growth potential, they easily make the case that their business is positioned for future growth.
Please review their presentation video and slide deck. It's No. 15 on this list, which includes
several other examples of solid slide decks accompanied by videos of each as they were given
by the entrepreneurs themselves at Y Combinator 2017.12

 Mobile Development Costs

  Let's start with an anecdote: In our entrepreneurial media management course at Southern Illinois
  University in Edwardsville, guest judges came one semester and quoted wildly different costs for
  app development. One estimate was based on an alert app that let students know when on-campus
  athletic events are being held. Students budgeted tens of thousands of dollars in their plan to build a
  fully functional app, but the guest judge said he had proposals for similar alert services on his desk
  that would cost the university about $2,000.
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 251

  At a pitch competition later the same semester, a different team proposed to a different set of judges
  to build a new social media platform that would visualize posts and group audiences into "cliques"
  enabling social media managers to send targeted message to only certain "cliques," in real time. One
  judge happened to have served as an adviser to a military contractor who wanted to develop its own
  social media platform. He had a front-row seat to the proposal, and his company quoted a base price
  (with a development team of dozens of software developers) at $20 million. Thus, the class was left
  with a range of costs for "app development" somewhere between $2,000 and $20 million. The best
  way to estimate costs for an app is to look for something with a similar feature set and find out how
  much seed money it got in its earliest round or rounds of funding.

FOLLOW UP

Question and Answer Preparation

Preparing for question and answer sessions with potential investors is something of a
challenge because every investor is different. You should anticipate likely questions and be
prepared for "wild card" questions by having an open mind and by practicing your pitch
in front of different audiences. Vary the age of your pitch audience. Get test audiences that
vary in income level and education. Sometimes you are not pitching to the investor but to
the investor's idea of who the consumer for this product must be. Once you have practiced
presenting in front of various audiences, you should identify a few likely questions and prepare
well-researched answers. You need not promise the world to an investor. But you must be
prepared to indicate your plans for improvement, or be able to explain why something that
seems like it should be done is not yet done. You should identify known weaknesses in your
pitch and prepare reasonable answers regarding your plans to improve upon shortcomings.
You may plan to conduct further research where more information is needed, or you may have
identified key features that need to be altered or replaced. If you have identified something
that needs doing and that isn't done yet, that may not be a deal breaker as long as you have a
reasonable plan for making changes and you show that you are prepared for change.

Staying Connected

You should also strategize for staying in touch with any potential investors. Task a point
person with collecting and organizing investors' contact information. Make note of each
investor's investing background and interests and take detailed and careful notes about their
feedback regarding your pitch. Do your research. You should know any potential investor's
history and strengths and weaknesses. Treat an investor's individual concerns as the most
important keys to your success. Making it work with one real investor ready to cut a check is
more important than developing a perfect product pitch for future potential investors.
252 MARK POEPSEL

Generally, cold calls to angel investors are not appreciated. Work carefully immediately after
an investor expresses interest in your proposal to open a line of communication. Follow the
investor's preference, which may be for asynchronous communication such as email or SMS,
or they may prefer to speak via video chat or by phone.

One goal, perhaps the goal of an initial pitch is to gain enough interest on the part of an
investor that she or he wants to hear a second, personalized pitch in the near future.

You are not going to meet your "soulmate" investor the first time out or in any of the first ten
times making your pitch. Shoot for a 1 in 100 rate of success at setting up a meeting with a
funder. That means that for every 100 contacts you make, one of them might consider funding
your business.

There is often a two-step flow to reach an investor. You may need to pitch a surrogate who can
get you a meeting with the right investor. As a baseline, you, as a representative of your startup,
ought to have an up-to-date LinkedIn profile. You should have a professional Twitter account
where you follow and connect with investor networks, and you should plan on attending
events with investors and other entrepreneurs through Eventbrite and Meetup.

Show up early to events. Stay late. Strategically attend paid events where investors are the
invited speaker for a better shot at meeting the right investor. The "right" investor is the one
who shoots you down but who knows three or four other investors who are more likely to be
interested in your idea or your brand.

Be where other startups are, such as co-working spaces, and consider creating a recruiting
profile for your startup on AngelList. You need to be easy to find and ready to meet.13

If you make your pitch informally 100 times, you will have the opportunity to refine your
idea and your informal narrative. You will learn what gets investors excited, how to pace your
informal pitch, and you will learn to move away from all-or-nothing formal pitches on the
stage to the kinds of informal conversations with connected people who can get you a meeting
with the right investor. It is important to learn who the connectors are, who are "all hat and
no cattle," and ultimately you must know what you are asking for: a sit-down meeting with an
angel investor who will listen to your idea.

The informal pitch may include a ballpark figure funding goal, but above all else should
communicate capability and passion for the idea.

Your first pitch to an investor, according to the odds, will not result in an offer of funding.

The investor will often tell you why she or he is interested in your pitch. Keep this in mind
and ask if there are any portions of the pitch that they would like to know more about. Be
straightforward and be open to change. Know when to stop selling and listen. Know that you
need not point out any flaws in your product when discussing a possible investment. A solid,
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 253

experienced investor will have noted many or all of the potential flaws, conflicts, and stress
points in your product pitch by researching your business before the meet.

Gauging investor interest is important. It is subjective. It takes time and regular, professional
communication. You can change mockups and make prototypes with investor input in mind,
but you must consider your costs and recognize when an investor is not serious. You do not
want to spend more than your startup can afford to alter your product for an investor who is
only testing the waters.

How often you communicate with a potential investor depends on their availability, their
willingness to communicate, and how many resources you have at your disposal for cultivating
relationships. One thing is for sure: You must follow up with potential investors. They will
expect you to do so if they have expressed an interest in your proposal.

A few somewhat universal goals you might pursue for communicating with interested
investors:

        Establish a pattern of regular communication.
        Encourage the investor to use your prototype.
        Encourage her or him to ask questions and make suggestions.
        Expect to pitch to a potential investor again and again. Expect to make follow-up

          pitches and progress reports consistently and professionally regularly even after she
          or he has bought in.
        As you work to secure and reassure investors, your work will likely evolve to include
          two difficult but essential facets: 1. You will have to be the communicative connector
          between your customers and investors. 2. You will need to keep innovating even after
          investors have thrown their weight around.

OTHER TYPES OF PITCH

There are a few other types of pitch you may wish to prepare or that you may be assigned
to develop besides the somewhat standard ten- to fifteen-minute slide deck proposal. The
following are examples of longer-form and more brief pitch types: elevator pitches, three-
minute pitches, prospectus writing, and nonprofit pitches.

Elevator Pitches

The elevator pitch, or Twitter pitch, should land somewhere between a branding statement
and a problem-solution narrative. It should take no longer than a minute to deliver, and in
most cases it ought to be memorized. The point of an elevator pitch is to earn a chance to make
a longer pitch at a later date at the time and place of the investor's choosing. Giving an elevator
pitch is an art. It's often done informally at networking events. In movies, these types of pitches
are given in bathrooms, on the street, in the firm's lobby as a courtesy, or, yes, in elevators.
254 MARK POEPSEL

In reality, you never know when you might need to give an elevator speech. That's why you
always have it memorized.

Be able to tell a potential investor precisely what your product does, why a mass audience
would be interested, and where mass revenues are going to come from. All other aspects of
the pitch will be in response to questions--if you can manage to get an investor interested.
If you're asked to write one, make it two to three sentences, or a tweet. Write one that's easy
to memorize so that any member of your team can deliver it and any potential investor can
comprehend what the brand is, what you do, and how you plan to make money.

Three-Minute Pitches

Two- or three-minute pitches are often used at "pitch days" or "speed dating" events where
many entrepreneurs and many potential investors or well-connected people meet to hear
what's being developed. Rather than tailoring a deck for a potential investor or for a
competition and then reading the audience during the pitch performance, you may need to
take a Swiss Army Knife approach and develop a handful of different short, completely scripted
pitches to present to different people depending on their role (e.g. investor or journalist), their
field (e.g. tech, advocacy, PR), or their attention span.

When startups attend pitch days in front of prospective investors, there is a formulaic
approach to the ask. While you may not need to adhere to a script for a slide deck, a solid
three-minute pitch can help you attract vendors and suppliers, woo landlords and advertisers,
recruit employees, and win over other advocates. And, yes, maybe even investors someday (at
which point you'll revisit that pitch deck).14

Craft pitches that are long enough to incorporate a narrative without missing the essentials
of the elevator pitch. Joanne Cleaver, writing for Entrepreneur.com, suggests that the three-
minute pitch can be tailored to an audience according to this formula: "Get their attention, tell
them the right story, and keep `em on the hook."

Prospectus Writing

A successful pitch presentation might end with an investor asking for your prospectus.
"Prospectus" is a tricky term in the startup world. Prospectus.com spells out all of its potential
meanings:

     "A prospectus is somewhat used as an interchangeable term. Often a business plan is
     referred to as a prospectus, as is the private placement memorandum (PPM). In many
     cases, the prospectus is a public disclosure document that, like the PPM, is used to
     disclose the company's data prior to a public listing of securities (with the goal in mind
     to raise capital publicly). However, prospectuses are also used in the private placement
     market and often the term itself is employed in lieu of an offering memorandum or
                                                                                                                                                   PITCHING IDEAS 255

     a PPM. Referring to your business plan or your private placement memorandum as
     a `prospectus' is not inaccurate, but it may not be precise [edited for spelling and
     clarity]."15

Be sure you know what's being asked of you if someone asks for a "prospectus." Have your
complete business plan ready in case that's what an investor really wants to see. It's much more
feasible to break down a business plan into different types of prospectuses depending on who's
making the request than it is to try to turn a legal prospectus into a complete business plan.

"Whether you are raising private capital or set to launch a publicly listed company on a stock
exchange, a business plan and a disclosure document is required."16 Per prospectus.com, the
document needs at a minimum the following information:

        Terms of the Offering: The terms should be directed to a targeted audience of
          appropriate investors.

        Regulation Disclosures: Whatever regulations exist for raising funds need to be
          indicated and addressed.

        Management Team: Describe who is leading this organization, what each person's
          background is, and where they are getting their help from in terms of outside
          organizational or institutional support.

        Risk Factors: In particular, note any risks associated with the specific field you are
          trying to enter.

        Subscription Procedures: You need to write up a legal document to explain the terms
          of the stock or other security your startup is offering.17

For this text, a prospectus refers to a summary of a business plan put in writing that might
be used as a disclosure document. There are online aids available that can help you write a
business plan, which can be streamlined and used as a prospectus. You should make contact
with a lawyer before you make any serious pitches to investors. The best advice may be to use
the U.S. Small Business Administration's tools for crafting a business plan as completely as you
can, and then based on a thorough examination of the marketplace and your plans, you can
then craft a prospectus.

Nonprofit Pitches

Nonprofit startups need to make pitches to request funds, and they may still go through the
process of bootstrapping, asking friends and family for money, and eventually going to larger
investors (i.e. donors, foundations, grantors, etc.) to try to get their business off the ground.
In the vast majority of cases, nonprofit organizations will need to identify various revenue
sources apart from the initial grantor or foundation if they plan to stay afloat. Thus, nonprofits
often have to be grant-managing machines and great pitch developers too. Other ways that
nonprofits bring in revenues beyond getting grants include signing up small donors in person
256 MARK POEPSEL

at community events, hosting fundraising galas, crowdfunding, making direct mail requests,
and sending phone, email, and text requests.

Potential sources of revenue must be described in great detail in any documentation explaining
your nonprofit business plan. Other elements should still be included: branding, a problem-
solution narrative, communications plans and tools demonstrating your design sense, an
analysis of the "competition," and financial plans. They need to be addressed in terms of
terminology and tone to donors and grantors, but at the end of the day the pitch for a nonprofit
business has a lot in common with a startup pitch.

TOOLS TO IMPROVE YOUR PLAN AND YOUR PITCH

The Business Model Canvas mentioned earlier can be used to develop the components of your
pitch; however, it shouldn't be used as a checklist. The sections of the canvas flow into one
another and should be considered a strategic whole.18 Write and edit multiple versions of your
business model so that you could make it into a flipbook and animate it if you wanted to.

If your company or university would pay for it, Strategyzer costs $299 per year and allows you
to electronically build within the BMC framework and to generate reports based on what you
have proposed.19 The Value Proposition Design text zeroes in on two points of the BMC--the
value propositions and customer segments--and breaks down your analysis and development
into smaller units that can be profiled, anticipated, and measured to try to achieve the best
product market fit as you further develop your actual product and test it with users.20

Canvanizer21 and BMFiddle22 allow you to digitally build the BMC over and over again. With
some practice, either can be a useful tool for applying virtual sticky notes to the BMC. Neither
does your thinking for you, but if you're looking for inspiration, BMFiddle shares the Skype
BMC example.23

Regardless of the tool you use, it is essential not to be boring. Present your slide deck to new
people consistently. Present it to people with no knowledge of investing or entrepreneurial
pitches to see how they respond to the design and the flow of your presentation.

Guy Kawasaki offers good guidelines for using PowerPoint in his 10/20/30 rule.24 You may
have to adjust your presentations for each pitch setting, but these are solid guidelines to start
with. Kawasaki says that a slide deck should have 10 slides, the presentation should take
about 20 minutes, and the type size should be at least 30-point. Follow these rules to have
easily understood PowerPoint presentations that don't drone on and that conform to investors'
expectations when dealing with startups. The 10-slide structure presented by Kawasaki is a
good alternative to the structure presented in this chapter.

PITCHING PRACTICES -- WHAT RESEARCH SAYS

Scholars study the art and (social) science of the startup pitch. The discussion here includes brief
analyses of research on the use of rhetoric in pitches, the role gender plays in pitch success, and
analysis of how entrepreneurs can dress to win. Useful academic research focusing narrowly on
entrepreneurial pitches has been done, but the body of pitch research is not nearly as robust as work
delving into other aspects of entrepreneurial business management and success.

Plenty of articles have been written about how to pitch. Some may prove useful to you in planning and
delivering your pitches, but they usually lack academic rigor. This section is a synthesis of carefully
conducted social science research that has gone through peer review. Assumptions were tested.
Findings are backed by detailed evidence, and limitations are acknowledged directly in detail.

Successful Presentation Language: Framing the Pitch

Research regarding rhetoric in pitch presentations covers a variety of areas. This is an interesting
area of study for scholars of rhetoric because pitch competitions and television shows are fertile
ground for looking at what works in contemporary persuasive speech. One key concept is "impression
management."25 In a recent publication in the Journal of Business Venturing, Parhankangas and
Ehrlich examine down to the word "How entrepreneurs seduce business angels." They looked at
what words or types of words helped entrepreneurs actually secure funding and found that there
may be optimal points in terms of numbers of words to put in your pitch deck for employing
"positive language" (nine words), for self-promotion regarding your ability to innovate (2.8 words), for
referencing your own weaknesses (3.5 words), and for "blasting" the competition (3.3 words). This
serves as a reminder that these things - referencing your innovativeness, your weaknesses and your
competition's failings - are good to do in a pitch, but you probably shouldn't overdo it. There seems
to be, at least based on one study, a "Goldilocks"26 point beyond which you don't want to step.

Stay positive, and reference your skills and failings and your competition's major weaknesses without
overdoing it. Another paper on rhetoric and the entrepreneurial pitch looks at how Korean
entrepreneurs reconfigured their pitch decks when participating in a competition designed to bring
already successful Korean products to American markets. The entrepreneurship program studied here
is intense. Program organizers and their staff do "actual market research for each company's product,
and the competition's winners receive actual business development that has historically led to actual
deals."27 The authors of this paper probably use the word "actual" so often because they want to
stress that this is not a paper about "merely academic" concepts.

They analyzed initial pitch decks and final decks of fourteen teams that completed the program:
258 MARK POEPSEL

  "a full cycle of activity: application to the program, initial pitches, initial feedback from program
  personnel, detailed feedback from representative stakeholders in the target market, and revised
  pitches." Product claims changed as teams went through the program: "There is a change in wording
  or details to provide more evidence-based and benefit-oriented language." At times, questions raised
  in the feedback process were directly addressed in rebuttal slides showing an engagement in the
  process that reached beyond trying to perfect the pitch deck. When entrepreneurial pitch
  development programs are running at top speed, so to speak, entrepreneurs show they can think
  strategically about their product, their market, and how to communicate to all types of audiences the
  value of their solution and their approach to solving problems.

  Another article, published in IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, analyzed frames
  used by entrepreneurs and how they are developed.28 Here, "frame" is a way of talking about
  something that helps connect your understanding of an object, product, or event with other people's
  understanding and values. The article states, "The entrepreneur acquired the most influential frames
  through stakeholder discussion, applied these frames in a way that stacked and made salient multiple
  frames beyond the problem-solution frame, and judged frame fit by considering the degree to which
  catchers took up the frames." The author calls investors and stakeholders in this study "catchers" to
  stress that they are the ones pitches are directed to. It's important that they understand, so it can help
  to use multiple frames.

  Problem-solution is just one frame you can use. What this means for students is that the way you
  describe your product will probably evolve as you talk about it with stakeholders, and it should
  probably evolve in ways that are meaningful to them. It's okay to stack frames if you need to. You can
  work to come up with different, specific terms that help define your innovation in different contexts for
  different groups. The example in this paper framed the innovation - a nonprofit organization called
  Hacker Gals - as a collection of hackers who know about computers, makers who get things done,
  and women who have unique perspectives in the startup world. The combination of frames helped the
  paper's author, who also runs the startup, to communicate better with more stakeholders. Ultimately,
  more specificity emerged as she reworked her pitches: "Specificity and salience appeared to be, in
  other words, directly proportional." Thus, one thread tying all these rhetorical analyses together is that
  specificity is important in entrepreneurial pitches, but it doesn't come only from the minds of the pitch
  team. It comes as a result of working and reworking the pitch with stakeholders and mentors.

 Gender and Pitch Success

  Lakshmi Balachandra, Anthony Briggs, Kimberly Eddleston, and Candida Brush studied how gender
  affects the way entrepreneurial pitches are perceived.29 They did not find that being female
  absolutely precluded an entrepreneur from finding funding, but they did find that "gendered
                                                                                                                                                PITCHING IDEAS 259

expectations do make a difference as women entrepreneurs who present masculine behaviors are
more likely to be evaluated positively than those who do not." The authors continue, "Interestingly we
find women entrepreneurs have stronger communication skills, but rates of women's entrepreneurial
participation remain weaker than men's." The authors suggest that this is because investors,
generally speaking, are males who prefer to see so-called "masculine behavior," characterized as
"bold," "attentive," "[demonstrating] self-assurance," "calm," and "confident," in women giving
entrepreneurial pitches.

The authors go on to say: "Consistent with liberal feminist theory, women do face bias in terms of
the masculine stereotype held by the majority of the male-dominated investment community: During
the pitch, women should `act' like men and indicate masculine behaviors or they may be penalized by
investor audiences to not have the qualities they believe to be consistent with entrepreneurship."30

Students shouldn't interpret this article simply as a plea to female entrepreneurs to "Pitch Like a
Man" in early-stage pitch presentations, to reference the title of this article. Social structures setting
the norms for pitch analysis need to change. Investors must become aware of their own biases and
retrain themselves to analyze pitches on their own merits rather than on the gender of the people
making the pitch. Scholars and advocates are better positioned to demand these changes than
entrepreneurs begging for startup funds in an environment where the success rate is very low.

What to Wear

The quality of a pitch presentation is subjective. Investors and judges will notice when a pitch lacks
quality, but they might not care to or be able to discern if it was the style of dress or style of
presentation that spoiled the deal. Your dress and your performance can obviously influence whether
or not your pitch is successful, but there are not many hard and fast rules. Web resources are filled
with advice on how to dress and whether or not you should wear formal business attire, business-
casual attire, or even casual attire. What's essential is that you research what pitch competition calls
for or what the investor prefers. Just ask how formal the context of the presentation is and dress
accordingly. If it's a competition, look for media from previous events showing how previous winners
were dressed.

There's not a deep pool of academic research on what to wear to your pitch presentation, but scholars
have shared a clear idea of what doesn't work: "Casual dress and nonchalance have a negative
influence on investors' evaluations."31 Do the research that allows you to dress to suit the occasion.
When in doubt, wear a business suit and jacket. You can always set the jacket aside and lose the tie
or your most formal accessories, e.g. Mom's pearls, if needed.
260 MARK POEPSEL

 The Importance of Performance

  There is a better body of work on performance and what works. Jeffrey Pollack, Matthew Rutherford,
  and Brian Nagy reviewed 113 successful pitches from the TV shows Shark Tank and Dragons' Den
  (Canada's answer to Shark Tank).32

  They had students rate these successful pitches and noted that those who were more prepared
  received more funding, and they found that perceptions of legitimacy had to be present for this
  relationship to work. This suggests that merely being over-prepared isn't enough to secure the most
  funding. An entrepreneur must be prepared and legitimate to survive the sharks. What comprises
  legitimacy? In this study, it was a wide variety of concepts ranging from the founder's level of
  experience to the business' likelihood of gaining good media attention. Additionally, showing strong
  management skills, existing resources, and likelihood of gaining endorsements helped.

 Digging Deep Into Performance Types and Practices

  Even if investors don't want to acknowledge it, the quality of the pitch makes a difference. Studies
  show that investors often say their decisions are based on rational elements of the business and
  the plan presented to them. However, an article titled "The Impact of Entrepreneurs' Oral `Pitch'
  Presentation Skills on Business Angels' Initial Screening Investment Decisions" suggests otherwise:

       "Presentational factors (relating to the entrepreneurs' style of delivery, etc.) tended to
       have the highest influence on the overall score an entrepreneur received as well as on
       business angels' level of investment interest. However, the business angels appeared to be
       unaware of (or were reluctant to acknowledge) the influence presentational factors had on
       their investment-related decisions: the stated reasons for their post-presentation intentions
       were focused firmly on substance-oriented non-presentational criteria (company, market,
       product, funding/finance issues, etc.)."33

  How do you show preparedness? Melissa Cardon, Cheryl Mitteness, and Richard Sudek suggest that
  it's essential the pitch team demonstrates that it understands the larger context of the market and
  social conditions for their product. "Not surprisingly, our results confirm that entrepreneurs seeking
  funding from angel investors need to have a strong opportunity and be perceived as competent.
  More important, beyond these factors, entrepreneurs appear to be able to increase their chances of
  receiving funding if they are able to signal to potential investors that they are prepared, meaning they
  have thought through the big picture and impact of their product or service and are able to answer

  This suggests that for your pitch performance to land, you need to demonstrate not just that you
                                                                                                                                                PITCHING IDEAS 261

understand how your business model works but that you understand how all similar business models
work, what the economic conditions in the related field need to be, and whether those conditions are
present.

The research of Sean Williams, Gisela Ammetller, Inma Rodrguez-Ardura, and Xiaoli Li finds (based
on a study of a small sample) that different cultural values are evident in the entrepreneurial pitches
made in different countries.35 Even if you're not presenting outside of your most comfortable cultural
sphere, it may be in your best interests to learn about the values of the organization, angel or
judges you'll be pitching to and speak to those values to maximize your success. These scholars
considered entrepreneurial values in pairs, e.g. some entrepreneurs tend to focus on the motivation
of profits while others focused more on autonomy. Some tend to promote individualism while others
show the strength of their networks. Some focus on learning while everyone (in this small study)
discussed action. The country-by-country breakdown in this study's results is somewhat murky, but
these pairings ought to be helpful for you to consider what kind of entrepreneur you are. Identify your
values and communicate them. Look for investors and competitions that are trying to achieve the
same things with their entrepreneurial efforts.

PRESENTATION TOOLS

There is more to life than PowerPoint, but Prezi gives people headaches. If you must use PowerPoint,
generate a branded deck format or, perhaps better yet, let the product design lead the way and have
a plain deck background. Avoid extensive use of bullet points. Illustrate every number that appears
in your presentation. A dollar amount belongs in context. You should either demonstrate expected
growth or expenditures or represent your target market, for example, as a small piece of a relatively
large mass media pie.

Alternatives to the traditional deck include Perspective by Pixxa, which allows you to represent and
animate data, and Haiku Deck, which includes lots of propriety art elements and a startup pitch
template -- not for professionals but perhaps good for novices getting right to work. Slidebean is good
for producing pitches and testing online because it has built-in support for analytics and tracking.
Wideo, an animation development app, can be used to completely stack and time a deck with various
animations within and between sides.

Spinuzzi, et al. developed another paper on pitch deck development and noted that in intensive pitch
competitions entrepreneurs are quite limited in how they can adjust their decks. Consider yourself
lucky if you can develop your product and your pitch at the same time so that feedback on your
pitch is simultaneously feedback on your innovation. In the same article, authors identified three
ways pitch decks are most often altered. The structure of the deck may change--slides can be added
262 MARK POEPSEL

  and deleted. The claims and evidence may be clarified or strengthened, and the level of audience
  engagement may be tweaked. Consider judging yourself on these three areas as a good, overarching,
  holistic approach to determining what, if anything, you can improve on as you work to perfect your
  pitch.

FROM THE FIELD: THE PERFECT PITCH

Amy Eisman

    How to avoid the dreaded blank stare during a live presentation. `Good ideas die all the time,' one
                                                    expert reminds us.

 From the Field

  What makes a compelling, memorable presentation? What will make investors sit up and take notice?
  Most experts say the first thing a startup presenter should do is tell a good story. You have to be
  engaging, even entertaining, explains Tom Davidson, former senior director of PBS Digital, now in
  product development at Gannett.
  Executive coach and author Peggy Klaus calls that "painting images about how this product or
  company could impact the audience."
  Klaus, president of Klaus & Associates, has seen thousands of presentations -- from executives and
  entrepreneurs, to private bankers and nonprofits. She tells clients to keep the audience in mind by
  embracing fictional radio station WIFT-FM -- where the call letters stand for what's in it for them?
  "Most people who start a speech or presentation think about what I want to say, what is my point,"
  Klaus says. "That is a narcissistic way of looking at it. What are their goals and objectives?"
  Insiders admit the soul of a good pitch presentation is really common sense. Don't dare read your
  slides. Be confident and concise. And of course practice, practice, practice.
  "People think they can wing it because they've been verbal since 18 months," Klaus says. "This results
  in a terrible meltdown situation."
  Below, the experts weigh in on the perfect pitch:
                                                                                                                                                        PITCHING 267

Your parents were right.

"Maintain eye contact with your audience," says Jan Schaffer, who has funded 220 media
entrepreneurship and innovation projects as Executive Director of J-Lab: The Institute for Interactive
Journalism. "Walk around. Be at ease. Show some personality without being obnoxious."

They were right about this, too.

Introduce yourself, says Schaffer, who teaches media entrepreneurship at American University and
the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Don't forget to tell your listeners who you are. Your
audience won't always be classmates.

Be armed.

Have one or two sentences that show that you, as the founder, have a firm grasp of the opportunity,
says Ju-Don Marshall Roberts, startup advisor and coach and now Chief Content Officer for WFAE.FM.
Convey enough passion to show you are the one to pull this off.

Davidson emphasizes that you simply can't let the investors, humans like the rest of us, get distracted.
If you don't know an answer, tell them an exact time you will get back to them with the response.

Define your opportunity.

Will the market sustain the product? Have you explained how your idea is different from a similar one?
"Good ideas die all the time," Roberts says.

Equally critical: Convince funders that this is a business, not a hobby, Schaffer says.

Bring a solid team.

"I've seen a lot of pitches where you think, `This is a great idea, I wish someone else was doing it,'"
Roberts says.

Memorize your pitch and don't read your deck.

"Likewise, don't read from your laptop or cell phone," Schaffer says.

Klaus has seen so many presentations that a question about biggest mistakes momentarily stumped
her. "There are so many. Where do I begin?"
268 AMY EISMAN

  She identifies some of the top presentation mistakes as using jargon, causing death by PowerPoint,
  speaking longer than seven minutes before interacting with the audience, and being condescending
  or arrogant.

  Klaus also warns against promising future results and cautions that conditional language is preferred.
  "With our numbers, we see a future where we can ... "

  Klaus warns that young people's nerves often get the best of them. They end up talking quickly or
  speaking with an upward inflection (making statements sound like questions). They fidget. They twist
  their hair. They slap their thighs.

  Klaus says young presenters have a particular challenge that interferes with the enthusiasm our
  experts say is critical. "A lot of young people feel if they show passion and excitement they will come
  off as too exuberant or too young," says the author of Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without
  Blowing It. "It is actually the inverse -- that young people feel, `If I am really serious, they will think I
  am really smart.'"

  In the end, make a video of yourself while practicing your pitch. Yes, we know you hate seeing yourself
  perform. But if even you can't stand watching you, why should an investor have to listen?

MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO
AUDIENCES

Elizabeth Mays

Overview

You've identified a problem, need or opportunity and you've developed your solution to it as
an entrepreneurial venture. You now have a minimally viable product or service. This chapter
will talk about how to market that product or service to your target audience in order to find
users and customers.

Your Audience: Users vs. Customers

The first thing to keep in mind is that media entrepreneurship is different from traditional
entrepreneurship. You may be marketing to two distinct groups-users and customers-and you
may want them to take different actions.

Think of a restaurant you frequent. The people who go in to eat are the end users of the
product and also the people who pay for that product. The restaurant's users are also its
customers, so it only needs to market to one audience.

Now think about a technology venture like Facebook. Facebook makes its platform free to
its users but charges advertisers to market to those users. This is much more similar to the
traditional model for content and media businesses in which the core product (news) is given
away free to an audience whose attention is then sold to the advertisers.

That's not to say that as a media startup you can't charge your users-you might have premium
news or subscriptions, branded tchotchkes, events they can attend and hopefully countless
other streams of revenue.

Your users may be just users of the product, or they may also be both users and customers to
you.

The point is, if your customers and your users are different, you may need to reach them with
different approaches and messaging.
274 ELIZABETH MAYS

For the purposes of this chapter, though, we're going to focus on marketing your business
in a way that attracts and engages an audience that uses your product, because whether that
audience is paying you or inspiring others to pay you, without an audience, you can't monetize.

Audience Acquisition

You might ask, why do you need an audience if they are not paying you directly, or not
paying you yet? Traditionally, in media, the size of an outlet's audience is important because
it determines how much it can charge for advertising. Nowadays as a media startup, you
probably want to also charge the audience for something-whether that's a membership,
events, a subscription to premium content, or something else. Either way, the larger your
audience, the more revenue potential. Even if you're grant-funded, you'll want to prove to
funders that your work matters and is worthy of more funding. The size of the audience that
sees your work is one measure you can use to demonstrate impact.

Quantifying your audience is a measure of reach. The depth of their interest in you (which may
be measured in terms of the length of time they spent with your content, whether they shared
it, and other metrics) is known as engagement.

When you're marketing your venture, it's important to know whether it is more useful to your
business goals to get a large quantity of audience members, or audience members who are
passionate about your business and engage deeply.

In either case, it's important to find an audience that is a match for your brand. This is
called your target audience. The Customer Discovery for Content and Tech Startups1 chapter
discusses how to identify and target your intended "market segment," whether that is
demographic, psychographic, behavioral, or geographic. It also discusses how to perform
market research and develop user personas, or buyer personas.

AIDA Models and Conversion

Ever heard of an AIDA model? The initials stand for attention, interest, desire, and action. The
terms were originally used to describe how advertisers moved prospects or consumers down a
pipeline or sales funnel from hearing about your product to being interested in knowing more
about it, to wanting to get it, to actually buying it. For many businesses nowadays, including
content businesses, this journey happens online. It's called a "conversion funnel" in the e-
commerce context.

Even as a journalist, your media outlet has an AIDA funnel that should matter to you. Ideally
you probably want readers and visitors to subscribe to the media outlet as their conversion.
But even if a user or audience member is not making an actual purchase or if your story doesn't
advance that end goal, chances are there is an action you want them to take (sign up to receive
                                                                                                                   MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO AUDIENCES 275

                                                                                    AIDA funnel

your column in their inbox each week, for instance). That action is still called a conversion
even when it doesn't involve a purchase.
Conversion, whatever form it takes, is a "bottom of the funnel" activity. A user is unlikely
to do a bottom of the funnel activity without being aware of your company and becoming
increasingly interested first. Sometimes, this does all happen in the span of a moment, in which
someone comes to your landing page and converts by signing up to your email list. More
often, movement through the funnel happens through multiple contacts with your company
over time. For example, someone might see a boosted post from you on Facebook, but not
take the action to go to your website. Another day, they might see another post and this time
click through to go to your site, an investigative reporting site. There, they fill out the opt-
in form to join your email list. They forget all about you for awhile, but now they get your
276 ELIZABETH MAYS

biweekly emails. A few weeks later, they click on a link from one of them to a really good
story about something that impacts them directly. In this action, they realize why you are
important to them. A few weeks later, they get another email from you with information about
a crowdfunding campaign you are running. They click to make a small donation.

Figuring out what conversion means for your organization and how to move audiences
through the funnel should be the goal of your marketing.

Content Marketing

The great thing about a digital business is that all you need to start off is some talent, a
great business idea, some paperwork, a website, a way to transact business, and some content
marketing. You don't have to be rich to start a business nor do you have to spend thousands on
advertising to get people into your physical doors. If you sell to people online, you can market
to them there too. Content marketing is one of the main ways digital organizations acquire
audiences. And content marketing costs only your time if you know how to do it yourself.
Content marketing is a common way to avoid needing a million-dollar advertising budget.

Content marketing is the David to advertising's Goliath. And the Internet is the great equalizer.
Today, you as a startup media organization and The New York Times have equal opportunity
to acquire an audience because the Internet allows you to reach a niche audience in ways
previously not possible.

Content marketing can be even more effective than advertising at growing a digital audience.
Think about the advertisements you see-they're often an unwanted interruption pushing you
to want to buy something. Content is different. It pulls you into something you are already
interested in, reminds you of your needs and wants, and subtly markets a solution to those
needs in an enjoyable, soft-sell package, complete with a call to action.

The type of content you do will be different if you are a news outlet, in which case you will
probably rely on amazing news content to market your outlet, than if you are a consultant, in
which case you will probably produce content that positions you as an expert in the type of
work you do, or if you are marketing a platform, in which scenario you'll probably do content
that helps your target audience solve problems they have that your platform can help them
solve.

Marketing Strategy, Competitive Analysis and Content Strategy

Once I've said the word content marketing, it's tempting to take that to mean, "Okay, I just
need to create some blog posts." But that's going straight to tactics and bypassing strategy, and
marketing starts with strategy. You have to first ask and answer the following questions:

        Who are you trying to reach?

        What are their needs and problems?
        What content might you provide that meets those needs?
        Where is your potential audience now?
        How will you distribute it through channels that reach them?
        And how will you measure / know whether your marketing was effective and iterate

          if not?

NewsCred offers one methodology for content marketing programs. It breaks down content
marketing into five steps:

        documenting strategy
        producing and distributing content
        refining based on insights gleaned through producing and distributing content
        converting visitors to leads and customers
        and connecting metrics to business outcomes

You can read more in their white paper2 (free if you sign up to their site).

Even though some people find creating content fun, that's not why you're doing it. You should
be doing it to meet the business objectives. Content as marketing inevitably involves research
and data to help you with decision making.

How do you decide what type of content to do? After all, if you're launching your own startup,
chances are you have lots of other core things you need to be doing (building the product,
building a revenue model around it, etc.) in addition to marketing it. So you've got to decide
where to put your resources.

Here's a process that will help you decide where to put your efforts.

        First, develop an overall marketing strategy that takes into account your Goals,
          Strategies, Measurable Objectives and Tactics, as well as KPIs (key performance
          indicators by which you will measure success).

        Conduct a SWOT analysis to help you understand your brand's strengths,
          weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the marketplace.

        Then, conduct a Competitive Analysis of your competitors' content to see what your
          closest competitors are doing.

        Finally develop a Content Strategy that shows where you might compete.

Let's say you are creating a brand-new political news outlet targeted to progressive millennials.

        Your goal might be to become the go-to political news source brand with this
          audience.

        Your measurable objective might be to get X # of subscribers to your outlet's daily
          newsletter.
278 ELIZABETH MAYS

        Your strategy to do that might be to do things that make your brand prominent on
          college campuses.

        One tactic might be to do paid social that markets your newsletter signup to a
          targeted audience on an appropriate social network. Another tactic might be to
          sponsor relevant events on college campuses and give away cool swag with your
          brand on it in exchange for on-site email signups.

        Your key performance indicators (or KPIs) in this example would be the number of
          signups to your newsletter.

                                                             Exercise

    Put together a one-page marketing plan for your venture. Include high-level goals for the marketing you do,
    strategies, measurable objectives (X number of new users, X percent growth each week, X new followers on
    Twitter, etc.), and the tactics you will pursue to achieve these goals.
                                                                                                                   MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO AUDIENCES 279

Now that you know what you're focusing on and why, check out what the competition is
doing and conduct a competitive analysis. There are two levels of competition here: the
peer competitors you know about who do something very similar to what you do (other
280 ELIZABETH MAYS

professional political news outlets in the example above), and the competitors you might not
have thought of as competitors, but who are competing for your audience's attention in search
results on the Internet (for instance, a random but hugely popular blogger you may never have
heard of).

You can use a program such as SEMRush or SpyFu to compare yourself to the competitors you
know about and discover the competitors you weren't aware of.

Use such programs to:

        Discover which topics in your expertise are popular and what topical niches are not
          being filled by your competitors.

        Unearth the search terms that commonly land people on your website or blog and
          your competitor's.

        Surface other websites that also compete for those same search terms.
        See which variations of relevant search terms draw the highest number of searches.
        See what Google adwords terms your competitors have paid for and presumably find

          valuable from in attracting an audience.

Knowing the terms that are relevant to your enterprise that a good swath of people are
searching for will give you the insights you need to develop a content strategy-i.e., what niche
are you going to write about, that people are interested in but that is not already well-served
by a similar competing company.

Here are some questions to ask as you approach this:

        What relevant search terms are your competitors ranking for?
        What does that information lead you to believe about what their audience is

          interested in and the demographic characteristics and interests of that audience?
        How does that match or diverge from the audience you want to reach?
        Which of your competitors' words do you also want to rank for?
        Which of those are most difficult to compete for? Are they worth it given your budget

          and goals?
        What other words get traffic and provide an opportunity they haven't considered or

          capitalized on?

These and similar lines of inquiry should lead you to some preliminary conclusions about
the content that might engage your target audience-what topics do they care about and seek
out, what information do they need, and most importantly, which of those are not covered ad
nauseum elsewhere. Where can you provide a fresh and needed perspective?

If your venture is a content business, these questions would be used to hone the direction of
the content that is your product, and marketing that product would become more of a question
                                                                                                                   MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO AUDIENCES 281

of how to distribute that content you're doing as a product into the right channels to reach
people who might be interested in it.

If your venture is a technology startup, this process would help you learn about the needs of
the marketplace and where your competitor's blog is providing value and where there might
be a new niche opportunity to compete.

If you're a freelance consultant providing a service to a certain type of business, this process
will help you shape content your target clients might need and want that differentiates your
brand and keeps it top of mind.

SEO

SEO is the topic of countless blog posts, by countless so-called gurus. What follows is an
attempt to give an overview of generally agreed-upon principles that content producers should
be aware of, not a comprehensive deep dive into the controversial nuances.

Here are the basics of what you need to know.

There are two facets to getting an audience for your (presumably great) content: distributing
it into channels where your audience already is; and ensuring its discoverability in the places
where audiences might be searching for it: in this case, search engines.

The first thing to understand is that search engines want to show people the most relevant
results for whatever they're searching for. By doing this, they gain eyeballs and become the
most trusted authority, and can leverage that status to monetize their engines through
advertising and other methods. So they've built a variety of complicated proprietary
algorithms to ensure they only show the content they think people will find most relevant.
This calculation includes the behaviors other people have had on the content-did they linger
or did they bounce; did they share it; did reputable experts in the same topical space link to it?

This means that the best way you can optimize your content to be found is by doing amazing
content on a top that people are searching for because they want to know. Ideally your posts
will also be so good that influencers-leaders in their/your field with large audiences-will link
to them. This is the ultimate compliment as they are endorsing you to their audience, and in a
way, sending a quality signal to the search engines.

There are lots of search engine marketers who use "black hat" tactics to fool the algorithms
into thinking your content is relevant, but using these is dangerous and can get you demoted in
rankings. Two examples of black hat techniques are keyword stuffing, packing content full of
irrelevant but high-traffic keywords; or cloaking, hiding such keywords in a way where search
engines see them but humans don't.

Again, the best thing you can do to show up in the search results to the right audience, is to
282 ELIZABETH MAYS

create amazing content that is needed or wanted by that audience. What is amazing content?
To start with, that means content that solves a problem or serves a need for its audience,
content that's more than just what you had for dinner, content that's long enough to be
worthwhile, and content that delivers on its promises.

The other thing you can do that is within your control is to optimize that content in several
ways.

The first is in your meta description. This shows up in search results and when you post on
social, and it may encourage or discourage someone from clicking on your post, so it's an
important component of acquiring audience in the first place. When people engage with your
content by clicking or lingering on it, that sends a signal that your content is authoritative.

If you use WordPress, you'll need a plugin like Yoast or similar to edit this area of your post to
be tantalizing.

The next is by making sure you use the terms (aka keywords) your audience is searching for (in
a natural and relevant way) when you're writing.

Remember that competitive analysis you conducted? In it, you found out what people were
searching for on sites similar to yours and how many people were searching for various
relevant topics? You also found out the many variations of relevant terms, and which were
most commonly used. Note that similar phrases might have vastly different search
volume-"hiking in Phoenix" might get 10,000 searches a month whereas the variation
"Phoenix hiking" might only get 500. Even if something gets a million hits a month though,
that doesn't mean it's a great thing to build your content strategy around. It may have too much
competition.

Hopefully you've found some words that have a decent audience, but that your competitors
aren't yet leveraging well, that you can use to optimize your strategy. (These should also help
you find your outlet's niche subject matter.)

Here are some of the places you may want to include the keywords you've decided to target:

        in your post URL
        in page titles
        in subheads
        near the top of the post
        in image alt tags, image title tags
        in the metadescription

Of course, you never want to overuse or "stuff" keywords into your content, and you certainly
shouldn't hide them (known as "cloaking"). These are black-hat tactics that will get you
penalized by search engines.
                                                                                                                   MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO AUDIENCES 283

But if your post is about a certain niche topic or specific person, it should say so, prominently.
Save cutesy or abstract headlines or ledes for print. You should also research which variations
of terms people are searching for around the topic and be strategic about which ones you use.

The above description focuses on "text" types of content. Of course, there are numerous
types of content, such as video and multimedia, and there are different ways to leverage these
for SEO. If you're doing video or audio, optimize the title and description, and consider
including a transcript. Also, realize that video and multimedia formats are great for getting
other reputable sites to link to your content. But if you're hosting the videos on YouTube or
similar, you will need to think about how to get people back to your site.

There are also some technical things you can do to your site, especially if you are starting out.
These include:

        You may need to install a plugin to help you control page titles and your search and
          social meta description.

        Avoiding having a bunch of 404 errors on pages that have been deleted. (Redirect any
          such pages to avoid this. Also redirect pages where you've changed the URL.)

        Enable an XML sitemap and submit it to Google Webmaster Tools. This will allow
          you to see when Google thinks your site is giving people a bad experience.

        Use SSL.
        Have good navigation (breadcrumbs) and URL structure.

You can get far more into the weeds with this (and people do), but following these best
practices is a good start.

Types of Content

There are many types of content you can deploy as part of a content marketing strategy. Here
are just a few of the types of content that can be used for marketing.

        Blog posts
        Videos, 360 video or virtual reality
        Social posts
        Email messaging
        Events, webinars and conferences
        Games
        Podcasts
        Ebooks, books
        And more (See Beyond 800 Words: New Digital Story Formats for News3 for a list.)

Note that content is not always the same as distribution. For instance, you might have a blog
post that is designed to be distributed on social, a video designed to be distributed through
284 ELIZABETH MAYS

YouTube, messaging written to be distributed via email, a lecture designed to be delivered at a
conference, a podcast for iTunes, an ebook for Amazon, and so forth.

Social media can be a platform on which you create content. But it is also a distribution
method for content housed elsewhere.

Each piece of content will be designed to fit the appropriate format for the platform(s) it will
be distributed on, leaving lots of room for the same message to be repurposed into different
content formats and then distributed into different channels where you can connect with
different parts of your audience.

Social Media

Organic Social Media

The Internet is saturated with blog posts on how to use each social media network to best
effect. We will not replicate those here. Instead, we'll give an overview of how to use social
media, generally, in the context of a broader marketing strategy for your venture.

Of course, you can create content that is solely meant to live on a social network. Instagram
is a great example of a network that lends itself to this. People post awesome images and links
are not clickable by default, which decreases the value of using this network to promote things
you're doing elsewhere.

However, when you're using someone else's network to post content, you don't own your
audience.

The social network owns the data about that audience, which decreases the value to you in
building an audience on social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, etc. These are what we
call "borrowed channels."

In addition, these borrowed channels all have different algorithms, some of which are
specifically designed to demote content that is too obviously promotional rather than
personal.

Furthermore, as a social media manager colleague of mine likes to say, social media is like
throwing a pebble in the ocean. The odds of people seeing your efforts here at scale are low (if
you don't have lots of resources to devote to this).

For all of these reasons, in the content marketing context, social media is more often used to:

        Distribute, amplify, and bring attention to content that lives elsewhere on your
          "owned channels" and encourage people to subscribe to your owned channels.
                                                                                                                   MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO AUDIENCES 285

        Expand the audience you reach on your owned channels by targeting a similar
          audience that wasn't connecting with you previously.

        Listen to your audience and find out about their needs so you can serve them better.
        Foster engagement with your audience for your brand.

In my experience, when student teams pitch an entrepreneurial idea, they focus on social
media as the main way to market their product. But posting on social media in itself does not
comprise a marketing strategy. Social media is but one tactic or tool in a much larger toolbox.
And the tools you employ should be tied to your venture's business goals and marketing
strategy, with some eye to the resources you have to deploy.

Paid Social Media

Why pay to reach your audience through social media networks? When you pay, you reduce
the chance your efforts will be ineffective. For instance, by paying to advertise on these
networks, you can ensure that your content reaches a larger audience, reaches more of the
right niche audience or gets the right audience to engage with your content, if that's your goal.
Sometimes, you even get better analytics to track the effectiveness of your efforts.

Social advertising offers important advantages over conventional advertising:

        It lets you target a niche audience. It leverages the social network's data about its users
          to show your ad only to the people most likely to care about your product, rather than
          the most eyeballs.

        It's usually far less expensive than other types of advertising.
        It often allows you to pay only for the people you reach or engage (depending which

          you choose to optimize your ad for), so there is less waste.
        It gives you clear data and analytics about how your ad performed and lets you A/B

          test different variables-paid social will show you everything from the numbers of
          people who saw it and the actions they took on it to the ad variation they preferred.
          This allows you to optimize your efforts and minimize your expenses in the future.

Social media outlets typically let you choose which goal to pursue with your advertising, which
can include:

        Get people to your website.
        Get people into your physical location.
        Get people to buy something from you.
        Build your email list.
        Get people to subscribe to other content you offer.
        Increase your followers, or followers of a certain demographic.
        Target your competitors' followers and bring them into your fold.
        Get people to engage with your content.
        Generate leads.
286 ELIZABETH MAYS

        Target a very specific niche.
        And more.

Across most networks, when placing a social ad, you can choose between goals of reach,
engagement or conversion. You will be charged accordingly:

        CPM, the cost per 1,000 views, is a measure of reach. This is great if you care mainly
          about awareness.

        CPC, the cost per click, is a measure of engagement. This is a better metric if you
          want people to go to a specific link. However, if your website or landing
          page-wherever you send people from the ad-isn't set up well to get people to move
          down your funnel, this is a waste.

        CPA, the cost for an action that you specify, is a measure of conversion. This could
          include buying something, downloading an app, signing up, or similar.

When Brands Go Social

Social media has a down side too. Whenever you use it as a brand, you should think, "Who
might not appreciate this message I'm going to put out?" And think about how those parties
might co-opt your content to put out a counternarrative. You should also ask yourself, "Is there
anything remotely potentially offensive in this piece of fun creative content I'm about to do?"

Perhaps you heard about Dove's recent ad fail--a campaign on Facebook depicting a black
woman turning white--and its mea culpa afterward.4

Or Ghost in the Shell's backfired viral marketing campaign. The movie put out a hashtag and
an image generator to encourage fans to make "I am Major" images that identified with the
main character. However, people ended up using the hashtag and generator to call attention to
what they saw as whitewashing on behalf of the movie, which cast a white woman in an Asian
role, and renamed the character.5

Testing, Measuring and Iterating

Once you've executed your strategy, it's important to determine whether it was successful, and
how it might be adjusted in the future to better meet your goals.

This is where analytics come in to answer questions like which blog post topics or story topics
performed better, which brand imagery did people respond best to, and which CTA (call to
action) messaging was most effective in getting people to sign up / subscribe / etc.?

Here are just a few things you can and should test on your landing pages, in your marketing
emails, on social, and in paid advertising:

        Text
                                                       MARKETING YOUR VENTURE TO AUDIENCES 287

 Visuals
 Headlines
 CTAs
 The relative performance of different landing pages

So how do you measure the effectiveness of your content efforts? Read on! The next chapter,
Marketing Your Venture: Engagement & Analytics,6 goes further into depth on how to set
goals and objectives, measure success, and decide which analytics make the most sense to track
and care about.

MARKETING YOUR VENTURE:
ENGAGEMENT AND ANALYTICS

Jessica Pucci

Far too often, entrepreneurs focus squarely on conversion and forget about the rest of the
funnel.1 It can sound tempting to measure the success of your business solely by tickets sold,
apps downloaded or T-shirts shipped. But evaluating a venture that way neglects the value and
impact of your audience--the audience you have now, and the audiences you want but don't
have yet. Is your company really successful if it sells 750 hats at a music festival? To really
say one way or the other, you'd need to know what your audience opportunity was first: Did
1,000 people attend the festival (if so, you sold hats to 75% of them, and that's excellent!), or
did 50,000 people attend (if so, you sold hats to only 1.5% of them, and that's not so excellent,
assuming everyone at the festival had a head)? And what about the 200 festival-goers who came
to browse your hat booth but didn't buy anything... yet? What about the 450 attendees who
saw your hats around the festival and started following your brand on Instagram? Shouldn't
we include them when we tally up our successes? Don't they count for something?

Your job as an entrepreneur is not just to make a single sale: It's to build relationships with
audiences who will grow your company. Focusing on a one-time sale will get you just that: one
sale. But focusing on audience development--strategic growth and engagement of likely, long-
term customers--creates a sustainable business.

Growth and engagement go hand-in-hand. Tomatoes don't just grow: They need a particular
patch of dirt with at least six hours of sun; they need a trellis; they need regular water, pruning
and support--and that's just tomatoes. Other veggies need different care. The point is, you
don't toss down some seeds and expect a harvest. Growth takes research, planning, hands-
on care, and recognition that no two crops need the same thing. Gardening isn't so far from
digital audience growth. Just like produce, digital audiences are all different, and all require
different forms of nurturing and nourishment to thrive. The way we feed and care for our
digital audiences is engagement.

Engagement

Broadly, entrepreneurs and marketers use the term "engagement" to capture the many ways
                                                                                                                                     MARKETING YOUR VENTURE 291

people and organizations identify, listen to, interact with, and activate digital audiences. When
a company states it wants to "ramp up engagement," it usually wants to increase discussion
and activity around its brand, content or product. When a company hires an "engagement
manager," it usually intends for that person to manage the connections to and conversations
with its audiences, on digital platforms or otherwise.

More specifically, however, engagement is defined as any action taken on digital content.
A tweet, for example, is a piece of digital content; engagements with tweets include likes,
retweets, and replies. A page on a website is a piece of digital content; engagements on
web pages include scrolls, clicks, taps, video views, cursor or mouse movements, and form
submissions.

Music is digital content, too; engagements include downloads and listens. All of these
engagements are tangible and quantifiable. When we speak of "engagement" in the general
sense, we can include face-to-face community outreach, magazine ads, and garage-sale
posters. When we talk about "engagement" in the digital sense, we're referring only to
measurable content interactions.

Most organizations recognize that digital engagement is a critical marketing channel, though
not all companies engage well. To work effectively--that is, to not only increase conversions,
but to build a thriving customer pipeline--engagement has to occur at every stage of the
funnel, and every stage requires strategy. Businesses should engage with users who are new to
their brand differently than they engage with customers who have been brand-loyal for years.
Companies selling baby products should engage with customers differently than a political
organization engages. Here are four examples of companies with vastly different identities
using digital engagement to achieve organizational success:

Engagement Example 1: Brand Discovery

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWam9YmDzTI/?taken-by=minimalistbaker

Your audience can't engage with you until they know you exist, and brand discovery is one
of the things Instagram does best. Here, the gluten-free food blogger Minimalist Baker, aka
Dana Shultz, is showing off a vegan taco recipe. Shultz wants to sell cookbooks, of course,
but she knows that to do that, she must first build awareness and authority within the food
content market by forging and nurturing relationships with audiences who enjoy eating and
looking at pretty pictures of food. Shultz has almost 1 million followers, but even a robust
Instagram account isn't likely to directly drive too many users to her blog, or to Amazon to buy
her book. It is likely to reach Shultz's target audiences: people who like to cook, particularly
vegan and gluten-free folks. Users will discover the Minimalist Baker account if someone they
follow mentions @minimalistbaker, but more likely, they'll discover the brand by clicking a
hashtag in another post--say, #tacos. If someone I follow shares a photo of family taco night
and uses #tacos, I may tap that hashtag to see more tacos... and then I'd see @minimalistbaker's
292 JESSICA PUCCI

droolworthy photo. As soon as I tap it, I'd find myself suddenly aware of the Minimalist Baker
brand. From here, any action I take is an engagement. If I like, save, or comment on any
Minimalist Baker post, that's an engagement. If I share a Minimalist Baker post with my sister,
that's an engagement. If I tap another hashtag--say, #vegan--on any Minimalist Baker post,
or if I click on the link in her profile, those are engagements, too, even though performing
those actions take me away from Minimalist Baker. None of those engagement actions made
Minimalist Baker any money. There were no conversions in this scenario. But what did happen
is that I became aware of the Minimalist Baker brand, and perhaps I began to take some
small actions with the brand's content, which officially makes me part of the Minimalist Baker
audience, at the top of the Minimalist Baker funnel.

Engagement Example 2: Content Consumption

This image is linked to, not embedded. It is not CC BY.
Here, online magazine Slate wants something a bit more than the typical social media
engagement. Slate produced a story about lab-grown meat that the company would like its
audience to read. But they can't see the story in Facebook--they have to click. So Slate
                                                                                                                                     MARKETING YOUR VENTURE 293

combined an eye-catchingly bizarre image with a text hat-trick of novel post, practical
headline, and a story description that teases the story (but doesn't tell all!) to persuade users
who view this post to click the cow for more. Now, Slate would absolutely love for readers
to like, comment about, and share this article within Facebook--those engagements are great,
because they help put this story in front of more people--but it's also very important to the
organization to get users to take the specific "click" engagement action. Doing so brings the
user away from Facebook and onto Slate.com, which brings that user further down Slate's
funnel toward conversion. (Conversion, for Slate, may be subscriptions to SlatePlus, its
membership-only content experience.)

Engagement Example 3: Group Discussion

https://www.facebook.com/groups/yourmoneyandlife/
NPR hosts a personal finance podcast called Your Money and Your Life, but the star of the
show might just be its corresponding Facebook group of the same name. Originally intended
as a forum where listeners could ask questions and swap ideas (and NPR could promote the
podcast), the group has taken on a life of its own and boasts more than 30,000 members.
Within the group--which anyone can join--members join in rich discussions on money advice,
credit scores and retirement planning. NPR still shares podcast episodes within the group,
but some of the group's loudest conversations have nothing to do with NPR2... which is
fine by NPR, because all of the engagement happens within an NPR-created and -facilitated
environment. Robust online communities--just like offline groups--are excellent spaces to
create or join as an organization. They're where you can listen, research, network--and build
a captive audience for your content.

Engagement Example 4: Video Views and More

                                        This video is linked to, not embedded. It is not CC BY.
294 JESSICA PUCCI

This video, a creative PSA on gun violence awareness with a shocking twist, has a clear
objective: raise awareness of the warning signs of at-risk behavior. But you only get that
message if you complete the entire video--and getting digital audiences to actually complete a
video they begin is no small feat. You may notice that Sandy Hook Promise, the organization
that created and posted this video, turned off comment functionality. So, truly, the only digital
engagements a user can make with this video are to watch it, like or dislike it, or share it. Those
are the only physical actions audiences can take. However, it's Sandy Hook Promise's hope that
engagement around this video will go far beyond those three digital actions: After watching
it, viewers can talk it about it at the dinner table, or initiate deeper discussions at school. And
hopefully, because of this video, a viewer may be able to prevent a violent tragedy. Those are
all engagements, too--and they may be more impactful than a like or a share.

Indeed, there are many types of engagement that are important, but not necessarily digital
or measurable: A shoe company can count when a user likes a Facebook post, clicks an ad
or actually buys a pair of sneakers, but the company cannot count when the shoes are worn.
Wearing a brand is engaging with that brand!

In-person engagement is valuable, too: If you see a band play, you may choose to download
their music, follow them on Twitter, or buy a ticket to their next show. You attending the
concert wasn't a digital event, but you and the band were absolutely engaging with each other
as they rocked and you listened. Reading a vendor's poster, seeing a choir sing, clipping a
mailbox coupon, and reading a paper newsletter are all forms of engagement. However, some
engagements are just easier to track--and thus, easier to grow strategically--than others.

Indeed, offline engagement is still alive and well. There's an entire discipline of marketing
dedicated to physical experiences; "experiential marketing" seeks to connect a brand to
audiences directly via physical experiences such as flash mobs, taste tests, competitions,
performances, art installations, and other events designed to evoke emotion and interaction.
You may have seen the 2012 viral video "A Dramatic Surprise on a Quiet Square3," which
captured an offline experiential marketing event. The cable channel TNT was launching in
Belgium, and to encourage audiences to feel drama--in line with TNT's tagline, "We know
drama"--the channel placed a big, red button in the middle of a quiet town square and waited
for a brave soul to push it. When the button's finally pushed, drama ensues! The bystanders
didn't know it was a stunt at the time, and you can see their expressions of surprise; it was
TNT's hope that participants in the marketing event would forever connect their feelings to
the brand, and that the campaign would grow its Belgian audience.

Even good, old-fashioned word-of-mouth is more important than ever: While academics have
tuned focus to digital word-of-mouth (think Yelp reviews, comments and sharing), offline
word of mouth can still grow and engage audiences. If I recommend my plumber to you in
conversation, that's engagement--and meaningful, high-quality engagement at that!

Engagement for engagement's sake is fine if engagement alone is your goal. But if you have
                                                                                                                                     MARKETING YOUR VENTURE 295

another goal--that is, if you need to get an audience to do or buy something--you have to use
engagement as a stepping stone, one that builds and ushers potential and existing customers
through your marketing funnel. It can be difficult to do all of that in a bubble: How do you
know if you're reaching your target customer? How do you know if all the time you spend on
engagement is making your organization money? For those answers, we turn to analytics.

Analytics

Digital analytics are the data organizations use to measure the audience's interactions with,
quantify the impact of and inform the messages of our content and brand. Analytics is a
collection of individual numbers called metrics that, when analyzed, tell the story of how far
our brand or content reaches, how users engage with it, who those users are, where they are
in the funnel, and when they take conversion actions. Nearly every digital activity can be
recorded and counted, and analytics is the quantitative and qualitative analysis of that activity.

Analyzing your company's digital performance is a critical step in understanding your overall
business performance; understanding when, where and why users convert and how they
interact with your brand adds necessary context to more traditional business data like revenue
and supply-chain analysis. Analytics also help understand how our products and messages
resonate with our audience, and suggest how to pivot our content to build stronger audience
connections. But companies also use analytics to understand how digital audiences engage
with their competitors--called "competitive analysis"--which helps businesses understand
why, say, one furniture brand outsells another. Marketers also use analytics to identify
audience opportunity. Before we ever start trying to feed audiences into our funnel, we can use
analytics to determine what audiences we should target for our funnel in the first place.

           Assignment: Facebook Audience Insights

           You can use Facebook Audience Insights-the same tool all companies use to target specific
           audiences in Facebook-to research audience opportunities.

  STEP 1: To access Facebook Audience Insights, you'll need to be an editor or an administrator of a
  public Facebook page (a page is different from your regular profile). Don't have a page? Make one! Visit
  facebook.com/pages/create and follow the directions to create a page of your own.

  STEP 2: Visit Facebook.com/ads/audience-insights to access the Insights tool. Select "Everyone on
  Facebook" from the initial options; this ensures you can research Facebook audiences from scratch.
  Right away, you see data that represents all Facebook users; at the top, Facebook explains that the data
  you see represents all 150 to 200 million monthly active Facebook users in the United States.
296 JESSICA PUCCI

  STEP 3: Make your potential audience more specific by narrowing it down. Instead of looking at everyone
  in the country, select a state. Type a state into the "Location" box in the left-hand menu; here, we've
  selected Arizona. Immediately, we see that the data changes a bit: Now, the Insights tool tells us
  that the data we're examining represents the 4 to 4.5 million monthly active Facebook users. You'll
  also notice that the demographic data has shifted; the blue bars represent data for Arizona users,
  but the gray bars behind the blue ones represent the same United States Facebook users you started
  with, so you can compare your new audience to the "typical" Facebook user.

  STEP 4: Now, narrow down your audience even further by selecting an age group, a gender or an interest
  from the options at left. Here, we've selected 18- to 30-year-olds with an interest in fitness and wellness;
                                                                                                                                     MARKETING YOUR VENTURE 297

  the Insights tool tells us that there are 600- to 700,000 Arizonans ages 18 to 30 who have indicated an
  interest in fitness.
  STEP 5: Now that you've identified a "target" audience, explore it. Stay within the Demographics tab and
  scroll down to reveal information about the lifestyle, relationship status, job type, and education of your
  audience; think about what learnings you can take from this to apply to your overall marketing strategy.
  Then, go back to the top and click through the insights in the Household, Purchase, and Location tabs.
  Which of this data is helpful to you? Do you notice any major differences between "typical" Facebook
  users and your niche audience?
  STEP 6: Finally, click on the Page Likes and Activity tabs. What other pages does this audience like? How
  can you replicate the success of those pages on your own? In the Activity tab, determine whether the
  audience you chose is more or less likely to engage on Facebook in the following ways. How can you turn
  these insights into action and audience growth? Our sample audience tends to comment, like, and click
  ads more often than typical Facebook users; this is a good opportunity for an Arizona fitness company!

Most of the digital metrics available to analyze can be parsed into two buckets: reach metrics
and engagement metrics. Generally, reach metrics explain how widely a piece of content (or
a website, or an entire brand or message) was distributed and to whom, while engagement
metrics explain how users interacted with that content once they saw it.
Social media metrics make for easy examples. To analyze the performance of a single tweet, we
first have to understand its reach: How many times did Twitter serve it to users? How far did
it "go"? That data, then, puts engagement metrics in context. What did users do with the tweet
once it was shown to them? In twitter, and across most other social networks, the following
core reach and engagement metrics are at the heart of social media analytics:

        Reach: Reach defines the number of accounts or users a piece of content was served
          to.

        Impressions: Impressions represent the number of times a social network has served
298 JESSICA PUCCI

          a piece of content to its users. One person can see a single Instagram, say, four times;
          that's four impressions, but a reach of only one.
        Engagements: Social media engagements are any action taken on a piece of social
          content. Likes, retweets, shares, comments, taps, video views, poll responses--all of
          these are engagements.
        Engagement rate: Divide the total number of engagements by the total number of
          impressions for an engagement rate, which describes how "engaging" a piece of
          content is. In other words, engagement rate describes how likely users are to interact
          with the given content.

Site and app data are quite different than social metrics, but they're close cousins. Just as we
can divide social content into "reach" and "engagement" boxes, we can do the same with site
and app metrics--the numbers are different, but they still help us organize our thinking and
analyses around to who is receiving our content and what they're doing with it. To understand
who our site content or app reaches, organizations examine metrics such as:

        Pageviews: A pageview is counted when a user visits a page. It's that simple! Be
          careful, though: A pageview is not a user. One person or one user can view a page
          more than once, and visit several different pages.

        Unique pageviews: Technically, Unique Pageviews (or "uniques") are the number of
          sessions during which a specified page was viewed at least once. Uniques are not
          synonymous with "people" or "users"; one person can view a page on a laptop and the
          same page the next day using a mobile device... that's two unique pageviews, but only
          one user.

        Sessions: A session is a single visit to your site or app; it's the group of interactions
          made by a single user within a given time frame. A single session can contain multiple
          pageviews, clicks, events, transactions, and more. Knowing how many sessions or
          visits our audience initiates is a critical piece of the puzzle:

        Video views: A video view is counted whenever a user clicks "play" on a digital
          video--or when a social network or video platform auto-plays a video.

        Geography: Are your users actually from the state, region, or country you hope to do
          business in? Geography reports help explain whether the people interacting with your
          content are in your target markets.

        Device: If you know what kind of device--desktop, mobile, or tablet--your audience
          uses to access you, you can better tailor your website's design and content to their
          needs.

        Source: Knowing your audience's acquisition source--or where your site or app
          traffic comes from--is as important as knowing who's showing up. Users can access
          your site by typing the URL into a browser or clicking a bookmark, or they can find
          your site via a search engine, a tweet, a Facebook post, an ad, an email, or a link on
          another website. Source breakdowns tell organizations which of these avenues are
                                                                                                                                     MARKETING YOUR VENTURE 299

          driving users to particular pages, which helps organizations understand where to
          spend their marketing energy.

Understanding who is getting to our site or downloading our app with those reach-related
metrics is a critical step in evaluating digital performance--not only do they provide
interesting business insights alone, but they set the stage for many other metrics, including
engagement metrics. We can't begin to understand, for example, how many users abandoned
an ugly web page until we first know how many people arrived there. Sessions, pageviews,
and unique pageviews--as well as segments of those, such as mobile sessions, or pageviews
acquired by search engines--are building blocks for engagement metrics that explain how
users behave with digital properties once they get there. Engagement or behavior metrics
include:

        Average time on page: Time on page metrics help marketers understand how long
          users spend on each piece of content. It's often safe to assume that the more time
          users spend on a page, the more highly engaged they are with that page's content;
          therefore, time on page (and, similarly, session time metrics) are good indicators of
          how engaging content actually is.

        Entrances: Entrances are the number of times users entered a site or app through a
          particular page; in other words, entrances represent the number of sessions for which
          the specified page was the first page in a session. It's one thing for people to view a
          page at some point during the course of a session, but it's quite another for a user to
          actually arrive at the site on a particular page. Entrances help organizations
          understand what products (or blog posts, or photos) attract users to the site or app in
          the first place.

        Exit rate: Close to (but not exactly) the opposite of entrances, exit rates tell the story
          of pages in terms of how often they exit. To calculate exit rate, analytics platforms
          divide the number of exits from a page by that page's total pageviews. Essentially, exit
          rate is a measure of how likely users are to leave a site from the given page.

        Bounce rate: A bounce is a session that includes only a single page-sessions in which
          users reached a single page and clicked no further. The bounce rate, then, is the
          number of these single-page sessions divided by all sessions; the quotient is the
          percentage of sessions that only viewed a single page.

        Conversions: Think back to your digital marketing funnel. A conversion is the action
          users take that moves them from potential customer to actual customer. Sometimes
          the point of conversion is a completed sales transaction, but other times it's an app
          download, a form submission, a series of steps taken--say, viewing four articles.
          Marketers can configure their analytics program to report on when and where most
          conversions take place.

        Completion: Just because a user arrives on a web page or plays a video does not mean
          they'll consume every word or frame of content. Completion tells us how many users
          watched through to the very end of a video, or scrolled all the way down to the
300 JESSICA PUCCI

          bottom of a page. When completions are divided by pageviews or video views, the
          metric becomes a "completion rate," which suggests how likely the audience is to
          complete the content.

Alone, any of these metrics can reveal snippets of content performance: How many times that
Instagram post was seen, how many users downloaded that app, how long they watched that
video. But taken together, they tell the audience narrative. Individual metrics combine in the
art and science of audience analytics to help organizations reach their goals efficiently--and
identify who to reach next.

the public, and assess results and outcomes. These products should also reflect an
organization's commitment to ethics and its responsibility to the audience. Those who manage
digital products must possess a combination of communication skills and technology savvy,
as well as demonstrate innovation, leadership, strategy, and creativity. This chapter explores
the emerging role of product management as it specifically relates to journalism and media
companies.

PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR
JOURNALISTS

by Cindy Royal

  INSTRUCTOR NOTE: This chapter was added for fall 2018, and is not yet reflected in the print edition.

What Is a Digital Product?

The first step to defining the role of a product manager is to understand what is meant by
a digital product. With technology's influence, there are many digital products that a news
organization might be developing and maintaining at any time. In the 2016 research paper,
"Managing Digital Products in a Newsroom Context,"1 one interview respondent succinctly
articulated this newfound complexity.

"We used to know what a media product was. It was a newspaper or a television broadcast.
Now it's much broader."2

Stories themselves can be digital products when they have interactive or data components.
For example, organizations like ProPublica and Texas Tribune have made it their mission
to present and visualize data in the service of their stories. ProPublica's Dollars for Docs3
project provides an interface to explore financial contributions physicians receive from
pharmaceutical companies. Texas Tribune has developed projects that allow users to explore
state employee salaries,4 public schools 5 and Texas prison inmates. ProPublica and Texas
Tribune collaborated on the award-winning Hell and High Water6 project, which used
mapping and data to visualize the problem of hurricane preparedness, months before
Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston.

But interactive journalism projects aren't the only digital products a news organization might
develop. Some examples of digital products include:

        Mobile applications, like The New York Times Cooking app7
        Bots, like the Quartz app8 that facilitates a conversation with the news
        Special project and event sites, like the Hook `Em website9 developed by Austin

          American Statesman to highlight sports news about The University of Texas
310 JESSICA PUCCI

        Social media engagement products that solicit user input, like ProPublica's project to
          monitor online political ads10

And there are internal projects like content management systems, subscription services, and
analytics products that help an organization more efficiently manage their operations. These
are just a few examples of the range of digital activities managed by news organizations, with
new applications being introduced all the time.

Digital products require a different set of skills than those of a traditional reporter or editor.
The complexity and breadth of digital products have elevated the need for managers with
unique skills and perspectives. That role falls to someone with a product manager capacity,
whether the job title specifically states that or not.

Since 2016, articles have been written and summits convened on defining this new role
of product management role as it relates to journalism 11121314 The role of "journalist"
used to be synonymous with "reporter" and "editor." But now, a new realm of functions
and responsibilities has emerged in the service of digital platforms, products, data, and
engagement. These are roles as programmers and designers, social media experts, community
managers and data analysts, and those who manage and coordinate these resources. In addition
to managing the technical aspects of a product, a product manager must also be concerned
with their product's exact role in the strategy of an organization and its life cycle across social
media and other platforms, using data to inform decision-making.

Even those in more traditional roles in media organizations need to have a stronger
understanding of the product management life cycle. In "The Rise of the Journalist Product
Manager"15 Fontoura said:

"A reporter that publishes a feature nowadays needs to understand how that story gets
measured, how it's affected when it goes through a push notification, or when new
customization options appear on the CMS. In other words, how does technology and its use
affect that story?"16

Thus, a product management mindset for the entire organization is increasingly important.
The role of product manager broadly influences an organization's commitment to innovation
and digital culture, making it a valuable and critical function and an emerging career path.

History and Background of Product Management

The concept of product management started in the 1930s in the field of consumer goods
marketing, where companies like Procter & Gamble made brands the center of the
organization and developed customer-centric strategies.17 But product development was not
often included in this process, as consumer products were the result of the manufacturing
function. The focus of product management through most of the twentieth century was on
                                                                                                                  PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR JOURNALISTS 311

sales, promotion and distribution, using marketing to create demand for the products - toilet
paper, laundry detergent, beauty aids - these companies manufactured.

But product development eventually became central to the technology industry, causing the
development role to more closely align with customer needs. Product management connects
an organization's products to its mission and values. It has been a function of marketing and
engineering departments, but recently has become more central in organizations, with product
officers reporting to the top executive in many companies. New roles have emerged with titles
like chief product officer, director of product development, and product editor. Other roles,
like community manager and social media editor, have product management concepts at their
core. Where the product function specifically lies in an organization depends on the type of
organization and its product goals.

Product Management in Tech

Product management is an emerging role, defined by continuous innovation, particularly as it
is used in journalism. However, this is a fairly mature role in the technology industry. There
are courses, websites, books, and articles that describe the product management process.

        What it Takes to Become a Great Product Manager28
        8 Tips for Landing Your First Product Manager Role29
At its most basic, product management is the intersection of the user, technology, and business
needs of an organization (Figure 1). This role is typically an expert in at least one area, but
should be conversant across all three sectors to be effective.

                                                                         Figure 1. Image licensed CC-BY

This intersection of functions further emphasizes the need for a product manager to be
broadly conversant across an organization's activities. Product management represents a
unique role in media companies, where the business and editorial sides have traditionally been
viewed as separate and non-interacting functions. But the business and technology climate in
the media industry now requires organizations to consider how these functions relate to and
affect one another - how technology affects distribution, how users' habits affect profitability,
and how to best engage platforms in the service of both the business's and audience's needs.

Project versus Product Management

Sometimes the terms project and product management are used interchangeably. But they
are different roles, even if they are handled in some manner by the same person. Project
                                                                                                                  PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR JOURNALISTS 313

management is specifically focused on delivering project functionality - identifying features,
scheduling their execution, and making sure a timeline is adhered to. Projects tend to have
a defined beginning and ending. Product management encompasses the broader strategic
implications of the entire digital product and its relationship to the organization's overall
strategy. The function can also be described as product leadership or development, although
these are often defined as different roles, with product leadership referring to the management
of product managers and overall product strategy. Product development specifically focuses
on the engineering requirements of the product life cycle.

Methodologies and Processes

Design Thinking

A product manager is responsible for all phases of a product's lifecycle, from the conception of
the idea, through planning, development, testing, the launch and assessment phases, until the
product is retired. A methodology that is often used in assisting with the product management
process is Design Thinking, originated by the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford
better known as the d.School30 in conjunction with the creativity firm IDEO31 Design
thinking is a process by which problems are better understood and solved by listening to
and developing empathy for potential users. It provides methods for inspiring creativity in
a structured manner and quickly developing a prototype for testing and gaining feedback.
Design thinking employs various techniques, including brainstorming problem approaches
and quickly prototyping a set of solutions that can be tested with users. (You can read more
about this process in the Ideation chapter32 of this book.

                                                                       Figure 2. Design thinking process.

Agile Methodology

Another phrase often associated with product management is Agile Development. Agile
methodologies are characterized as more of a philosophy than a process, based on what
314 JESSICA PUCCI

  The Design Thinking Process

  The main purpose of Design Thinking (Figure 2) is to develop empathy for those affected by a problem or
  issue. This is best done by talking directly to those affected, rather than making unsubstantiated assumptions.
  Interviewing people and digging into their specific issues will allow for better solution development.
  One technique for better understanding a user's needs is the Five-Whys Method. When asking an interviewee about
  his or her problem, they are not likely to initially reveal their real issue. One must dig a bit deeper to gain a better
  understanding of what is really at play. For example, if the interview reveals that a person has trouble keeping up
  with local politics, one ask can a series of "why" questions to get to the heart of the issue.

             1. Why do you have trouble keeping up with local politics?
             I'm too busy to pay attention.
             2. Why are you so busy?
             I work a full-time job and have little time to read the news. It's hard enough keeping up with social
             media.
             3. Why do you use social media platforms?
             I check Facebook and Instagram to keep up with what my friends are doing and what is going on in
             my community.
             4. Why do you use social media to keep up with what is going on in your community?
             I like that I can check on my phone and easily learn about happenings at my child's school.
             5. Why is it important to regularly keep up with what is happening at your child's school?
             They have some funding issues, and I like to be aware of fund-raising activities.

  And so on. If the interviewer stopped at the initial problem of keeping up with local politics, one might make the
  assumption the respondent didn't care or was apathetic about these issues. However, with more probing, one
  might be able to assess a scenario that would make room in their schedules on platforms they are already using
  to stay abreast of information that could be important to them.
  The next step in Design Thinking is to define the problem. Using the interview data that was captured in the
  empathy phase, a problem can be identified and crafted into a How Might We...? Statement. For example:

           How might we use video in our political coverage?
           How might we better engage our audience around the issue of diversity in the community?
           How might we attract more young people to our products?

  How Might We Statements can be developed from the perspective of the user or the organization, but should
  always have user needs at the core.
  Once a How Might We Statement is developed, it is time to ideate. The ideation phase applies creativity in
  generating a range of ideas for a solution. The purpose in this phase is to quickly generate as many ideas as
  possible from people with a range of experiences and backgrounds. Again, these ideas should flow from the
  empathy interview phase. As an ice-breaker, a Design Thinking session may employ a few exercises that have
  nothing to do with the actual problem. For example, the first few sessions might focus on improving someone's
  "wake-up" process or generating ideas by drawing images that represent and build upon potential problems. There
                                                                                                                  PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR JOURNALISTS 315

  are many other techniques that can be used for inspiring creativity in brainstorming ideas. See the Stanford
  d.School`s Tools for Taking Action.33
  After the ideation phase, it is time to develop a prototype. A prototype can be a very low-fidelity representation
  of a solution, that can be as simple as a flow chart developed using pencil and paper. It can be a slightly more
  elaborate sketch that incorporates color and texture using art supplies. Or it can an interactive design created in
  a prototyping software program like Balsamiq,34 Proto.io,35 Adobe XD,36 or a mock up using a graphics program
  like Photoshop.
  The goal of the prototype is to quickly and cheaply create a solution that can be used to gain feedback from
  potential users. This leads to the testing phase where potential users interact with the prototype and provide
  feedback. Sharing the results of these tests across the product team will allow user input to be incorporated
  into each product iteration. With each series of tests, a more advanced prototype can be developed which will
  ultimately lead to working solution.

is known as the Agile Manifesto37 It values trust in individuals, completion of tasks and
responsiveness to change.

 Agile Manifesto

  "We are uncovering better ways of developing

  software by doing it and helping others do it.

  Through this work we have come to value:

  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

  Working software over comprehensive documentation

  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

  Responding to change over following a plan

  That is, while there is value in the items on

  the right, we value the items on the left more."38

Agile methodologies are designed to allow products to respond quickly to market needs and
changes by being iterative and incremental. Instead of a long, comprehensive development
cycle (traditionally known as the waterfall method), products are broken down into smaller
pieces or sprints, each creating a deliverable. Communication between product team members
316 JESSICA PUCCI

is usually handled by daily scrums, or short, stand-up meetings, that allow collaborators to
check in on a regular basis.
During a scrum meeting, team members specifically address only three questions: 1) What
have you completed? 2) What are you working on? 3) What would prevent you from
completing your next activity? Team members typically stand (no leaning!) for these meetings,
so that no one gets too comfortable, and they can quickly move on to their work activities.

                                                                                  Figure 3. CC BY

An agile sprint culminates with user testing that should lead to modifications for the next
sprint and be incorporated throughout product development. As with Design Thinking,
feedback from the user testing phase is incorporated in each iteration of the product.
Most product management processes adopt practices from both design thinking and agile
development. But the main goal is to remain spry, understand and respond to needs, and to
adapt to the environment throughout the development cycle.

Conclusion

As digital products mature, product management will need to be comprehended as a core
process and responsibility of media, as opposed to a technology sideline, offshoot, or
tangential activity. As media organizations receive increased scrutiny for the accuracy and
                                                                                                               PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR JOURNALISTS 317

Roles and Skills

With its overarching responsibility for aligning products across an organization's functions and mission, the skills
required of a product manager are broad and comprehensive. These are a few of the skills that a product manager
must demonstrate in order to effectively manage a product team.
Communication - First and foremost, product managers must be great communicators who understand and are
passionate about products and audiences. They must be able to lead cross-functional teams and communicate
with management across functions. They must also be able to speak to and learn from users to better understand
their problems.
Empathy - Product managers must also be able to exhibit empathy, not only for their products' users, but also
the various personnel with whom they collaborate in the organization. They must be able to understand issues
through others' points of views.
Leadership - Across a range of activities, the product role requires leadership ability to lead and motivate cross-
functional teams. That means working with people with different communication styles and skills levels, as well
as having a high level of understanding across a range of functions at all levels of an organization.
Problem Solving, Innovation and Creativity - Many of the functions a product manager performs will be
originated by that position, which means he or she may be the first to encounter it. There is not likely to be a policy
or another colleague to provide direction. With the constantly evolving technology environment, product managers
are expected to be comfortable and excited about finding creative solutions that can help the product team meet
its goals. Product managers must have an appreciation for the ways that innovation and creativity are employed
in the digital environment. They must look for new ways to solve problems and new approaches to understanding
users' needs. A product manager must also be able to inspire innovation and creativity in collaborators.
Ability to Execute - A key characteristic of a product manager is a bias toward action. Not only must he or she
generate ideas and strategy, but a person in this role must be able to motivate the team to execute deliverables
within established deadlines.
Technology Skill - A product manager should have strong technology understanding that allows for strong
communication across these key functions. While a product manager will not necessarily use computer
programming or design skills, he or she must have a strong understanding of the capabilities of technology and
be able to communicate effectively with engineering resources.
Data Analysis - A product manager must understand how to develop and measure objectives and be comfortable
making decisions based on data. They must be comfortable in working with metrics and tools for analyzing data.
Journalistic Ethics and Responsibilities - In a media organization, a product manager must also represent
the ethics and responsibilities of the media organization throughout the development process. He or she must
anticipate how a product will be used and affect the culture in which it is introduced. This is particularly relevant
in how an organization guides users in engaging with their platforms and how it uses and shares data generated
by their products.
Finally, a product manager must also recognize that their role is emerging and evolving and be able to adapt to
changes in technology, processes, and culture.
The role of product manager is a particularly relevant one for mass communication graduates to aspire to in
their careers, particularly for those with an emphasis on technology skills. Graduates of mass communication
programs who wish to one day become product managers should identify and learn about organizations with a
318 JESSICA PUCCI

  product culture, work on side projects that will enhance their understanding of digital products and processes, and
  demonstrate their ability to take initiative and exercise continuous learning.
  This area offers particular opportunity for journalism and mass communication academic programs to introduce
  product management concepts into curriculum. The PhDigital Bootcamp39, held in 2018 in the Media Innovation
  Lab in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Texas State University, used product management
  as the organizing concept in assisting educators in proposing and leading innovative curriculum.
  At Ohio University, the Digital Information & Innovation course uses product development to walk students through
  the development and startup of their own ventures.

truthfulness of their reporting, the digital projects they create will be expected to demonstrate
the same responsibilities and judgment.

The role of digital product management is being fulfilled, at least in some of the most
innovative news organizations, by the proliferation of technology products presented by news
organizations. The broad range of digital media products - websites, mobile applications, bots,
and data interactives - demonstrate an increasing complexity as related to news distribution
and audience engagement. There are several themes that newsrooms will need to address
in developing a product culture, which include the need to work in cross-functional teams;
an emphasis on empathy, problem solving and creating value for users; an attention to data;
and the need to recruit and develop resources with a combination of communication skills,
business sense, and technology expertise.

                                                            Exercises

               1. What are some of your favorite digital products and why? Identify the specific features that you
               enjoy about using these products. For example, what ways can you engage with the product, how is
               the product interactive, what is the value of the content, and how do visuals function in the product?
               2. Create a series of questions to interview people about a problem in media. Talk to at least three
               people about this problem, recording their responses. Follow up by using the Five-Whys Method for
               each question. What are the main themes addressed by each of the respondents?
               3. Based on your interviews, craft one of the problems into a How Might We...? statement. Using
               sticky notes, with one sticky note for each idea, quietly brainstorm for 3-4 minutes some potential
               ways to address the issues. In groups, discuss, review, combine, and categorize each of these ideas
               and vote on the ones with the most potential. Create a low-fidelity prototype (pencil and paper are
               fine) to demonstrate your solution.

FROM THE FIELD:PROCESS ENGINEERING
HELPED BUILD A REPLICABLE MODEL FOR
TWO STARTUP NEWS SITES

  NOTE: This sidebar was added for fall 2018, and is not yet reflected in the print edition.

  Kat Friedrich is a news editor at Yale University. She runs two startup news sites: Clean Energy
  Finance Forum,1 which covers the niche vertical of the solar power industry and the energy efficiency
  industry deeply; and Conservation Finance Network,2 a nonprofit partnership site that covers all
  aspects of ecosystem conservation from cities to oceans. She works at Yale Center for Business and
  the Environment, which encourages startup green business development.

  As an editor who had worked in web-intensive writing roles related to energy efficiency and science
  education, Friedrich was adept in web editing and online media. She had a master's degree in Science
  and Environmental Journalism from The Nelson Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But
  it is her project-management experience from a prior career in mechanical engineering that serves her
  most when leading the Clean Energy Finance Forum and Conservation Finance Network site teams,
  which have grown to 27 and 20 student staff respectively since their inception.

  Clean Energy Finance Source was created by Friedrich in 2012 for Clean Energy Finance Center, a
  national nonprofit. Yale Center for Business and the Environment brought the site on board in January
  2014 and expanded it extensively to include new technologies, international news, web interaction,
  and online tools.

  Conservation Finance Network's web news production began in January 2016 in response to a
  request from two graduate students, Meaghan McGrath and Logan Yonavjak, who were both at
  Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. The second site was developed as a branded
  partnership with Conservation Finance Network, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, DC.

  As she started the news sites from the ground up, Friedrich pioneered a reusable model for creating
  new sites that includes a replicable workflow for team collaboration and a project management
                                FROM THE FIELD:PROCESS ENGINEERING HELPED BUILD A REPLICABLE MODEL FOR TWO STARTUP NEWS SITES 323

system for news production. The web template for both sites prioritizes web usability and user
experience.

"The actual website template is one that we're reusing," Friedrich said. "Then we're also reusing our
processes. Then we're also reusing our journalism training materials. All of that can be used for any
new website that we decide to branch off with."

She was also systematic in building an industrial-engineering process for the content production
-documenting team workflows, developing editing checklists, compiling writing worksheets, creating
ethics guidelines, mapping marketing goals, and pursuing process improvement.

"If you have an industrial-engineering process, it's almost like you can visualize the product going
through the factory," Friedrich said. "You have different things happen to it at different workstations.
It moves along. The news goes here. The news goes there. The story idea comes in here. The story
idea comes out there. There's kind of a machine-shop aspect to how this is all put together."

Friedrich stays informed about online media techniques through her role as a local co-organizer for
Online News Association Western New England. Also, to learn from experienced editors about staff
management, Friedrich participated in a training at the American Society of News Editors Emerging
Leaders Institute in Chicago in 2016. This program helps news editors from underrepresented groups
advance in their careers.

Despite these reliable workflows and team structures, any news editor has to deal with their share of
good old-fashioned newsroom unpredictability and manage a full inbox.

"As editor of these sites, I'm continually catching new ideas and sending them here and there. So
there's an aspect that's like being a dispatcher for a taxi company where you will have a call come in
and say `OK, this taxi's here and now you need to send it there,'" Friedrich said. She dispatched taxis
in the evening during her second year of college.

Friedrich said a process-focused approach can pay off from a marketing perspective too, helping you
to track the performance of your content. She put a shared spreadsheet in place where the team
tracks when pieces get a signal boost or show high performance. She also watches newsletter, article
and report performance using various online tools. Every week, she observes coverage that similar
publications are doing. She also tracks attendance at the projects' webinars and events.

Friedrich said these audience-behavior analytics are a form of feedback on your news product.

"You have to be attuned to your audience in order to see whether your process actually is working
324 JESSICA PUCCI

  because if you don't have your analytics data in hand, you don't know if your process is working or
  not," Friedrich said, explaining that companies who manufacture products use product feedback to
  retool their engineering processes.
  Friedrich offered some recommendations for other editors who want to be process-efficient as they
  create startup news outlets:

         Start with a manageable and small number of verticals. You can expand to others later.
         Be realistic about assignments. Assess the amount of time it takes to do them right.

           Figure out manageable goals. Commit to your goals in a time-efficient way.
         Start with a manageable volume of content - and don't forget to budget time to promote

           it. "If you're producing stuff that's really good, and you're letting people know about it
           enough, you don't have to produce a ton of content to have a positive splash."

ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD:
CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL
PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES

by Betty Tsakarestou

Summary

In this chapter, we explore international perspectives in entrepreneurship, how the startup
"fever" captured the minds and souls of innovators across Europe and around the globe, and
how leading cities are growing as startup and innovation ecosystems.

While this section is titled entrepreneurship abroad, the preliminary chapter focuses on
entrepreneurship in Europe. (This chapter will be expanded to other continents for Version 2.)

We also look into how Silicon Valley has provided the prototype of scalable success and startup
ecosystems which others in the world have tried either to differentiate from or emulate. This
U.S. West Coast model built a world-leading innovation ecosystem attracting talent, funding,
and resources.

Media innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives and startups are presented in the context
of the broader global focus on entrepreneurs leading both change and solutions to global and
local challenges that impact twenty-first-century interconnected societies.

Activities will help you to take the lead in implementing and learning more from your own
experience and experimentation.

                                        Learning Objectives

             Gain a wider global perspective of entrepreneurship outside the U.S., with a focus in Europe.
             Learn about the key structural and cultural drivers that help or create barriers to building successful

               startup cities-based ecosystems around the world, with a focus on the European tech-startup scene.
             Learn the key players and stakeholders shaping and scaling up startup ecosystems across Europe.
             Explore what it takes to build an entrepreneurial mindset in regions with a weak enterprising culture.
             Learn current challenges and dilemmas that face different regions and cities in the world as they
               choose between inventing their own approaches to entrepreneurship or trying to emulate the Silicon
               Valley model.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL
AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND
CHALLENGES

Betty Tsakarestou

Journalists, legacy media, digital publishers and platforms, communicators, branded content
creators, and social innovators have reinvented the profession by creating and testing new
business models as niche and specialized journalism startups. In so doing, they have offered
novel news experiences and publishing environments, served underserved communities,
empowered contributors to build their own digital brands, offered more relevant content
to their communities, and explored new opportunities for audience engagement. They have
advanced new storytelling approaches with the help of big data; have integrated immersive
virtual reality and Internet of Things (IoT) technology; and have designed journalistic new
products and services related to key questions and challenges such as fact checking for non-
specialists, filter bubbles, and the impact of personalization of the Internet.

While in many European countries legacy newsrooms are still laying off journalists, online
publishers and some legacy media companies are revamping for growth and diversifying their
strategies by investing in digital startups according to a Financial Times analysis.1

"Following the examples of Time Warner and Comcast, European companies have sought to
structure their venture arms like independent funds - with partners judged on the financial
value of the portfolio companies, rather than on looser strategic value to the parent company."

At the same time, across Europe, journalism startups are creating the first "pockets of
innovation" by introducing alternative business models, getting public attention, and raising
or crowd-sourcing funds.

Take a first glimpse of some notable cases:

In Germany, Republik,2 an open-source cooperative digital magazine to be launched in January
2018, reclaims the role of journalism to reinforce Democracy. Republik co-founder Christof
Moser, a journalist and professor, succeeded in raising $2 million.3

Innovative Journalism Startups from Netherlands4 are focusing on quality journalism. Blendle
employs an "iTunes" model for news.5 De Correspondent6 is getting ready for its U.S. presence
330 BETTY TSAKARESTOU

while more media startups are taking tech press influencer Charmaine Li's attention: Piano
Media in Austria, PressPad in Krakow, Sellfy in Riga/ Latvia, Movellas in Copenhagen and
London, Ghost, ShareWall, ReadWave, and Reedsy in London, Liberio in Berlin. In Athens, Press
Project 7 is one of the few independent investigative journalism and data reporting startups
that fill the vacuum of failing legacy media.

When you look at the global heat maps of the emerging dynamic startup ecosystem, innovation
starts to be geographically and culturally diverse and unevenly distributed. We can get an
overview and a very informed perspective of the emerging and dynamic startup ecosystems
all over the world through the lens of Startup Genome the Global Startup Ecosystem Report
2017.8 In 2011 a devoted team of researchers, entrepreneurs, and data mavericks launched
the Startup Genome project. Inspired and driven by the mission to help building the
entrepreneurial ecosystem, they conduct and publish annually primary research with 10,000+
startups and 500 partnering companies to inform local startup leaders about success factors
to measure the ecosystem's lifecycle, to provide in-depth insights by continent or startup city,
and to produce a global startup ecosystem ranking.

Startup Genome examines nine factors that determine how cities become key players9 and
catalysts into enabling vibrant startup ecosystems:

          1. funding,
          2. market reach,
          3. global connectedness,
          4. technical talent,
          5. startup experience,
          6. resource attraction,
          7. corporate involvement,
          8. founder ambition and
          9. strategy

As the CEO of Startup Genome states in their mission statement: Startup founders are driven
by their pathos to create a positive change in our world, to participate in a world movement
and a revolution in search of innovative solutions, and to experiment with the new business
model canvases for making a great idea into an impactful service to people and to their
communities. This entrepreneurial ethos is representing a cultural shift about the potential
of startup entrepreneurship to bring positive change, to have a desirable impact by the
communities, cities, and people in producing solutions.

Says J.F. Gauthier, Founder and CEO of Startup Genome:

     "There is a revolution going on -- the global startup revolution. We are changing the
     world together. All of us startup leaders, and all of us working in different parts of
     the ecosystem. We are challenging the status quo, putting new ideas to work, and
                                                   ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 331

     holding fast to the belief -- the knowledge -- that anyone, anywhere should be able to
     participate in this revolution. The work of startup leaders in spreading this culture of
     meritocracy and equality is never finished and we are all helping each other, paying it
     forward, and expanding boundaries of startup culture."

and continents that are closer to your own interest and entrepreneurial journalism focus. The

Startup Genome Top Global 20 Startup Emerging and Established Entrepreneurial Cities and
Ecosystems

While Silicon Valley keeps its leadership above any other ecosystem, it is no longer the number
one pool of talent, losing its long-uncontested dominance over the Asia-Pacific region and
Europe. Government initiatives are playing a significant role in both Singapore and Beijing by
creating a friendly entrepreneurial business and cultural environment.11

According to Gauthier:12

     "For the first time we can all see the comparative strengths of Beijing and Shanghai
     with the rest of world. Beijing's amazing performance at creating large scale-ups is
     confirmed with its second place in our performance factor, and third place overall,
     but the lack of global connections of its startups was also clear. Shanghai takes a
     surprising eighth place overall with its strong early-stage funding, how it attracts
     talent and resource from all over the world, and how globally connected its startups
     are."

African startup cities are on the rise. Even though they have not made it to any of the
prominent ranks of the Global Startup Eccosystem report, they are competing for their share
in tech, innovation, and sustainable startup solutions. Cape Town in South Africa is the largest
startup ecosystem in the continent, which still needs to build up its global networking and
connectedness, followed by Johannesburg and Lagos in Nigeria.

Innovators and Startup Entrepreneurs in Europe: Are They Lagging Behind Silicon
Valley?

If you are a regular reader or visitor to TechCrunch, a leading technology website founded in
2005 to cover news about startup companies, founders and investors, then you might as well be
following a recurring topic, the comparisons of the U.S. and European startups and innovation
ecosystems. Back in 2010, Alan Gleason, a guest contributor to the TechCrunch European
startup section gives his theories on why Europe lags the U.S. in technology startups"13

Gleason writes as an insider, who has gained a considerable experience in consulting with
U.S. startup entrepreneurs. He asserts that there is an uncontestable structural gap, a disparity,
between the two continents when considering their capacity to enable and scale up globally-
successful technology-led innovative startups and develop tech giants like Google, Facebook,
YouTube, or Apple. He takes the Silicon Valley model (see sidebar) as the benchmark to assess
the dynamism and the potential success of entrepreneurial ecosystems that follow a different
path of development outside of United States. In 2010, the U.S. enjoyed a "semi-monopoly"
position worldwide in generating startup companies.
                                                   ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 333

Let's follow Gleason's analysis from 2010 about the structural and cultural triggering factors
that created this capacity gap for innovation in entrepreneurship between the U.S. and Europe.

Gleason identifies six structural and cultural factors that are at play:

          1. Location: Europe seems to lack the "hub network effect" of Silicon Valley's model
          as an ecosystem attracting innovating entrepreneurs from all over the world, venture
          funds, and top engineers. Europe has mainly developed "pockets of innovation" in
          metropolitan cities across the continent.
          2. Talent: Silicon Valley's model as an ecosystem that attracts a diverse pool of talent
          of innovating entrepreneurs immigrating from all over the world is compared with
          European mobility of talented and highly skilled people that in the latter case are not
          translated into a critical mass of successful startups.
          3. Market Size: Gaining traction as a startup and making profitable new product
          launches is considered a safer venture in the U.S. market rather than Europe on the
          basis of perceived cultural homogeneity (language, culture) and common currency
          versus a more culturally diverse Europe despite the fact the European overall
          population is almost double the United States' size.
          4. Support Systems: Compared to the West Coast ecosystem in the U.S., Europe lags
          in creating access to capital ranging from early-stage funding, seed and angel funds to
          venture capital funding rounds, along with a supportive business environment
          offering multiple options for legal and communication advice and professional
          services along with a pro-entrepreneurship strong media presence. Most notably,
          compared to the U.S., in Europe there are fewer investors and funding schemes to
          help tech startups go to market and scale up.
          5. Attitude to Risk and the "Fail Fast" Mindset: Risk-taking or risk-aversion is one of
          the most culturally debated issues in the startup ecosystems and hubs all over the
          world. The United States fosters a more entrepreneurial mindset, open to more risk,
          to experimentation, and to "failing fast." This entrepreneurial mindset becomes a
          pivotal point in Europe as it attempts to develop global reach and impact.
          6. Media: Media and blogs covering technology, entrepreneurship, startup news and
          innovation topics, founders and funders' thinking and methodologies have created a
          new positive and forward-thinking public imagery and culture that encourages new
          ventures and initiatives. Again, the most influential blogs mentioned such as Mike
          Arrington, serial entrepreneur and founder of TechCrunch or Jason Calacanis (who
          defines himself as a serial entrepreneur, angel investor, podcaster, and writer) are
          featuring the fervent U.S. entrepreneurial scene while Mike Butcher has been one of
          the more influential voices writing for the TechCrunch European section.

Another difference between the European mature ecosystems and Silicon Valley is that that
European startups are mainly (55 to 75 percent) B2B oriented while in U.S. the vast majority
(two out of three startups) are consumer-oriented businesses.
334 BETTY TSAKARESTOU

In conclusion, European tech startups and entrepreneurs must overcome some structural
limitations in three key areas:

          1. Take smart money only as an investment to scale and expand into your investors'

The European Commission Seeds Startup Growth

Even with the growth of entrepreneurial ecosystems across the European Union, many
entrepreneurs at major tech events such as the Web Summit question whether Europe's startup
culture truly exists. In "Does Europe lack a Startup Culture"?14, the authors compare the
dollars being transferred in the different markets, however, dollars may not provide a fair
comparison.

"Debating Europe", 15 a bottom-up platform co-initiated by multiple partners16 to bring
together European citizens' voices directly to European policy makers, published in December
2016 an infographic (see Figure 1) based on data issued by Eurostat, OECD, Google, and
Forbes. The graphic provides some insight into this recurring question.

According to this graphic: In 2014 venture capital investment in computer and consumer
electronics was more than $24 billion for the United States and $959 million for Europe.
This is the chasm that Europe anticipates as it rapidly builds its own startup culture. In
2015, five European countries attracted the highest venture capital investments in companies
developing new products and technologies, as percentage of GDP: Denmark, Luxembourg,
Finland, Ireland, and Portugal. Google for Entrepreneurs, a network of 40 tech hubs
worldwide, provides financial support, mentorship, and education to European entrepreneurs
and facilitates the access to a network of startup hubs across 125 countries all over the world.
From "Debating Europe":

     "Young entrepreneurs are quick to identify the factors holding Europe back. Lack
     of finance tops the list, particularly the venture capital needed to move from startup
     to scale-up. Then comes red tape - too many European countries impose too many
     regulatory and administrative burdens; Europe's digital-single market has failed to
     overcome fragmentation. Taxes are too high and too complicated. Then there are
     underlying cultural problems - from a multiplicity of languages to a fear-of-failure
     mentality."

To address the funding concern, during Web Summit in 2016, the European Commission
                                                   ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 335

announced a "fund of funds"17 designed to trigger at least 1.6bn in venture capital for
startups." The European Fund for Strategic Investments for small and medium-sized
enterprises18 is one of the many European funding opportunities to mobilize finance in a
collective and coordinated way seeking to reverse the low level of investment since the global
economic crisis.

     "The programme, which was presented today at the Web Summit, has been sponsored
     by the European Union and set up in cooperation with EIF. Under the Pan-European
     VC FoF programme EIF is looking to invest, using resources of the Horizon 2020
     InnovFin Equity facility, EFSI Equity Instrument, COSME Equity Facility for Growth
     and EIF's own resources, in private-sector-led, market-driven Pan-European VC
     Fund(s)-of-funds (the Fund(s)-of-Funds)."

Startup Europe

The European Commission is taking the lead in this global and networked-innovation-driven
world where entrepreneurship and innovators address and provide entrepreneurial solutions.
These startups are often aligned with the United Nations' 17 interconnected Sustainable
Development Goals19 (SDGs) to address effectively the challenges they entail "to end poverty,
protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity." These goals are at the
core of twenty-first-century societies for making positive and impactful change by 2030. The
European Commission, by actively contributing and supporting SDGs and the 2030 agenda,20
strategically positions Europe to pursue a leading role in the new reshuffle of dynamics among
global financial and tech robust players.

The twenty-first century international consensus advanced also by United Nations (UN)
SDGs seems to be that it is all about entrepreneurship and sustainable innovating solutions-
makers around the world. A United Nations "Solutions Summit"21 in 2015 brought together
policy makers, innovators, investors in the private sector, and civil society leaders, together
with technologists and scientists to partner and co-create impactful "solutions-in-progress."
Entrepreneurs and cross-disciplinary innovators are taking the lead across the world to
imagine and develop impactful positive solutions to the biggest global challenges.

     "Everyone has a role to play in advancing the Global Goals, and innovators and
     entrepreneurs are central to finding the solutions needed to achieve these goals," said
     Kathy Calvin, president and CEO of the United Nations Foundation. "The Solutions
     Summit is a catalytic gathering of some of the best and brightest who have developed
     innovative approaches to the world's most vexing issues."

In 2011, the European Commission initiated Startup Europe22 as a "One Stop Shop,"
providing information, tools, legal advice, and networking for startups in Europe with the
goal:

          Emirates, and India28

        To celebrate entrepreneurial successes by launching awards and other events such as
          Tech Allstars, Europioneers,29 and StartUp Europe Awards30

The EU response31 has prioritized catalyzing a risk-taking and experimentation culture in
Europe by launching the project "FACE Entrepreneurship" and EXCEL, a European Virtual
Accelerator to address local limits on access to co-founders, resources, expertise, and markets.

One of the key factors in forming successful and sustainable innovation startup ecosystems
that will incubate and support world-leading ventures is to establish strong synergies and
collaboration between the universities and the innovation startup hubs. Stanford University
and its role in building Silicon Valley32 has been one of the most influential paradigms around
the world, a benchmark that inspired both scholarly research33 and extensive media coverage
in the quest of replicating Silicon Valley model34 in other regions and cities in the world.

In Europe, a longstanding barrier to creating continental cities as startup hubs has been the
weak or missing collaboration between the academic community and the business-startup
ecosystems. The European Commission, by launching the Startup Europe Universities
Network,35 is aiming to connect academic institutions and community to the business and
scientific parks setting the framework for enabling collaborative forums, sharing of
information and resources, and catalyzing synergies and collaborations.

And taking a it step further, Erasmus+ Program36 provides more funding opportunities to
help teachers prepare primary and secondary pupils to be entrepreneurial and creative.
The Exchange programs for Young Entrepreneurs37 nurtures the entrepreneurial mindset at
an early age in an attempt to change the cultural paradigm to funding.

What might be the impact of combined institutional initiatives taken by the European
Commission38 to "Startup Europe" in creating a more innovation- and startup-friendly
environment? Through tax incentives, startup visas, legal context, and advisory services
infrastructures built by the European Commission, along with the bottom-up initiatives of
the startup ecosystem leaders, entrepreneurs and policy makers hope this European mix will
attract more talent, venture funding, and help create global startup brands. The European
Startup Initiative39 takes an active role in facilitating the debate around where Europe's
hottest startup hub is evolving by designing the first data-driven report on startup locations
and mobility in Europe as well as a startup heatmap on the perceived quality of the startup
hubs in Europe.

Cities as Startup Ecosystems

In the last decade, entrepreneurial ecosystems are proliferating across Europe. Cities such
as London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, Dublin, Manchester, Milan, and
Copenhagen were listed according to Social Media Week as the top "10 European Cities to
Watch in 2017". 40

These cities are emerging as pockets of growth41 in different European regions, competing
for the innovative local and international talent, for digital and mobile creative class, and for
investors' money.

A 2016 Venture Beat article makes a good point when it stated that "So While Europe Might
be a Single Market, It's Definitely Not a Single Tech Scene."42 This is a challenge for Europe to
invent and establish a sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship model.

Many of Europe's unicorn startups,43 a term coined by Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy
Ventures44 that describes companies that are valued at $1 billion or more, are based in
London. Collectively they raised $2.9 billion in 2015, according to London & Partners. "That's
75 percent of all VC money in the UK"45 and even Brexit has raised concerns that a startup
exit will follow. Yet, London still has a competitive advantage as it offers a lighter regulation46
framework. Analysts estimate that even post-"Brexit," London will continue to be one of the
flourishing startup scenes. Paris is emerging as the second European metropolis investing in
startups. The French Government has been the most active venture investor in small and
medium digital businesses within their broader strategy for digital "France 2030."47

Paris is getting ready to impress the world by revamping and launching in 2018 Station F48
(formerly known as la Halle Freyssinet), a 34,000-sq-meter startup campus and co-living space
with the goal to gather the whole entrepreneurial ecosystem in the same space. This ambitious
project seeks to create the "world's biggest campus."49

"We're talking about a startup campus because we're actually very similar to a university
campus," Station F director Roxanne Varza50 said in an article in TechCrunch. "We're expecting
about one thousand startups in this space."

The city of Paris and the French Government, not Berlin, are set to become the beneficiary of
any post-Brexit startup fallout, according to some analysts. The government is aiming to make
France a "Digital Republic"51 by supporting digital startups and providing the "French Tech
Ticket"52 to attract international startups.

Germany's capital Berlin has for many years been considered a European mecca for startups.53
The city has successfully appealed to international professional and artistic creative class
talent, converting this success into a booming startup hub. The city is a great example on
how to be "inviting" to international talent to relocate, by offering a reasonable cost of living
                                                   ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 339

combined with an open culture54 to learning, to experimentation, to change,55 to sharing
knowledge and to collaboration that can attract and retain diverse entrepreneurial and
creative talent. Compare this aspect of Berlin city culture to the rising costs of living in
Silicon Valley, where exorbitant housing costs make it inaccessible to new talent, whether
international or domestic. Berlin is also investing into lively community meetups that can
"help foster individual success." Government and political support56 created with a "grassroots
inclusive feel" supported by "The German Startup Association-The Voice of Startups in
Germany" 57 make the case for Berlin startup ecosystem.

Stockholm in Sweden58 is a new entrant in the startup cities world, earning a reputation as a
"unicorn factory" and in a league of its own with unicorns such as Skype, Minecraft, Klarna,
Spotify, and King. And who doesn't know MySQL, Kazaa, uTorrent, and Piratebay?

According to the article, "The country is leading the 2016 ranking in a number of industries, including
gaming, music-tech, and sport-tech, giving much bigger economies such as Germany, UK, Spain, Italy,
and France a run for their money."59

Looking at the South of Europe, Spain is becoming a considerable leading startup player, with
two cities in the forefront. Barcelona and Madrid are both attracting international investment
and global digital players like Google and Amazon who are establishing their presence in the
innovation-driven cities.

Besides the capital cities, we also see vibrant and scalable and high-performing ecosystems
growing fast in Lausanne (Switzerland), in Ghent (Belgium), in Krakow (Poland), and in Porto
(Portugal).

Will these distinct cities-based tech and innovation hubs operate independently or will they
become a collaborative network of connected hubs? This is a real bet and challenge for
Europe. We will have to see in coming years how these European "pockets of growth" across
multiple cities and regions will establish an entrepreneurship model that will fare and compete
successfully with the Silicon Valleys or emerging Asian ecosystem(s) as analyzed in Startup
Genome Global Startup Ecosystem Report 201760 and the Asia Startup Ecosystem61
accelerator.

If you wish to explore more in depth the commonalities and what differentiates the unicorns
from around the world, take 15 minutes to read a very well-documented post on Startup Grind
by Alex Stern, published on February 27, 2017 on "Revisiting the Unicorn Club."62 In it, he
covers all continents, all countries, and sectors.

The Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund (DNI Fund)

In an attempt to further explore the emerging media innovation hubs around Europe and the
corporate actors that take action to enable such an approach, it is worthy to look into The
Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund (DNI Fund).63 The fund is a partnership between
340 BETTY TSAKARESTOU

Google news publishers in Europe to support high-quality journalism through technology and
innovation with the goal to enable and nurture sustainable news ecosystems, collaboration and
dialogue between the tech and news industries. Among the founding members are prominent
legacy media companies such as The Guardian, The Financial Times, Die Zeit, El Pas, Les Echos, La
Stampa, and organizations such as Global Editors Network, European Journalism Centre, and
NRC Group.64 DNI Fund was launched in 2015 andhas invested more than 70m to more
than 350 projects in 29 European countries.65 DNI seems to have a quite balanced distribution
of its fund among the participating countries. As an indication, here are the number of funded
projects by country: Austria (9), Belgium (10), Czech Republic (7), Denmark (6), Finland (9),
France (9), Germany (9), Greece (7), Sweden (9), Switzerland (9), and the United Kingdom (9).

The DNI Fund Projects offer innovative journalism and media entrepreneurial solutions to a
wide spectrum of media-related challenges.

        In Austria, De-Escalation Bot66 is figuring out how to de-escalate negative emotions
          online.

        In Belgium, Wave67 offers interest-based listening experiences through connected
          cars, virtual assistants, and other smart technology devices. Likewise, in Greece, the
          Connected Cars, Connected Audience, News Ecosystem68 Project is a prototype
          developed at Aristotle University. It's investigating the ways connected and self-
          driving cars will impact news organizations. In Switzerland, NZZ Companion App69
          will provide personalized, geotargeted, niche news based on a user's preferences.

Media Entrepreneurship Education Around the World

One key lesson for building successful entrepreneurial ecosystems both from Silicon Valley as
well as from the European Commission strategy is to actively involve the academic, scientific,
and research communities as co-creators and enablers.

This is the path that many leading academic institutions in the U.S. have followed very actively
over the last ten years by introducing entrepreneurial journalism and media innovation
programs76 into their journalism, media, and communication programs to help students as
                                                   ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 341

well as to train professionals in entrepreneurial thinking, skills, tools, and methodologies...and
to innovate.

Initiatives to introduce media entrepreneurship compared to those in U.S. are modest.77 The
journalistic traditions in Europe that separate journalism production from the business and
market side of media companies are still strong in many countries. European academics are
still skeptical of the new "hybrid" and porous concept of bringing both editorial and financial
sides together into collaborating and re-defining the purpose and the impact of journalism.

According to one article,78

     "In attempting to create an overview corralling the various outlooks and initiatives
     related to entrepreneurial journalism in Europe, one thing remains clear: There is
     no common understanding of the phenomenon and its ramifications. Some view
     the transformation as a new window of opportunity for ambitious journalism, while
     others merely consider it a new name for the old game of freelancing."

In 2012, the entrepreneurial journalism U.S. educational model found its first early advocates
in Britain and Baltic countries' universities. Entrepreneurial journalism courses are offered as
part of journalism academic programs or professional training initiatives in France, Germany,
Switzerland, and the Ukraine.

As an indication of the growing international interest and demand for media entrepreneurship
education, a post on Quora, a question-and-answer, crowd-sourcing knowledge and
information platform, asks "Which colleges and universities offer entrepreneurial journalism
programs?"79

In response to this request, Pierre France, Quora community member, posts a document with
a list of entrepreneurial journalism courses offered in their U.S. Universities, with a few in
Europe, in Canada, and in Mexico (list updated 21 July 2014).80

 Greece: An Emerging Ecosystem

                               "Create more value than you capture"- Tim O'Reilly

  Athens, Greece, even though is not featured in any of the top startup cities rankings, has gained
  publicity for succeeding in building a vibrant startup culture and ecosystem in a crisis-ridden
  economy81 that has been retracting since 2010, despite a long period of political and financial
  uncertainty and the unemployment rate climbing around 25%.

  The last ten years, Athens has enjoyed the bottom-up birth, growth, and impact of enabling disruptive
342 BETTY TSAKARESTOU

  change and innovation out of the vision and the passion of a very small group of techies and bloggers,
  who are well connected locally and internationally with pioneering tech communities.

 Open Coffee Club Greece- Greek Startups Are Here82

  In 2007, a new generation of Greek tech startup entrepreneurs and digital innovators self-organized
  as a movement around the Open Coffee Club Greece to take action and support. Their goals were to:

         Create a network of people with common interests to support relationship building and
           collaboration.

         Cultivate a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.
         Spread new technologies with an emphasis on the web.

  Adopting the model of the global Open Coffee Club Network they kept organizing with great
  success.83 Monthly Open Coffee meetups in Athens bring together "nerds and marketers, bloggers
  and journalists, venture capitalists and developers, entrepreneurs and [public relations practitioners],
  who shape and help shape the Greek startup scene" and invite participants to "create [their] own
  network and become part of this new informal and interactive community."84

  These pioneers followed closely the three waves of the Internet revolution85 and the emerging
  startup movement and were familiar with the global debates and developments, particularly in Silicon
  Valley. They became the first ambassadors for disruptive startup innovation during the second
  wave of the app economy and mobile revolution (2010-2015) building their own startups. They
  purposefully collaborated, in a non-collaboration-friendly culture, to building a very active Athens
  startup ecosystem. They worked to connect the hubs of innovation and they launched the first
  funding schemes (Open Fund,86 Marathon VC87) and tools to enable the first promising local
  founders with the potential to scale their businesses internationally. They invested in building trust
  and social proof88 (a psychological principle marketers use to build trust around brands and
  products) as the most important currency for impact and success.

  Within a turbulent political and social landscape and an anti-entrepreneurial mindset prevailing for
  decades in both the political class and the society at large, Athens startup founders created a strong
  case of disruptive and impactful innovation where they were able to reverse the current attitudes and
  trigger a "startup fever" among youth, business, and institutions, followed by the reluctant political
  class.

  Startup incubators, co-working spaces and innovation labs, Startup Weekend events, and hackathons
  were initiated by startup founders, social entrepreneurs, foundations, philanthropic and cultural
  institutions, NGOs, museums, embassies (the U.S. Embassy and the Embassy of Netherland being
                                                ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 343

among the most active ones), business associations, international initiatives, digital leading
companies such as Google or Microsoft, and companies that invested in empowering young startup
entrepreneurship as part of their sustainability policies to spark innovation in their own sectors and
supply chains.

The majority of Greek startups are aiming to serve international markets and customers. The local
market is very small to sustain a viable startup venture that scales up internationally and has a
successful exit.

In 2013 TechCrunch Europe and its editor, Mike Butcher, held their second meetup in
Athens, showcasing how the Greek startup community could break the local financial and cultural
boundaries and enable some international players.89

     "In many ways Greece faces the quintessential problems of many European countries:
     plenty of talent, but a dearth of sources of funding for startups; limited markets at home
     and the difficulty of reaching out to large international markets like the U.S. Time and
     again panelists pointed out some of the obstacles that need to be overcome, such as
     a mismatch in university computer science courses with modern tech startups, and a
     moribund academic world. That said, it also acted as a showcase for success stories
     emerging from Greece that hope to show that there is plenty of talent just waiting to be
     unleashed."

In the World Bank high-ease-of-doing-business ranking for 2017 indicating if the "regulatory
environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm," Greece is ranked in the
56th position for starting a new business and fell to 61st for the ease of doing business.90

In this unfriendly regulatory environment, international media positive coverage of the successful
Greek startups91 with the potential to turn Greece into a startup hub has been juxtaposed against the
counternarrative of all the financial and political coverage about the prospects of the never-ending
crisis-torn country.

     "It's been easy to overlook Greece's tech scene since the country's recent economic woes
     eclipsed most of the other news," wrote Itai Elizur in The Next Web.

     "The debt crisis sent most businesses reeling, and, despite declared over in 2015, its
     negative effects still linger today. The rest of Europe still keeps a close eye on the
     government's management of the economy and unemployment still is at 23.6 percent in
     Q492 of 2016.
344 BETTY TSAKARESTOU

       But despite this grim outlook, I was pleasantly greeted by an energetic tech scene
       composed of ventures that aim to bring some luster back into Greek entrepreneurship.
       Greece has at least a couple of major tech success stories that they can be proud of."93

  "Could the Greek tech sector save the Greek economy?" asks Cate Lawrence, a contributing writer
  at Readwrite.94 How did we reach this high point of expectations of the Greek startup innovators to
  make such change ,and impact in a country plagued by one of the worst financial and social crises in
  her recent history?

  With an educated and innovative workforce, and great traction with angel investors through
  structures like EVEA Business Angels Network,95 Angels Group by StartTech Ventures Incubation
  Fund,96 and more recently by Marathon VC,97 it's clear that Greece's startup sector is healthy. With
  its reputation growing, we soon might see entrepreneurs emigrating to Greece to join the burgeoning
  tech scene. As a first evidence-based estimation of the size and investments in the Greek startup
  technology market for the period between 2010-2016, Marathon VC conducted a short study98
  researching available data from public and private sources to track the dynamic and potential of the
  market.

  The study shows that "the [Greek tech startup] market has grown to more than 40 investments taking
  place every year starting from 2013, with 137 companies receiving 214 rounds in total." As a general
  pattern they observe that "local funds and angels participate early, followed by international investors
  taking the lead in later stage rounds. This also suggests that, as more companies mature, more
  investments by international players are to be expected."

 Higher Education: Taking the Lead to Teach and Mentor Startup Founders on Media
 Entrepreneurship

  In 2015, I introduced a graduate course on Entrepreneurial Journalism99 in a newly launched program
  on Journalism and New Media at my home institution Panteion University. The curriculum change
  developed as a result of my participation on the Study of U.S. Institutes on Journalism and Media
  at Ohio University the same year, which focused my personal research project on developing a
  curriculum in the field after studying, benchmarking, and creatively adapting the best U.S. academic
  and training practices in this innovative field in my local academic and professional journalism
  context.

  In 2016, with the support of U.S. Embassy Athens and in collaboration with the Tow-Knight Center
  for Entrepreneurial Journalism, we organized the first Athens "Startup Weekend on Entrepreneurial
  Journalism"100 as a community outreach activity. We invited mid-career journalists in legacy media
                                                ENTREPRENEURSHIP ABROAD: CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES 345

and online publishers, communications professionals who are experimenting with introducing
intrapreneurial-branded journalism, and native advertising projects as well as university students.

Both initiatives have so far offered valuable insights:
       Value creation and the quest to make a positive change by engaging students, the startup
         ecosystem, legacy media, and online media into collaborating to imagine and design
         innovative journalism startups, proved a stronger transformative experience to overcome
         long-standing suspicious attitudes to entrepreneurship and to empower people to start their
         own journalism independent or intrapreneurial projects.
       The co-creation educational and learning model of inviting key stakeholders from the local
         and international ecosystems to contribute as mentors at the core of the program is
         creating an "accelerator effect" and a fertile environment where all partners and participants
         are sharing and testing new ideas.
       Local market conditions and academic cultures, despite harsh critics, have been proved to
         be more fluid and adaptive in embracing a bold entrepreneurial mindset and course of
         action as the way out of current financial crisis as well as the path for bold

MEDIA ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CHINA

       China is like a sleeping giant. And when she awakes, she shall astonish the world.

       -Napoleon Bonaparte, 1803

  By most accounts, China is considered one of the most entrepreneurial countries worldwide. As
  the second largest economy in the world, it is also home to 53 percent of the world's unicorns,
  a term coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013 that refers to startups valued at $1 billion
  USD or more.1 The combination of 108 Chinese unicorns in 2017 had a combined worth of more
  than $445 billion USD, a figure equivalent to the GDP of the world's 26th largest economy.2 Many
  of these rising unicorns are media and technology startups that are positioned to capitalize on the
  technological, socio-cultural, and socio-economic changes in the country. A report published in 2017
  by Chinese startup database IT Juzi indicated that there were 34 new Chinese companies that year
  alone, with media companies such as Kuaishou, Kuaikan Manhua "Quick Comic," and Luoji Siwei
  "Logical Thinking" dominating the list.3

  The rapid economic developments in China in recent years have fostered technological innovations
  that have allowed for a new wave of media entrepreneurship to emerge. While some represent efforts
  by the state to appeal to the younger generations by funding and endorsing new media outlets, most
  are business ventures created by media professionals or individual entrepreneurs hoping to reach
  unicorn scale by succeeding within the Chinese markets that cater to 850 million people under the
  age of 40.4 The high penetration rate of mobile phones and the Internet in China make it easy for
  startups to reach vast markets cheaply by tapping into the market of 731 million Internet users, and
  695 million mobile phone users in the country.5 Tencent, Baidu, WeChat, Youku, Weibo and Toutiao
  are all examples of explosive media enterprises that have witnessed tremendous growth in China in
  recent years. These platforms gained popularity with Chinese netizens, a term widely used to refer to
  Chinese Internet users, not only for giving them a platform to share and access information, but also
356 HODAN OSMAN

for enabling users to make money as well. These platforms allowed their users to become their own
entrepreneurs through multiple innovative methods.

This trend began with the rise of zi meiti or "self-media" in China, such as Tencent blogging in the
early 2000s, followed by the later formation of Weibo, the Twitter-like social media app in 2010, and
the launching of WeChat in 2011. While blogging spaces and Weibo accounts became important
outlets for civic engagement and political participation, the use of platforms such as WeChat opened
up the possibilities for users to make a significant financial income, turning their media participation
activities into profitable entrepreneurial ventures.

WeChat, which is currently the most popular messaging app in China, has a platform ecosystem of
over 200,000 developers and offers an ever-expanding range of services such as chat, voice and video
calls, social media, news, payments, hotel booking, and so on to its almost 1 billion monthly active
users.

WeChat was developed by Tencent Holdings, Asia's most valuable listed company with a market
capitalization of nearly $500 billion USD on the Nikkei Asian stock exchange at the end of 2017.6
Tencent, China's largest social network and gaming firm, rolled out WeChat in 2011 as a mobile-only
messaging app that would disrupt SMS messaging and work on any phone and any mobile service.
                                                                           FROM THE FIELD: TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CHINA 357

It first had only basic capabilities such as text messaging, creating voice clips, and sending photos.
Later on, it added features such as video clips and a "find nearby users" function. The app quickly
gained popularity and reached 100 million users in less than 14 months after launching, tripling that
number the following year to reach 300 million users in 2013. In 2012, the app added voice and video
call services, and opened up to national and international commercial brands by introducing public
accounts users could follow by simply scanning a personalized QR code. Soon after that, the app
introduced more value-added features including games, mobile payments, WeChat stores, and Mini
programs. The app now has more than 1 billion active monthly users, and is currently rolling out its
services worldwide in a plan to expand globally.

China is considered a mobile-first market, since the vast majority of its consumers joined the Internet
on a mobile device before a computer, an important factor that contributed to the popularity of chat
apps such as WeChat. However, one of WeChat's key elements of success was its deep understanding
of Chinese digital culture, which carries unique societal norms into the digital space. For example, the
platform introduced Hong Bao or "Red Envelopes" -- a traditional form of cash gifts in red envelopes
culturally considered auspicious -- in a digital format as a form of payment between users within
the app instead of normal transfers. Combining the traditional Hong Bao with digital instant money
transfers became one of the innovative approaches that gained popularity in the country.

With the convenience of online payment portals in China, and the rising number of WeChat users,
social networks became important e-commerce hubs. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent $31.3 billion
USD on digital content purchases, including novels, audio, and videos, a 28 percent jump compared to
the same period in 2015.7 To capitalize on the trend of social commerce, facilitating online shopping
with the use of user ratings, referrals, online communities, and social advertising on online social
networks, WeChat began to open up its platform for developers to build e-commerce stores as early
as 2014. By 2016, 31 percent of WeChat users were making e-commerce purchases on the platform
according to a report published by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mary Meeker.8 Some startup
companies embedded entire e-commerce platforms inside WeChat. WeChat Stores or "Wei Dian," an
interface akin to Shopify that connects to the menu of WeChat public accounts and allows one-click-
payments for WeChat users, became one of its most popular and convenient e-commerce platforms.

WeChat Stores allowed for users to build well-designed stores for free in a simple-to-follow process
that took less than 10 minutes to complete. And while it didn't allow for product searches like
traditional e-commerce sites, it had a successful marketing strategy of linking users from your
public WeChat account to your WeChat store. As such, WeChat's public accounts became important
incubators for emerging entrepreneurs and startups that began by featuring innovative media
products and services on the platform and offering deals and coupons for group purchases to drive
traffic to their stores. For example, Luoji Siwei, or "Logical Thinking," an online talk show anchored by
358 HODAN OSMAN

  its founder Luo Zhenyu, started out as a WeChat public account and successfully capitalized on its
  model. Eventually it secured investment from venture capitalists and completed Series B financing in
  October 2015, when it was valued at more than $460 million USD,9 making it one of the most valuable
  WeChat-born unicorns.

  Since WeChat's launch, media entrepreneurs in China largely used WeChat as a platform for their
  businesses instead of developing their own apps or websites. Startups such as Luoji Siwei conducted
  innovative content marketing by offering creative products, introduced by stories, in a limited quantity
  and time. It offered a daily 60-second audio from the host at 6:30 am every day, in which he shared
  interesting perspectives on common issues such as parenting. His WeChat store sold books and other
  products he mentioned in these talks to 3.5 million followers, and 30,000 paid members. Occasionally,
  Luoji Siwei launched very successful e-commerce campaigns, such as the Mooncake campaign
  in which 2.7 million people participated in a game that involved buying and receiving Mooncakes,
  popular festive delicacies shared as gifts. Later on, Luoji Siwei continued to expand his business
  offline by offering talks and seminars in popular cities with ticket prices as high as $2,200 USD as
  fans rushed to attend these activities.

  Another example of media entrepreneurship within WeChat is Uncle Tongdao, a brand that was
  founded by Cai Yuedong, a 28-year-old illustrator on WeChat. His Uncle Astrology cartoon series about
  the 12 astrology zodiac signs became an instantaneous hit as they combined the Chinese culture
  of Tucao or "sarcastically complaining" with the hip culture of astrology. Its success depended on
  WeChat's integrated ecosystem that allowed for multiple online and offline revenue streams including
  advertising, creating customized products, emojis, WeChat shops, and creating an offline presence
  such as setting up the Uncle Tongdao Cafe and Store in Shanghai, and organizing the astrology gala in
  Guangzhou where they sold products worth 2 million RMB (approx $317,000 USD at time of writing).
  On December 2016, Cai Yuedong went from freelance illustrator to millionaire after he sold 73 percent
  of his startup Tongdao Culture Studio to Shanghai-listed media company Meisheng for $25 million
  USD.

  When Tencent first launched WeChat in 2011, no one predicted that the mobile-only messenger
  app designed to reinvent SMS messaging would in less than five years grow to become one of
  the world's largest e-commerce and social media platforms. In China, WeChat eclipses many of the
  country's former social media giants such as Renren and Weibo, and within minutes of meeting
  someone new in China, it is very likely that you will connect on the popular app. Today, teachers
  communicate with parents through WeChat groups, and some companies even make important staff
  announcements on their public accounts, making the app an essential part of professional and social
  life in China. On the other hand, WeChat not only provides space to stay connected with people,
  it also offers essential services such as news and shopping. Today, we find a WeChat payment
                                                                           FROM THE FIELD: TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CHINA 359

QR code stuck to counters everywhere in the country as the app increasingly becomes a popular
payment method in transactions from buying coffee to paying utility fees. The app also continues
to provide entrepreneurs with innovative new ways of reaching customers and selling their products
and services, such as WeChat's latest Mini Programs-lightweight apps embedded within WeChat that
don't need to be installed, and offer a range of services from hailing rides and food delivery to live-
streaming, and coupons for group purchases. Since Mini Programs were launched in 2017, developers
introduced more than 580,000 Mini Programs aimed at capitalizing on the large potential of social
commerce on WeChat's network of 1 billion users.

Factors for successful WeChat entrepreneurship

Analysis of the above-mentioned examples shows that the success of media entrepreneurship
attempts on WeChat depends on the capitalization of the following factors:

         1. Monetization through multiple channels - WeChat offers a complex environment that
         combines social content with e-commerce, and allows for user engagement both online
         through social media content and offline through QR code scanning.
         2. Designing unique products - by designing their own unique products, entrepreneurs
         on WeChat were able to align their content with products and further enhance user
         experience and entice user interaction.
         3. Ensuring an offline presence alongside the online presence - keeping an offline
         presence through physical shops or events allows for a better user experience and a
         more strategic immersion into the daily interactions of users.
         4. Grounding a brand and product within the popular culture - the digitization of the red-
         envelope cash-gifts culture by WeChat, and how Uncle Tongdao playfully allowed for the
         culture of Tucao "sarcastically complaining" to combine with astrology zodiac signs, are
         both examples of media and digital innovations that are grounded within popular culture.
         5. Commitment to your original voice - in order to ensure long-term user engagement,
         staying true to your brand and original voice is key in ensuring user loyalty.

FROM THE FIELD: ADDIS INSIGHT - A
NICHE SITE FOR THE ETHIOPIAN
DIASPORA

Abel Asrat and Rediat Belehu

  NOTE: This sidebar was added for fall 2018, and is not yet reflected in the print edition.

  In January 2016, I started Addis Insight1 with the aim of becoming a leading digital media platform
  for Ethiopians across the world. Before starting Addis Insight, I had the opportunity to work as a
  Wikipedian In Residence and Google Student Ambassador, which gave me the opportunity to identify
  an area where I could express my passions. When I first started Addis Insight, I had two clear goals:
  1) to improve the quality and quantity of content that is available online regarding Ethiopia and its
  far-flung citizens and 2) to allow the younger generation of Ethiopians to tell their story.

  Six months after launching Addis Insight, I won a scholarship in media and communication to attend
  Ohio University in the Communication Development program. At the same time, I had to make a tough
  decision about Addis Insight. I was at a crossroads. I had to choose between incorporating Addis
  Insight as a company or letting it become a website that aggregates news from other news sources.
  That is when I met Rediat Belehu, a marketing graduate, who was willing to leave her high-paying job
  and join Addis Insight to run the company as chief executive officer and shareholder while I was out
  of the country for two years.

  Despite having no background in media and communication, our team had the determination to build
  a media brand that will give our audience insight across several topic areas. To achieve our content
  goals, we started out by reaching out to subject matter experts in different professions. We believed
  that many professionals in Ethiopia has not been given a chance to share their expertise. In Ethiopian
  media, you rarely see an architect, doctor, banker, investor, engineer, or athlete sharing their insight
  on topics in which they have expertise. As a result, we started encouraging people to share their views
  on our platform even if they were not journalists or politicians.

  Our revenue model was based on three strategies. The first was to target local companies to
364 ABEL ASRAT AND REDIAT BELEHU

  advertise on our website. Our approach is to show advertising customers that unlike radio, television
  and newspapers where they may advertise, we can provide them demographic details about the
  audience that visited and interacted with their ads. The second strategy was to partner with online
  ad publishers like Google AdSense and the Facebook Ads Network. Unfortunately, our website was
  flagged by Google AdSense after our website was spammed by Russian traffic. This resulted in the
  suspension of our ads for over a year. We are still trying to contact Google and fix the issue. The
  third income-generating model is to provide consulting through social media and digital marketing
  services for businesses and celebrities. This helped us to build strong relationships with people in
  the entertainment industry. Because of this effort, we have had more than 24 contributors from
  various fields and backgrounds, who have contributed a total of 170 articles. Ninety-five percent of
  our contributors are under 30, and 60 percent of them are women. The approach we used to attract
  experts to contribute to our website was to first identify a topic area, then research the social media
  profiles that are trending and driving engagement around it. For instance, we have a business section
  and for that we looked at people mainly on networks like Linkedin and analyzed the type of content
  they share with their network and the engagement they drive. After that we approached influencers
  and pitched the idea that they could gain more readers and create more awareness of the issues
  they are writing about by becoming a contributor to our website. Even where there was no monetary
  compensation, we explained the benefits of growing their brand profile on digital platforms. Where
  applicable, we also offered them an internship and recommendation letter. This approach really
  solidified our brand recognition through social media, as our content was shared by contributors who
  are influencers in their social media sphere.

  Political polarization between the government and opposition parties means that part of our society
  is excluded from getting stories that inspire them to become successful in Ethiopia. That is why we
  launched our "Made In Ethiopia" series. It features change makers in Ethiopia who are building the
  Ethiopian Dream against all odds. We also gave voice to the first generation of Ethiopian Americans
  to share their views about identity and their homeland. Some of the initiatives include the inspiring
  stories of the Yellow Movement, which supports and empowers girls by selling roses; the story of
  Hermella Wondimu, who built more than 27 water wells at age 28; the story of Abraham, who returned
  from Dubai and disrupted the car washing business in Ethiopia by using his car washing experience
  from Dubai. We also happily shared our platform to promote artists, creators, and technology
  entrepreneurs who wanted to gain the public's vote during global competitions. Whenever tragedies
  broke, we did our best to tell a story that would lift our country folk and makes us stronger as a nation.
  Last year after a garbage landslide at Koshe took the life of 115 people, we did an exclusive interview
  with one of the survivors from Koshe titled The Koshe Dreamers and it was among our most visited
  posts.
                                                                      FROM THE FIELD: ADDIS INSIGHT - A NICHE SITE FOR THE ETHIOPIAN DIASPORA 365

Lack of experience in the field of media and limitation of resources didn't stop us from pursuing our
dream. In order to sustain, we pitched our ideas to people who we assumed could help in filling our
gap. Our story and how young we are as a team inspires others to join our team. In order to solidify
our credibility, we seek media partnerships with important brands that are not already partnered in
Ethiopia. As a result we were able to forge media partnerships with YouTube, Music In Africa, and
the Ethiopian Diaspora Fellowship. But above all we built credibility because we really valued our
user experience and consistently improved our platforms and our visitors' experience. We are the
first media in Ethiopia to adopt Facebook Instant Articles and Google Accelerated Mobile Pages that
significantly saved data cost for users. We avoided the temptations of clickbait and refrained from
monetizing our content by misleading readers with headlines and sensationalized content that is full
of gossip.

Just one month after I came to America, the Ethiopian government imposed a state of emergency2
blocking all social media and restricting any form of public assembly. This was due to an ongoing
protest at the time. The social media blockade lasted for 10 months, and the service disruption still
occurs whenever there is any protest in the country. This directly affected our reader base in Ethiopia.
Also, people were using Virtual Private Network (VPN)3 to access our website and that distorted our
demographic geodata as the readers were rerouted to access social media websites from different
country gateways.

Our journey has never been easy, and we were able to sustain our business without making any profit
for the past two years. We had to convince advertisers that digital media is the next big thing for
Ethiopia even though we were not lucky to get clients as easily as we expected. We had to support
our business by bootstrapping and funding from our school stipends and with the generosity of
teammates who put in "sweat equity" and worked essentially for free when we couldn't pay salaries
on time. Even after living 16 months in the United States I didn't adjust my sleeping hours because
I had to operate in Ethiopia time (an eight-hour difference ) to help my teammates. I may graduate
with my master's degree in media and communication without my friends, but I make sure to share
my school materials and knowledge with my team so that we can all grow in my absence. Our dream
is so powerful that we had people like Sergut Dejene, a marketing strategist who left the U.S. to
join our team. When we hadn't developed editorial guidelines for our contributors, people like Hadra
Ahmed, a freelance journalist, extended a hand to help us. Full-time students and workers committed
their weekends and nights to make sure we don't lack well-researched and well-written content. We
always took the criticism of our readers on our grammar and content as constructive, and responded
positively and graciously. We even believe in collaborating with other media and we have learned
a lot from people like Tsedale Lemma, who is the founder of Addis Standard, (Addis Standard was
a monthly English newsmagazine print that suspended its publication due to challenges related to
366 ABEL ASRAT AND REDIAT BELEHU

  media law in Ethiopia). We get inspiration from her works and challenged ourselves to improve our
  content depth and journalistic professionalism.

  Because of our team perseverance and our devoted readers, we've now surpassed 500,000 unique
  visitors with 1.5 million views in the past two years. Currently we get 30,000 visitors per month.
  Despite having a steady growth of visitors, advertisers are hesitant to publish ads on the website. Part
  of this is due to lack of awareness about the power of digital media. But when our stories are picked
  up by global media, it gives us a morale boost that very soon the interest from local advertisers will
  rise.

  Finally, as we follow on our second anniversary, we have more than 120 people who have volunteered
  to become contributors on our website. Our next step will be to secure investment and a bank loan
  to invest in the human resources we need to operate efficiently. At the same time we are doubling
  our efforts to get local ads. Even with these milestones, two years in, we had to sell our furniture
  just to pay our office rent. But as I write this, we just secured our first website ads deal with a
  chocolate factory in Ethiopia. We are 100 percent confident that we will become the leading digital
  media platform in Ethiopia, and that is our New Year's resolution for 2018.

FROM THE FIELD: A SHORT HISTORY OF
SILICON VALLEY

Francine Hardaway

  What made Silicon Valley a Hub for entrepreneurs? And why has that become as much of a liability
  as an advantage?

  Silicon Valley grew up in the area between San Jose, California, and San Francisco as a result of
  Frederick Terman, the legendary dean of Stanford engineering school during the 1940s and 1950s.
  He created the tradition of Stanford faculty starting their own companies. A number of companies
  we still reference came out of Stanford during those years, especially Hewlett Packard and Varian
  Associates.

  The transistor was invented and manufactured in Silicon Valley, which gave the area a leg up in the
  radio and telegraph industries. And the Navy had a base in Sunnyvale. By 1957, Russia's success
  with Sputnik unleashed a big space competition, and the U.S. government founded NASA. At the time
  NASA opened at Moffett Field near San Jose, the only company able to build electronics for the space
  capsule was Fairchild Semiconductor.

  The legend of Silicon Valley from the beginning of the transistor industry is well-known and has been
  written about and documented.1 Most of the Valley's early success came from either components
  like Silicon chips (from which the Valley got its name) or the hardware into which the chips were
  placed.

  It's actually fun to learn about the Valley's history, because the lesson is that the beginning of Silicon
  Valley was all about men and women, engineers, who had ideas out of science fiction about what
  technology could enable. Many of those ideas have now come true, like the personal computer and
  the iPhone, both envisioned by Steve Jobs. And we now wear what was once envisioned in a comic
  book as the "Dick Tracy wrist radio"-the Apple Watch.

  Early engineers were not after money, they were about making things possible that had never been
  possible before, such as space travel. As a result, they received both government grants and venture
  capital. Before venture capital became a "thing," it originated from the financial centers like New York.
                                                                                                 FROM THE FIELD: A SHORT HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY 369

Arthur Rock, for example, was an early investor in Intel, Apple, and Scientific Data Systems. The first
Bay Area venture capital firms, who located on Sand Hill Road adjacent to the Stanford campus, were
Kleiner, Perkins Caulfield and Byers, and Sequoia Capital.

If you are interested in the history of Silicon Valley, you might want to watch the HBO show Silicon
Valley, which tells you everything you need to know about where Silicon Valley is in the present, and
also the fourth season of AMC's Halt and Catch Fire, which can take you from the 1980s to the rise of
the World Wide Web.

We have now reached the point where Silicon Valley is a rich ecosystem where everyone with an idea
eventually shows up because it's possible to sit in a coffee shop and form a team, raise some money,
and get started. Numerous accelerators, such as Y Combinator make it easy to get a start, and the
cost of starting a company has come down significantly due to Amazon Web Services (cloud-based
infrastructure) and software development tools and frameworks.

However, we're also reached the point where Silicon Valley is a self-parody, with all the downsides
of its own success: race, age, and gender discrimination, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide and
depression.2 Its "win at all costs mentality" has spawned excesses of every variety.

Not to mention the fact that it is now possible to start a company anywhere, especially near a
university. Let's give Silicon Valley credit for establishing a culture of entrepreneurship, which is really
a culture of resilience, and then understand that for digital media, it's not Paradise.

A Collaboratively Created Open Textbook

This open textbook was built through a collaborative, grassroots effort of many educators
in j-entrepreneurship, with project support from the Rebus Community for Open Textbook
Creation.1 There are numerous contributors to this, version 1.0, whom we would like to
acknowledge and to thank.

Dr. Michelle Ferrier, president of Journalism That Matters and an associate professor in the
E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University; and Elizabeth Mays, operations and
marketing manager for Rebus Foundation and adjunct faculty at Arizona State University,
instigated and served as editors on the project.

Others, including Ebony Reed, and Daniel Zayas, provided interviews for the book. And
Cheryl Cuillier, OER coordinator at the University of Arizona, helped to flesh out the (still-
growing!) spreadsheet of foundations and contest funding for j-startups.

We would be remiss if we neglected to mention all those who volunteered to copy-edit
chapters of the book, including Leanne Page, Mary Brunskill, and Jay Hartwell. (Peer
reviewers will also be credited as a group here once we know all those who participated.)
Finally, a thanks to the students and faculty who are beta testing the book in Fall 2017 and will
help us improve it for the official release in January 2018.

Apurva Ashok, with help from Zoe Wake Hyde, formatted and designed the book using
Pressbooks as well as product development for the software itself that will ultimately enhance
the book's UX.

We would like to express our sincerest gratitude to all who contributed to this project to date.

This book is in public beta as of Fall 2017. The official release (ETA January 2018) will
incorporate feedback received in beta testing. A future release will also include activities,
ancillary materials, and faculty resources on media innovation for instructors. If you would
like to help expand this book for the second edition and have a (CC BY) resource or additional
chapter you would like to contribute, please volunteer by commenting here.2

ACCESSIBILITY ASSESSMENT

A note from the Rebus Community

We are working to create a new, collaborative model for publishing open textbooks. Critical
to our success in reaching this goal is to ensure that all books produced using that model meet
the needs of all students who will one day use them. To us, open means inclusive, so for a book
to be open, it must also be accessible.

As a result, we are working with accessibility experts and others in the OER community to
develop best practices for creating accessible open textbooks, and are building those practices
into the Rebus model of publishing. By doing this, we hope to ensure that all books produced
using the Rebus Community are accessible by default, and require an absolute minimum of
remediation or adaptation to meet any individual student's needs.

While we work on developing guidelines and implementing support for authoring accessible
content, we are making a good faith effort to ensure that books produced with our support
meet accessibility standards wherever possible, and to highlight areas where we know there
is work to do. It is our hope that by being transparent on our current books, we can begin
the process of making sure accessibility is top of mind for all authors, adopters, students and
contributors of all kinds on all our open textbook projects.

Below is a short assessment of eight key areas that have been assessed during the production
process. The checklist has been drawn from the BCcampus Accessibility Toolkit. While a
checklist such as this is just one part of a holistic approach to accessibility, it is one way to
begin our work on embedded good accessibility practices in the books we support.

Wherever possible, we have identified ways in which anyone may contribute their expertise to
improve the accessibility of this text.

We also welcome any feedback from students, instructors or others who encounter the book
and identify an issue that needs resolving. This book is an ongoing project and will be updated
as needed. If you would like to submit a correction or suggestion, please do so using the Rebus
Community Accessibility Suggestions form.

REVIEW STATEMENT

This book underwent numerous layers of review.

        In 2017, each chapter of the book was peer-reviewed by a faculty in the field in a
          single-blind peer review process.

        The book was also beta tested by faculty and students in 12 classrooms in August
          2017. Feedback received in that process was incorporated into the first edition,
          officially launched in December of 2017.

        A community of faculty teaching this subject convened biweekly in 2017 to provide
          feedback on each chapter of the book.

        The first edition of the full book underwent peer review by several faculty reviewers
          in a single-blind peer review process.

        Other, independent organizations provided unsolicited peer review of the book.
          MERLOT reviewers, for example, conducted a peer review. In addition, OTN
          facilitated faculty peer reviews of the book. You can read those reviews on the Media
          Innovation & Entrepreneurship book page of the OTN Library.
ERRATA

An earlier version of this text included a math miscalculation in the Engagement and Analytics
chapter. The sentence has since been corrected to read:
"Did 1,000 people attend the festival (if so, you sold hats to 75% of them, and that's excellent!),
or did 50,000 people attend (if so, you sold hats to only 1.5% of them, and that's not so
excellent, assuming everyone at the festival had a head)?"
INSTRUCTOR RESOURCES

We're beginning a series of instructor resources to accompany the book. These will be added
to over time.

HELP TO EXPAND THIS BOOK!

This book is designed to be an ever-evolving and expanding resource of materials for faculty
and students in media entrepreneurship courses. The beta version is an MVP, a minimum
viable product, in itself. We hope that if you find it useful, you will also help to make it better.

Among the things we'd like to add:
        Instructor / ancillary materials: assignments and rubrics, lesson plans, presentations
          as well as pointers on how to teach a topic or grow capacity for teaching
          entrepreneurship in your institution
        Additional chapters or sidebars on relevant topics
        More glossary terms
        Links to resources elsewhere in the ecosystem

If you have a resource you can license CC BY that you would like to add to the book, contact
us.

If you're unable to license the material CC BY for inclusion in the book, we may still be
interested in linking from the book to the resource you propose in the resources section. Please
contact us to discuss!
COPY EDITING STATEMENT

Co-editor Michelle Ferrier, a longtime journalist, served as subject matter expert and
performed the substantive editing on the major chapters.

Co-editor Elizabeth Mays, with over 10 years as a professional copy editor of magazines,
books and textbooks, did final proofreading on each chapter and sidebar as well as several
rounds of the full book prior to printing.

The co-editors also enlisted a retired copy editor to do additional copy editing to one chapter
that proved particularly complex, and several volunteers from the Rebus Community with
professional copy editing experience, to do so on three others.

The book was edited according to the Chicago Manual of Style, a style guide frequently used
in book publishing.
