    This book stands on the shoulders of many scholars, practitioners, and public
thinkers. It also benefited greatly from the support I have received from different
people in my life and at my institution. While I cannot thank everyone who deserves
it within these pages -- that is another book altogether -- I do want to highlight a few
people who played a major role in bringing this book to life.

    First, thank you, my former students. Over the years, you have challenged me in
so many ways, both inside and outside of class. It has made me a better person and, I
hope, a better teacher. You have helped me identify what matters in journalism, and
why. And, you have energized me to persevere whenever this job starts to feel like a
job. Thanks to you, it is much more than that. May you continue to challenge me for
many years.

    Second, thank you, University of Massachusetts Amherst, UMass Amherst Li-
braries, and my colleagues in the Journalism Department. UMass promotes a culture
of teaching excellence and has provided me with several opportunities to develop
as an instructor, including a Lilly Teaching Fellowship. UMass Amherst Libraries
generously provided me with an Open Education Initiative grant that helped me
design a publishing system that turned my course notes into this book. And, my
departmental colleagues have embodied the meaning of teaching excellence since
my very first day at UMass. They constantly push me to be creative and diligent in
order to offer my students the very best experience.

    Finally, I'd like to thank a number of experts outside of UMass who played a
major and direct role in shaping the ideas featured in the pages of these book: Abeer

                Introduction

    International journalism is crucial to our understanding of the world beyond our
own borders. Such understanding is increasingly important because modern societies
are deeply interconnected. For example, an earthquake near Indonesia matters to a
mother in Brazil not just because she (hopefully) cares about her fellow humans. It also
matters because it can have cascading effects that impact supply chains and results in
a shortage of a medicine her son relies on. Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic has
shown us, it is impossible for a country to fully isolate itself. And, some of our most
pressing challenges (like climate change) hardly limit themselves to national borders.

    However, international journalism is not just about the events and developments
that begin outside of our own borders. It's also a way to learn about how people
in other parts of the world chronicle those developments, make sense of what is
happening, and present information in a truthful and clear way. Put another way,
it offers us the chance to imagine how journalists here, at home, might think about
(and perform) their jobs differently. It's a chance to recognize that, maybe, the way(s)
in which journalism is enacted in one place could be enriched if it whisked in some
ingredients from another place. Conversely, it's also a chance to recognize the pitfalls
of adopting certain ideologies and practices.

    This book is designed to explain key theories and concepts that allow us to
understand the general practice of journalism around the world, and to illustrate some
of the challenges that arise from practicing journalism in those contexts. It begins
by providing a theoretical foundation that helps us understand why international
journalism matters and the key forces that shape what it looks like; highlights some
of the key challenges to bearing witness to developments, sourcing information,
and simply doing `the job' of journalism; and describes important similarities and
differences in how journalism is imagined and performed in different regions of the
world.

    Unit I establishes a conceptual foundation for understanding journalism. This

                                                                  - vii -
                                            Introduction

requires defining terms like "news" and "journalism," and reckoning with implications
of the fact that such terms mean different things to different people. For example, if a
person considers something to be "journalism" (rather than just simple "news"), they
may be more willing to accept its author's version of events. This unit also explores
the broad constellation of entities involved in journalism, such as its social actors (e.g.,
journalists and software developers), technological actants (e.g., news recommendation
algorithms), and audiences (e.g., news consumers and policymakers). Finally, the unit
illustrates the rather large array of potential journalistic activities involved in the
practice of journalism.

    Unit II introduces multiple theoretical frameworks for understanding the potential
impacts of journalism. It begins by discussing media dependency theory, which helps
situate journalism within a broader system of information and identifies the conditions
that make some people more dependent on journalism to make sense of the world. It
then evaluates framing theory, agenda-setting theory, and priming theory. These three
frameworks offer sociological and psychological explanations for how news content
can impact individuals' evaluations of, and attitudes toward, a topic or issue. They
are also useful in illustrating some of the limits of journalism's impacts on individuals
and on society. The unit concludes with an examination of the phenomena of news
avoidance and fatigue, helping to explain why some people choose to opt out of
consuming journalism.

    Unit III begins to flip that script around by examining journalism through the
lens of journalistic cultures. The unit draws heavily upon the outstanding work done
by the Worlds of Journalism research team, who have spent almost two decades
systematically breaking down some of the similarities and differences in how jour-
nalists in dozens of different countries think about and perform journalism. The
unit begins by introducing the notion of journalistic cultures and why they matter.
It then focuses on three particular intrinsic dimensions of journalistic cultures that
shape how journalists think about their jobs (and, to some extent, how they perform
them). These dimensions are: their role orientations (how journalists think about their
social purpose), their ethical considerations (what journalists believe to be appropriate
responses to tricky situations), and their trust in institutions (journalists' willingness
to believe information provided by important public actors).

    Unit IV continues flipping that script by introducing theoretical frameworks
that help explain some of the extrinsic dimensions of journalistic cultures that shape
what journalistic content is produced, and how it is produced. The unit begins
by describing the Hierarchy of Influences Model, which is a useful framework for
describing the many forces that affect the news content that audiences see, hear, and

                                                                  - viii -

read. It then examines some of the news values that are factored into journalists'
determinations of newsworthiness. The unit then critically evaluates the notions of
truth, bias, and neutrality by highlighting that facts are not `natural' things that just
`exist' and underscoring the value of truth-seeking in journalism. The unit concludes
by examining the increasing fragmentation of a mass audience into many smaller
audiences as a result of diverging media consumption habits, which has resulted in
greater competition and optimization for audience attention.

    Unit V explores the economic aspects of journalism. It begins by chronicling the
commodification of news in the United States and discussing the role that advertising
has played in subsidizing journalism over the past century -- a role that it is arguably
no longer able to play as effectively. The unit then examines the impacts of audience
measurement, highlighting how new technologies have enabled broader and more
immediate quantification of audience wants. It then describes the influence of third-
party platforms (e.g., Apple News) on journalism, highlighting the structural roles
they now play as intermediaries in the information ecosystem. The unit concludes by
describing two alternative economic models for supporting journalism: non-profit
journalism and state-supported journalism.

    Unit VI centers on global journalism, or journalism that is intended to cross borders
and reach audiences around the world. The unit begins by describing what is unique
about international news coverage, both in terms of what influences its production as
well as the distinct impacts international news can have on citizens' understandings
of public affairs. The unit then illustrates some different kinds of global journalistic
outlets and describes how they can be instrumentalized by governments to increase
their power. It then explains what foreign correspondents and news bureaus are, and
highlights some of the challenges they face in modern times. The unit concludes by
explicating the practice of parachute journalism, highlighting some of its problematic
tendencies while also challenging some critiques lodged against it.

    Unit VII examines the practices of news sourcing as they commonly manifest in
the context of international journalism. It begins by conceptualizing news sources,
examining the exchanges of power that are involved in the act of news sourcing, and
describing common news sourcing biases. Then, the unit describes a key conduit
foreign correspondents turn to in order to source information and gather information
abroad: the fixer. The unit proceeds to describe a crucial type of typically reliable
source that correspondents turn to for information: non-governmental organizations.
The two following chapters describe another type of source (and sourcing practice)
that correspondents are increasingly turning to: user-generated content and crowd-
sourcing information. The unit concludes with an explication of misinformation and

                                                                   - ix -

disinformation, terms that help us better capture the range of inaccurate information
that pollute information ecosystems.

    Unit VIII evaluates the challenging labor conditions that modern journalists face,
especially when working abroad. It begins by offering a primer on the legal landscape
for journalists around the world, highlighting trends in legal frameworks and how laws
are sometimes applied selectively to silence critical journalists. The unit then describes
how modern laws and technologies are being used to surveil journalists and, in the
process, make potential sources think twice before communicating with a journalist.
It then highlights the acute challenges faced by journalists who report on war and
conflict, from truthfully depicting the events to managing their own physical and
psychological health. The unit concludes with a chapter on the increasing incidence
of violence against journalists -- a phenomenon we have seen more of in the United
States in recent years but that journalists abroad have experienced for a long time.

    Unit IX concludes the book by examining the press freedoms and constraints,
professionalization and labor conditions, and sociotechnical trends being experienced
in five different regions around the world. While the unit is not intended to be
comprehensive -- neither in terms of all the regions around the world nor in the
countries within each region -- it does help to concretely illustrate some of the diversity
in the ways journalism is thought about and practiced around the world.

    I hope this book proves useful to anyone who is curious about what journalism is
and how it is practiced around the world. I also hope that it inspires you, the reader,
to want to be better informed about developments around the world and about how
the rest of the world sees the developments happening here. I believe information
is central to communication, and communication is key to approaching our future
collective challenges as a community. I hope you will join me in helping make that
happen.

                    News

    News refers to novel information about recent affairs.

    News has been a part of human societies for as long as we've been able to commu-
nicate complex ideas. Going back to our early times, you can think of travelers, priests,
and soldiers as individuals who would learn something about a recent affair -- such
as the outcome of a battle or the emergence of a plague nearby -- and would share
that news with others. Perhaps you have even heard about the `town criers' who
would learn some news -- perhaps an official decree from the king -- and share it with
a public audience.

    News is the lifeblood of journalism. And, in the context of journalism, news
usually entails novel information about recent affairs that is in the public interest.
This emphasis on `public interest' is influenced by Enlightenment principles, which
emphasize objectivity and rationality in order to engage with social problems in a
fruitful way. Moreover, this view considers newsgathering to be an important activity
within a democratic society. That activity involves having individuals (news gatherers)
systematically collect novel information about recent affairs and convey that information
in a way that allows citizens to engage productively in debates about matters that
impact the public.

    That interpretation of newsgathering is similar to what we tend to call reporting
today. However, if we were to require news gatherers to be hired and dedicated
reporters -- basically, limit them to people who get paid to report the news -- then we
would find that there was fairly little newsgathering until the 1800s, and only in a
few places around the world. Put another way, our current imagining of newsgather-
ing (or reporting) as a distinct, semi-professionalized activity is a historically recent
development.

                                                                   -3-

News and The News

in mind that it also has a colloquial meaning, and also to distinguish between "news"
and "the news." It is not uncommon to hear "news" be used colloquially in reference
to a particular way of conveying novel information about recent affairs, and "the news"
as some monolithic aggregation of it. For example, the phrase, "What's `the news'
today?" implies that there is one relatively small group of news stories, drawn from a
much-larger pool of possible news stories, that a large group of people would accept
as being particularly important at that moment in time.

    It is thus important to recognize that "news" and "the news" are modern cultural
constructs that reflect particular understandings of what is news and what is news-
worthy. Those understandings, in turn, are shaped by the histories and cultures of
particular places and peoples. Put another way, "news" and "the news" are not natural
things but rather things a group of people collectively agree to accept as "news" and
"the news."

    For example, a news story is rarely understood to mean a simple chronological
listing of observations. You wouldn't expect the lead news story in The New York
Times to read that Dr. Zamith woke up, went to his office, ate lunch, stubbed his toe,
and found the cure for dementia. Instead, most people expect "news" to resemble a
particular format. In the United States, you would likely expect a journalistic account
of that news to start with the fact that Dr. Zamith found the cure to dementia -- and
probably not even mention the fact that he ate lunch that day. Moreover, given the
prevalence of dementia in the United States and the significance of the discovery,
such a story would likely be considered a part of "the news" for that day.

The News and Newsworthiness

    What is understood as "the news" varies considerably across and within places
because it reflects not only different ways of thinking about what "news" should look
or sound like but also who has the authority to define what "news" is, as well as what is
newsworthy. Some stories tend to have more universal appeal -- for example, dementia
is a serious concern in much of the world, and not just the U.S. -- but other stories (e.g.,
stories about violence against transgender people) may be treated as more newsworthy
in some societies.

    Returning to that earlier question, "What's the news today?" we must therefore
recognize that there is a finite space for "news" -- because, after all, we only have
so much time to consume news and newsgatherers can only follow up on so many

                                                                   -4-
                                                  News

stories -- and that "the news" consequently requires someone (or, more accurately, some
group of people) to define what matters, both in terms of what news is important as
well as what is important about that news.

    While "news" can be understood as simply being novel information about recent
affairs, it can therefore also be understood more broadly as a form of knowledge about
the world we live in. Consequently, those who are recognized as the primary definers
of "the news" -- be they journalists, some other group of people, or a mix thereof -- are
granted power in shaping how we understand the societies we live in as well as those
we've never seen ourselves.

    Key Takeaways

    » Within the context of journalism, the term "news" usually refers to novel

        information about recent affairs that is in the public interest.

    » While news has long been traded by different people, the notion of news-

        gathering as a distinct professional activity is a historically recent develop-
        ment.

    » "News" is an evolving cultural object. It is rarely just a chronological listing

        of observations. Instead, it reflects local ways of thinking about things like
        presentation formats and ways of organizing information.

    » There is also the notion of "the news," which suggests that there is a

        collection of particularly important news. Those who are recognized as
        the primary definers of "the news" have power in shaping societal priorities
        and what is particularly important about emerging developments.

    » News can be understood as more than just a collection of information. It

        is also a form of knowledge.

                Journalism

    The term "journalism" can mean very different things to different people. As such,
you will often get a wide range of responses when you ask a group of people to define
"journalism."

    For example, you can define "journalism" as a product. Under this view, an inves-
tigative news story about the mayor taking bribes might be treated as "journalism"
because the product (an online article) contains certain things thought to be journalis-
tic, like a clear headline and quotes from multiple interviewees. Similarly, that story
might be treated as "journalism" because it appears on a television show that looks
a certain way -- maybe it has someone dressed professionally sitting behind a long
table describing the incident -- or follows certain linguistic patterns.

    "Journalism" can also be defined in terms of the people who are involved in the
creation of a news product. If something is produced by a certain kind of person,
perhaps someone with a college degree in Journalism or some related form of pro-
fessional training, then some people might treat their work as "journalism." In some
countries, people have to be recognized (or certified) by the government in order to
legally produce "journalism" or receive certain legal protections.

    Similarly, "journalism" can be defined in terms of the institutions that create such
products. If something is produced by a particular kind of organization, such as The
New York Times or BBC News, then some people will treat that product as a form of
"journalism."

    More broadly, "journalism" can be thought about as a set of activities through which
news is collected, organized, presented, and circulated. For example, someone might
believe something to be "journalism" only if it involved first-hand observation by
the would-be journalist, or interviews with multiple witnesses. That person may also
require all accounts to be subjected to verification practices by the would-be journalist.

                                                                   -7-
                                              Journalism

    Even more broadly yet, "journalism" can be understood as a service that is guided by
certain goals and values, such as identifying issues that are important to a community
and holding elected officials to account, or connecting citizens with opportunities for
civic engagement. From this perspective, "journalism" is less about what the product
looks like, who made it, or how they made it, but rather about what one hoped to
accomplish through their endeavor.

    Finally, "journalism" can also be understood as an occupation that is bound together
by a particular ideology spanning different elements of product, people, practice, and
service. For example, in the United States, this might entail values like seeking to
provide a public service to citizens; striving to be objective, fair, and trustworthy;
working independently from governmental officials; being committed to an approach
that emphasizes gathering first-hand accounts of events in a timely fashion; and
deferring to a shared, professional sense of ethics. In other contexts, that ideology
might be different. For example, the ideology may instead seek to promote societal
stability by having journalists be more deferential to government authorities and less
critical of the status quo. Those who act in line with the dominant occupational values
of journalism within a society -- whatever that may look like -- may thus be seen as
practicing "journalism."

Why Definitions Matter

    As we can see, there are many ways to define "journalism." Not only do different
places and different groups of people within those places often understand the term
differently, but those same places and groups have also understood it differently
through history.

    What this tells us is that journalism is a fluid and contested thing. Changing social,
cultural, economic, political, and technological conditions change how people under-
stand journalism. For example, technological advances have made it possible for a
kindergarten teacher to regularly blog about their city's public Board of Health meet-
ings to a large online audience -- in effect, arguably allowing that teacher to perform
acts of journalism in ways that were not previously possible.

    This matters because the way journalism is broadly understood within a society
impacts how symbolic resources are translated into material rewards. For example, think
about a press conference or a trial that has limited seating. Some of those seats may
be reserved for those who practice journalism. To determine who is eligible for those
seats, someone has to first define what "journalism" is.

                                                                   -8-
                                              Journalism

Definitions and Expectations

    In many societies, journalism also receives a special social status as being the
authority on "news." You can see evidence of this in the way journalism is enshrined in
foundational documents and legal protections of some countries. For example, in the
United States, the First Amendment protects a "free press" because of its presumed
importance to a well-informed democracy.

    With such status comes expectation, and perhaps even deference, from individual
citizens and the broader public. For example, if someone considers The New York
Times to engage in journalism but does not consider Fox News to do so, then they
will typically hold The New York Times to a higher standard when the Times makes a
mistake. At the same time, they will be more likely to give the Times the benefit of
the doubt when that someone can't independently verify some reported information
themselves. Put another way, that someone is effectively granting The New York Times
a degree of legitimacy that they are not granting Fox News because of how that
someone understands journalism.

    The consequence of this is that it grants the individuals and organizations that
are perceived to be legitimate brokers of journalism considerable power as they are
deemed to be authoritative by some group of people. That, in turn, allows those
organizations to become the primary definers of "news" for that group. This is why
different news organizations, commentators, and public figures expend so much en-
ergy casting some things as journalism and other things as not-journalism (sometimes
with disparaging labels like "fake news").

Journalism as Plural

    Although we have talked about "journalism" in the singular form, it is important
to recognize that journalism is not some monolithic thing. Thus, one could very easily
talk about journalisms -- that is, journalism in a pluralized sense.

    For example, we often hear about "sports journalism," "data journalism," and
"advocacy journalism." These prefixes refer to more than just genres or technologies.
They recognize that there is something substantively different about that particular
rendition of "journalism," whether in its purpose, people, processes, or products. Those
differences, in turn, result in distinct symbolic associations, material rewards, and social
expectations within that area of journalism. Put another way, what is considered to
be desirable practice within one area of journalism -- like adopting a neutral tone or
using an inverted pyramid story structure -- may be considered undesirable in another.

                                                                   -9-
                                              Journalism
As such, there is no one "right way" to do journalism, but certain ways are privileged
over others in particular contexts.

    These definitional challenges and considerations thus help us to appreciate that
"journalism" is actually a very dynamic and multifaceted thing.

    Key Takeaways

    » Journalism can be defined in many ways, which means that "journalism"

        is a contested term that means different things to different people.

    » In the U.S. and many liberal democracies, journalism is associated with cer-

        tain occupational values that stress a public service orientation, objectivity,
        independence, immediacy, and professional ethics.

    » How journalism is generally understood within a society matters because

        it affects how symbolic resources are translated into material rewards and
        expectations.

    » There is a plurality of journalisms (e.g., "data journalism" and "advocacy

        journalism"), each with distinct norms, values, and processes. This points
        to a recognition that journalism is not a single, monolithic entity.

             Social Actors

    Human beings play a central role in journalism, and we can refer to the individuals
who help shape the renditions of news we come across (and the organizations those
individuals work for) as social actors within the space of "journalism."

    The most obvious social actor in journalism is the journalist. But what constitutes
a "journalist" is often debated both within and across societies, and it changes over
time. For example, 50 years ago, it may have been enough to say that anyone who was
employed to do editorial work for an organization that primarily produced news was
effectively a "journalist." However, news organizations and the journalism ecosystem
are simply too complex today for that to be a good definition.

    Scholars have traditionally found two particularly helpful approaches for defining
who a "journalist" is.

    From a sociological approach, one could say that journalists are individuals with
particular skills and knowledge who both adhere to the shared ideals of what is recognized
as journalism within a given context and believe they are participating in shaping the
profession's standards of proper practice. Put another way, the sociological approach
looks at a combination of what the individual does, how they do it, and the role they
play in shaping the profession.

    From a normative approach, one could say that a journalist is simply someone
who reports news while holding certain values associated with journalism in a given
society. For example, in the United States, such values might include seeking to report
honestly and independently from commercial and social pressures, committing to
verifying information before disseminating it, and being responsible, methodical, and
transparent in their work. Put another way, the normative approach focuses less
on what a person does and more on the values they adopt and try to apply in their
work. Those norms, in turn, serve as identity markers for the individual, helping

                                                                  - 11 -
                                           Social Actors

them define who they are as professionals (or semi-professionals). Those norms also
serve as boundary markers separating journalists from non-journalists, helping those
individuals define who they are not, as well as who is not one of us.

    While this distinction may seem strictly academic at first, it has two broad practical
implications. First, individuals viewed as journalists by one group of people may not
be viewed as journalists by another group because they apply different definitional
criteria. Second, journalists often try to present themselves as journalists (or not-
journalists) in relation to norms and/or professional standards -- which underscores
the `soft' power of those cultural constructions.

Editorial Actors

    News organizations have a range of social actors who are typically associated with
the label of "journalist" -- whom we may call editorial actors. These include reporters
and correspondents, who collect and analyze information, and then produce news
reports about newsworthy events; photojournalists, who try to capture those events
through still and moving images; and anchors and presenters, who serve as the faces
and primary interpreters in broadcast news programs.

    In addition to those more front-facing social actors, you also have individuals
who work behind the scenes but are nevertheless also grouped under the "journalist"
umbrella. These include editors, who assign stories to reporters, review their work,
and have the ability to make substantial changes to the news reports that reporters
produce; copy editors, who review news reports for accuracy, grammar, adherence
to the organization's journalistic style, and often write the headlines; community
engagement editors, who help tailor content for social media and build community
around stories; and news designers, who employ different aesthetics like fonts and
visual hierarchy in order to call attention to certain aspects of a story.

    There are also some content producers whose work is regularly featured alongside
that of journalists but whose practices, norms, or styles result in their being considered
"journalists" only some of the time (if at all). These include columnists, who write
regular analyses of news that typically convey an explicit point of view or personal
experience; cartoonists, who often seek to convey an explicit point of view on an
issue through creative illustration; and a news organization's editorial board, which
may write anonymous editorials that convey the organization's view on some issue.
The work from these individuals is often -- but not always -- explicitly separated from
that of the aforementioned actors, such as by being included in an "Opinion" section.

                                                                  - 12 -
                                           Social Actors

Economic and Technical Actors

    In addition to those social actors, there are also individuals who are crucial to the
operation of a news organization but are less likely to be labeled a "journalist." Two
important groups of such individuals are economic actors and technical actors.

    Some of the key economic actors within news organizations are managers and
proprietors. Management covers a broad category of social actors who play a role
in defining and implementing the organization's business strategy, including its rev-
enue model, economic targets, budgets and resource allocations, and hiring choices.
Proprietors, in turn, refer to the actors who own news organizations. These actors
may be hands-off and allow the organization to operate with considerable indepen-
dence -- provided they reach specified economic targets -- but they may also actively
engage in the day-to-day decision-making by assigning stories of interest to them, shut-
ting down stories that hurt their interests, and serving as the `final word' in different
newsroom affairs.

    News organizations also require a range of technical actors in order to operate
successfully. These include camera operators, who set up and work the cameras for
news broadcasts; sound mixers, who record, synchronize, and edit audio for news
segments; and web and app developers, who design and operate content management
systems and user-facing applications. Simply put, these individuals help design and
operate the tools needed to create the news products that an organization wants to
put out -- and without whom there likely would not be a polished product.

Interlopers

    These are just a small sampling of the many social actors involved in journalism,
all of whom could easily fall under a single news organization's umbrella, provided
the organization is large enough. However, it is imperative to note that not only are
there many different social actors involved in journalism but that these (and related)
actors can work either inside or outside of a newsroom.

    For example, consider a news organization's content management system. Such
systems are commonplace in modern news organizations. They allow a reporter to
easily write their story on a digital platform, pass it on to an editor who reviews it,
and then quickly publishes it on the organization's website. Although commonplace,
the software supporting a system like this is often developed by a different organi-
zation -- and one that likely produces software for businesses in different industries.
That software development organization thus generally operates outside the space of
journalism. As such, the coders who create that content management system may

                                                                  - 13 -
                                           Social Actors

rarely ever interact with journalists, and they may even produce the software with a
different user base in mind, such as food bloggers. Nevertheless, the coder's decisions
partly shape what the reporter can and cannot do. For example, the editor may not be
able to use a `track changes' function while editing a story because the coders never
considered that need, and thus did not program the system to allow that functionality.

    We could call such a software development organization (and the coders who
worked on the content management system) an interloper because they would likely
be seen as a non-journalistic actor that operates outside of typical journalistic spaces,
even though that organization contributes meaningfully to journalism (despite that
contribution perhaps being unintentional). While some interlopers stumble onto
journalism -- perhaps as a result of a job or a passion project -- others do intentionally
seek to contribute to journalism, even as they may not seek recognition as journalistic
actors. An example of this might be an open-data advocate who digitizes records of
complaints against police officers so that data journalists can write stories about that
issue.

    Interlopers are important because they often challenge the orthodoxies of jour-
nalism. They may do this by explicitly critiquing those orthodoxies or by implicitly
introducing new practices and ways of thinking as a result of their non-journalistic
background and training. Those challenges, over time, have the potential to struc-
turally reshape aspects of journalism, allowing it to develop in unforeseen ways.

    It is important to note, however, that some outsiders may seek to interlope and gain
recognition as journalistic actors -- if not as outright "journalists." An example of this
may be a comedian who claims to be a "journalist" because they regularly feature news
material in their performances and provide news analysis through the lens of comedy.
Another example may be YouTube personalities who claim to be both an "outsider"
and a "journalist," and therefore not subject to the media problems they critique. Such
efforts are sometimes successful. However, they are more often unsuccessful because
the interloper's interventions may be deemed too extreme, and instead serve as an
example against which a boundary for what does constitute "journalism" is set. Over
time, such boundaries do change, though.

Networks of Actors

    Given that there are so many kinds of actors within journalism, it can be helpful to
think about journalism through a network lens, wherein different actors are connected
to one another. Such an exercise not only helps to make sense of the many different
actors involved in journalism but, crucially, helps illustrate that producing news is rarely
a solitary endeavor. Instead, it involves interactions, interrelations, and tensions among

                                                                  - 14 -
                                           Social Actors

a range of actors. That, in turn, leads to frequent reshapings of the ideas, norms, and
practices that define who is (and is not) a "journalist" and what "journalism" is (and is
not).

    For example, as web developers became more central to creating interactive data
visualizations in some newsrooms, they were physically moved to desks that were
closer to the data journalists in that newsroom. That, in turn, gave those coders
reputational credit within journalistic spaces -- they began being seen less as support
staff and more as journalists in their own right -- and gave them a greater ability to
reshape the journalistic culture within those newsrooms.

    Finally, although some actors may be thought of as being central to or on the
periphery of that network encompassing "journalism," it is important to recognize
that their positions within the network are often fluid. This means that they can
move from the periphery to a more central position over time -- or, the network may
become re-centered toward certain kinds of actors. Those fluid linkages within the
social network can thus grant different actors different forms and amounts of power
over time. For example, as U.S. journalism progressed in its digital transformations,
actors who were technically proficient with the so-called `new media' began to have a
stronger voice within newsrooms. Similarly, individuals whose informal writing styles
may have relegated them to the periphery of journalism in the past -- they may not
have been considered `serious' journalists because of how they wrote -- may now find
a place closer to the center as a result of the large and engaged online followings they
can attract. Journalistic networks thus adapt as the institution of journalism evolves.

    Key Takeaways

    » The term "social actors" refers to the human individuals (and the organiza-

        tions they work for) that operate within a given space, like journalism.

    » There is a wide range of editorial, economic, and technical actors in jour-

        nalism, and those actors may operate within and outside the newsroom.
        Examples of these actors include reporters, proprietors, and web develop-
        ers.

    » In addition to traditional actors, there are also interlopers, or actors who

      Technological Actants

    Although journalism is often associated with human beings, non-human entities
also play an important role in shaping journalism -- especially today. We can refer to
the material, non-human technologies that make a difference to how news is produced
and disseminated as technological actants within the space of journalism. Examples
of technological actants in journalism include word processing applications (used to
produce news stories), search engine algorithms (used to find news), and smartphones
(used to consume news).

    While that definition may seem quite abstract, at its heart is a simple truth: Nearly
all of today's journalistic work is shaped in some part by technology. This isn't
a recent development, though. Technological actants have played a major role in
the historical development of journalism. For example, the development of the
printing press made the mass distribution of journalism theoretically possible, even as
it restricted the formats that journalistic products could take on due to the technology's
limitations. Another technological actant, the telegraph, enabled newswire services
like The Associated Press to develop and allowed reporters to transmit their reports
relatively quickly from afar. Conversely, the proliferation of the telephone allowed
more reporting to be done from within the newsroom since reporters could just call
their sources instead of having to meet them in person.

    Technological actants are important because they both enable, restrict, and shape
different forms of journalism in both visible and invisible ways, and they very much
impact the social actors (human beings) who interact with technology. Moreover,
although technological actants are often described as neutral entities -- after all, they're
machines presumably acting in predictable ways -- technological actants are very
much shaped by the social actors who create them.

                                                                  - 17 -
                                    Technological Actants

Technology Shaping Human Behaviors

    In the aforementioned examples of the printing press, the telegraph, and the
telephone, technological actants shaped the behaviors of human actors by creating new
possibilities and restricting others.

    For a more detailed example, consider the following scenario: A news organization
uses a content management system to facilitate its workflow, and all reporters at that
organization must submit their stories through that system. When a reporter sees
that a star athlete announced, via a video on Instagram, that they're signing a new
contract, the reporter quickly writes a news brief for the website and plans to embed
the Instagram post so readers may see the athlete's excitement with their own eyes.
However, it turns out that the particular content management system used by the
news organization does not have the technical capacity to embed social media posts
in a story -- perhaps the person who created the system just never thought to add the
functionality. Thus, the reporter must either describe the video through the text in
the story or send the reader away from the story through a link to the post.

    In that example, the technological actant (the content management system) shaped
a particular human choice by making it impossible for the reporter to pursue their
preferred course of action, which was to embed the post with the video. Instead, it
provided the reporter with a limited set of alternative courses of action that the system
could accommodate: linking out to Instagram or presenting a written description of
the video. Over time, that system may end up discouraging the use of social media
in reporting -- such as embedding posts that illustrate a point made by the reporter
or that include reactions by other people -- and thus impact the way the reporters
working for that organization relate with their sources and audiences.

    It is crucial to note, though, that just because a technological actant is designed to
promote a particular way of doing things does not mean that its users will use them in
that way -- or use that actant at all. Many innovations in journalism are not actually
adopted by journalists. And, when they are, those actants are often adopted in ways
that allow journalists to continue doing the things they are used to doing, and in the
ways they are used to doing them. In that sense, technological actants can take on the
values, operational logics, and biases of their users when they are put to particular uses.
For example, when mainstream journalistic outlets began adopting the then-novel
blogging format in new sections of their websites, its journalists tended to use the new
functionalities in very traditional ways -- such as by linking primarily to mainstream
organizations, limiting audience participation, and using the same journalistic writing
style they were already used to.

                                                                  - 18 -
                                    Technological Actants

Humans Shaping Technology

    The relationship between technological actants and human actors is not a one-way
street, though. That is, human actors also shape technological actants.

    It is easy to think of technological actants as neutral tools due to their mechanical
nature. However, they are created and refined by human actors, and thus take on
certain cultural norms, politics, and ideological values. These may be intentionally
inserted into the technological actant by those humans in order to advance certain
commercial, technical, or journalistic objectives. They may also be added uninten-
tionally as a result of the human creator's biases and ways of thinking.

    To illustrate this, consider a scenario wherein a freelance coder is contracted to
create a web tool that helps journalists at a news organization quickly produce interac-
tive data visualizations. The coder intuits that most journalists at that organization are
not tech-savvy, and thus chooses to limit the range of customization options so as to
not overwhelm the journalists. The coder similarly intuits that many of the journalists
lack a design background, and thus implements a feature that will quickly inspect
the dataset and recommend the chart form that best illustrates the data. Finally, the
coder is told to optimize the tool for "a mobile-first experience," and the coder thus
further restricts the customization options to ensure that the journalist can only create
visualizations that look good on a smartphone.

    In that scenario, the coder -- a social actor -- has shaped the tool -- a technological
actant -- in different ways. First, their biases and perceptions lead them to promote a
restrictive logic of simplicity within the tool. Second, the coder's background shapes
the tool's suggestion for which kind of chart to use for a given dataset, and those
suggestions may be more oriented to scientific visualizations than journalistic ones if
the coder's background lies outside of journalism. Third, the economic logic of the
news organization instructs the coder to optimize the tool's outputs for smartphones;
the coder, in turn, programs the tool accordingly.

    As these examples show, not only do technological actants take on the biases and
logics of their users when they are put to use but they are also infused with the logics
and biases of their creators as they are built.

Mutual Shaping

    By acting upon one another, technological actants are constantly shaping human
actors and human actors are constantly shaping technological actants. This is called
mutual shaping and it operates in an iterative manner.

                                                                  - 19 -
                                    Technological Actants

    Returning to our data visualization tool scenario, the coder's choice to have the
software recommend pie charts when presented with data about proportions may
result in that visual format becoming a popular form in data visualizations created
by that organization. However, one of the journalists may find that they want the
doughnut chart form (an alternative to pie charts) to be an option, and eventually
convince the coder to include that functionality. Over time, the journalist's peers may
try that option and come to prefer it. They thus convince the coder to set the doughnut
chart to become the default recommendation, which in turn socializes future hires in
the organization to consider the doughnut chart first -- even as they continue to stay
within that general visual aesthetic initially proposed by the non-journalist coder.

    As the scenario now shows, a human actor shaped a technological actant, which
shaped the behaviors of other human actors, who in turn used the actant in particular
ways and had the coder reshape the actant, which had subsequent impacts on yet
more human actors. As such, they were influencing one another over time, with the
technological actant taking on the ideas, biases, and logics of different people -- even
as it influenced those very same people in important ways. While this is a fairly
simple example, you can imagine similar mutual shaping processes for more complex
technologies (e.g., search algorithms, communication platforms, virtual assistants).

    Given that technological actants act and are acted upon human actors (as well as
other technological actants), it is unsurprising that those dynamics introduce fluid
power relationships. Those relationships are oftentimes asymmetric, meaning that a
technological actant may ultimately have more power over the human actor -- and
vice versa.

    For example, Google's search algorithms may play a major role in determining
how many clicks a reporter's story gets, and the reporter may thus try to optimize the
language in their story to get more attention from Google. (This is called search engine
optimization, or SEO.) However, Google's algorithms are hardly influenced by that
individual journalist, or perhaps even the journalism industry as a whole. Thus, that
algorithm has more power over the reporter than the reporter has over the algorithm,
as the reporter must adapt to remain relevant but not the other way around.

    Such power relationships are particularly important to examine as particular
technologies become more and less central to the profession and to everyday life, and
as certain kinds of human actors become more and less central to journalism.

                                                                  - 20 -

Key Takeaways

» Technological actants refer to material, non-human technologies that make

   a difference to how journalism is produced and disseminated.

» Technological actants shape human actors by structuring their behaviors,

   both in terms of making it easier to do some things and impossible to do
   others.

» Technological actants are not neutral. They are developed by humans and

   take on those humans' values, biases, and preferred ways of accomplishing
   tasks. Moreover, they are sometimes intentionally employed within organi-
   zations (including newsrooms) to address different commercial, technical,
   and/or journalistic imperatives.

» The mutual shaping of human actors and technological actants creates

   power relationships that are fluid and dynamic, and are of consequence

                Audiences

    The term audience refers to the individuals and groups to whom products and
services, like journalism, are produced for or in the service of. Within the space of
journalism, this would typically be the readers, listeners, viewers, and so on that a
journalistic outlet seeks to serve.

    News audiences in particular are sometimes interchangeably called "the public" or
citizens. Those designations typically imply a civic objective: they are individuals that
journalists should seek to inform so that they may participate intelligently in democratic
processes. However, audiences may also be referred to as news consumers, which
sometimes implies a more commercial logic -- after all, the consumption of a product
is what is highlighted -- and thus emphasizes the organization's economic objectives
over its social ones. More recently, the term "news users" has received attention
because it moves away from the passive connotation of consumption and instead
offers audiences more agency by suggesting that they can actively participate in media
use.

    Although these terms differ, they all orient themselves toward something we can
call "news audiences."

News Audiences Over Time

    Although journalistic outlets often depend on their audiences for their financial
success -- whether directly through subscriptions or indirectly through advertise-
ments -- the newsrooms within those organizations have historically wanted little to
do with their audiences.

    News audiences have historically been treated in a fairly passive sense, as recipients
of media or commodities. Put another way, they were often thought about as just
people who consumed the work of journalists, and with whom the journalists rarely

                                                                  - 23 -
                                               Audiences

ever interacted -- save for the occasional letter or phone call that a journalist might
receive.

    Going back to the 1930s, much of the thinking about mass media (which includes
journalism) was oriented around a hypodermic needle model wherein `the audience'
was seen as a passive, monolithic group that simply accepted media messages as
intended by the sender -- in this case, the journalist. This view became progressively
less influential throughout the 1950s.

    Today, audiences are typically seen as having more agency in how they encounter
and interpret media messages. Put another way, they are seen as being more able
to determine how they find news, being more able to participate in how news is
produced and distributed, and having greater ability to interpret news through their
own filters, which in turn are shaped by their individual background and beliefs. This
has profoundly changed how news audiences are thought about, both professionally
and academically.

    Additionally, there are now greater commercial pressures on journalists and jour-
nalistic outlets to think about their audiences as potential active participants in news
production and distribution, and to enlist their help in order to lower news production
costs and increase the organization's reach. As advertising revenue declined for many
traditional media sectors and in many parts of the world, commercial journalistic
outlets have begun relying more on audience subscription revenue, which generally in-
crease when audiences feel more engaged (and thus see greater value in a subscription).
Even among state-supported and non-profit journalistic outlets, audience engagement
is becoming an increasingly important marker for legitimizing those outlets' requests
for funding.

News Audiences and Participation

    However, just because audiences can participate does not mean that news produc-
ers will seek or even want their participation.

    It has been argued that part of what gives a journalist a professional sense of
identity is that they have a `sixth-sense' for news, and the training needed to produce it
well. Journalists have thus historically rejected high degrees of audience participation
in news production because they perceived such participation to be an affront to
their independence and expertise, and thus to the quality of the news content they
produced.

    In recent years, however, there has been a cultural shift within the industry to-
ward welcoming participation -- and doing so in ways that are not simply optimized

                                                                  - 24 -
                                               Audiences

toward economic benefits. Journalists today are generally more open to the idea
of co-production with audiences since they have seen first-hand the quality of the
work that citizen journalists have been able to produce. They also now have access
to technological actants that make it easier to enlist the help of audiences to en-
gage in certain tasks, like reviewing large troves of public documents released by
whistleblowers and activists. Furthermore, there is greater acceptance of the idea that
audiences have more to offer journalism -- whether through story ideas or their own
social networks -- than they have been able to contribute in the past.

    However, just because audience participation is welcomed does not mean that
audiences will themselves want to participate. This is especially true if there is no
incentive for participation, or if they're treated as an appendix of sorts in the broad
scheme of things. Put differently, audiences are attune to exploitation -- such as being
asked to simply do grunt work for free -- and participatory forms of journalism are
therefore most successful when the relationships are perceived as being reciprocal,
with both journalists and audiences feeling like they have gained something as a result.
As such, discussions about "participatory journalism" now also include terms like
"reciprocal journalism."

Fragmentation of News Audiences

    Today's media ecology has also complicated ideas about audiences and the expe-
riences they have. For one, the rapid growth of media choices people have and the
ease with which they may access those choices has resulted in the fragmentation of
news audiences. No longer do tens of millions of people in the U.S. tune in to see a
single news broadcast at the same time, as was the case for CBS Evening News in the
1960s and 1970s. Similarly, news audiences are no longer bound to the handful of
channels their TV or radio antennas might pick up, to the delivery zones of their local
newspapers, or even to the cultural tastes of the owners of local stores that distribute
magazines.

    Instead, news audiences today can easily navigate their way to the New York Times'
website for national news, the Boston Globe's website for regional news, ESPN's website
for sports news, and SCOTUSblog for news about the Supreme Court. If they want
to stream local news from the National Public Radio member station in Minneapolis
in the morning, and then download a recorded broadcast from its Miami affiliate in
the evening, they can do that, too. If they want to see how the British Broadcasting
Corporation, or BBC, covered a particular issue, they can likely find that on YouTube
or the BBC's website.

                                                                  - 25 -
                                               Audiences

    In short, news audiences have access to far more news content, and far more
sources, than ever before -- and the cost of switching between journalistic outlets,
in terms of both money and convenience, is also lower than ever before in many
regards. This makes it difficult for a single journalistic outlet to gain a near-monopoly
on audiences. However, it has resulted in a media ecosystem wherein a few large
organizations are able to capture fairly large audiences due to brand recognition,
followed by a steep drop-off to a long tail made up of tens of thousands of journalistic
outlets that can only capture niche audiences and are, in many cases, deemed to be
interchangeable by users.

    Furthermore, not only do audiences now have access to more options for news but
they also have more options for other media. This includes entertainment media, such
as a popular show on Netflix or a streamer on Twitch. Such media compete with news
for a finite amount of audience time and attention. That, in turn, can further fragment
audiences as they turn to many different organizations to satisfy particular media
desires instead of relying on a single source, like CBS or NBC, to single-handedly
satisfy their want for news, culture, and entertainment.

Technological Actants and Audiences

    Although news audiences now have more agency, it is also important to be aware
that technological actants play an important role in mediating the interactions between
news audiences and journalistic actors, including journalistic outlets. For example,
when an individual searches for news about a recent event on YouTube, algorithms
developed by engineers at YouTube decide how to order the presentation of the
search results. Crucially, those algorithms are optimized to promote certain kinds of
content, including provocative or controversial content that will keep users on the
platform longer. Thus, news audiences are sometimes given a false sense of control,
as the search algorithms work invisibly to promote certain kinds of content while
deliberately obfuscating alternatives.

    Similarly, the experiences that news audiences have may be personalized in small
but important ways. Consider the following example: Dr. Zamith goes to the New
York Times' website and finds that the first opinion piece listed is about climate change,
an issue he cares deeply about. Other users might be shown a different opinion
piece, but Dr. Zamith is shown one about climate change because a technological
actant's analysis of his past browsing behavior estimated that he's interested in that
particular topic. When Dr. Zamith clicks on that opinion piece, he finds that the
third paragraph of the story is tailored to describe the average highs and lows over
the past few decades in Amherst. That's because a different technological actant

                                                                  - 26 -
                                               Audiences

guessed Dr. Zamith's location based on his IP address, and yet another actant looked
up the climate information in that area and generated a paragraph of text describing
it. Then, as Dr. Zamith scrolls to the middle of the article, he encounters an image
of a map-based data visualization that is automatically zoomed into Amherst. That's
because yet another technological actant determined that Dr. Zamith is using his
phone to access the story. Had he used a device with a larger screen, like a laptop, Dr.
Zamith would have been shown an interactive map of the entire United States, which
casts a broader lens on the issue.

    Throughout that example, a series of technological actants intervened in Dr.
Zamith's news experience in fairly invisible ways. These interventions may be seen as
positive. By personalizing the news experience, the story may feel more engaging to
Dr. Zamith and get him to care more about the issue. However, such personalization
can be highly problematic if the technological actants are used to mediate experiences
by offering audiences highly different stories based on characteristics like political
ideology, race and ethnicity, or economic status. In the extreme, such interventions
would make it harder for a public to have a shared sense of reality -- something that
scholars have argued is important for democratic deliberation.

    Technological actants have also altered the way news audiences and journalistic
actors communicate with one another, and thus the kinds of relationships they tend
to develop. For example, audience members are now more likely to give feedback
on a story through brief, immediate, public exchanges directed at the journalist using
a platform like Twitter, as opposed to longer, slower, private exchanges like a letter
or e-mail. This can result in more meaningful and direct audience participation.
However, it can likewise promote negative forms of participation, such as `brigading'
and strategic harassment of journalists.

       Journalistic Activities

    Journalistic activities refer to the routinized practices that help shape both news
media messages and the ways they are distributed and consumed.

    The phrase "routinized practices" underscores that journalistic activities tend to
follow certain routines, or ways of doing things. They're often deeply influenced by
long-standing institutional logics, processes, and cultural values that make it possible
for different kinds of social actors and technological actants to not only work together
but also work efficiently across the multi-stage process of producing journalism.

    Although journalistic activities are influenced by their past, they are not static or
unchangeable. In fact, they frequently iterate as new configurations of social actors,
technological actants, and audiences emerge as a result of social, political, economic,
and technological changes within media industries and society at large.

    For example, journalism was historically a more insular practice, with journalists
often writing for an audience they knew relatively little about and received relatively
little input from. Put another way, after the journalist identified a story they perhaps
thought was important, the journalist would report it and write it in a way that would
help answer questions they thought their audiences probably had. After the editors
and production staff processed the journalist's story, it would appear on somebody's
doorstep. That was often the end of that story's lifecycle.

    In contrast, that same journalist is today more likely to be looking at social media
trends to identify story ideas, put out open calls to solicit help in running down a
tip, and even receive frequent audience feedback about their story after it has been
published. Moreover, that journalist may go on to respond to questions about the
story on social media and later tweet small updates to the story based on audience
interest. Journalistic activities today are thus more social and less insular.

                                                                  - 29 -
                                    Journalistic Activities

From Production to Consumption

    We can broadly place many of the most consequential journalistic activities into
five distinct stages: access and observation, selection and filtering, processing and editing,
distribution, and interpretation.

Access and Observation

    Access and observation pertains to the information gathering stage of news pro-
duction. This involves gathering source material, like attending a press conference,
being present at a protest, or gaining access to confidential government reports. It also
involves identifying patterns in those source materials, like the members of Congress
who routinely receive more political donations from certain industries. Regular cit-
izens are now far more likely to participate in this stage than in times past because
they can easily serve as observers by streaming events or capturing incidents that
professional journalists may not be able to observe first-hand themselves. For example,
a Minneapolis teenager received a special citation by the Pulitzer Board in 2021 for
filming the murder of George Floyd. That video was crucial to journalistic coverage
of that incident, and it helped generate a great deal of media attention to the issue of
police violence against people of color in the summer of 2020.

Selection and Filtering

    Selection and filtering pertains to the stage wherein gathered information is
winnowed down to its most interesting and/or important parts. This involves looking
at all potential stories that might emerge from an event, like a protest, and deciding
what to include in a news product and where to include it. For example, a journalist
may choose to focus the story on the size of the turnout at a protest, on the police
response to the protesters, on the history of the issue that is being protested against,
on the potential solutions to the issue, and so on. Even if the journalist has the time
or space to cover every one of those angles -- and they often do not -- they still need
to decide which aspect of the issue to the lead the news story with.

Processing and Editing

    Processing and editing pertains to the stage wherein the gathered and filtered
information is turned into a news product, often by following certain stylistic guide-
lines. For example, the journalist may be expected to organize the information using
the inverted pyramid schema, wherein the most timely and important information
is placed near the very top of the story, followed by decreasingly important details
until you get to the non-essential background information at the end. The journalist

                                                                  - 30 -
                                    Journalistic Activities

may also be expected to generally use non-emotive language, like claiming a policy
proposal was "dismissed" instead of "lambasted" in order to signal their neutrality.
Within this stage, there may be multiple individuals (from the supervising editor to
a copy editor to the layout or web editor) modifying the news product as it moves
through the news production chain.

Distribution

    Distribution pertains to the stage wherein news products are disseminated to
audiences, such as by broadcasting a news story on a television show or trying to
place it on a user's social media feed. Historically, newsroom personnel had a limited
role to play in this stage as organizations had a dedicated group of people to handle
these activities. For example, dedicated print workers would set up the printing press,
print thousands of copies, and stash them in bunches at a delivery dock. Delivery
workers would then pick up and drop off individual copies at subscribers' homes.
Today, however, newsroom personnel often participate directly in the distribution
process by linking to their own stories on social media and sometimes even trying
to draw attention to the stories by engaging in online communities where would-be
audiences might congregate. Additionally, audiences themselves now play a crucial
role in distribution: They're often the ones driving attention to a story by sharing it,
helping some news products go viral.

Interpretation

    Interpretation pertains to the discussion around the distributed news product,
and more broadly about how it becomes widely understood and accepted by the
general population. Journalists can certainly influence the interpretation of a news
product based on the specific words and story angles they use in describing an issue or
event, and editors can similarly play a major role based on the headline they write for
the story and the pictures they choose to accompany it. However, audiences also play
a crucial role in this process based on how they talk about the product in associated
`comments' sections, the contexts within which they share the stories on social media,
and the rebuttals they may choose to issue themselves via blogging platforms and the
like.

Changing Nature of Activities

    At the heart of these examples are human actors. This is because journalistic
activities have historically been human-led, with technological actants acting largely
in a support role to help enact the human-led objectives more efficiently. For example,

                                                                  - 31 -
                                    Journalistic Activities

content management systems made it possible for journalists to quickly write their
stories -- perhaps with some automated spell- and grammar-checking help -- and
easily move it up the chain to a human editor. However, human beings were still
doing much of the core labor.

    This is changing, however. In some instances, the roles are now outright inverted,
with the human social actor playing the support role and the technological actant
taking the primary journalistic role, and sometimes acting with a remarkable degree
of independence. For example, newswriting algorithms are already able to take in large
numbers of electronic financial reports, identify the most interesting changes from
the previous financial quarter, and write thousands of news stories that look very
similar to what a human journalist might have produced. Another algorithm may then
take those stories and post them to an organization's website -- with a clever headline
and all -- and automatically promote it on social media. All of this can be done with
limited human intervention, beyond the work that goes into setting up the algorithm.

    While algorithmically led user-facing activities are still the exception within the
general space of journalism, they have become central in some sectors. For example,
The Associated Press publishes tens of thousands of algorithmically written news stories
about finance and sports each year, and a major journalistic media chain in Sweden
employs algorithms to automatically organize news stories on their homepages using
a mixture of personalization and algorithmic editorial judgment.

    Thus, while journalistic activities are often organized around predictable routines
shaped by history, they're also continually iterating before our eyes.

        messages as well as their distribution and consumption.

     Media Dependency Theory

    Media dependency theory offers a helpful way to think about the relationship
between media and the fulfillment of different audience needs and goals.

    At the heart of the theory is the proposition that in industrialized and information-
based societies, such as the one we presently live in, individuals come to rely on media
to satisfy a range of different needs and goals. These include learning about where
those individuals should go to vote as well as staying up-to-date about the latest
fashion trends.

    Before diving into this theory, it is helpful to be mindful of the fact that journalistic
outlets are just one group of social actors within a broader system of information. This
broader system includes other mass media actors, like movies and books. It includes
other institutional actors, like politicians and non-media corporations. It includes
personal contacts, like your friends and family members. It even includes your personal
experiences, like your attendance at an event or a study abroad experience that
exposed you to a different culture. There are many other potential actors in that
system, but this helps illustrate the notion that journalistic outlets operate within an
environment made up of many different entities, each of which can offer at least some
information that might be of interest to a particular audience member.

    This perspective is helpful because it underscores the importance of understand-
ing the context around people's interaction with information, which is crucial to
understanding journalistic media's role in informing people. That, in turn, is an ex-
plicit rejection of earlier, more simplistic theories about the effects of mass media.
For example, in the 1930s, scholars and popular intellectuals argued that mass media
were incredibly powerful and that people generally accepted the information dissemi-
nated by mass media as-is. (This is called the hypodermic needle perspective.) At the
same time, this systems perspective rejects the view that mass media have little to no
effect -- the limited effects perspective began to take hold as the hypodermic needle

                                                                  - 37 -
                                  Media Dependency Theory

perspective lost popularity in the 1940s and 50s -- as the magnitude of the effect is
dependent on the context.

Journalistic Media and Relationships

    Returning to media dependency theory, it posits that the impacts of journalistic
media on people (and of people on journalistic media) depend on the context and the
nature of the relationships within a network of social actors, technological actants,
and audiences that are relevant to that context.

    The theory further posits that an individual's characteristics and goals (e.g., how
interested they are in some topic), their personal environment and interpersonal network
(e.g., whether they know people with first-hand experience with that topic), and the
dominant media and social systems they live within (e.g., how free they are to access news
media they believe would be informative about that topic) all impact the extent to
which they may depend on media for information about that topic.

    For example, let's consider the topic of foreign election interference in the 2020
election. Perhaps, as someone passionate about politics, you were very interested in
that topic -- and thus have a personal goal of learning more about it. However, because
you were (most likely) not an intelligence officer and lacked the security clearance
needed to review intelligence reports yourself, you probably didn't have the ability to
gain first-hand knowledge about that issue. Moreover, you might not have had any
such intelligence officers in your friend or familial networks, so you didn't personally
know someone with first-hand knowledge, either. You thus had to depend on people
other than yourself (third parties) and those close to you for information. One such
third party might have been a journalist who has been covering the topic of election
interference for months as the National Security Correspondent for The Washington
Post. As such, you might have come to depend on that journalist for what you believed
to be trustworthy information about the topic. (Or, perhaps, you depended on other
journalistic outlets who themselves depended on the Post's reporting for key details.)

    However, that could change over time. Perhaps a reputable whistleblower leaked a
series of private intelligence reports online. Now, you may find yourself dependent on
the whistleblower for access to the information, as they controlled which of the intelli-
gence reports were made available to the public. As you review the leaked documents,
you may become less dependent on others' interpretation of the issue -- including The
Washington Post's reporting. Put another way, as your information network changes,
the kinds and degrees of dependence also change.

                                                                  - 38 -
                                  Media Dependency Theory

Importance of Journalistic Media

    Although journalistic outlets are just one of many sets of constituents within
information systems, they are often important. That's because people generally need
journalistic media to function in modern societies, which are more co-dependent
than ever before due to increased specialization and globalization. Put another way,
personal contacts and experience are no longer enough to satisfy all (or even most) of
the things a person needs to know in order to fully participate in modern social life.

    Crucially, media dependency theory contends that the degree of ambiguity about
news information impacts the degree of media dependency. Put another way, as news
information becomes more ambiguous (less clear to you), audiences are presumed to
become more dependent on journalistic outlets for understanding that news.

    Ambiguity can come from many different sources. It might involve lack of knowl-
edge about some phenomenon, such as whether a new technology developed by a
rival nation poses a threat to your nation's security. It might involve rapid change
associated with a phenomenon, such as whether an emerging coup d'état in a friendly
nation might impact the diplomatic relationship between them and your nation. It
might also involve simple disagreement among institutional elites about some phe-
nomenon, such as which political group is more likely to be correct about the costs
and benefits to a proposed renewable energy plan.

    That proposition from media dependency theory can further be extended into
an argument that journalism can be especially influential on people's understanding of
emerging international affairs. That is, people typically have less certainty (and thus
more ambiguity) when it comes to the world beyond their immediate geographical
sphere because they might not have recent (or any) personal experience in those
contexts -- perhaps they have never been to Cambodia -- and they might not have
any personal contacts who have expert knowledge or experience in those contexts.
Because of this, people become more dependent on media depictions of those places,
peoples, and issues, and on journalistic outlets when new developments are emerging
about those places, peoples, and issues.

Exclusivity and Dependence

    According to media dependency theory, when a media organization has exclusive
information, it tends to have more power within its relationship with an audience member
(and the broader ecosystem) because it increases the degree of information asymmetry.
This is particularly true if the information is in demand to satisfy that individual's
valued goals, and doubly so if access to such information is tightly controlled.

                                                                  - 39 -
                                 Media Dependency Theory

    Exclusive information does not have to mean classified information, as with
the earlier example. It might simply mean that they are the only source for that
information at a given time, such as in the early hours following a chemical explosion
at a local manufacturing plant. While local officials may eventually put out their
account of the event via a televised press conference, people are likely to first hear
about it from the breaking news coverage provided by journalists.

    However, journalistic media do not inherently get to have exclusive information
about breaking news (or confidential affairs). Indeed, some institutional actors, such
as governments or private companies, can restrict both media access to important
resources and individuals' access to certain journalistic outlets. In doing so, those
institutional actors can try to reorient dependency away from journalistic media and
toward their own version of events. For example, a private company may prevent news
media from accessing that manufacturing plant or speaking to its employees. Similarly,
government officials in some countries may even prevent journalistic media from
broadcasting information about the incident until those officials give their approval.
Such intervention happens quite often in practice, to varying degrees.

    It is important to note that media dependency theory was first proposed during a
time of high media concentration, when there were relatively few major broadcast
networks in places like the United States. Today's media ecology is far more complex,
though. In particular, mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and networked media (e.g.,
social media and messaging apps) have become important elements in today's media
ecology. They allow individuals to serve as intermediaries between mass media and
other people. That is, individuals and aggregators with large online followings can
become key brokers of news information during an event and thus gain power -- even
if only temporarily -- by virtue of others' dependence on them. Additionally, people
can now more easily find videos and accounts of an event posted by a range of other
people who observed it first-hand, thus reducing the exclusivity that any one actor
might otherwise have.

            Framing Theory

    Framing theory provides us with a helpful lens for understanding how people
develop their perception of reality, and the role that journalistic outlets play in shaping
those perceptions.

    Framing is deeply indebted to another theoretical perspective -- the Social Con-
struction of Reality -- which was formalized in 1966 by sociologists Peter Berger and
Thomas Luckman. At its core, this perspective argues that a person's perception of
reality is not entirely, or even mainly, objective. Instead, what we perceive to be reality
is actually a human and social construction that is deeply shaped by our previous
lived experiences and the ways in which we are socialized via everyday interactions.
As such, the theory contends, reality becomes socially constructed as we experience
it and learn about it, and we each therefore develop differing perceptions of reality.
Those differences may be fairly minor: Perhaps two witnesses agree that a police
officer acted with the needed force in response to a threat but one of them thinks the
officer could have toned things down a little. However, they might also be significant:
Perhaps those two witnesses disagree over who the aggressor was, and whether any
force was needed on the officer's part.

    This perspective is important because it presumes that individuals act based on
their unique perceptions of reality. For example, if someone perceives the officer to
have acted with unnecessary force, they may be more likely to protest against police
brutality than someone else who perceives that exact same situation to have involved
an appropriate response. As this example suggests, the theory posits that different
people experience different constructed realities -- even when they inhabit the same
spaces under the same present circumstances.

                                                                  - 43 -
                                          Framing Theory

A World With Multiple Realities

    It follows from this theoretical perspective that the world consists of multiple perceived
realities. Those perceived realities are shaped by a range of factors, operating from
an individual level (e.g., one's preconceptions, perhaps resulting from their particular
upbringing) to a social systems level (e.g., the dominant systems of thought within
their culture). In short, while there may indeed be a singular `true' reality out there,
made up of material things and governed by the laws of physics, an individual's
perception of that reality is just an approximation of it. And, sometimes, it's not a very
accurate one.

    A crucial implication of this perspective is that it is simply impossible for journalism
to mirror reality. That is, if a journalist cannot fully capture a `true' reality because
of their human shortcomings, then they cannot possibly replicate it in their work.
Instead, journalism is, at best, a good approximation of reality, with the journalist's
job being to approximate that reality as best they can.

    Even if one rejects the proposition that individuals inherently cannot mirror
reality, there is also a practical issue at play that makes framing theory useful: Even if
journalists could accurately replicate reality, they simply do not have the time or space
to show everything about that reality. Instead, they can only show a small portion of it.

    For example, consider a televised broadcast of a protest against police brutality.
One may think that setting up a camera and pointing it at the crowd offers a mirror of
reality -- after all, it is a simple, mechanical recording of what's happening. However,
the camera can only show one angle of what is happening. Depending on where it is
placed, it may be too close and miss the entire scope of the crowd -- or, it may be too
far and make the crowd appear small or miss important details about the interactions.
As such, the journalist must make a choice to place the camera in the place that they
believe offers the best representation (approximation) of the `reality' of that event.

    But journalists rarely ever just point a camera at something and call it a day. A
large part of their job is to make sense of what is happening. Put another way, even
if they just report `facts' -- and facts are themselves contentious things -- they must
still connect those facts. The process of making sense of reality is inherently an
interpretive (and thus constructive) act.

Media Framing and Frames

    One way to conceptualize that process of sense-making is through framing theory
and, specifically, media framing. Sociologist Robert Entman refers to media framing

                                                                  - 44 -
                                          Framing Theory

as the process by which an individual "selects some aspects of a perceived reality and
makes them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a par-
ticular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment
recommendation for the item described." That's a lot to take in, so let's break it down.

    First, this conceptualization of the framing process -- and there are other ways of
conceptualizing it -- involves two key sub-processes. The first is selection, or the choices
about what to include or exclude about that perceived reality. The second is salience,
or the choices about what to emphasize about that perceived reality and what to
downplay. These choices, again, are often driven by the necessity of communicating
something within a finite amount of time or space -- like a handful of live tweets or a
30-second broadcast segment.

    Second, this conceptualization describes four main acts of framing. The first
is diagnosing problems, or defining the issues associated with a topic. For example,
the aforementioned broadcast segment on a protest may choose to diagnose the
problem as police using excessive force against detainees or as the vilification of
police. The second is diagnosing causes, or identifying what or who are the main forces
driving the problem. For example, that segment may choose to focus on a hurtful
culture within policing or an inadequate amount of police training. The third is
making moral evaluations, which may include asserting whether the causal agents or
the consequences of an issue are good or bad. For example, that segment may assert
that these protests are good because they may serve as catalysts for change, or bad
because the protests are divisive within society. The fourth is recommending treatments,
which describe potential `solutions' to the identified problems. For example, that
segment may assert that systemic reform is necessary or that police should receive
more support from other actors and institutions.

    The result of that process is the media frame, which refers to the written, spoken,
graphical, or visual message that a communicator uses to contextualize a topic, such as a
person, event, episode, or issue, within a text transmitted to receivers by means of
mediation.

    Again, there's a lot to unpack there, but the key takeaway is that media frames are
the tools that communicators -- including journalists -- use to simplify and contex-
tualize an issue or event. A single frame (or media text, like a news story) does not
need to include all four of those acts of media framing. In fact, news stories rarely do,
especially when they aim to be as neutral as possible.

    Moreover, media framing and frames involve both conscious and subconscious
processes of selection and salience. Put another way, a journalist may consciously
adopt a particular frame because it addresses questions they believe their audiences

                                                                  - 45 -
                                          Framing Theory

will want answers to, even as they subconsciously reject alternative frames because
they recall seeing those frames in recent coverage by a competitor.

    Finally, it is crucial to recognize that news stories often include information from
different sources, which in turn shapes the frame. For example, a journalist may only
diagnose the problems associated with the aforementioned protest with their words
but add elements of moral evaluation to the story's frame by including quotes from a
source that asserts the police acted in a brutal and unprofessional way.

Impacts of Journalistic Frames

    Journalistic frames often impact audiences' understandings of and attitudes toward a
topic or issue. In this way, they influence the realities that those audience members
construct. This may include interpretations not only of basic elements, like what
happened, but broader (and no less impactful) notions about what is most important
or problematic about a topic or issue, who are the good and bad people involved, and
what are or aren't sensible solutions to a given problem.

    To illustrate this, consider the two following news briefs about two emerging
treatments for a group of 600 people who have been infected by a dangerous virus.

    The first news brief notes that if Treatment A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.
However, if Treatment B is adopted, there is a 1/3 chance that all 600 people will be
saved and a 2/3 chance that nobody will be saved.

    The second news brief notes that if Treatment A is adopted, 400 people will die.
However, if Treatment B is adopted, there is a 1/3 chance that nobody will die and a
2/3 chance that all 600 people will die.

    The depictions in those two news briefs are functionally equivalent, with Treat-
ment A being the risk-averse option and Treatment B being the risk-seeking option.
However, if a random set of 50 readers were shown the first brief and another 50
random readers were shown the second, the theoretical expectation is that the people
shown the first brief -- which is more positive -- would be more likely to select the
risk-averse option (Treatment A). In contrast, the readers who were shown the second
depiction -- which is more negative -- would be more likely to select the risk-seeking
option (Treatment B). This is an example of what we call gain/loss framing, one of
the many different approaches to framing in psychology.

    However, the extent of those impacts is neither uniform nor universal. Modern
theories of message processing reject the view that audiences are passive and just
accept journalistic frames. Instead, audiences process those messages in light of their

                                                                  - 46 -
                                          Framing Theory

existing knowledge and attitudes, which is in turn shaped by their lived experiences
and non-media messages (e.g., discussions with friends and family). For example, a
person who has had a negative encounter with the police is generally more likely to
accept a frame that centers them as the aggressor -- or, conversely, to reject such a
frame if their experiences have been exclusively positive.

    Repeated exposure to particular frames can develop associations over time. For
example, seeing repeated images of police brutality may link the concepts of police
and brutality over time, such that when the concept of police is triggered -- even in
other contexts -- the individual will also think about brutal actions. Alternatively,
that repeated exposure may make it so that when the concept of brutality comes
up, the individual may think of the police as an example. Such connections can be
both strengthened and weakened by frames. For example, if that same individual is
repeatedly exposed to media examples of police engaging in good deeds, the existing
negative connections are challenged and may thus become weaker.

    Journalistic frames tend to be most impactful in situations where individuals
are highly dependent on journalistic media for their understanding of an issue, and
especially when there is greater ambiguity around an issue. That is because there are
fewer preexisting associations, allowing the media associations to serve as the primary
driver. Thus, journalistic frames are especially impactful when they involve contexts,
people, and ideas that are new or foreign to an individual.

    Finally, it's also important to keep in mind that journalistic actors are themselves
audiences. They therefore not only have their own lived experiences to draw upon
but also regularly consume media messages crafted by other actors. As such, they
are also impacted by repeated exposure to certain frames and associations. They
may consequently go on to subconsciously repeat elements of dominant frames
and associations within their work, which in turn reifies those frames and makes
those associations even more salient within society. Conversely, those journalistic
actors may seek to use their awareness of the dominant frames to challenge them by
including counter-frames that weaken problematic associations.

       Agenda Setting Theory

    Bernard Cohen famously wrote in his 1963 book, The Press and Foreign Policy,
that journalistic media "may not be successful much of the time in telling people what
to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about."

    Although that statement came before the formalization of agenda-setting theory,
it aptly captures its essence: Even if journalistic outlets have a limited ability to shape
their audiences' attitudes toward an issue, they nevertheless exert influence over how
important the issue is perceived to be by those audiences. (That perceived importance
may be very different from the actual importance of that issue according to other
measures.)

    While agenda-setting theory and framing theory both address the potential impact
of journalistic media coverage, they are very different. Agenda-setting theory focuses
on the relationship between media coverage and the perceived importance of an
issue, while framing theory connects media coverage to the formation of attitudes
toward those issues.

Agenda-Setting Theory

    In a nutshell, agenda setting refers to the process by which mass media -- including
journalistic media -- present certain issues (e.g., gun violence) frequently and promi-
nently, with the result being that large segments of the public come to perceive those
issues as being more important than others.

    The central causal mechanism is a very simple one: The more media attention an
issue receives (issue salience), the more important it is perceived to be (by audiences). For
example, if there is sustained journalistic coverage of immigration over the course of
a few months, then news consumers will think that immigration is an important issue
at that point in time -- even if they don't have strong opinions about it.

                                                                  - 49 -
                                    Agenda Setting Theory

    Although the term `agenda-setting theory' may be seen to imply a conspiratorial
effort to manipulate public opinion, this is far from the case. It simply reflects twin
processes: First, journalistic media are bound by time and space. For example, an
evening news broadcast often has just 22 minutes to transmit information about the
day's most important issues and events. This forces journalists to focus on specific
issues and simplify them, and thus make decisions about what they believe matters
most to the audiences they serve. Even with a news website, where space and time
to cover a topic are less restricted and an online editor could theoretically cram 500
stories on the homepage, journalists must still make decisions about how to organize
the information they publish. Indeed, the decision about which story to place at
the top of a website's homepage offers a salience cue -- it is placed first because it is
presumed to be the most important story.

    The second process occurs on the audience side: Audiences turn to journalistic
media because they have a need for orientation, or a desire to understand new or
emerging situations. That need for orientation, in turn, is impacted by two elements:
relevance and uncertainty. Relevance pertains to the question, "Do I think this issue
is personally or socially important to me?" Uncertainty pertains to the question,
"Do I feel I lack the information I need about this topic?" When both relevance and
uncertainty are high, audience members pay greater attention to journalistic outlets'
cues about salience, and thus the resulting agenda-setting effect is stronger.

    Similarly, when the issue at question is unobtrusive -- that is, it is an issue people
have little to no personal experience with, such as international affairs -- then they
are more likely to rely on media cues for assessing the importance of that issue. This
may be countered by certain contextual factors, though. For example, scholars have
found that agenda-setting effects are weaker in closed media systems (those tightly
controlled by governments) with the idea being that people trust those journalistic
media less. They thus actively seek out other sources of information and draw even
more upon personal assessments.

    Agenda-setting effects are therefore not uniform or universal. They are instead
dependent on the context. Indeed, as Cohen wrote about the relationship between
journalistic media and foreign affairs, "the world will look different to different people
depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of
the paper they read."

Intermedia Agenda Setting

    Journalistic outlets do not just influence ordinary citizens, politicians, and the like.
They also influence one another. Within the context of agenda-setting, we refer to the

                                                                  - 50 -
                                    Agenda Setting Theory

process by which journalistic media influence one another as intermedia agenda-setting.
    The core argument for this hypothesis is that just as regular citizens turn to trusted

journalistic outlets for cues about what is important, journalistic outlets themselves
turn to other journalistic media that they perceive to be leaders within a given context.
For example, The New York Times may cover a story about U.S. troops withdrawing
from Syria, which leads a local newspaper to perceive that to be an important issue
and thus devote resources to covering a local angle about the same topic (e.g., covering
local families who might have a spouse or child returning home from deployment).

    This has led to a broader argument that audiences have historically developed
reasonably consistent perceptions of which issues are most important at a given
point in time because journalistic outlets generally follow similar issue agendas. This
does not mean that they all cover the exact same issues, and certainly not in the
same way. Instead, it contends that dominant coverage patterns often emerge across
media -- such as a period of intense and widespread journalistic coverage of climate
change, before that attention wanes and the issue later re-emerges as a priority -- and
that many people within similar contexts will often identify similar sets of issues as
being "important" at a given point in time.

    Intermedia agenda-setting has required some reconceptualization in recent years,
though, because the news ecology has become more complex. The perspective
was initially proposed during a time when traditional media dominated audience
attention. This is no longer the case, as niche and alternative media have grown
immensely -- leading to more specialized information sources -- and social media
have transformed the ways people engage with news.

    As such, while elite journalistic outlets like The New York Times may still shape the
initial perception of issues and their import, active audiences will blend messages from
a greater range of journalistic and non-journalistic media. This ostensibly weakens
the Times' agenda-setting power. Additionally, the transformation of the distribution
of news -- which is also more social today -- and the emergence of new ways for
audiences to engage with journalistic actors has enabled those active audiences to
increasingly shape media agendas themselves.

                                                                  - 51 -

            Priming Theory

    In order to more fully understand the underlying processes for key theories about
the impacts of media coverage and depiction, it is helpful to learn about how human
memory works. Priming theory is a particularly helpful tool in that regard.

    It is worth noting that priming theory -- and associated models theorizing about
the workings of human memory -- come from social psychology and cognition, and it
is not the only explanation for how humans make sense of the world. However, such
models of human memory have proven to be enduring and influential when it comes
to understanding the processing of information disseminated by journalistic outlets.

Priming Theory

    In a nutshell, priming theory contends that media depictions stimulate related
thoughts in the minds of audience members. For example, talking about "climate change"
with a person might activate their thinking about "extreme weather" because, for that
person, those two concepts have become related. Media depictions can strengthen
(or weaken) the association between those concepts.

    In this associative network model of memory, the direction and strength of the ties
between ideas and concepts matter. For example, thinking about "extreme weather"
may trigger "bad" most of the time, but thinking about "bad" may not trigger "extreme
weather" (or trigger it only some of the time). Additionally, stronger ties between two
ideas or concepts will result in the faster recall of the association between them.

    This model also differentiates between explicit and implicit memory. Explicit
memory refers to things an individual actively tries to recall. This would include the
answer to the question, "Who is the best professor you've ever had?" The key with this
type of memory is that the individual can consciously recall the associations between
"best" and "professor" and explain that information.

                                                                  - 53 -
                                          Priming Theory

    Implicit memory refers to things an individual does not try to purposely recall,
such as how to ride a bicycle. The key with this type of memory is that it might take
an individual a while to explain the related concepts (and they may not even be able
to explain them well or at all), but they are able to subconsciously draw on all the
requisite associations to not fall over when they start pedaling.

    Priming theory contends that people do not make use of all of the associations
they have developed. Instead, they take shortcuts to connect an information need -- for
example, how to make sense of a professor's quality -- to the previously stored as-
sociations that are most readily available. Thus, there is a strong emphasis on recent
associations -- such as recent journalistic coverage of the relevant issue(s).

Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming

    Agenda-setting theory connects to these understandings of how human memory
works in two related ways. The first proposes that repeated journalistic coverage of
an issue results in an individual associating that issue with more concepts. That, in
turn, increases the likelihood that the issue will be triggered later (as there are more
opportunities to trigger it). The second proposes that repeated journalistic coverage
of an issue increases the availability of information related to that issue by bringing
it to the top of an individual's mind. That, in turn, increases the likelihood that the
issue will be triggered later (as the issue, and its related concepts, are relatively easy to
access). Both of these ways influence perceptions about how important an issue is
because of how easily it is recalled.

    While framing theory draws upon many of the same core propositions about the
causal mechanisms in human memory, it differs from agenda-setting theory in that it
takes an extra step. Framing theory is not simply about the availability of information.
Instead, it argues that media can also influence attitudes toward those issues by rewiring
the associations between that issue and different concepts, such as by relating "climate
change" to "bad" and "anthropogenic."

    Framing theory and priming theory have been connected to examine issues
of stereotypes in journalistic depictions. For example, scholars have used those
frameworks to assess journalistic outlets' role in promoting associations between
the concepts of "people of color" and "poverty," "crime," and "urban blight." Those
associations may result from the over-representation of crime involving people of
color in local television news coverage. Conversely, primes may be used strategically to
counter stereotypes, such as by depicting people of color as being successful, serving as
community leaders, and inhabiting pleasant neighborhoods. In some cases, however,
primes can result in the rejection of the message being primed. For example, a news

                                                                  - 54 -
                                          Priming Theory

story about a police officer acting in self-defense may be rejected as being false to
someone who has had multiple negative encounters with police, as the depiction of
the officer's actions may appear off-base to that person.

Limitations of Priming Effects

    The effects of priming are neither uniform nor universal, though. In isolation,
priming effects are often short-lived. They can last as little as 90 seconds and weaken
over time if they are not triggered. However, repetition strengthens associations,
and that can lead to more lasting effects over time. Indeed, many of our strongest
associations are those promoted during our youth and reinforced over the course of
our lives as a result of the contexts within which we live.

    For example, higher amounts of local television news viewing will often involve
more exposure to stories about crime that feature people of color as perpetrators.
That, in turn, can result in greater concerns about people of color -- or, at minimum,
the perception that crime by people of color is an important issue.

    Such an effect is not predicated on the words and associations made by journalists
themselves, though. Although journalists may use careful language and avoid stereo-
types, they may choose to quote individuals who intentionally or unintentionally
use language and frames that strengthen and weaken associations between concepts.
Audiences often do not meaningfully differentiate between the journalists' words
and those of their sources. This underscores the responsibility journalists have when
selecting who and what to quote.

    Additionally, media priming is most powerful when individuals have little existing
knowledge about a target concept (e.g., "nuclear power") and are therefore more
susceptible to media-driven associations. Put another way, media primes are especially
impactful when they involve contexts, people, and ideas that are new or foreign to
audiences -- that is, when audiences are most dependent on journalistic outlets for
their understanding of something.

    Individuals do not develop associations between topics through journalistic media
consumption alone, though. First, news is incredibly complex, and there are often
many competing cues within a single journalistic message (e.g., an article), which in
turn trigger multifaceted responses. Second, media environments are also complex,
with journalistic outlets operating alongside entertainment, popular culture, politics,
and so on. Third, individuals establish associations -- and, often, the strongest associa-
tions -- based on their personal experiences or those relayed by other trusted sources,
like their family and friends.

                                                                  - 55 -

    Thus, in order to fully understand a priming effect, one must understand the
environment and context around the prime.

    Key Takeaways

    » At its core, priming theory posits that media depictions develop relation-

        ships between concepts and stimulate related thoughts in the minds of
        audience members.

    » Both agenda-setting theory and framing theory are premised on associa-

        tive network models of human memory, which focus on the associations
        between concepts and the ease through which they may be recalled. How-
        ever, they presume different pathways for the activation of concepts.

   News Avoidance and Fatigue

    News avoidance refers to a phenomenon where audiences reduce their consumption
of journalistic media over a continuous period of time due to either an active dislike for
news or a preference for other kinds of media content.

    Although many theories about the impacts of journalistic media implicitly assume
that large portions of the public regularly consume those media, it is important
to recognize that large segments of the population don't actually do that. Indeed,
although more journalism is produced today than ever before, the number of people
who avoid journalism has also increased in recent decades.

    Moreover, audiences' journalistic media use is usually characterized by a combi-
nation of genres, such as sports journalism, political journalism, and environmental
journalism. News avoidance is typically linked to the exclusion of certain genres and
issues (though it may be extended to all journalistic media use). Put another way, some
people (in fact, many) may routinely take in sports journalism but intentionally seek
to avoid political journalism.

    This development can have profound impacts on democratic societies that pre-
sumably rely upon a well-informed citizenry to self-govern because higher levels of
news exposure have historically been linked to greater amounts of political knowledge
and engagement. Second, news avoidance has negative economic consequences for
journalistic outlets as it reduces the potential size of its audience. That, in turn, can
also have consequences for non-avoiders, as journalistic outlets have fewer resources
with which to produce quality journalism.

Intentional and Unintentional Avoidance

    There are many reasons why an audience member may engage in news avoidance,
but they can usually be placed into one of two categories: intentional avoidance and

                                                                  - 57 -
                                News Avoidance and Fatigue

unintentional avoidance.

    Intentional avoidance is the consequence of individuals consciously tuning out
news media. There are three main reasons why they engage in such behavior, all of
which are linked to negative dispositions toward journalistic media.

    The first reason is that they perceive news coverage to be too negative and pes-
simistic. While some audiences are drawn to particularly negative or pessimistic news
(e.g., violent crime), such news has been linked to increases in negative emotions and
decreases in an individual's well-being over time. The desire to seek positive emotions
can thus result in intentional avoidance of news that is presumed to be too negative.

    The second reason is that some audiences do not trust journalistic outlets. This
may be due to a perception that certain groups of journalistic outlets -- if not "the
media" as a whole -- are pushing their own political and economic interests by being
selective about the topics they cover and the information they include in their coverage.
The perception that such coverage will be biased against a person's viewpoints or
perception of reality can thus encourage intentional avoidance.

    The third reason is that there is always a massive amount of readily accessible
journalistic products out there, which can create a feeling of information overload.
Not only is there a seemingly endless pool of issues being covered at any given
moment, but there is also a seemingly endless pool of stories about each issue -- which
is impossible for any single person to consume or process. That perceived overload
can create stress, confusion, and anxiety, and thus result in intentional avoidance in
order for a person to reclaim a positive emotional state.

    There is also unintentional news avoidance, which is based on the audience mem-
ber's relative preference for non-journalistic media. Put another way, the avoidance
isn't because a person is actively seeking to avoid journalistic media but rather because
their preference for another choice -- perhaps a new movie featuring Ryan Gosling -- is
stronger. Indeed, scholars have argued that the large audiences drawn by television
news broadcasts in the 1960s and 1970s were due in part to audiences watching
the news while they waited for the evening entertainment programs to start (which
followed the nightly newscasts).

News Fatigue

    News avoidance does not have to reflect a permanent state wherein audience
members always avoid certain kinds of journalistic products, or journalistic media
altogether. Quite often, it is a temporary state, as when individuals feel overwhelmed
and need to take a break from an issue.

                                                                  - 58 -
                                News Avoidance and Fatigue

    For example, consider the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. After being exposed to
several stories about the pandemic every day for months, a person may have felt the
need to disconnect from their preferred news sources to keep their mental state from
deteriorating. However, after taking a break, that person may have resumed taking in
such stories -- and perhaps needed another break later on.

    We can call this phenomenon news fatigue, which connotes a temporary feeling
of exhaustion that can be addressed through a period of disconnection (recharging).
News fatigue can occur in relation to any kind of issue or genre, such as a royal
wedding or political journalism. However, it is typically most pronounced when it
comes to natural disasters, illnesses, poverty, and political issues that, by their very
nature, already tend to engender negative emotional responses.

Compassion Fatigue

    Similarly, there is a phenomenon called compassion fatigue, which refers to the
gradual lessening of compassion over time as a result of repeated exposure to traumatic
phenomena. For example, consider the refugee crisis resulting from the Syrian Civil
War, wherein at least 13 million Syrians were estimated to have been displaced and in
need of humanitarian assistance. As the war dragged on over years, audiences around
the world moved from being shocked to becoming numbed in order to psychologically
protect themselves from repeated exposure to the death and destruction featured in
news reports about the war.

    Compassion fatigue has been associated with increased feelings of hopelessness
and negative attitudes. That, in turn, can lead to desensitization and even resistance to
helping those suffering if the issue is perceived as being intractable, or impossible to
manage or change. Consequently, individuals may seek to turn off certain emotions
as best they can. Compassion fatigue can also impact political and economic support
for initiatives to address that issue. For example, in the aforementioned example of
the Syrian Civil War, well-informed but fatigued news consumers may be less likely to
become involved in protests against the war than their less-informed but non-fatigued
counterparts.

    This phenomenon is not limited to news audiences or to journalism. It has been
found to impact a range of professionals, including doctors, child welfare workers,
and lawyers. However, it has been found to have profound impacts on journalists
themselves -- and especially foreign correspondents who are shuttled from one crisis
to another. Those impacts involve not only their emotional and mental states but also
the depictions (and tropes) they incorporate into their journalistic work.

                                                                  - 59 -
                                News Avoidance and Fatigue

Combating News Avoidance

    Several strategies have been proposed to reduce the likelihood of news avoidance.
The first is to engage in approaches to journalism like constructive journalism and
solutions journalism.

    Constructive journalism aims to rebalance journalism by accompanying a selection
of predominantly negative news stories about an issue with more positive coverage
that illustrates the bright spots -- however few they may be -- related to that issue.
For example, this might involve stories about how some Syrian refugees were able to
successfully relocate themselves and start new lives, or how a local non-profit helped
provide needed aid to displaced refugees.

    Solutions journalism aims to not only diagnose problems -- like the reasons for the
displacement of Syrians during the war -- but also adopt a forward-looking perspective
that identifies possible solutions. Solutions journalism also tends to offer concrete
suggestions to audiences for how to become a part of possible solutions. This may
include providing contact information for local nonprofits or identifying specific
humanitarian aid legislation that is under consideration.

    The second strategy is to look for ways to increase trust in news organizations,
such as by being more transparent about how stories are reported and explaining
the journalistic processes behind them. For example, this might entail appending
an information box to a story that contains anonymous sources that explains the
journalistic organization's policy on granting anonymity. It may also include an
explanation that a product reviewer was not paid for the review, but that the outlet
may receive money if audiences purchase the product from an affiliated online store.

    A third strategy that has received more attention in recent years is to provide
slow journalism alternatives. This approach moves away from providing many short
and episodic breaking news products (e.g., breaking news stories or tweets). Instead,
it promotes providing fewer, longer, and more holistic news products (e.g., a well-
reported and in-depth story published a couple of days after the news first broke).
The approach is not intended to replace traditional journalism but simply to offer a
complement for those who feel stressed by information overload.

                                                                  - 60 -

       Journalistic Cultures

    According to media scholar Mark Deuze, journalism -- especially in Western
societies in the Global North -- is generally made up in part by five central values.
Together, those values add up to what Deuze calls the occupational ideology of journalism.

    The first value Deuze identifies is that journalists should provide a public service
to the citizens of a given country. The second is that journalists should be impartial,
fair, and objective. The third is that journalists must be autonomous and independent
in their work. The fourth is that journalists must have a sense of immediacy and the
ability to be expedient in their reporting. The fifth is that journalists must have a
strong sense of ethics that is consistent with broader professional codes of ethics.

    It is important to note that just because such an ideology exists does not mean that
the way in which journalism is practiced in those places actually reflects those values.
Put another way, in some places, journalism is hardly impartial in practice even if
journalists in those places consider that value to be important. However, those cultural
values are important to how the majority journalists in those places self-identify, how
they think about their work, and how they collectively try to legitimize themselves to
their society. Such values also come up in popular media about journalism, such as
American movies that portray journalists as independent truth-tellers.

Breaking Down Journalistic Cultures

    What Deuze is effectively suggesting is that although journalism may be performed
differently in different places, there is a general journalistic culture that spans many of
those places.

    However, although useful as a starting point, Deuze's theorizing is a reflection
of Western ideology rooted in the Global North. For example, those values implic-
itly assume a separation of powers that is accomplished through systems of checks

                                                                  - 65 -
                                     Journalistic Cultures

and balances, with journalistic outlets informally serving as one such check. Addi-
tionally, those values also assume that journalistic outlets have the ability to remain
independent from government. This is obviously not the case in many places.

    Scholars have thus sought to move away from trying to find some universal jour-
nalistic culture and instead move toward demarcating different aspects of journalistic
cultures that allow for comparisons across contexts.

    One such model comes from the Worlds of Journalism project, which has ex-
amined dozens of countries. The researchers behind the project break journalistic
culture into two sets of dimensions: extrinsic and intrinsic.

Extrinsic Dimensions of Journalistic Culture

    The extrinsic dimensions of journalistic culture include their perceived influences
and editorial autonomy. We refer to these as extrinsic dimensions because they pertain
to journalists' experiences of, and reflections on, the external constraints placed upon
them.

    Perceived influences refer to journalists' (or other journalistic actors') subjective
perceptions of the various forces that can shape the news production process. These include
the media laws that govern those actors, the feedback they get from their audiences,
and the availability of newsgathering resources. The emphasis here is not only on the
extent to which journalists are aware of those influences -- that is, whether they know
about a specific law -- but also on the degree to which they think those influences
play an important role in their work. For example, a journalist may be aware of what
their audience thinks about their work but they may not care a great deal about it.

    Journalists' perceptions serve as a filter through which real, external pressures are
translated into consciously experienced influences. Notably, scholars have found that
there is often a gap between those real, external pressures and journalists' perceptions
of them. Put another way, journalists sometimes perceive external pressures to be
more or less constraining than they actually are, and they act in accordance to those
perceptions rather than the reality.

    Editorial autonomy pertains to the degree of independence that journalists believe
they have when performing essential journalistic acts, such as selecting the stories they
want to cover, which aspects of those stories to emphasize, and which sources of
information to draw upon. This is closely related to journalists' perceived influences,
but it focuses on the organizational level. That is, this dimension underscores the
extent to which journalistic organizations within a culture typically have owners,

                                                                  - 66 -
                                     Journalistic Cultures

managers, and editors (as well as organizational structures) that give journalists the
necessary freedom to perform their work independently.

Intrinsic Dimensions of Journalistic Culture

    The intrinsic dimensions of journalistic culture include journalistic role orienta-
tions, ethical considerations, and their trust in institutions. We refer to these as intrinsic
dimensions because they represent discourses of professional self-awareness in which
journalists internally negotiate the appropriateness of certain journalistic norms, val-
ues, and practices.

    Role orientations refers to how journalists think about their social purpose within a
society, and to whom and how they direct their journalistic ambitions. For example, in the
United States, this may involve being a detached observer of events. In contrast, in
the United Arab Emirates, this may involve seeking to influence public opinion. Such
roles often feel evident, natural, and self-explanatory to the journalists within a given
context.

    Ethical considerations refers to journalists' perceptions of the appropriate responses to
situations in which their actions can have potentially harmful consequences for individuals,
groups, or society as a whole. For example, when covering the murder of a minor, jour-
nalists need to weigh the public's `right' to know against the family's `right' to privacy.
That calculus may be different across contexts. This dimension thus underscores both
the degree to which journalists should adhere to professional codes of ethics as well
as the extent to which they believe certain controversial journalistic practices -- like
bribing officials for information -- are acceptable.

    Trust in institutions refers to the willingness of a journalist to believe the information
provided by public institutions, such as the federal government, the judiciary, and
political parties. For example, in countries where journalistic media are likely to trust
public institutions, journalists are more likely to defer to those institutions' accounts
of events and statistics -- especially if the journalist has no way of bearing witness
first-hand. Conversely, when that trust is low, journalists are more likely to be critical
of such information, or simply choose to ignore it altogether.

Why Journalistic Cultures Matter

    Journalistic cultures shape (and are shaped by) how journalists think and, consequently,
influence how they act. There is, again, often a disconnect between what journalists
think and what they do. Nevertheless, what they do is often influenced -- at least ini-
tially -- by what they think. For example, a journalist may choose to not go undercover

                                                                  - 67 -
                                     Journalistic Cultures

or lie about their identity because they believe that would go against a professional
code of ethics. They may thus try to get the story through other means first.

    Additionally, journalistic cultures impact what is seen as legitimate work among
fellow journalistic actors. That, in turn, impacts who and what are symbolically cel-
ebrated -- that is, who are treated as "good" journalists or what is treated as "good"
journalism. This has material implications, such as the kinds of job offers, promotions,
awards, and so on that might be extended to a certain kind of journalist or journalism.

    Finally, journalistic cultures impact how journalistic actors legitimize their work to
society. This, in turn, affects how societies think about journalism and the kinds
of access and protections that other institutional actors (e.g., governments or even
sports teams) are willing to grant those journalists. For example, in a society where
journalists are seen as an unofficial branch of government for the purposes of checks
and balances -- as is the case in the United States -- then that society is likely to support
limited government interference in news production and distribution.

    It is important to note that such cultures are not static, though. They can and
do change over time. For example, the journalistic culture in the United States only
generally adopted the journalistic value of neutrality in the early 20th century. More
recently, there have been rumblings within that culture to shift away from the value
of "balance" and toward a "weight-of-evidence" approach, especially when it comes to
scientific issues like climate change.

    Similar kinds of transitions have occurred elsewhere in the world. Specifically, as
the world has become more interconnected -- and journalism from other places has
become more easily accessible -- there has been some natural blending of journalistic
cultures. In some cases, there is pressure to adopt values and practices from other
journalistic cultures, as with private media in some countries in the Global South
taking a more consumer-oriented approach to journalism from the Global North.
Additionally, as the reach of some global journalistic outlets like The New York Times
and the BBC increases, so does the cultural influence of their approach to journal-
ism. However, although we find increased interconnection to perhaps promote the
formulation of a more homogeneous culture, research has shown us that important
distinctions remain.

Key Takeaways

» Different countries have distinct journalistic cultures. There is no single,

   universal way of doing journalism, though some values and norms are
   more common than others across contexts.

» Scholars have broken journalistic cultures into two sets of dimensions:

   extrinsic and intrinsic.

» Extrinsic dimensions include journalists' perceived influences as well as

   their editorial autonomy.

» Intrinsic dimensions include journalists' role orientations, their ethical

   considerations, and their trust in institutions.

» Journalistic cultures matter because they shape (and are shaped by) how

   journalists think, act, and legitimize themselves to their peers and to soci-
   ety.

          Role Orientations

    The concept of role orientation refers to how journalists think about their social
purpose within a society, and to whom and how they direct their journalistic ambitions.

    It is important to distinguish between role orientation and role performance,
though the two are linked. Role orientation refers to how journalistic actors think
whereas role performance refers to how they act, which may be limited by a range
of structural factors. As such, the role orientations journalists believe most strongly
in may not entirely reflect the reality of what those journalists actually do in a given
context. Nevertheless, they play a major role in determining how journalism and
journalists are legitimized within that context.

Types of Role Orientations
    The Worlds of Journalism project has identified four main journalistic role ori-

entations: the monitorial role, the collaborative role, the interventionist role, and the
accommodative role. These roles are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they operate
on continuums, such that a journalist may adhere strongly to both monitorial and
interventionist roles. Additionally, these roles refer to the most prevalent ways of
thinking within a country but recognize that there is also a lot of variation within
countries and within specific subfields or genres of journalism.

    It is also important to note that other scholars have come up with different ty-
pologies. However, the Worlds of Journalism typology is particularly useful because
of its theoretical rigor and the global scope of that project, which allows for broad
comparisons across countries.

                                                                  - 71 -
                                        Role Orientations

Monitorial Role

    The monitorial role is broadly grounded in the ideal of journalism acting as a
"Fourth Estate" that holds those in power to account, keeps citizens aware of major
political and social developments, and strives to foster a critical-minded citizenry.
Put another way, the legitimacy of journalists to act in a monitorial role is anchored
in journalism's relationship with political authorities. Journalists may act as critical
observers of political decisions and other political conduct, publishing objective
stories as they become aware of transgressions. They may also act more proactively to
investigate and scrutinize government claims and gather information about issues they
consider suspicious. The `watchdog' function of journalism is thus closely associated
with this role.

    Journalists who subscribe to this role are thus more likely to say that their job is to
"provide political information," to "monitor and scrutinize politics," to "monitor and
scrutinize business," and to "motivate people to participate in politics." The countries
that tend to subscribe strongly to this role orientation include Denmark, Sweden, and
the United States.

Collaborative Role

    The collaborative role is quite different from the monitorial role. In this role,
journalists act as partners of the government and support it in its efforts to bring
about socioeconomic development and social well-being. This role orientation calls
on journalists to support authorities in defense of the social order against threats of
crime, conflict, and natural emergencies. Put another way, in this role, journalists may
(but do not always) actively defend the government and its policies by acting as pro-
pagandists. However, they may also serve as simple facilitators by voluntarily assisting
the government in its efforts to maintain social harmony, preserve national unity, and
promote nation-building. Furthermore, journalists may see it as their responsibility to
provide legitimacy to the government by explaining political decisions to citizens and
helping guide public opinion. This may involve adopting a `mouthpiece' function,
whereby journalists simply aim to improve one-way communication from government
officials to citizens.

    Journalists who subscribe to this role are thus more likely to say that their job is to
"support government policy" and "convey a positive image of political leaders." The
countries that tend to subscribe strongly to this role orientation include China, Qatar,
and Singapore.

                                                                  - 72 -
                                        Role Orientations

Interventionist Role

    The interventionist role is characterized by a strong inclination toward pursuing
a particular mission and promoting certain values. Interventionist journalists are
typically involved, socially committed, and motivated to engage in social affairs by
thinking of themselves as active participants in political life rather than as neutral
scribes. These journalists may thus act as advocates for particular groups and causes,
as missionaries for certain values and ideologies, and as agents for social change. This
can include thinking of oneself as a spokesperson for the socially disadvantaged but
also as active promoters for causes like the preservation of indigenous cultures or for
political positions associated with certain political parties. Put another way, journalists
who identify with this role orientation seek to move society toward what they think
it can become, rather than just trying to mirror a contemporary social reality.

    Journalists who subscribe to this role are thus more likely to say that their job is to
"advocate for social change," to "influence public opinion," to "set the political agenda,"
and to "support national development." The countries that tend to subscribe strongly
to this role include Croatia, Cyprus, and Tanzania.

Accommodative Role

    The accommodative role is, among all these four role dimensions, the one most
strongly oriented toward viewing journalistic audiences as consumers (rather than
citizens). Journalists who embrace an accommodative role strive to provide their audi-
ences with the sort of information that appeals most to the public. This role could take
the form of consumer journalism, which features reviews of commercial products and
evaluations of leisure-time activities, as well as `news-you-can-use' content like advice
columns and information about the management of everyday social life. Put another
way, this role orientation places less of an emphasis on public service journalism and
more emphasis on so-called `soft news' journalism -- provided that is what journalistic
audiences want.

    Journalists who subscribe to this role are thus more likely to say that their job is
to "provide entertainment and relaxation," to "provide news that attracts the largest
audience," and to "provide advice, orientation, and direction for daily life." The
countries that tend to subscribe strongly to this role orientation include Austria,
Germany, and Iceland.

Synthesizing Global Roles

    The Worlds of Journalism research has found, through their study of 66 countries
between 2012 and 2016, that the ideological core of journalism is still linked to

                                                                  - 73 -
                                        Role Orientations

journalism's political obligations. Journalists around the world generally link, at least
in their minds, journalism to the promotion of political self-governance by articulating
support for such journalistic functions like being an informer, a watchdog, and a
disseminator of information. Overall, their results show that journalists around the
world generally share a common understanding of how journalism should serve
society via an emphasis on values connected to the monitorial role.

    However, this does not mean that there is a single, universal understanding of
role orientations that permeates all journalistic cultures. While the monitorial role
receives the greatest amount of support overall, it is more prevalent in the Western
world than the non-Western world. Meanwhile, the collaborative role receives far
less support overall but it is valued more in the non-Western world than the Western
world. The interventionist and accommodative roles find similar levels of support
around the world, but the interventionist role is more strongly supported in countries
with lower levels of economic development as well as those that have recently faced
disruptive political changes. In contrast, the accommodative role is more likely to
garner support in more economically developed and stable countries.

    Taken as a whole, the Worlds of Journalism project finds that while there are
important commonalities across the globe when it comes to journalistic role orienta-
tions, political, economic, social, and cultural factors all influence the extent to which
those values are subscribed to within those countries. This lends support to the basic
proposition that social systems leave an imprint on journalistic roles even as some
roles, like the monitorial role, do transcend local contexts.

    Key Takeaways

    » There are four main, overarching role orientations for journalism, accord-

        ing to the Worlds of Journalism project. They are the monitorial role, the
        collaborative role, the interventionist role, and the accommodative role.

    » Role orientations do not necessarily reflect practice. Instead, they reflect

        ways of thinking about journalism, which is presumed to have some effect
        on its practice as well as on how journalism is legitimated within a society.

      Ethical Considerations

    The concept of ethical considerations refers to journalists' perceptions of the appropri-
ate responses to situations in which their actions can have potentially harmful consequences.

    Journalists are required to make ethical decisions every day as they go about
covering the news. Such decisions can involve whether it is okay to pay a source for
information or whether it is okay to misrepresent oneself in order to gain the access
needed to report a story. Indeed, journalism is often described rather pointedly as a
"moral calling."

    The notion of ethical considerations covers two distinct dimensions. The first
is one's ethical orientation, or the philosophy that a journalistic actor draws upon to
ascertain if something is ethical or not (i.e., moral or amoral). The second is one's
justification of controversial newsgathering practices, or how appropriate a journalistic
actor believes specific techniques to be within the context of journalism.

    It is important to distinguish between these ethical considerations and what
journalists actually do, though the two are linked. Ethical considerations cover how
journalistic actors think, which may differ from the reality of what they do, perhaps
because of particular structural constraints those journalists face. Nevertheless, the
dominant ethics-related ideological patterns still play a role in broadly legitimizing
journalism and journalists within a society, and influence how journalistic actors
self-regulate within a professional context.

Ethical Orientations

    The Worlds of Journalism project has examined the concept of ethical orientations
by focusing on four philosophies: absolutism, situationism, exceptionism, and subjectivism.

    Absolutism contends that moral rules are to be followed the same way at all
times. Journalists who subscribe to this perspective are more likely to say things

                                                                  - 77 -
                                    Ethical Considerations

like, "journalists should always adhere to codes of professional ethics, regardless of
situation and context." This was the dominant ethical orientation in nearly all of the
66 countries evaluated by the Worlds of Journalism team in a series of large-scale
surveys of journalists between 2012 and 2016. The countries that subscribed to this
orientation most strongly included Italy, Portugal, and the United States.

    Situationism argues that it is the situation that determines which solution is most
ethical. Journalists who subscribe to this perspective are more likely to say things like,
"what is ethical in journalism depends on the specific situation." The countries that
subscribed most strongly to this orientation included Bhutan, Moldova, and Russia.

    Exceptionism contends that there are some moral rules that should be followed
most of the time but it is acceptable to occasionally waive them if needed. Journalists
who subscribe to this perspective are more likely to say things like, "it is acceptable to
set aside moral standards if extraordinary circumstances require it." The countries that
subscribed most strongly to this orientation included the Czech Republic, Ethiopia,
and Singapore.

    Subjectivism posits that moral judgments should depend primarily on one's own
personal values rather than any objective code that all people (or journalists) should
adhere to. Journalists who subscribe to this perspective are more likely to say things
like, "what is ethical in journalism is a matter of personal judgment." This is the ethical
orientation that is least commonly subscribed to across the world, according to the
Worlds of Journalism research. However, the countries that subscribed most strongly
to this orientation included Oman, Qatar, and Sudan.

Justifications of Controversial Practices

    The Worlds of Journalism project also evaluated the extent to which a few contro-
versial newsgathering practices were perceived to be justifiable by asking journalists
to evaluate them as either always justified, justified on occasion, and not justifiable
when reporting on an important story.

    The practice that was seen to be most justifiable overall -- that is, it was seen as
being justifiable either all of the time or at least some of the time -- involved "using
hidden microphones or cameras." Globally, that practice was deemed to be always
justified by 10% of journalists and justified on occasion by 57% of them. It received
the most approval in Latvia, Norway, and Denmark during the 2012-2016 surveys.

    Another practice that was seen to be justifiable at least some of the time by most
journalists worldwide was "using confidential business or government documents
without authorization." That practice was deemed to be always justified by 13% of

                                                                  - 78 -

journalists and justified on occasion by 52% of them. It received the most approval
in France, Japan, and Sweden.

    A third practice, "claiming to be somebody else," received lower approval ratings
worldwide. That practice was deemed to be always justified by 7% of journalists and
justified on occasion by 41%. It received the most approval in China, Romania, and
South Korea.

    The practice of "paying people for confidential information" also received lower
levels of approval. Globally, that practice was deemed to be always justified by 6% of
journalists and justified on occasion by 36% of them. It received the most approval
in Albania, Bhutan, and China.

    Finally, the practice of "accepting money from sources" received exceptionally
low levels of approval worldwide. That practice was deemed to be always justified by
4% of journalists and justified on occasion by 6% of them. The only country in which
this practice was seen as being justified by the majority of journalists was Tanzania. In
the majority of countries, less than 5% of journalists said it was acceptable even just
on occasion.

Synthesizing Ethical Considerations

    After examining 66 countries between 2012 and 2016, the Worlds of Journalism
researchers concluded there is hybridity in journalists' ethical orientations and their
acceptance of controversial practices. Put another way, although there was a broad
inclination toward an absolutist ethical orientation worldwide, different countries and
regions had unique combinations of absolutism with situationism, subjectivism, and
exceptionism -- and those combinations further intersected in different ways with
proclivities toward controversial practices.

    Regionally, countries in the Global North were the ones most associated with
absolutism. Additionally, the researchers found that democratic and journalistic
freedoms, professional values toward autonomy and independence, and the cultural
value of uncertainty avoidance also played an important role in determining ethical
orientations. In countries that impose fewer constraints on journalists, most journalists
privilege absolutism in their ethical orientation. Adherence to subjectivism, which
was the orientation least accepted by journalists, was more evident in countries in the
Middle East and North Africa, where political and press freedoms are more limited,
there are often greater levels of corruption, and the professional values of autonomy
and independence are rated lower.

                                                                  - 79 -
                                    Ethical Considerations

    With regard to controversial practices, the relationships were less clear-cut. Journal-
ists in countries that score higher in press freedom, and in which journalists experience
greater autonomy and fewer internal pressures, tended to believe that some controver-
sial practices sometimes associated with watchdog journalism -- like using confidential
documents without authorization and using hidden recording devices -- were justi-
fiable for important stories. Again, many of these are countries in the Global North,
though there were multiple exceptions to that pattern. Conversely, many other con-
troversial practices -- like misrepresenting oneself, paying for sources, and receiving
payment from sources -- were typically found in countries with lower levels of socioe-
conomic development.

    Taken as a whole, the Worlds of Journalism project found ethical ideologies in jour-
nalism are multidimensional and pluralistic -- meaning that they are very dependent
on the context. That context, in turn, is shaped by a country's degree of press freedom,
democratic development, corruption, human development, and emancipative values.
This helps to explain why there are still significant differences among some countries,
even as there does appear to be at least some agreement among many journalists
around the globe about what it means to be an ethical journalist.

    Key Takeaways

    » Globally, absolutism is the most prevalent ethical orientation. However,

        that orientation is sometimes mixed with values associated with other
        orientations, creating some diversity in ethical approaches.

    » There is considerable variation across countries in terms of support for

        controversial newsgathering practices. Some practices, like using hidden
        microphones and cameras, are seen as being justifiable at least some of the
        time for important stories. Others, like receiving payment from sources,
        are almost always frowned upon.

    » The degree of adherence to certain ethical orientations and support for

        controversial newsgathering practices is influenced by a range of factors,
        including a country's degree of press freedom, professional values toward
        autonomy and independence, and cultural values regarding the avoidance
        of uncertainty.

                                                                  - 80 -

        Trust in Institutions

    The concept of journalistic trust in institutions refers to the willingness of a journalist
to believe the information provided by public institutions.

    Journalists are important intermediaries between public institutions -- like the
government, the judiciary, and political parties -- and their audiences. In most places,
they serve as crucial links between ordinary citizens and the authorities who are
supposed to represent them and who govern their lives. Indeed, citizens often do not
get to meet those institutions or the individuals within them, nor do those citizens
partake in the day-to-day work of governance. For example, few of us have ever met
a sitting president of the United States or been part of a private Senate Intelligence
Committee hearing. Instead, we rely on journalistic media to keep us informed about
those institutions and officials.

    In this context, journalistic media can play both constructive and destructive roles.
For example, sustained pessimism about the motivations of public institutions and
negative coverage of their actions can contribute to public disdain for political actors.
Conversely, journalism can also create and consolidate people's trust in those same
public institutions and ensure that those institutions live up to certain standards.

    Additionally, the way in which journalists depict public institutions is often con-
nected to their own level of trust in them. Indeed, in many journalistic cultures, a
certain degree of skepticism is built deeply into their journalism's professional ideol-
ogy. In such places, journalists must therefore walk a tightrope between exercising a
healthy amount of skepticism and instigating cynicism.

Kinds of Public Institutions

    The Worlds of Journalism project has examined two distinct types of public
institutions in a series of surveys between 2012 and 2016: representative institutions

                                                                  - 81 -
                                      Trust in Institutions

and regulative institutions.

    Representative institutions are those that are responsible for democratic represen-
tation and political decision-making. They include institutions like parliament (or, in
places like the U.S., Congress), government (or, in places like the U.S., the Executive
Branch), political parties, and politicians (in general). Overall, journalists around the
world have tended to have fairly little trust in representative institutions. Among
them, the most trusted was parliament, which received an average rating between
"low trust" and "some trust." This was followed by institutions most akin to the U.S.'s
Executive Branch. Political parties tend to receive the lowest ratings.

    Regulative institutions are those that implement the decisions made by represen-
tative institutions. They include the judiciary, military, and police. Overall, journalists
around the world have tended to have the greatest amount of trust in the judiciary.
However, even then that trust was low, with the average rating being "some trust."
This was followed by the police and the military, both of which actually received
higher ratings than any representative institution.

Synthesizing Trust

    After examining 66 countries, the Worlds of Journalism researchers concluded
that journalists around the world are generally skeptical of public institutions. Overall,
their ratings tended to fall between "little" to "some" trust in institutions. They did,
however, have relatively more confidence in regulative institutions than in representa-
tive ones. In particular, journalists in most countries tended to have especially low
trust in politicians (in general) as well as the political parties they belong to. These
findings are consistent with journalists' general preference for a monitorial profes-
sional role orientation since it calls attention to journalists' perceived need to keep
tabs on what government and the powerful are up to.

    However, although these findings were consistent across many countries, they
were not unanimous. The researchers found no significant linear relationship between
journalists' trust in institutions and contextual factors like press freedom, democracy,
the rule of law, and economic performance. The only factor that was consistent had
to do with corruption: Countries in which corruption was low tended to have the
highest levels of trust in institutions among journalists.

    There were, however, many exceptions to that finding, too. For example, journal-
ists in the United States, which has historically been considered to have low levels
of corruption, exhibited relatively low levels of trust in institutions. This is likely
due to the United States' emphasis on watchdog reporting and the history of how

                                                                  - 82 -
                                      Trust in Institutions

professional journalism developed there. Indeed, this attitude is well captured by
former Boston Globe journalist Bob Anglin, who wrote more than thirty years ago:
"Show me a reporter with a respect for authority, and I'll show you a lousy reporter."

    Conversely, journalists in countries like Bhutan and India, which have not been
historically considered to have low levels of corruption, exhibited high levels of trust
in institutions. In the case of Bhutan, the researchers hypothesized that it had to do
with the fact that it was still a new democracy when they interviewed journalists, and
they thus suspected that it was due to a "honeymoon" period of sorts. However, they
have generally found that journalists in the younger democracies, and particularly in
Eastern and Central Europe (e.g., Albania, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Kosovo,
Moldova, Romania, and Serbia), tended to have relatively lower levels of trust in
public institutions. In many of those cases, the political, economic, and cultural
transitions have been complicated and resulted in social inequalities, which in turn
raises skepticism toward the public institutions charged with representing citizens
and implementing political decisions.

    Taken as a whole, the Worlds of Journalism project thus finds that there is near-
universal skepticism of public institutions by journalists, but that the degree of trust
(or lack thereof ) is still dependent on different contextual factors -- even as it remains
unclear exactly which contextual factors best explain the differences. The broader
implication is that journalists may approach those institutions with a critical eye -- at
least as far as other structural factors (e.g., protections from government interference)
will allow them to -- but they must take care to not simply reproduce that skepticism
and, in turn, breed cynicism.

    Key Takeaways

    » Globally, journalists are generally very skeptical of public institutions. This

        is consistent with their proclivity toward the monitorial role of journalism.

    » Trust is lower for representative institutions, or those responsible for demo-

        cratic representation and political decision-making, than for regulative
        institutions, or those responsible for implementing and adjucticating those
        decisions.

    » Levels of trust in institutions are dependent on contextual factors, though

        scholars have yet to identify exactly which factors are most explanatory.

                                                                  - 83 -

 Hierarchy of Influences Model

    The Hierarchy of Influences Model is a useful framework for describing many of
the things that affect the news content that audiences see, hear, and read. The model
was proposed by media scholars Pamela Shoemaker and Stephen Reese in their 1996
book, Mediating the Message. The crucial intervention of this model is that it helped
formalize the idea that there are a number of different factors that influence news content,
and that those factors operate across different levels, from the micro (individual) to the
macro (society).

    Put another way, individuals operate within larger social, economic, political, and
technical systems and structures. Those systems and structures in turn influence how
journalistic actors think and how they go about their work. That, in turn, influences
the journalistic products that those actors produce.

    The Hierarchy of Influences Model wasn't designed to propose or explain causal
relationships, such as if X happens then Y will happen. Instead, it is particularly
useful in helping us appreciate that journalism isn't shaped just by journalists or the
organizations they work for. It is also shaped by a number of other factors.

Levels of Analysis
    The Hierarchy of Influences Model identifies five levels of influence: the individual

level, the routine level, the organizational level, the social-institutional level, and the
social systems level. These levels are ordered from the micro (smallest in scope) to
the macro (broadest in scope), and the model presents them as a series of concentric
circles.

                                                                  - 87 -

Individual Level

    The individual level refers to the biographical, psychological, and sociological char-
acteristics of an individual social actor. For example, a journalist's age, gender, sexual
orientation, race, ethnicity, and class status can all impact the news that person pro-
duces because previous life experiences associated with those attributes may color
that person's interpretation of an issue or what they choose to prioritize when cov-
ering it. That journalist's personal values and beliefs (e.g., their religious beliefs or
political attitudes) may similarly impact how they think about things. Even their role
orientations, or what they think the purpose of journalism is and how journalism
should be done, will impact how a journalist will seek to cover an issue.

    These factors, like many others in the model, are not always conscious influences.
For example, a journalist may not knowingly decide that they have to adopt a partic-
ular story angle because they lean toward liberalism or conservatism. Instead, their
political preference may subconsciously orient them toward a particular story angle
precisely because they believe certain philosophies -- like personal choice or the social
good -- are especially important (which is probably what led them to hold that political
preference to begin with).

Routine Level

    The routine level refers to the patterned, repeated practices, forms, and rules that
journalistic actors use to do their jobs. For example, this may include news values, or
the set of criteria journalists apply to determine the newsworthiness of information.
If they deem controversy to be an important news value, then they are generally
more likely to cover issues and events that are controversial. This is especially true
when there is disagreement among institutional elites, such as political party leaders,
regarding an issue.

    Another such factor may be an institutional preference to appear balanced by
offering "both sides" of an issue an equal voice. That often results in coverage that
positions both voices as equally legitimate, even when that is not the case. For example,
anthropogenic climate change has long been considered a real phenomenon by leading
scientists. However, for many years, journalistic coverage of climate change often gave
voice to skeptics (who implied a lack of scientific consensus) to appear balanced.

    Yet another such factor is a preference for certain styles of presenting information
to audiences. One such style of writing is the inverted pyramid, which organizes
information from most recent and important to least recent and important. This
style is perceived as being efficient at quickly conveying important information, but
it often comes at the expense of developing a compelling narrative. These factors

                                                                  - 88 -
                              Hierarchy of Influences Model

operate at a higher level because they reflect what is seen as appropriate or normal
among fellow journalistic actors.

Organizational Level

    The organizational level refers to the policies, unwritten rules, and economic imper-
atives within journalistic organizations (or whatever other entity a journalistic actor
works for). Journalistic outlets must balance commercial concerns with professional
ones. This balancing act is often most difficult for for-profit organizations, as they are
expected to generate profits even as important journalism is often not cost-effective.
However, even non-profit media have to work within a set budget to remain viable and
promote their work in a way that can attract funding from different benefactors (e.g.,
foundations). As such, media ownership is often an important influence. While some
owners (or ownership groups) are fairly hands-off (as long as economic objectives are
met), others are more active in dictating coverage priorities and may even become
directly involved in shaping the reporting of specific issues.

    Additionally, the primary medium associated with a journalistic outlet (e.g., whether
they see print as their primary media vehicle or if they focus on an online-first strat-
egy) may also impact how they present information. After all, you wouldn't expect
an organization that focuses on print journalism to invest much in interactive data
visualizations that only work online.

    A third factor might be the geographic location where that organization is based,
and whether they have news bureaus (satellite offices) elsewhere. For example, if
a journalistic outlet is based in a major East Coast city, the social make-up of the
journalists will be more likely to reflect the values and priorities of that place, even
when they cover stories elsewhere in the country or abroad.

Social-Institutional Level

    The social-institutional level refers to the norms, individuals, and organizations that
operate outside a given journalistic organization. There is some overlap here with the
aforementioned routines level, but this level includes information sources, other
journalistic organizations, advertisers, and media policy, among other actors. For
example, information sources (e.g., the witnesses a journalist may interview) can
shape a news product by virtue of the words they choose to use and the information
they choose to share -- or, more simply, by being willing or unwilling to talk to the
journalist in the first place. Some journalistic outlets can influence general news
coverage themselves by serving as `pack leaders' that other outlets seek to follow
or imitate. They can also influence coverage by publishing stories that competing

                                                                  - 89 -
                              Hierarchy of Influences Model

organizations may then choose to avoid (because those stories will be thought of as
`already having been done').

    Advertisers can impact coverage by demanding that their ads only be shown
alongside positive coverage. After all, they likely do not want their products to
be associated with negative emotions or connotations. That, in turn, can result in
important (but typically exhausting) stories receiving inadequate coverage, or having
portions of a news product be reserved for more-positive feature stories. Conversely,
advertisers can threaten to withdraw ads if they perceive that a journalistic outlet
represents values that do not reflect their own.

    Media policy can restrict what journalistic outlets can report on, or how they may
report on those things. For example, some countries have strict state secrets laws that
prevent journalistic outlets from publishing anything that the government deems
to be threatening to national security. Similarly, some countries around the world
have adopted "fake news" laws that enable government authorities to fine (or shut
down) journalists and outlets that produce news the authorities do not agree with. In
both of these examples, media policy can have a "chilling effect" on what journalists
choose to write (or write about). Conversely, some countries can adopt media policies
that protect journalists from frivolous lawsuits by implementing serious penalties for
individuals who sue journalists in bad faith.

Social Systems Level

    The social systems level refers to the symbolic frameworks of norms, values, and beliefs
that reside at the societal level. This is the most macro level, and it simply reflects the
sorts of ideas that are more generally accepted within a broad society. For example,
in the United States, capitalism remains the dominant economic system. This results
in different issues being more likely to be framed in terms of how they might affect
private ownership, free markets, and the pursuit of profit. Similarly, democratic values
remain dominant within U.S. politics. That, in turn, leads to beliefs that the role of
journalistic media in the U.S. is to inform citizens so they may better participate in
self-governance. In less-capitalistic social systems, those same issues may be more
likely to be framed primarily in terms of the collective good. Similarly, in autocratic
social systems, journalists will be more likely to believe that their job is to help the
government maintain social order.

Importance of Levels and Factors

    The Hierarchy of Influences Model does not presume that any of the levels
discussed here is more important than another. It also makes no claims about the

                                                                  - 90 -
                              Hierarchy of Influences Model

directionality of influences. (For example, the social systems level is not theorized to
be the one that shapes individuals, nor the other way around.) Instead, it views those
levels as frequently acting upon one another: Individuals collectively shape values
and norms at the social systems level, even as those values and norms help enable
and restrict the behaviors of individuals within that society.

    Similarly, each factor can operate independently from the other factors or in
conjunction with one or more. For example, the influence of advertisers on a particular
organization may be entirely independent from the dominant presentation style of
that organization. Regardless of who is advertising or how much advertising there is,
the organization may continue to use the inverted pyramid style of writing. However,
if an organization is for-profit and has aggressive profit targets, then the existing
influence of advertisers may become even stronger.

    We have only covered a few of the factors identified by the Hierarchy of Influences
Model here. There are dozens more, and you can learn more about them in the most
recent edition of Mediating the Message. While it is less important to know how to
classify each potential influence into a particular level, it is very useful to simply
recognize that a great many things can influence journalists and journalism, and that
these influences can emanate from individuals to society as a whole.

    It is important to note that journalism is rapidly changing as new social actors, tech-
nological actants, and journalistic activities emerge or become increasingly important.
For example, companies like Facebook and Google have staked important positions
within news production and distribution, even though they claim they are not media
organizations themselves. Similarly, some new digital advertising technologies have
made it harder for advertisers to know exactly where their ads will be placed online,
and for online news organizations to know which ads will appear alongside their
stories.

    In short, as journalism (and the environments it operates within) changes, so do
the factors that might influence it, as well as the nature and extent of the influence
those factors exert. However, what remains unchanged is that journalism is regularly
influenced in important ways by an array of different things.

                                                                  - 91 -

              News Values

    News values are the benchmarks of newsworthiness against which journalists measure
potential stories.

    News is not a `natural' thing that just `exists.' In the context of journalism, news is
something that is constructed by editorial actors (e.g., journalists) and even by some
technological actants (e.g., newswriting algorithms). The use of the term "constructed"
here is not intended to imply that news is arbitrarily invented or that it is "fake"
information. Instead, it simply recognizes that news is the product of human and
technological interventions, and it is shaped by the contexts within which it is identi-
fied, gathered, verified, structured, and presented as a product that is recognizable as
"news" by audiences.

    After all, only a tiny fraction of the developments and events happening in the
world at any given moment ever get covered as news by editorial actors and actants.
First, journalists are unlikely to be aware of most of those developments. Second,
only a small portion of the things they are aware of are deemed to be worthy of being
constructed as news stories. To help them decide which developments are worthy of
their time and their audiences' attention, editorial actors apply the set of criteria we
can call news values.

News Values

    According to media scholars Tony Harcup and Deirdre O'Neill, most published
news stories tend to include at least one of the following 15 elements:

     · Exclusivity: The development is available first (or only) to a particular news
       organization (e.g., an exclusive interview with Mark Zuckerberg).

                                                                  - 93 -
                                       News Values

· Power elite: The development involves powerful individuals and organizations
  (e.g., the president of the United States).

· Magnitude: The development potentially impacts a large number of people, or
  impacts a few people significantly (e.g., a court ruling affecting thousands of
  immigrants' citizenship rights).

· Relevance: The development involves issues or groups that are perceived to be
  relevant to the organization's audience (e.g., a major local employer relocating
  to another state).

· Surprise: The development deviates from the norm or shows stark contrasts
  (e.g., a man who bites dogs).

· Conflict: The development involves controversies, arguments, fights, or insur-
  rections (e.g., a politician breaking away from their party).

· Drama: The development concerns an unfolding drama, such as battles or court
  cases (e.g., a major criminal trial).

· Bad news: The development has especially negative overtones, such as a death
  or tragedy (e.g., a plane crash).

· Good news: The development has especially positive overtones, including res-
  cues or cures (e.g., development of a new vaccine).

· Entertainment: The development highlights human interest, unfolding drama,
  opportunities for humor (e.g., how to spend 36 hours in Bucharest).

· Celebrity: The development concerns people who are already famous (e.g., Ryan
  Gosling).

· Audio-visuals: The development has compelling photographs, video, audio, or
  can be illustrated with data visualizations (e.g., large protests).

· Shareability: The development is likely to generate sharing and comments on
  social media, e-mail, and messaging apps (e.g., content that is likely to `go viral').

· Follow-up: The development advances a story already being covered by that
  journalistic outlet or other news organization (e.g., the result of a vote on legis-
  lation previously covered).

· Journalistic outlet's agenda: The development fits the organization's agenda
  and/or journalistic identity (e.g., it focuses on a particular issue, like foreign
  policy).

                                            News Values

    In addition to these values, timeliness is a crucial factor. After all, news is typically
presumed to be new, and journalists are thus sensitive to how recent the information
is. However, news may also be evergreen, or not connected to breaking developments
but part of an ongoing issue or event. For example, a timely story about homelessness
may be produced when the city council approves additional funding for homeless
shelters. However, a general story about homelessness can also be evergreen because
homelessness is a persistent issue in many places. In practice, evergreen stories are
also useful because they provide content for slower news days.

    The more news values a potential story contains, the more likely it is to be seen
as newsworthy and therefore receive coverage. News can therefore be understood as
a highly selective version of events (and, arguably, nonevents) that have been chosen
and packaged to match a news organization's objectives, its output requirements, and
the information needs or entertainment wants that its target audiences are believed
to have. This, in turn, highlights that the material attributes of a development or
event -- that is, what actually happened -- only has some bearing on whether it is
covered, how it gets covered, what information is emphasized, and who receives a
voice in that coverage. For example, an online rant about immigrants may be seen as
newsworthy solely because it was tweeted by a sitting U.S. president, and the coverage
may focus on the controversy around that rant (rather than the substance of its claims)
because opposing party leaders subsequently traded barbs over it.

    These news values also help us to appreciate why certain developments do not
receive coverage. For example, an evening TV news broadcast may decide not to
cover an event simply because it is unlikely to produce good visuals (e.g., a corruption
investigation) or if the organization does not have access to those visuals (e.g., a
governmental detention camp in a remote area of a foreign country). Instead, it may
allot the limited time in its broadcast to an arguably less-important event that can
produce more visually captivating images (e.g., an accidental house fire).

News Values as Ideology

    News values are a reflection of the dominant ideologies within a journalistic
culture. However, they have also been critiqued as examples of journalistic media
straying from their stated missions. For example, in their influential Propaganda
Model of news media, Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky argue that mainstream
journalism tends to support the status quo in large part because, they argue, the
selection of topics for news coverage ultimately privileges the perspectives of the most
powerful while marginalizing the voices of less powerful sections of the population.

                                                                  - 95 -
                                            News Values

    Crucially, Herman and Chomsky are not arguing that mainstream journalists
do this intentionally or as part of a deliberate conspiracy to manipulate audiences.
Instead, they argue that there are structural filters that impact what is selected as
newsworthy, which in turn creates distortions that favor existing power brokers and
marginalizes points of view regarded as being outside the mainstream. This is an
example of critical theory, which seeks to interrogate power structures in media
industries.

    It is important to note that news values are relative. The aforementioned values
identified by Harcup and O'Neill are most reflective of journalistic cultures in demo-
cratic Western societies in the Global North, since those are the cultures that scholars
have most studied. News values in autocratic regimes are likely to be different, as
there may be less emphasis on values like conflict or exclusivity. We still have much
to learn about news values in other parts of the world.

    Truth, Bias, and Neutrality

    The concept of "truth" is central to journalism, and audiences expect journalists
to provide truthful accounts and analyses of recent developments. And, yet, truth
can be a very messy thing that is difficult to grasp.

    According to the realism perspective, truth is a judgment that accurately describes,
or corresponds with, the way the world actually is. That is, under this perspective,
truth is a universal reality that is separate from subjective human perspectives. Most
journalists in the United States subscribe to the realism perspective. They typically
argue that "facts" exist, and that conveying these facts is an important aspect of doing
journalism and of getting at the "truth."

    However, "facts" can be tricky things themselves. For example, consider the
unemployment rate in the United States right now. One might think that to be a
pretty simple, measurable "fact." And, yet, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the primary
body charged with measuring the unemployment rate in the United States, offers six
different calculations of it. Its primary calculation refers to the percentage of the labor
force that is without a job and has actively looked for work within the past four weeks.
However, it also considers the percentage of the labor force that has been unemployed
for 15 weeks or longer to be a valid measure, as well as a the percentage of the labor
force that is unemployed and is not actively looking for work because of discouragement
due to economic conditions.

    In short, when audiences say they "just want the facts," the question becomes:
Which facts?

    Subscribing to this more critical view does not require a person to reject the idea
of "facts," or to suggest that they are meaningless or entirely relative. But it does call
attention to two things. First, there are often multiple ways to measure complex facts. (In
contrast, it is typically easier to measure something simple like the number of students

                                                                  - 97 -
                                Truth, Bias, and Neutrality

enrolled in a journalism course.) Second, journalists have to work within the confines of
time and space -- a story can only be so long -- and this limitation naturally requires
them to select some facts at the expense of others. Put another way, they rarely have
the ability to list all the different permutations of the unemployment rate; they focus
on the `best' one.

    Moreover, journalism involves more than just listing facts. It typically requires
journalists to make sense of those facts, in order to help their audiences understand
how certain information fits into a broader context and what the implications of those
facts might be. Indeed, this is the very basis of framing theory and the sense-making
function of journalism.

    It is important to be cautious of arguments that "facts" do not exist, that "truth
isn't truth," or that we should embrace "alternative facts," though. While the critical
view described above promotes inquisition, simplistic rejections of factual knowl-
edge are often made in bad faith, in order to make competing measures of truth (or
interpretations of it) seem equal when they are not actually equally supported by
the evidence. This is especially true when people in positions of power (or grifters
looking to develop a following) urge people to dismiss unfavorable or inconvenient
information. Instead, it is important that audiences (and journalists) think critically
about how "facts" were arrived at, and to avoid reflexively accepting or rejecting them.

Bias

    Journalists' inherent need to be selective often leads to allegations of journalistic
bias, especially when audiences perceive news products to deviate from their world-
views and preconceptions. For example, in the United States, there is a widely held
belief in public circles that journalistic media have a liberal bias. (To be clear, non-
partisan studies of media bias have historically found little evidence of this. While
journalists in the U.S. generally hold more liberal values, the professional emphasis
on neutrality, balance, and a systematic approach to newsgathering limits one-sided
coverage.)

    Journalistic bias can be defined as prejudice toward certain ideas, issues, perspectives, or
groups or individuals in the production and distribution of journalistic content. Allegations
of journalistic bias often fall into one or more of the following three categories.
The first, issue bias, pertains to a proclivity toward certain kinds of issues, such as
an overemphasis on crime or immigration. The second, framing bias, refers to the
propensity to frame issues through particular prisms, such as the threat immigrants
might pose (as opposed to the benefits they might offer), or to routinely use certain
language, such as "illegal immigrants" instead of "undocumented immigrants." The

                                                                  - 98 -
                                Truth, Bias, and Neutrality

third, source bias, refers to the differential treatment of a story depending on who the
main actors are -- as with offering more positive coverage to members of a certain
political party. Source bias can also refer to a proclivity toward giving certain kinds of
sources a larger (or any) voice within a news product, such as a journalist being more
likely to quote government officials than activists or demonstrators.

    Connecting all three of those categories is visibility bias, which involves the amount
of attention or prominence given to certain kinds of issues, frames, or sources. For
example, although a journalist may quote an equal number of sources from two
opposing parties, they may routinely offer longer quotes in more prominent parts of a
news story (e.g., near the top, which more people are likely to read) to one of the two
parties. Similarly, visibility bias may become apparent when prime-time shows on
cable news networks focus on stories about immigrant misdeeds, with more positive
coverage of immigrants relegated to less-watched daytime shows.

Neutrality and Balance

    In order to combat allegations of bias, journalists often claim to be neutral and
to offer "a view from nowhere" -- that is, to offer a perspective without a position or
that takes no side. A common way to enact that claim is to try to occupy a middle
ground by simply capturing and broadcasting opposing viewpoints, and trying to
give equal weight to competing sides of an issue. Crucially, such attempts take care to
not convey the journalist's own opinion on a matter.

    This proclivity toward neutrality and balance is, itself, a form of bias, and it is
especially prevalent among journalists in places like the United States. This is not to
say that such an approach to doing journalism is bad but rather that it represents a
predisposition toward a particular way of presenting news.

    There are downsides to that approach, though. In trying to be neutral and bal-
anced, a journalist may promote false balance by assigning equal blame or acclaim
when one side is more culpable or deserving of it. For example, by taking the position
that "all politicians lie" or that "both sides share blame" in order to appear neutral,
a journalist may obfuscate the fact that some politicians make more verifiably false
claims than others, or that one side is more responsible for an outcome (e.g., by being
less willing to negotiate a compromise). Put another way, journalists distort reality
when promoting a false balance and they thus do a disservice to truth -- and to news
audiences.

    Bad-faith institutional actors, including some political candidates and public offi-
cials, have taken advantage of this "view from nowhere" approach through concerted

                                                                  - 99 -
                                Truth, Bias, and Neutrality

efforts to "work the refs," especially in recent decades. If journalists are seen to be
arbiters of truth -- much as referees are the arbiters of rules within a game -- then
subjects of news coverage (e.g., a politician) can allege news media to be biased against
them in order to intimidate journalists from scrutinizing their claims. (After all, critical
evaluations by journalists can be pointed to as `further evidence' of the alleged bias.)
This is important because false or inaccurate claims carried by trusted journalistic
outlets are granted legitimacy -- that is, they may be seen as true (or be evaluated
less skeptically) by audiences who presume journalists to have filtered out untruthful
information.

Accuracy and Truth-Seeking

    One element found in most definitions of "truth" is accuracy, or a focus on precision
and the avoidance of errors. Accuracy is indeed central to journalism, and many
aspiring journalists have failed a college assignment because they submitted a news
story with a factual error in it.

    However, accuracy is not, on its own, enough for satisfying truth. For example, it
may be accurate to report that one person said that 75% of peer-reviewed studies
about climate change say it is not a real phenomenon. After all, they may have said
such a thing. However, it is not true that such a proportion of peer-reviewed studies
say that. Similarly, it may be accurate to point a camera at a small crowd of people
and zoom in so as to have them fill the frame, or to zoom out so as to make it look
sparse. After all, neither picture was doctored or manipulated after the fact in any way.
However, the resulting image's connotation that there was a large or small crowd may
be an `untrue' depiction of the event. Finally, it would be equally accurate to show
a mug shot of a dejected person in a crime story or their happy, upstanding family
photo. However, it can be difficult to ascertain which photo best represents the truth
about what that individual is like.

    In short, accuracy must be supplemented by commitment to truth. We can call that
commitment "truth-seeking." This approach views truth as more of a process wherein
the journalist aims to approximate truth as best as they can. Truth-seeking typically
involves an objective approach to journalism, where journalists seek to systematically
observe and record developments; interview sources with intimate knowledge about
that development (like eye-witnesses); verify claims by seeking out generally accepted
facts and official documents; and ultimately produce a story with the most truthful
(plausible) representation of that development.

    The process of truth-seeking recognizes that journalists are inherently biased.
Put another way, it accepts the proposition that it is impossible for journalists to

                                                                 - 100 -
                                Truth, Bias, and Neutrality

be unbiased because of their backgrounds and the structural constraints they work
within. However, it recognizes that by systematically adopting what are regarded
as best practices in journalism, journalists can mitigate some of those biases and not
fall into traps like false balance, all the while striving toward the ambitious goal of
reproducing truth.

    It is important to note, however, that in some countries, journalistic outlets are
openly biased and explicitly reject the values of neutrality and balance. For example,
in countries like Pakistan and Indonesia, journalists typically believe that openly
advocating for social change and staking clear positions regarding which side in a
dispute has the superior argument -- and sometimes substantiating those positions
primarily through intuition or their agreement with ethical or religious principles -- is
a better way of serving truth. Put another way, different journalistic cultures approach
truth-seeking in different ways.

    Key Takeaways

    » Facts are not `natural' things that just `exist.' Journalistic actors (and audi-

        ences) should therefore critically evaluate facts and approach them with a
        healthy dose of skepticism.

    » There are multiple forms of journalistic bias, such as issue bias, framing

        bias, and source bias.

    » In the United States, journalists typically strive to appear neutral and to

        offer balanced accounts. However, bad-faith actors have taken advantage
        of this approach in various ways. This has forced journalists to reconsider
        whether that approach still serves citizens well.

    » Accuracy is, by itself, insufficient for getting at the truth. However, it is an

        essential component of truth.

    » Journalists will typically strive for truth-seeking by systematically adopting

        best practices in journalism, such as interviewing multiple people, verifying
        their accounts, and offering the best approximation of truth.

      Audience Fragmentation

    The term audience fragmentation describes a process whereby a mass audience
(or few audiences) is broken up into many small audiences by virtue of divergent media
consumption habits. With the proliferation of online journalism and digital devices,
audiences have become empowered to access more content from more publishers and
on the audiences' terms. Consequently, individual news consumers have developed
more specific tastes and consumption patterns.

    Consider asking your friends where they get their political news from. There's
a good chance they'll each list a different set of sources. (There will likely be some
overlap, since people generally befriend individuals who share their interests, but it
is unlikely to be a uniform set of outlets.) Then, consider asking your parents and
their friends where they get their political news from. There's a good chance they
will not only list an even more distinct set of sources but also a different set of media
vehicles (e.g., television vs. online) and on a different schedule (e.g., live at a certain
time vs. on-demand). If you were to swing by a retirement community a few towns
away, you'll likely find an even more distinct media diet from your own.

    In short, today's news audiences have fragmented from a few mass audiences
to many small audiences. And while that fragmentation may immediately sound
like a net positive -- after all, more choices should be a good thing, right? -- it has
introduced important challenges not only to the journalism industry but to democratic
institutions.

Civic Implications of Fragmentation

    The explosion of media options is still a relatively new phenomenon. For example,
back in the 1960s, the majority of Americans regularly turned to one of just three
evening TV newscasts (from ABC, CBS, and NBC). Broadcast news was so pervasive

                                                                 - 103 -
                                   Audience Fragmentation

that 96% of the American population watched TV news coverage of President John
F. Kennedy's assassination.

    That level of concentration and small number of options is hard to fathom today
given the present array of broadcast news options (and even wider spectrum of media
vehicles and journalistic outlets). Today's audiences can seek news from text-based,
broadcast, radio, and digital outlets. They can watch the news through live video,
social video, 360 video, and even virtual and augmented reality. They can turn to
mainstream or independent outlets and partisan or non-partisan outlets. They can
choose between international, national, local, and even hyper-local coverage of a topic.
They can often consume those news products live or on-demand. The list goes on
and on.

    However, having access to so many options has a major downside. The paradox
of choice can make it tough for news consumers to leave their comfort zones or even
avoid news altogether. For example, how often do you sign on to Netflix to watch
something, only to realize that you've spent 10 minutes browsing and are no longer
in the mood to watch anything at all? A similar process of fatigue occurs in what can
sometimes feel like an over-saturated news ecosystem.

    Having so many options also allows people to more easily turn to slanted news
sources that support their existing points of view. This phenomenon is called selective
exposure and involves people actively choosing to pursue a fraction of the available
information or information sources, typically along some lines of preference (e.g.,
political preferences). This can trap news consumers in echo chambers that limit their
exposure to new and divergent perspectives. That, in turn, can also lead to increased
polarization within societies, particularly when it comes to political affairs. Such
polarization can make it difficult for citizens to engage with one another because not
only do they approach opposing viewpoints with greater antipathy but they also tend
to draw on very different bodies of information about the world. This makes dialogue,
debate, and compromise -- the cornerstones of democratic society -- difficult.

Professional Implications of Fragmentation

    Audience fragmentation also poses economic and professional challenges for
journalists and the organizations that employ them. It provides incentives for journal-
istic actors to specialize. Generalist outlets that provide overviews of many different
topics are less desirable to audiences that know what they want and want in-depth
or exclusive information about that topic. By specializing in niche areas, journalistic
outlets can capture smaller but loyal audiences. While generalist outlets will still
continue to exist, there are likely to be fewer of them in the future than in the past.

                                                                 - 104 -
                                   Audience Fragmentation

    The fragmentation of audiences and increased availability of options also place
even more pressures on journalistic outlets to stand out within an attention economy.
Outlets must compete furiously with one another because there is a greater supply
of news content than there is attention to take it in. This competition is magnified
exponentially when you also factor in non-news media competitors, such as beauty
vlogs, video game streams, and history podcasts. (Consider that in 2019, 500 hours of
video were being uploaded to YouTube alone every minute.) Consequently, journalistic
outlets are not only competing against one another to produce good journalism, they
are also competing with one another (and other media organizations) to have their
content capture the attention of a sufficiently large number of increasingly fragmented
audiences.

    It is unlikely that the processes underlying the fragmentation of audiences in
recent decades will be reversed in the coming years. In fact, the opposite is more likely:
Audiences will probably become even more fragmented as new technologies give
audiences more agency and as technological actants further personalize audiences'
news experiences. This will require journalistic outlets and society at large to continue
to adapt to the existence of niche audiences that frequently draw upon divergent
bodies of knowledge about current affairs and the broader world.

     Commodification of News

    The phrase "commodification of news" refers to the process through which news is
translated into a commodity, or a good or service designed to earn its producer a profit
when it is sold in a market.

    News has been treated as a commodity in much of the world in recent decades.
However, it is different from most other commodities. Since the invention of the
telegraph, news has been a weightless product that can be transported over vast
distances nearly instantaneously. It also has limited exclusivity and a short individual
lifespan, as news quickly loses value as it ages and can be quickly repackaged by
competitors. Additionally, one person's consumption of news does not diminish its
supply to the next person (unlike a pint of ice cream from Trader Joe's). As such, the
economics of news is unique in many ways, especially in a digital environment.

    Commodities are responsible only to the marketplace. They are indifferent to the
quality of democracy or the values of a society so long as buying, selling, and private
profit-making are permitted. Put another way, the more news is treated as a market
commodity, the less certain it is to supply the kind of information a democratic society
requires.

Audiences and Advertising

    Within the context of commodities, commercial journalistic organizations typi-
cally operate in a dual-product market. They produce and market one product (news)
so they can produce another product (audience attention) that can then be sold to
advertisers, who covet audiences for their products.

    This relationship is particularly important because the majority of revenue for
most commercial journalistic organizations today comes from advertising, and not
directly from audiences via things like subscriptions. Indeed, since the invention of

                                                                 - 109 -
                                  Commodification of News

mass advertising, news has generally been subsidized (e.g., newspapers) or outright
paid for (e.g., broadcast TV newscasts) by someone other than the audience. This
has allowed news content to be more affordable for -- and thus accessed by -- mass
audiences, who receive the content for far less than it costs to produce it.

    This dual-product market is further characterized by mutual interdependence: Jour-
nalistic organizations need advertising revenue to subsidize their journalistic activities,
but the amount of advertising revenue is often related to the amount of audience
attention that the organization can deliver. Put another way, in order to increase the
revenue necessary to produce quality journalism, journalistic outlets must deliver
larger numbers of readers, viewers, or listeners -- even as, one would hope, quality
journalism is what helps to bring in larger audiences.

The Newsroom `Wall'

    To combat the potentially negative influences of this interdependence on journal-
ists' ability to serve as truth-seekers, professional journalistic organizations tended to
implement throughout the 20th and 21st century a metaphorical `wall' separating the
business side of the organization from its newsroom operations. On one side of the
wall, journalists and editors developed content for citizens, with limited regard for the
business implications of their reporting. On the other side, managers and sales staff
worked with advertisers to sell the audience attention.

    The purpose of the `wall' was to grant journalists greater autonomy, or inde-
pendence from business concerns, which would allow the organization to produce
journalism. The `wall' itself was often implemented through different social rules (and
even physical obstacles) that reduced interactions between members of each side. This
might include placing business personnel on one floor of a building and newsroom
personnel on another, and having them report to different sets of supervisors. This
was possible in large part because journalism was already a very profitable enterprise
for much of the past century. (Although it may seem comical now, major newspapers
were regarded as cash cows three decades ago.)

    Such a separation was reasonably effective for much of the past century. However,
it was not always impervious. For example, the news hole (the amount of space available
for news in a product like a newspaper) was often dependent on the amount of
advertisements that were sold for that edition. If there were more advertisements, there
would be more newspaper pages, and thus more space for news content. Additionally,
workers on the business side would sometimes pressure editors, with varying success,
to push for content that was advertising-friendly. This did not necessarily mean
producing stories that were favorable to specific advertisers, like a happy story about

                                                                 - 110 -
                                  Commodification of News

Trader Joe's. Instead, it meant ensuring the news product had some happy stories in it.
That's because Trader Joe's would be happier if its advertisement appeared next to a
story that already left the audience member in a positive emotional state, which in
turn would make them more likely to transfer that feeling of happiness to the product
being sold by Trader Joe's.

    The industry's economic challenges have resulted in that line becoming even
more blurred in recent years, though. For example, one source of revenue newsrooms
now tap into is called native advertising. This involves a newsroom having a team of
`content creators' (sometimes comprised of former journalists) who work directly with
potential advertisers to create semi-advertisements that look and feel like a typical
journalistic story. Such stories are often distinguished by being labeled as `sponsored
content' or with some other aesthetic signifier to show that they are not journalistic
stories produced by the journalists at that organization. However, readers and viewers
do not often make that distinction -- indeed, the very appeal to advertisers is that
those distinctions will not be made and that audiences will mistake native ads for
editorial content. Although profitable, the downside to such efforts is that they may
erode audiences' trust in a journalistic organization.

Market Failure

    The tension between treating news as a market commodity and practicing jour-
nalism as a public service has been a central dilemma in journalism for over a century.
Notably, advertising was first welcomed rather than criticized because it promised to
end, or at least ease, the dependency of journalism on the political parties that used
to finance newspapers. In the Utopian vision of ad-supported journalism, advertising
would enable market forces to empower audiences, resulting in the production of
news information that was even more useful to them. Conversely, others worried that
market sensitivities would seed market-driven journalism characterized not by "all
the news that's fit to print" but rather "all the news that's fit to sell."

    Scholars have argued that quality journalism provides multiple fundamental
benefits to a democratic society that the market fails to adequately compensate. For
example, all members of a society benefit when voters are well-informed and thus
able to choose wise leaders and reward good governance. Similarly, all members of
a society benefit from the deterrence of corruption and abuse that results from an
actively monitorial journalistic environment, as bad-faith actors weigh the costs of
getting caught against the benefit of doing a bad thing. Yet, in a market-oriented
system, not everyone pays for news. In fact, only a very small proportion of people do.
This creates a free rider problem, where people can experience many of the benefits of

                                                                 - 111 -
                                  Commodification of News

a product without having to pay for it. Consequently, what is civically valuable but
goes unrewarded in the marketplace -- such as expensive public-service journalistic
investigations -- ends up being under-produced, since there's no economic incentive
for it.

    Scholars have also found that the more responsive a newsroom is to market
forces, the less it tends to serve the public interest through civic-minded efforts like
`watchdog' journalism. Again, this makes sense on multiple levels under rational-choice
theories of economics. Rational managers and owners who seek to maximize their
(or their investors') economic return should produce the least expensive content that
can generate the largest audience of subscribers and/or consumers that are attractive
to advertisers. Rational advertisers should seek the largest audience of potential
customers at the lowest cost while favoring outlets that produce softer, simpler stories
that leave potential consumers in a positive emotional state. And, audiences are not
themselves paragons of rational self-interest. They do not always financially reward
the content that benefits them the most in the long run.

    The confluence of these factors results in what economists call market failure,
where there is inefficient production and distribution of goods and services within a
free market resulting from the fact that the individual incentives for rational behavior
do not lead to the best outcomes for a group (or society). This has become especially
apparent as the economic underpinnings for commercial journalism in many parts
of the world, including the United States, have been significantly challenged by
sociotechnical disruptions.

    For example, the newspaper advertising market enjoyed robust growth from
1950 to 2000, and then declined to the 1950 levels in the next 12 years alone.
Consequently, newsroom employment in the United States declined by 51% between
2008 and 2019. Additionally, hundreds of small community newspapers in the
United States have been forced to close, creating a situation where in 2019, almost half
of U.S. counties had a single local newspaper (that was often only published weekly).
The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 only increased those economic pressures: A third
of U.S. newspapers experienced layoffs that year, with large-circulation newspapers
being most affected.

    This has required commercial newsrooms to significantly rethink how to serve
their civic objectives while remaining economically viable -- efforts that have, at least
recently, guided them toward further diversifying their revenue models in order to
make up for drastic losses in advertising. Even among local and national television
journalism outlets, which have been less affected by those trends, there are more
intense economic (and political) pressures to move away from expensive public-

                                                                 - 112 -

service journalism. There have been many calls to address the market failures within
journalism, but the challenge has persisted.

    Key Takeaways

    » News is a unique commodity in that it often has a short lifespan, it is easily

        copied, and its supply does not diminish as it is consumed.

    » Commercial journalistic organizations often serve two markets at the same

        time: audiences and advertisers. Advertisers subsidize the content that
        audiences need and audiences give advertisers the attention they seek.

    » Historically, professional, commercial journalistic organizations separated

        journalists from business-people by creating a metaphorical `wall' in the
        newsroom that promoted newsroom independence and autonomy.

    » In many countries, including the United States, commercial journalism

        operates within a context of market failure in terms of serving of the
        public good. A number of happy coincidences allowed that system to
        work reasonably well for many decades. However, those coincidences no
        longer hold true.

    Audience Measurement and
                 Bundling

    The term "audience measurement" refers to the goal-oriented process of collecting, an-
alyzing, reporting, and interpreting data about the size, composition, behavior, characteristics,
and preferences of individuals interacting with particular media brands or products.

    Historically, journalists and journalistic organizations had only very crude mea-
sures of what news audiences were interested in -- and how (and to what extent) they
were engaging with that content. For example, journalists would often turn to their
friends and family, or perhaps to letters to the editor, for cues about what people
were interested in and how their work was resonating with audiences. Journalistic
organizations, in turn, would hire consultants to conduct focus groups, survey their
readers, or ask broadcast audiences to keep a diary of the programs they watched.

    Those methods came with significant limitations. First, they only provided partial
data because they drew on small samples of people, who were often sampled in ways
that made it hard to generalize findings to an entire audience. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, the information was self-reported. This meant that people might
say they wanted more information about international affairs because they thought
that's what they should say -- after all, most of us want to seem cultured, even to
strangers -- when in fact the news they craved was information about Ryan Gosling's
latest film.

Audience Analytics and Metrics

    The digitization of news has significantly changed how audience interests and
consumption are measured. Specifically, digital systems enable passive, mass tracking.
This means that when a person accesses a story, the infrastructure helping to serve that
content -- that is, the computer systems belonging to the journalistic organization and,

                                                                 - 115 -
                         Audience Measurement and Bundling

often, other companies as well -- will automatically record the fact that the content
was accessed. These systems also often record additional information, including when
that person accessed the content, where (roughly) they accessed it from, on what
device, and how much time they spent with that content.

    Those systems and information aggregation efforts are often called audience analyt-
ics, which is effectively a form of audience measurement that was not possible before
the internet age. While it comes with its own limitations -- for example, this system
alone cannot give journalists a clear picture of how people feel about the content they
access -- it differs from past approaches in that it can gather information about all
members of the audience, and that information is not limited to what audiences want
to report. It is a more complete record, quantitatively speaking.

    These systems can be used to automatically personalize content by linking it to
past records of a news consumer's behavior. For example, if the journalistic organiza-
tion's tracking systems know a specific audience member frequently accesses content
about Ryan Gosling, it may choose to put that content in more prominent positions
on its website (or suggest it as the next article for this user to read) because the system
infers from past data that this individual wants to stay on top of news about Ryan
Gosling.

    Additionally, those systems produce what are often called audience metrics, or
aggregate measures about the audience. These include the number of unique people
who were exposed to a particular piece of content, where those individuals came from
(not just geographically but also the website or platform that led them to that content),
and how much time the average person spent with that content, or perhaps even
how far the average person scrolled down the page. Thus, a journalist or journalistic
organization can have a more quantified sense of how many people read their story
and how they interacted with it, instead of just assuming a lot of people did because
their group of friends, who likely share the same interests, found it interesting.

    Journalists and newsrooms historically marginalized audience measurement data
because they often viewed it as an intrusion on their journalistic autonomy and
independence. Put another way, drawing on their role orientations and occupa-
tional ideology, they would often believe they had to give audiences certain kinds
of news -- regardless of how popular it might turn out to be -- because it was a civic
necessity to do so.

    While there was always some tension over this, the high profitability of journalism
made it easier for journalists to resist perceived intrusions in the past. The combination
of these new technologies and the economic challenges faced by commercial media
in recent years have resulted in even greater pressure to use audience analytics and

                                                                 - 116 -
                         Audience Measurement and Bundling

metrics to more efficiently cater to audience desires -- and made it riskier for journalists
to resist such pressures.

    Such systems and information do not exist to solely further economic objectives,
though. Audience analytics and metrics can and arguably should be used to find
ways to better understand what audiences want in order to make civically important
content more appealing to them -- whether in terms of its substance or simply how and
where it is presented, as well as to encourage greater audience engagement and loyalty.
Additionally, researchers have found little evidence that highly professionalized news-
rooms like The New York Times and The Guardian are blindly making news decisions
based on audience metrics alone. Nevertheless, it has become apparent that these
technologies and cultural artifacts have changed how journalists think about their
work and the ways in which they perform it.

Bundling and Journalism

    For much of its history, commercial news media has been a bundled product. What
this means is that a person rarely bought a single piece of news, or even just news.
Instead, they bought a single product that included local news, national news, sports
news, and arts news -- as well as comics, classifieds, and advertisements. This allowed
journalism to be produced in an efficient way insofar as it allowed journalistic outlets
to make money from two mutually dependent sources -- audiences and advertis-
ers -- with a single media vehicle (e.g., a newspaper). Classifieds are emblematic of this:
A local business would pay the journalistic outlet a fee to list a job opening in the news-
paper while local citizens would pay the outlet for the cost of the newspaper to find a
new job openings. A similar arrangement existed for engagement announcements
and obituaries, which were also bundled in.

    Content that was cheaper to produce (e.g., post-game reports from local high
school football games) also helped subsidize more expensive content (e.g., an investiga-
tive series on local corruption). Put another way, citizens often bought the newspaper
because they cared about their local sports teams and would perhaps stick around for,
and benefit from, the investigative series. The journalistic organization, for its part,
tended to see the investigative series as more central to its mission and as a poten-
tial status marker -- such stories are usually the ones that receive major journalism
awards -- and viewed its cheaper and more popular content as a way to pay for it.

    This dynamic has changed considerably in recent years. Audiences are now
less likely to go directly to a journalistic outlet's homepage or app, and they are far
less likely to seek out a single source to satisfy all of their information needs. Put
differently, an individual may go to The Boston Globe for coverage of regional politics

                                                                 - 117 -
                         Audience Measurement and Bundling

and policy, to BuzzFeed for entertainment news, to a local sports enthusiast's blog
for analysis of high school football, and to the British Broadcasting Corporation, or
BBC, for coverage of international affairs. As such, news has become unbundled in
many ways as journalistic outlets place all of their news online for free or under a `soft'
paywall knowing that individuals will only access some of the content. That, in turn,
results in advertising revenue only being generated for those things that are accessed,
putting pressure on commercial outlets to focus on narrower sets of content that can
pay for itself.

    Moreover, journalistic outlets have lost their monopolies on some of those key
dual-channel revenue sources. For example, people now go to websites like Craigslist
and Indeed for classifieds, and to Facebook to discover who is getting engaged (and
perhaps who has died). There is also a plethora of free and paid entertainment
alternatives that far exceed what journalistic outlets have ever been able to offer.

    Because of this evolution in the news industry, the structural advantages and
subsidies that enabled commercial journalism to operate as it did in the past no longer
exist in such advantageous ways.

    Key Takeaways

    » Journalistic outlets have always tried to measure different aspects of their

        audiences and their audiences' wants, but audience analytics and metrics
        have enabled more quantifiable measurements of individual audience
        members and of audiences as a whole.

    » There is now great economic pressure on journalistic outlets to make use of

        audience metrics in guiding editorial decisions. However, professionalized
        newsrooms still draw heavily upon their conceptions of newsworthiness
        when making those decisions.

    » Journalistic products are no longer bundled in the ways they were before.

        This has both reduced their ability to subsidize expensive, civic-minded
        news through cheaper, more popular content and reduced the opportuni-
        ties to generate revenue from non-news content.

                                                                 - 118 -

       Third-Party Platforms

    Today's journalism environment is deeply influenced by third-party platforms,
or technical systems that mediate exchanges between content producers and consumers.
Those platforms have significantly altered how news is monetized, distributed, and
engaged with, and have consequently disrupted key financial support mechanisms
for journalism in market-oriented media systems around the world.

    Many journalistic organizations have experienced what may appear to be a para-
dox at first sight: They now have access to a far larger potential audience than ever
before through their digital distribution channels -- and, in fact, often have more read-
ers, viewers, and listeners than ever before -- yet they have seen a drastic reduction in
advertising revenue.

    The reason for this is two-fold. The first reason is that the cost for placing an
advertisement on an organization's digital offerings is exponentially lower than the
cost for placing an advertisement on that same organization's analogue offerings.
Put another way, it is a lot cheaper to place an ad on the Daily Hampshire Gazette's
website than it is to place that same ad on its newspaper. This is due in part to the fact
that online audiences have historically been seen as less valuable by producers and
advertisers alike. However, it is also due to the increased supply of content online.
If an advertiser wants to reach a particular kind of audience offline, they have a far
more limited set of media vehicles -- such as the lone newspaper for an entire county
and the few broadcast channels that cover that area. Conversely, there is a seemingly
limitless supply of media vehicles online, such as the billions of websites that exist.

    The second reason is that much of today's advertising is managed through third-
party platforms that not only govern pricing but also take a hefty cut. For example, if
UMass wanted to promote its excellent Journalism Department to an international
audience, it might work directly with The Japan Times to publish an advertisement in
its newspaper. However, if UMass wanted to advertise on The Japan Times' website, it

                                                                 - 119 -
                                    Third-Party Platforms

may need to work with an intermediary like Google's AdSense, which might handle all
of the online advertising for The Japan Times (as well as for millions of other websites).

    This is the case for many journalistic organizations today, and it comes with many
implications. The most important of these is that there is downward pressure to
keep ad rates low online. Specifically, UMass may reason that its goal is to reach
people outside the U.S. who are interested in journalism -- and it may not care if
those people are found on The Japan Times's website or elsewhere on the web. Thus,
they will use an ad-tech intermediary (like Google's AdSense) to target their ad to a
certain demographic and set a maximum price. Google's AdSense may then allow
any website visited by any user matching that demographic -- based on a profile that
the ad-tech company has created from different data points -- to show UMass' ad
so long as a website accepts UMass' pricing limits. (Ad-tech systems do allow for
black-listing, too. This means that some websites are not eligible to show an ad if
they contain certain keywords. While this is usually restricted to offensive language,
it can be extended to sensitive topics, like human rights abuses. That, in turn, may
discourage the production of news stories about those topics.)

    All of those decisions are made by automated systems in microseconds through
what is called programmatic advertising, and it often results in lower ad prices because a
rational advertiser will seek to advertise on the websites that require the least amount
of money while delivering the desired audience. This pushes websites to accept lower
rates in order to ensure they have advertisements to serve. On top of this, those
intermediaries charge the websites a service fee for each ad shown. Thus, not only
are journalistic outlets receiving less money for each ad but they also receive just a
portion of that amount.

    It is therefore unsurprising that while digital ad spending has grown immensely,
much of those gains have been highly concentrated among a few companies. Specifi-
cally, Google and Facebook alone are estimated to receive more than half of global
digital ad spending, with China-based Alibaba coming in a distant third.

    In short, many of the gains in digital advertising are not being realized by journal-
istic outlets; the uptick in online ad revenue has not come close to replacing the losses
in offline ad revenue for many journalistic outlets; and many journalistic outlets still
rely on their offline products for the majority of their advertising revenue, even as they
have much larger audiences online. This helps us understand why some traditional
media companies still orient themselves, at least in part, around media vehicles that
are widely seen as being phased out along generational lines (e.g., a newspaper): Such
outlets generally have more control over, and can extract more value from, their legacy
products.

                                                                 - 120 -
                                    Third-Party Platforms

Distributional Intermediaries

    Third-party platforms are not limited to advertising, though. In the United States,
much of Europe, and elsewhere in the world, a small group of Silicon Valley-based
companies -- namely Google, Facebook, Apple, and Twitter -- largely control the social
media, web search, and mobile application platforms that audiences use to find and
access news.

    Because of their positions as intermediaries, those companies generally realize many
of the economic benefits from news production while not suffering its costs. For example,
a platform like Facebook benefits from user-generated content like its users' posts
(including any news they may break); from the fact that many people rely on Facebook
to be their primary news source, via the links that are shared by their friends; and
from the many journalistic outlets that use Facebook themselves in order to promote
their content (often by offering portions of it for free on the platform). All of this
participation comes at relatively negligible cost to Facebook, because it does not pay
any of these people for the very content that makes its platform worthwhile.

    At the same time, platform owners seek to avoid expensive legal and gatekeeping
responsibilities by claiming to be distinct from media organizations. Put another
way, they often claim to only offer neutral, technical infrastructures in order to avoid
the public interest obligations that governments have historically placed on broad-
casters and that society expects from traditional journalistic outlets. After all, such
platforms tend to claim, they do not produce journalistic content of their own, and
their platforms are governed by supposedly impartial algorithms, rather than humans,
to determine what to show audiences and how to show it. Therefore, the argument
is that such neutrality should shield platforms from journalistic responsibilities, or
from legal risks like accusations of libel. (This is, of course, a weak argument. Their
algorithms reflect the values and/or economic interests of platform owners, and the
algorithms exercise a form of judgment when they promote content that is expected
to elicit further engagement on the platform.)

    Third-party platforms also create loyalty challenges for journalistic outlets. In
the past, audiences tended to go directly to trusted outlets to find information. Put
another way, they actively sought it out. Today, audiences increasingly go to news
aggregators like Apple News, or they wait for news to find them on social media platforms
like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. As users are shown an array of news from a lot of
different news brands, they begin to disassociate the content from the brand itself. Put
differently, researchers have found that, after reading a news story, less than half of
people would remember the journalistic organization that published the story if the
individual found the story on social media. (However, most people could remember

                                                                 - 121 -
                                    Third-Party Platforms

which social media platform they used to find it.) In contrast, 80% of people who
found that same story on a journalistic organization's website were able to remember
who published it. In short, social media platforms end up receiving more of the
credit for the content published by journalistic outlets than the journalistic outlets
themselves. That, in turn, reduces the worth of the organization's brand and the
incentive to produce high-quality content in order to help the brand stand out in a
crowded marketplace.

    The massive size of these third-party platforms -- Facebook alone counts billions
of users worldwide -- and their structural positions as intermediaries make it difficult
for journalistic outlets to ignore them. Moreover, they are difficult to displace. Such
platforms are subject to network effects in which a product or service becomes more
useful as more people use it, creating conditions for monopolies or outsize power.
Consequently, many journalistic outlets believe they must not only have a presence
on those platforms but that they must engage with audiences there, too, even as such
participation further tethers them to these platforms. Put another way, journalistic
outlets are forced to weigh the short-term benefits of tapping into new audiences and
remaining relevant on popular platforms against long-term concerns about ceding
further control over their content and processes. While more journalistic outlets have
begun to distance themselves from some third-party platforms in recent years, such
efforts often come at great risk.

    Key Takeaways

    » Third-party platforms refer to technical systems that mediate exchanges

        between content producers and consumers. This includes social media
        platforms like Facebook, search platforms like Google search, and ad-tech
        platforms like Google AdSense.

    » Although digital advertising has grown immensely over the past decade,

        it has not come close to replacing the revenue lost from non-digital ad-
        vertising for most journalistic outlets. This is due in part to different pric-
        ing regimes and the ad-tech intermediary platforms that pervade online
        spaces.

    » Distributional intermediaries like Facebook and Apple News have ben-

        efited greatly from the economic benefits of news production yet bear
        little of its costs. They have also sought to reduce their media-related

   companies.

» Although these platforms have introduced many challenges to a range of

   journalistic outlets -- especially traditional organizations -- those outlets
   have often found the cost of non-participation on platforms to exceed
   those of participation.

       Non-Profit Journalism

    Non-profit journalistic outlets are not driven by commercial concerns but are instead
dedicated to furthering a public-service mission, filling gaps resulting from market failures, or
advancing a particular social cause.

    Non-profit outlets have long been a part of many media systems. For example, in
the U.S., The Associated Press was founded as a non-profit cooperative in 1846 in order
to lower newsgathering costs among its commercial and non-commercial members.
Over time, it has helped ensure that audiences in different parts of the country have
access to high-quality information from around the U.S. and abroad. Globally, jour-
nalism outlets like The Guardian in the United Kingdom and Malaysiakini in Malaysia
operate in the spirit of promoting high-quality journalism and providing alternative
voices, especially in tightly controlled media environments where commercial and
state-sponsored media are afraid of challenging those in power.

    Non-profit media have seen considerable growth over the past two decades as
the economics of commercial journalism have been disrupted. Put another way,
for much of the 20th and 21st centuries, a happy coincidence enabled the market,
via advertising and subscription revenue, to support the existence of a robust, ad-
supported journalistic sector. There is, however, no reason why that model has to
work to adequately support journalism's public-service responsibilities. Indeed, the
drastic drop of advertising revenues and the reluctance audiences have shown for
paying for online content in high-choice environments has illustrated how vulnerable
that model is.

Objectives, Norms, and Funding

    Many of the non-profits established over the past two decades have been founded
by journalists who used to work for commercial outlets and became concerned about
the ability of commercial media to provide public-service journalism. This is especially

                                                                 - 125 -
                                    Non-Profit Journalism

the case in democratic societies that lack a strong, state-supported, public-service
broadcasting system. Non-profit journalistic outlets often seek to produce the types
of content that their founders are concerned is in short supply elsewhere -- often
because such content is perceived to go unrewarded by market forces. This includes
expensive genres like investigative journalism and international journalism, as well as
topics that are deemed to be intractable or less-captivating to mass audiences, such as
homelessness and mass incarceration.

    Many non-profit journalistic outlets share some of the dominant role orientations,
norms, and news values associated with journalism in a particular context. For example,
conceptions of newsworthiness at non-profits are not wholly different from those
at their commercial counterparts. Instead, they are tweaked and, most importantly,
less encumbered by economic concerns. Moreover, for these outlets' content to be
considered journalism by audiences, it must still resemble to some extent the forms
and formats recognized as journalism within that context -- which the dominant,
typically commercial or state-supported, outlets play a large role in shaping.

    Non-profit outlets often raise funds from an array of sources. The two primary
sources tend to be audience-derived contributions and philanthropic grants. Audience-
derived contributions may include the subscription fees often found in commercial
media, but it typically also includes voluntary donations and crowdfunding campaigns.
Philanthropic grants often come from other non-profit organizations and foundations
that are devoted to promoting the civic good. For example, the Knight Foundation is
a major philanthropic organization in the United States, and it will sometimes provide
upwards of $100 million in grants each year to help advance journalism in the U.S.
For most other foundations, journalism constitutes a portion of their giving, which is
often related to a focus on democracy, community, or education. Researchers have
estimated that between 2009 and 2017, foundations provided more than $9 billion
worldwide in order to advance journalism -- though a significant portion of that was
in the United States.

    However, those two sources alone are rarely sufficient for non-profit journalistic
organizations. Many also draw upon advertising and sponsorships as supplemental
revenue sources, though their dependence on advertising is generally lower than
that of their commercial counterparts. They also engage in a range of additional
revenue-generating activities, like hosting conferences, social events, workshops, and
webinars -- though these activities usually only account for a small proportion of
overall revenue. Additionally, non-profit journalistic outlets benefit from favorable
tax status in some countries (including the United States), meaning that contributions
to them are tax-deductible and they themselves have to pay fewer taxes.

                                                                 - 126 -

Impact and Sustainability

    The dependence on philanthropic funding does not come without entangle-
ments. Such funders typically receive more requests for funding than they can fund,
and they thus tend to require organizations to justify the merit of their requests by
demonstrating their impact and sustainability.

    Impact is immensely difficult to measure and demonstrate. Funders will often
develop different ways of understanding impact, which may include measures of
the reach of a project (i.e., how many readers, viewers, or listeners it attracted), the
impact(s) it had on policy and governance (e.g., if it resulted in the passing of new
legislation or ousting of a corrupt figure), and the coverage it helped generate from
other news organizations (e.g., local investigations resulting from a national dataset
compiled by the non-profit). However, such developments can be difficult to track
and to tie directly to the non-profit's work, and they may not become apparent for a
long time. Moreover, the measures of impact imposed by a funder can significantly
shape the journalism produced by a non-profit journalistic outlet -- in both positive
and negative ways.

    Many (though not all) funders also ask non-profit organizations to demonstrate a
path toward self-sustainability. A substantial amount of the funding comes as so-called
`seed grants' that are intended to help an organization get off the ground, with the
expectation that the organization will find sufficient revenue sources over time to
no longer require assistance from that particular funder. Indeed, many non-profit
journalistic outlets tend to face an inflection point around their fourth or fifth year of
operation, and many that fail to establish themselves financially by then are forced
to close. Philanthropic funding can thus be an unstable and temporary source of
revenue.

    Impact and sustainability often become linked in practice within the context
of non-profit journalism. One way to demonstrate impact is to point to a growing,
loyal audience, which can then be monetized through donations and subscriptions.
Additionally, in order to reach a larger audience and increase the impact of a story, non-
profit journalistic organizations will often partner with larger, commercial journalistic
outlets to distribute the work. For example, the non-profit ProPublica launched its
first investigation in 2008 in partnership with the popular CBS television program
60 Minutes, and it has since worked with The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and NPR
to increase its reach. In some instances, the works are collaborations -- both the
non-profit outlet and the commercial outlet devote some resources to producing a
story -- but oftentimes, the non-profit provides the content for free simply to reach
more people. This is because some non-profits tend to publish infrequently, and

                                                                 - 127 -
                                    Non-Profit Journalism

their own websites and distribution channels tend to have smaller audiences. Thus,
even when funders are directly supporting a non-profit like ProPublica, they are also
offering indirect subsidies to the commercial organizations that use the non-profit's
work.

    Finally, it should be noted that although we have focused on funding for organi-
zations, there is also a robust sector of philanthropic funding for freelance journalists
(journalists who work independently and are not attached to any one organization).
Such journalists may then work with an established journalistic outlet, such as PBS,
or even a non-traditional partner (e.g., Netflix) to ensure wider distribution of their
work.

    State-Supported Journalism

    State-supported journalism refers to journalism that is directly supported by state
governments. This includes both public funding for independent, self-governed jour-
nalistic outlets and ventures as well as direct management of state-owned and state-
supervised media apparatuses.

    State-supported journalism is often promoted by governments that feel responsi-
ble for safeguarding and fostering sustainable, critical, and high-quality journalism
options that serve the public instead of commercial media owners, shareholders, and
advertisers. In these cases, state-supported journalism is argued to be a necessary
response to the market failure paradigm wherein self-regulated markets prove to be
inefficient or incapable of producing news that serves the public interest. Therefore,
state support is needed as a correction, in order to support journalism that can monitor
and hold accountable the institutions of government, commerce, and civic life.

    However, state-supported journalism can also encompass what are commonly
called state-controlled media, wherein the government funds media organizations to
more efficiently reach large audiences with the government's messaging. Under that
information regime, the media organization often works to advance the political
interests of the state by serving as the state's mouthpiece. Those interests may be
advanced both domestically and internationally.

Independent State-Supported Journalism

    Many countries around the world, from Argentina to Afghanistan to Albania to
Australia, have some kind of state-supported journalistic outlet. These outlets are
typically rooted in radio and television broadcasting, though there are some instances
of state-supported print media and digitally native media. This is due in large part to
the natural scarcity of broadcasting frequencies: There are only so many airwaves that

                                                                 - 129 -
                                State-Supported Journalism

broadcasting devices can use, and those frequencies have historically been treated as
public goods.

    However, any form of government support for journalistic media raises ques-
tions about the independence of the media producers. Put another way, how can a
government foot the bill for journalists without unduly influencing (if not outright
intervening in) the editorial process?

    One way to do this is to establish an independent governance model, as is the norm
in many European countries. For example, the British Broadcasting Corporation, or
the BBC, operates as a public service broadcaster that is funded directly by citizens
through an annual license fee that is set and collected by the government. Those
funds are then transferred to an independent company with a board of directors
that oversees the general direction of the BBC and an executive committee charged
with overseeing its day-to-day operations. By creating a managerial structure that is
largely separate from the British government, the BBC is generally able to remain
independent from it. Additionally, it operates under a royal charter that charges it
to produce public-interest journalism that advances the interests of the citizens of
the entirety of the United Kingdom. While it is not free from criticism (especially
from public officials who feel scorned), its journalistic arm (BBC News) is not only
well regarded internationally but is the largest broadcast newsgathering operation in
the world.

    Europe has been particularly successful in developing a public policy framework
that grants state subsidies to journalists and journalistic outlets that serve the public
interest, advance accountability and transparency, and contribute to critical thinking
and well-informed debate among citizens. Such efforts may include direct cash
payments to selected projects or general incentives (e.g., reduced rates for mailing
news media) that play a vital role in creating favorable economic conditions for a
public-interest culture in journalism.

    Moreover, those frameworks often help support public-service broadcasters -- organizations
like the BBC in the United Kingdom, France24 in France, and NRK in Norway -- that
are designed to produce public-service journalism and are often among the biggest
news producers in their countries. Researchers have found that countries with well-
regarded public-service broadcasters tend to have better-informed citizens.

    While the United States does offer some level of government support for jour-
nalism, its efforts pale in comparison to its European counterparts. For example, less
than 1% of National Public Radio's (NPR) funding comes from the federally funded
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) or from federal agencies and departments.
Most of NPR's funding comes from corporate sponsorships and dues paid by member

                                                                 - 130 -
                                State-Supported Journalism

stations across the country. Those member stations, in turn, receive just 12% of their
funding from the CPB and other federal, state, and local government sources. In
short, public media in the U.S. receives a relatively small amount of state support.
Instead, most public and non-profit journalistic outlets in the U.S. rely on charitable
contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations (e.g., crowdfunded
journalism and philanthropic funding).

State-Controlled Media

    In the absence of structures to protect the independence of journalists, state-
supported media can become state-controlled media. Under this environment, or-
ganizations will seek to appear journalistic but functionally serve as propagandist
organs of a government. This does not need to involve fabrication on the part of
the organization, or the production of disinformation. Instead, it may simply involve
the systematic exclusion of stories and perspectives that are critical of the state, and
the systematic over-inclusion of stories and perspectives that are favorable to the
state. (However, such outlets may, and some often do, produce false information that
reflects positively on the government.)

    For example, the Xinhua News Agency serves as the official state-run press agency
of the People's Republic of China. It is by far the biggest and most influential media
organization in China, and it is arguably the world's largest news organization in terms
of personnel. In addition to operating within China, it also has more than 170 news
bureaus -- or satellite offices -- worldwide, making it one of the most international
news organizations in the world.

    Xinhua has been routinely criticized for its deep connection to the Communist
Party of China, and its governance structure places it under the direct supervision of
party officials. As such, Reporters Without Borders has called it "the world's biggest
propaganda machine." Nevertheless, it has served as a crucial instrument for commu-
nicating its citizens' needs to party officials, and for (favorably) conveying the party's
policies and initiatives to citizens.

    Xinhua has also served as an instrument for increasing China's foreign influence. It
delivers its content through multiple mediums, including print, broadcast, and online,
and in multiple languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, English, Japanese,
Portuguese, and Russian. In recent years, Xinhua has acquired commercial real estate
in New York's Times Square, bolstered its English-language reporting staff, and started
an English-language satellite news network. Such efforts are capable of producing
strong journalism -- especially about matters only loosely related to China -- but they

                                                                 - 131 -
                                State-Supported Journalism
are generally driven by a desire to spread perspectives that are aligned with those of
the Chinese state.

    State-controlled journalism is not limited to China. It is present under many
authoritarian regimes, including Eritrea, North Korea, and Turkmenistan. Additionally,
even in semi-democratic societies, state-controlled media may exist and reflect the
political positions of ruling parties. In some cases, the dominant perspectives conveyed
by such outlets change drastically as political power transitions between parties,
making state-controlled media a bellwether of power.

    Key Takeaways

    » State-supported journalism refers to journalism that is directly supported

        by state governments.

    » Strong, independent public-service journalistic outlets can emerge in

        media systems that receive substantial state support. Many European
        countries have well-regarded public-service broadcasters that promote a
        well-informed citizenry.

    » State subsidies can also support state-controlled media outlets that are

        designed to promote the viewpoints of ruling parties and serve as instru-
        ments for advancing foreign influence.

  International News Coverage

    International news coverage has received considerable scholarly and professional
attention because it is a unique category of journalism. It not only tends to be processed
and prepared by specially trained professionals but involves particular newsgathering and
distributional challenges, and it can arguably produce a deeper and wider impact than any
other news category.

    International news coverage introduces some unique news values to the general
journalistic repertoire of news values. That general repertoire draws on values like
conflict, magnitude, and surprise to determine the newsworthiness of an event or
issue -- which must be tweaked in the context of international news. Additionally,
journalists will often face greater journalistic restrictions than they otherwise would
at home. (Even if they are working in a more open media environment, pressures
from home may still influence reporting.) Finally, the influence of international
news coverage can be felt in matters from war to peace, from global predicaments to
synergistic cooperation, and from ecological collapse to sustainable environments for
all global citizens. Put simply, no other news genre can wield such a large-scaled and
profound influence on so many aspects of human lives.

Determinants of International News Coverage

    According to media scholars Tony Harcup and Deirdre O'Neill, most published
news stories tend to draw upon a set of journalistic values about what makes some-
thing newsworthy. One such value is conflict, where developments that involve
controversies, arguments, fights, or insurrections (e.g., a politician breaking with their
party) are seen as being particularly newsworthy. A second value is magnitude, where
developments that potentially impact a large number of people (e.g., a court ruling
over abortion rights), or impact a few people significantly (e.g., a court ruling involving
an indigenous tribe's land rights), are seen as being more newsworthy. A third value is

                                                                 - 135 -
                               International News Coverage

surprise, where developments that deviate from the norm or shows stark contrasts
(e.g., the man bites the dog) are seen as being more newsworthy. Harcup and O'Neill
identify 15 such news values in all.

    However, international news coverage further complicates those general news
values. Analyses of international news content have found that events that involve
a foreign country that is culturally proximate and geographically close tend to receive
greater news coverage than events in non-proximate/close countries. For example,
U.S. audiences are often exposed to more stories about the United Kingdom than
Japan in part because the U.S. and the U.K. share more of their language, cultural
values, and history than the U.S. and Japan.

    However, there are important structural factors at play: Countries that are seen as
being more economically or militarily important (economic clout and military clout),
or are of geopolitical significance, also tend to receive more coverage. Put another way,
Japan may receive more coverage in U.S. journalistic media than Brazil because it is a
more important economic partner to the U.S. and because it is a significant partner in
containing China's influence in Asia -- which is a major U.S. interest. Similarly, Middle
Eastern countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen are relatively tiny economic
partners with the U.S., have relatively limited cultural proximity, and are certainly not
geographically close. However, they have received considerable journalistic attention
in the U.S. because of their significance to the U.S.'s geopolitical interests.

    It is difficult to say which of these so-called `determinants' of coverage is most
important because they vary across subject matter, situation, and timing. However,
researchers have found them to be of particular import across countries, meaning that
this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. Many countries, for example, devote significant
portions of their news hole (the space available for news within a news product) to
the U.S. because the U.S. is deemed to be an economic and military superpower that
is often entangled with the domestic country through trade deals and international
aid.

Representation of Countries and Issues

    An important finding from decades of analyses of international news coverage
is that there is a great deal of unevenness in the coverage of the world's countries,
and that dramatically different depictions of the same world are often presented to
audiences in different parts of the world.

    For example, scholars have found that European media tend to focus more on
Europe, North America, and the Middle East, while East Asian media are more likely

                                                                 - 136 -
                               International News Coverage

to cover China, Japan, the Koreas, and so forth. There is thus considerable evidence
for a geocentric tendency and regionalism in international news coverage across the
world's media.

    More broadly, the majority of international coverage has historically centered on
world powers. Emerging countries, mostly those in the Global South, are generally
far less likely to be covered by the world's elite media and leading news agencies
than those in the developed Global North. Therefore, limited coverage of emerging
countries is an issue that has been repeatedly pointed out by scholars -- though it
remains a thorny concern. Additionally, when emerging countries are covered by
foreign media, there is often a good chance that the topics of the stories will focus
on something negative or disastrous (e.g., coup d'états, national disasters, or plane
crashes).

    Scholars have also concluded that the immense variance of international news
coverage about identical events is the norm. A number of empirical studies have
demonstrated that particular issues and events -- for example, the Olympic Games,
climate change, or war -- are often covered in meaningfully different ways across
countries. This is often a reflection of the journalistic cultures of those places, and the
ways in which the given issue or event intersects with local interests. The consequence
of this is that audiences from different countries may get meaningfully dissimilar
stories (and even opposite perspectives) when reading, watching, or listening to news
coverage of the same events.

    The existence of the aforementioned `determinants' or the variance in coverage
should not be taken as evidence of national governments meddling with or dictating
journalistic coverage. Instead, it is a particular manifestation of existing news values
like relevance, where developments that involve matters that are perceived to be
relevant to the organization's audience tend to be seen as being more newsworthy.
Put another way, countries with greater cultural proximity tend to have more familial
ties, and countries with more economic clout tend to be important trading partners,
which have local impacts by way of things like import and export contracts with
regional businesses.

A Declining News Hole

    Both academic and professional observers have also witnessed a gradual and
steady decline in the amount of international news coverage, relative to other news
genres, since the turn of the century. A number of interconnected factors have
been identified as contributing to this decline. First, the production of international
news is far more expensive than that of domestic news, such as lifestyle news and

                                                                 - 137 -
                               International News Coverage

news commentaries. For example, international news requires obtaining access to
other countries, recruiting experienced and specialized reporters or trustworthy local
journalists, providing them with local fixers or translators, and budgeting for security
and unanticipated costs. Such costs are magnified in the case of television, which
often requires additional equipment and personnel.

    Second, the audience for international news is typically smaller than that of
domestic news (especially relative to genres like politics and sports), which leads
to lower ratings and less online traffic. One view of this phenomenon is that the
interest for international news needs to be cultivated, and international coverage must
therefore be designed to better resonate with audiences. This can be accomplished by
domesticating international news, or making those foreign developments more relevant
and accessible to local audiences by connecting them to domestic developments. This
view thus argues that journalistic outlets must invest more in international news and
make it more interesting or relevant, and a larger the audience would follow. This,
of course, introduces something of a chicken-and-egg conundrum that dissuades
journalistic outlets already facing economic challenges.

    Third, the Internet -- and social media in particular -- has also introduced greater
competition since freelance journalists and citizen journalists can now quickly produce
and distribute their own news content. This can promote a form of news coverage
that is more akin to aggregation, with professional journalists trying to gather and
contextualize observations made by non-professionals. However, this is sometimes
seen as a `lesser' journalistic product by other professional journalists since there was no
first-hand observation by news professionals. Consequently, such work can become
marginalized (made less prominent and afforded fewer resources). Moreover, it is now
far easier for audiences to go straight to a local source in another country -- though
language barriers still exist, of course.

Impacts Of International News Coverage

    Different theoretical perspectives, such as media dependency theory, underscore
that international news can be particularly influential to people's awareness and
understanding of issues, developments, and problems going on around the world.
Central to such perspectives is the notion that people generally have little contact
with those parts of the world (whether through direct experience by visiting those
places or indirect experience by meeting immigrants from those places). They must
therefore rely on mediated accounts of those places to shape their understandings.
Consequently, there has long been a fundamental concern that the distortions in the
way international news gets covered produces important distortions in the way local

                                                                 - 138 -
                               International News Coverage

citizens understand the rest of the world. In particular, it may lead to certain parts
of the world being unfairly ignored or misunderstood. This includes stereotypes of
`backwards' or `technologically illiterate' people living in `third world' countries.

    Conversely, placing the international media spotlight on a particular location
can also introduce problems. For example, instantaneous coverage of an unfold-
ing event -- like a terror attack, the kidnapping of villagers, or an outbreak in civil
conflict -- can shape public opinion in dramatic ways, leading to public calls for gov-
ernmental intervention by world leaders. Such demands can result in hasty and
ill-considered decisions and actions that have profound impacts on those places and
on broader international relations, as the world has seen in places like Afghanistan,
Somalia, and Syria in recent years.

    The concentration of the production of international news among a few global
journalistic outlets (e.g., The New York Times and the BBC) and international news
agencies (e.g., The Associated Press and Agence France Presse) also introduces some
concerns for international news coverage. Such arrangements not only emphasize
Western perspectives but tend to result in global news flows that go primarily from the
Global North to the Global South, rather than the other way (or horizontally within
the Global South). The Internet has helped to balance some of these flows by making
local publications more accessible to international audiences. Additionally, some
journalistic outlets have been established precisely to serve as counter-flows, such as
Qatar-based Al Jazeera English. Moreover, we now see more journalistic cooperation
across borders, as with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

    Ultimately, as different parts of the world become intricately interconnected, it
becomes increasingly difficult to truly separate domestic from foreign news. However,
work is needed to reverse the trend toward downsizing news holes for international
news, and to promote more equitable information flows.

   Global Journalistic Outlets

    Global journalistic outlets refer to those outlets that either have -- or have access
to -- staff members or contractors and informational resources that are sufficiently
widespread to justify a global status. In the case of news agencies (also called newswire
services), such outlets often supply information to clients around the world. In the case
of individual journalistic outlets, they typically have audiences that are themselves
global in nature.

    Such organizations are deserving of special attention because they are major
sources of international news, and thus often come to be among the primary definers
of the world outside one's national borders. Put another way, these outlets often see
it as their mission to help inform individuals about the world and, as a consequence
of their output, play a major role in shaping those individuals' understandings of it.

International News Agencies

    While journalistic outlets like The New York Times can be said to be global in nature,
there is another category of journalistic outlets that is particularly influential when it
comes to international journalism: news agencies.

    News agencies are effectively wholesale suppliers of news. They have large staffs
of reporters and freelancers who gather the news, package it, and distribute it to their
clients: other news organizations. Put another way, much of the international (and
domestic) news a reader of the Boston Globe might come across is actually originated by
a journalist working for a news agency. This is especially true for journalistic outlets
that do not have their own foreign correspondents -- which are most journalistic
outlets these days, due to the cost of maintaining a correspondent network. As such,
international news agencies are particularly influential given their direct and indirect
reach.

                                                                 - 141 -
                                Global Journalistic Outlets

    Three of the leading international news agencies today trace their roots to the
mid-nineteenth century. The first, The Associated Press, was established in New York in
1846 as a cooperative comprised of member newspapers and broadcasters. Basically,
members of the non-profit cooperative (which are mostly daily newspapers and
online news sites) may contribute a portion of their coverage to the cooperative,
which other AP members can then republish in their own publications. Moreover,
they also pay subscription fees, which allows the AP to employ hundreds of foreign
correspondents -- in addition to domestic journalists -- and operate more than 60
foreign news bureaus (satellite offices) around the globe. The Associated Press produces
more than 2,000 news stories each day (though only a portion of that is international
in nature), and its content appears in nearly all major print and online media.

    Another major news agency is Reuters, which was established in London in 1851
but is now a part of a publicly traded, Canadian-based multimedia conglomerate.
Reuters has an even larger international footprint than the AP, employing hundreds
of foreign correspondents in more than 80 different news bureaus around the world.
While Reuters has historically specialized in financial news, it also provides coverage
of a large range of subjects, from international conflicts to sporting events.

    A third major news agency is the Agence France Presse (AFP). AFP is the successor to
Agence Havas, the world's oldest news agency, having been established in 1835. Today,
AFP employs hundreds of foreign correspondents in more than 60 foreign news
bureaus. Although it derives a portion of its revenue from the French government,
it has a fairly independent governing structure that includes representatives from
the French press, French public service broadcasters, the French state, AFP staff, and
external experts.

    More recently, two other major players have joined these historical outlets. The
first, Bloomberg News, was established in New York in 1990 and specializes in financial
news. Although it has fewer foreign news bureaus than its competitors -- and those
news bureaus are primarily located in financial centers -- it has a comparable number
of foreign correspondents. The other recent addition is the China-based and state-
owned Xinhua News Agency. Although it was established in 1931, Xinhua's rapid
growth is a more recent phenomenon. Today, it rivals those other international news
agencies in size, scope, and reach.

    Four of these five major international news agencies are based in the U.S. or
western Europe, and they largely adhere to similar news cultures despite being head-
quartered in different countries. The AP, Reuters, AFP, and Bloomberg tend to focus
on so-called `hard news' (e.g., stories about public affairs, politics, business, and so on),
though they also cover some areas of so-called `soft news' (e.g., sports and entertain-

                                                                 - 142 -
                                Global Journalistic Outlets

ment). They also tend to adhere to a very neutral approach to reporting and writing,
and typically use the inverted pyramid style of writing, where the `who,' `what,' `when,'
and `where' tend to appear at the top, followed by quotes from different sources,
and then some background information near the bottom to contextualize the story.
Stories tend to feature a terse writing style and short paragraphs. Although these
agencies also produce news analyses that are more interpretive in nature, they clearly
label them as such. This neutral and systematic approach enables news agencies to
serve a wider range of clients (member outlets), and consequently reduce those clients'
newsgathering costs by providing them with a steady stream of prepackaged news
that cover even expensive genres, such as international news.

    There are, of course, smaller news bureaus that serve more regional clients and are
often less Westernized. Put another way, while they may not be as significant globally,
they are highly significant in bringing the world to their regions. These include
the state-supported EFE agency in Spain, the state-supported Anadolu Agency in
Turkey, the non-profit Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) in Germany, the non-profit
cooperative Kyodo News in Japan, and the non-profit cooperative Agenzia Nazionale
Stampa Associata (ANSA) in Italy.

Global Broadcasting

    Another subset of particularly important global journalistic outlets includes inter-
national broadcasters. When it comes to `wholesale' international television news, the
market has been largely dominated over the past three decades by subsidiaries of the
print news agencies.

    For example, The Associated Press has a subsidiary called Associated Press Television
News, or APTN. APTN produces more than 200 video stories per day, each with
an average run-time of two and a half minutes. It also broadcasts more than 11,000
hours of live video per year, which can be tapped into by any of its member outlets.
Reuters Television, a subsidiary of Reuters, produces more than 350 video stories
per day, in addition to thousands of hours of live video. Reuters TV's content is
used by nearly 800 broadcasters around the world. Other major suppliers to the
global wholesale television news market include AFPTV and Bloomberg TV. In short,
the most significant providers of televised international news are outgrowths of the
dominant suppliers of print international news.

    However, some individual broadcasters have also developed into global newsgath-
erers and disseminators. Of these, the two largest are state-supported BBC World
News, which is part of the London-based British Broadcasting Corporation, and
the commercial CNN International, which is part of the Atlanta-based Cable News

                                                                 - 143 -
                                Global Journalistic Outlets

Network. BBC World News claims to reach 99 million weekly viewers in over 200
countries and territories through its satellite, cable, streaming, and, in the U.K., free-
to-air channels. It further claims to be available to more than 440 million homes
worldwide, and BBC World News also produces more than 10 live news programs
of 30 minutes or longer, in addition to several prerecorded news programs. CNN
International has a similar global footprint.

    Many nations also have sizable international broadcasting outlets that may operate
as commercial, state-supported, or state-owned organizations -- or in some hybrid
fashion. Some organizations that are especially notable for their influence and reach
are Qatar-based Al Jazeera, Russia-based RT (formerly Russia Today), China-based
CCTV, and Venezuela-based Telesur.

Global News Systems and Soft Power

    Global journalistic outlets are major components of what can be thought of as
a global news system that incorporates print, broadcast, and online gatherers and
disseminators of news. Once published by a global outlet, the information is made
available to member organizations as a resource they can republish or adapt (in the
case of news agencies) and/or to the general public via packaged news stories. Even
when the news content is not directly republished or rebroadcast, it often inspires
further information gathering -- as with an Associated Press story about the spread of
an animal-borne disease in Europe inspiring an editor to assign an original local story
about the effects of the disease on local meat exports.

    In light of their reach, global journalistic outlets can serve as instruments of soft
power as they help seed and distribute certain ideas, values, and perspectives. The
historical dominance of Western outlets, for example, played a major role in the
diffusion of capitalistic and democratic values around the world, especially after
World War II. Such efforts do not have to be concerted or planned, such as by forcing
journalists to publish stories in support of certain policies or perspectives. They
often emerge naturally from the journalist's socialization and biases, and are diffused
over time. Critics will sometimes describe this phenomenon as a form of cultural
hegemony.

    However, some governments have instrumentalized global outlets as vehicles for
intentionally exerting soft power. This is especially the case for large, state-owned
media. For example, after the 1916 Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union-based TASS
news agency became a leading supplier of international news for the communist world,
and especially for countries in eastern and central Europe. TASS did not operate
on a commercial basis. Instead, it was a subordinate of the Communist Party of the

                                                                 - 144 -
                                Global Journalistic Outlets

Soviet Union and tended to produce news that aligned with (if not promoted) the
Party's perspectives. Today, critics contend that the Xinhua News Agency has received
substantial state backing in recent years to support its rapid growth in order to advance
China's growing soft power around the world. Xinhua's extensive newsgathering and
distribution operations have made it particularly influential in the emerging economies
of Africa, Asia, and South America.

    Other commercial and state-supported outlets have emerged in recent years that
are widely seen as credible news sources while challenging perspectives from the
Global North, even as they adopt some of its techniques. For example, the Qatar-based,
state-owned Al Jazeera (established in 1996) and Al Jazeera English (established in
1999) recruited many reputable journalists (including a number of BBC veterans)
and granted them a considerable amount of autonomy to produce impactful pieces
of investigative journalism. In some cases, Al Jazeera's journalism (especially that of its
English-language sibling) pointedly challenges policies favorable to Qatar, which adds
to the outlet's credibility around the world. The rise of global broadcasters like Al
Jazeera have helped promote the dissemination of counter-hegemonic perspectives
across international news ecosystems.

   Foreign Correspondents and
                  Bureaus

    Foreign correspondents refer to journalists who are employed to send news or comment
from a foreign country. Historically, being a staff correspondent was a highly desirable
job for journalists. It was also a status symbol since journalists were often only given
major correspondent postings if they had gained substantial experience and had
proven themselves in the newsroom. The position also had particular professional
prestige as correspondents were seen to be trustworthy enough to carry out the
journalistic outlet's mission with even greater autonomy. Finally, it had a certain
degree of personal glamor. Being a foreign correspondent allowed journalists to
report from exotic (and sometimes dangerous) locations -- and, sometimes, with a
rather nice expense account.

    In the past, foreign correspondents would typically be based in news bureaus, or
satellite offices set up for newsgathering operations. For example, The Associated Press may
have a Cairo bureau where a reporting team (sometimes as small as a single reporter
with support staff or as big as dozens of reporters) would be based and charged with
covering Egypt -- or even North Africa more broadly. For media organizations, a good
spread of foreign bureaus has also traditionally translated into cultural capital, as it was
evidence of the organization's resources and commitment to serious newsgathering.
Practically, however, it was an important resource for allowing correspondents to
establish themselves in a location, develop sourcing networks, and become immersed
in a culture. While many organizations with a major international presence still have
foreign news bureaus today, they are typically fewer and smaller than in the past.

                                                                 - 147 -
                         Foreign Correspondents and Bureaus

Foreign Correspondents and Values

    Historically, foreign correspondents were journalists from the same country where
their parent organization was based. Those journalists were then stationed abroad
for a temporary period. For example, the U.S.-based New York Times would often
take one of their American journalists and station him -- and, historically, it was
usually a man -- in one of their foreign news bureaus. In British, American, and
Australian media, the usual term of a posting was three years or less. After that time,
newsroom managers would often move that correspondent to another foreign bureau.
As correspondents gained experience, they would be sent to more desirable postings
like London, Washington, and Jerusalem.

    The logic behind these rotations was that news managers historically feared that
if a posting lasted too long, the foreign correspondent might become too much of
an insider and thus lose their ability to report objectively on that foreign country
(due to natural socialization processes). By rotating correspondents, they argued,
news managers could mitigate those negative effects (whether real or perceived) while
allowing countries to be covered through fresh perspectives over time. While there are
obvious flaws with this reasoning, it underscores the idea that foreign correspondence
has always required journalists to be insiders and outsiders at the same time.

    The emphasis on such rotations -- and on the broader phenomenon of sending
local reporters to cover foreign affairs -- is more contested today. Critics contend that
this design results in mainly Western correspondents from the Western Global North
reporting on countries that they cannot understand as well as local reporters would.
While foreign correspondents are typically well-versed in international affairs (many
were students of regions they cover), critics contend that such knowledge is not an ad-
equate substitute for local lived experience and the more extensive sourcing networks
brought by local journalists. Such a perspective aligns with a tradition of political
economy that views international journalism through the prism of global dominance.
From that perspective, the major global journalistic outlets and global news agen-
cies -- the most dominant of which are based in the Western Global North -- use their
privileged positions to not only set the news agenda for the rest of the world's media
(by virtue of their sizable news output) but also potentially shape, and sometimes
distort, how the rest of the world is depicted (to align with its Western perspective).

    In more recent years, there has been a move to hire more locals as foreign corre-
spondents (e.g., a full-time Moroccan journalist tasked with covering North Africa
from a regional bureau), as well as more part-time correspondents from foreign media
outlets (e.g., a local Moroccan journalist who files a certain number of stories from
Morocco and is on standby, in addition to their existing day job at a Moroccan news

                                                                 - 148 -
                         Foreign Correspondents and Bureaus

outlet). While such moves have been largely driven by economic motives -- such corre-
spondents are far cheaper to employ -- it has led to a change in attitudes about where
foreign correspondents should be from and how their job ought to be performed.

Foreign News Bureaus

    Historically, news organizations sought to establish foreign news bureaus in order
to have a stable newsgathering operation that could unearth important regional stories
and react quickly when there was a major development.

    Such bureaus are also valuable in that they offer a long-term perspective on the politics,
economics, and social issues of places and regions. First, bureaus are often established in
carefully selected cities that reflect geopolitical importance (e.g., Beijing and Brussels),
are important financial centers (e.g., London), or are locations where there are frequent
conflicts (e.g., Baghdad and Jerusalem). Second, while foreign correspondents at those
bureaus may rotate, supporting staff often do not. Such staff can play important roles
in interpreting the significance of stories, in connecting correspondents with local
sources, and by offering helpful context to stories. Third, bureaus offer a stable base of
operations. Journalists can travel lightly to other parts of a region -- and, often, more
dangerous parts of that region -- to cover a story knowing that they have a safe place
to return to and a reliable support team nearby.

    The value of foreign news bureaus is aptly illustrated by instances like the 2003
Iraq War. Outlets like the BBC, CNN, and The Associated Press, all of which had
Baghdad bureaus, were well-placed to chronicle the invasion of Iraq by U.S., U.K.,
Australian, and Polish forces. They had good regional sourcing networks that enabled
them to get insights from different parts of the country and to triangulate information
being fed by both Iraqi and Coalition officials. More importantly, however, is that
those bureaus allowed journalists to remain safely in Iraq for a lengthy period after the
invasion and thus bear witness to a worsening situation -- even though the dangers
still required them to rely extensively on local journalists and `fixers' to help capture a
broader picture.

    Although foreign news bureaus exist worldwide, the majority of bureaus -- and
certainly the largest and best resourced of them -- are in western Europe and the U.S.
According to a recent survey, the cities with the most news bureaus were Brussels,
London, Moscow, Rome, New York, Washington, Beijing, Berlin, and Madrid. As
one might expect, this results in an over-representation of news from those countries
since foreign correspondents are more likely to identify and report on stories near to
the places where they are stationed.

                                                                 - 149 -

Economics of Bureaus and Correspondents

    At the height of the boom in international news coverage in the 1980s and 1990s,
even regional and metropolitan newspapers in the United States had foreign bureaus.
For example, The Chicago Tribune had offices in places like Baghdad, Buenos Aires,
and Moscow. However, by the 2010s, most newspapers -- and even some newspaper
chains -- had shuttered all of their foreign news bureaus and many stopped employing
foreign correspondents full-time. Today, only elite newspapers in the U.S., such as
The New York Times and The Washington Post, maintain a sizable number of bureaus
and correspondents, as well as some major broadcast outlets like ABC and CNN.

    The reason for this decline is not a shortfall in public interest in foreign news -- though
some scholars have observed a downward trend of audience interest in foreign
news -- or a reduction in the newsworthy foreign news events. Instead, many journal-
istic outlets have simply elected to devote their dwindling budgets to more `efficient'
newsgathering efforts through the use of freelancers, stringers, and so-called `parachute
journalists' instead of supporting the expensive infrastructure needed to support a
news bureau. Indeed, supporting a bureau means paying for office and house rentals,
a permanent staff, health care and education for said staff, and auxiliary services
like drivers, translators, and sometimes security personnel. Such high costs must
now be negotiated against (much) cheaper subscriptions to global news agencies or
aggregation-based practices that rely on user-generated content (e.g., tweets, Face-
book posts, Instagram pictures, and YouTube videos) posted by citizens in locations
abroad. The latter phenomenon has led to concerns about the de-professionalization of
international journalism.

    This is not just a U.S.-based phenomenon, though. In the United Kingdom,
for example, there has been a similar reduction of bureaus among the country's
newspapers. This includes bureaus in nearby European nations that are deeply
intertwined with the U.K. and its affairs. Instead, there has been a move toward
teaming up with other organizations to develop newsgathering partnerships, alongside
the broader trend toward relying on global news agencies for material.

    As such, foreign correspondence is an area of journalism that has been partic-
ularly affected by the industry's economic challenges, and it has seen substantial
changes in recent years as a result. What was once an international symbol of or-
ganizational prestige and a reward for being a good journalist is now an easy target
for budget cuts. Nevertheless, though fewer in number, both full-time, bureau-based
foreign correspondents and news bureaus remain important features of international
journalism.

                                                                 - 150 -

        Parachute Journalism

    Parachute journalism refers to the practice of briefly dispatching journalists to cover a
news story far from their home base. For example, this might involve sending a journalist
who regularly works out of New York into Venezuela to cover a political uprising, and
then extracting them back to New York in a few days' time.

    Parachute journalism has gained more attention as traditional news media have cut
their budgets for international news, and consequently the number of full-time foreign
correspondents and foreign news bureaus, due to economic constraints. Parachuting
journalists in typically entails far lower costs as it does not require the outlet to pay
for a permanent office, support staff, an apartment, and allowances for spouses and
children. Instead, parachute journalists may simply be based at a journalistic outlet's
headquarters or, as is often the case for television broadcasters, near transportation
hubs like Atlanta, Dubai, Paris, and Tokyo.

    Parachute journalism is often used pejoratively in connection to a broader critique
of foreign correspondence that highlights its emphasis on sensational stories of coups
and natural disasters that are lacking in context and deeper understanding. However,
parachute journalism can be leveraged in positive ways.

Critiques of Parachute Journalism

    Critics of parachute journalism contend that journalists who parachute into for-
eign news sites often lack a fundamental understanding of the culture and history of
those places. Moreover, they often have a limited grasp of both the language skills
and social customs of the places they cover, which forces them to rely extensively
on intermediaries like translators and `fixers.' Sometimes, the journalists parachuting
in may have little experience working abroad. Finally, such journalists are typically
not given the opportunity to stick around long enough to acquire the necessary
background to deeply report out a story, or to follow up on its consequences.

                                                                 - 153 -
                                     Parachute Journalism

    The broader implication of this is that parachute journalism can result in shallow
stories that focus on episodes rather than themes. Put another way, it can result in de-
contextualized coverage that is driven more by incidents than by a broader trend.
In addition to an increased likelihood for making journalistic errors, critics also con-
tent that parachute journalism can promote stereotypical and ethnocentric versions
of events that present international affairs as `exotic' things, promote `otherness,' or
focuses on clashes of cultures and an `us' versus `them' framework. Furthermore,
the journalists' lack of cultural understanding can result in the omission of nuance
and important contradictions. Lastly, parachute journalists may feel less pressure to
consider the impact of their reporting or to correct their mistakes, as they will typically
quickly move on to another place after they have finished their reporting assignment.

    These critiques are not just philosophical in nature. Scholars have found that
parachute journalists tend to rely more on government sources and social elites since
they are more readily available and such journalists have not had the time to establish
a more diverse sourcing network. The consequence is that such accounts tend to
reflect the perspectives of those in power -- and, in some instances, result in the
recirculation of propaganda. Moreover, scholars have found that stories by parachute
journalists tend to offer less context and are more likely to mischaracterize events and
misreport details while disproportionately making use of shallower, conflict-oriented
news frames.

Value of Parachute Journalism

    However, parachute journalism also offers some benefits. The chief benefit is that
it at least allows for some form of eyewitness journalism by professional journalists
during a time of cutbacks to full-time, bureau-based foreign correspondents and to
international news coverage more broadly.

    For example, journalistic outlets in small and midsized markets can no longer
afford to spend a quarter of a million dollars per year permanently stationing a foreign
correspondent abroad. However, they can afford to fly a reporter (and production
team, in the case of television) abroad to report on a few stories that are significant to
their community but might not receive adequate coverage from global news agencies.
This might include, as one example, a health program that a local community church
is organizing abroad in response to a humanitarian crisis. While such stories may
come with some shortcomings, they at least increase coverage where there might have
been none. (That said, sometimes no news coverage is often better than poor news
coverage.)

                                                                 - 154 -
                                     Parachute Journalism

    Moreover, while parachute journalism is typically associated with general as-
signment reporters -- that is, reporters who do not specialize in a particular beat or
topic -- it can involve parachuting in subject experts. For example, a journalistic out-
let may have a dedicated energy reporter or an environmental reporter who would
be better able to cover the impacts of a nuclear power plant meltdown than the
bureau-based correspondent assigned to that region. Similarly, an art critic may be
able to offer greater depth in covering a new fashion trend in Mozambique than the
bureau-based regional correspondent more used to covering politics.

    Critics of traditional foreign correspondence have also argued that international
journalism has always involved some form of parachuting. Indeed, a country like
France has a number of local cultures, yet correspondents parachuting in to a small
town from Paris may have little understanding of that town's culture. Moreover, many
outlets have a single bureau and correspondent to cover regions made up of many
countries, each with a different history and set of customs -- such as by using Jerusalem
as a hub for covering the Middle East. Put another way, those critics contend that
some form of parachute journalism is inevitable even under good circumstances, and
that it is therefore just part of international journalism.

    Ultimately, parachute journalism has become a significant and growing aspect
of international journalism. While the practice has evolved largely as a response to
financial constraints, it has not fully substituted the value of full-time, bureau-based
foreign correspondents that at minimum tend to have deeper understanding of the
regions they cover. Nevertheless, amid those constraints, it does offer some coverage
where there otherwise would be none.

              News Sources

    The term `news source' refers to any person, organization, document, or object that
provides information to journalists. This may include the spokesperson for an interna-
tional aid group, an academic, or a regular citizen who witnessed an event. It may also
include press releases, court filings, reports published by interest groups, or datasets
produced by government agencies.

    Sources are crucial to journalism for several reasons. First, journalists cannot
observe everything first-hand. For example, they may be asked to write a story about
an individual killed by an on-duty police officer, even though the journalist did not
witness the shooting. As such, the journalist must seek out individuals who may
have seen the shooting and triangulate their accounts to approximate the truth about
what happened. Second, journalists lack expertise in certain matters, and they must
therefore speak with an expert source (e.g., a climate scientist) in order to better inform
news audiences. Third, sources are sometimes the center of a story, as with the head
of a government agency who is alleged to have engaged in corrupt acts and should be
given a chance to respond to the allegations.

    However, the relationship is not unidirectional. Sources also need journalists.
First, sources often depend on journalists to spread their views. Without the support
of international media, for example, a climatologist's research findings may not receive
a great deal of attention or impact policymakers around the globe. Second, sources
gain legitimacy by being featured in respected news media. For example, a rebel
leader in Kyrgyzstan may be seen as important (and possibly legitimate) if they're
deemed worthy of being profiled by The New York Times. And, third, sources often
have agendas of their own and seek to promote them by gaining media attention. For
example, the head of an agency may play up international tensions for a news story
in order to secure more funding for their agency.

    Sourcing is particularly important because some scholars have argued that what a

                                                                 - 159 -
                                            News Sources

source is quoted as saying can be even more important than what the journalist writes.
That is, news audiences may view the source as being more knowledgeable than
the journalist, and thus view the quote as more authoritative than the surrounding
context offered by the journalist. (Conversely, audiences may also view the source as
more self-interested, especially if they already have low trust in that kind of source.)
Moreover, even when they are not quoted, sources often influence how journalists
think about a development and consequently produce news about it.

Sourcing, Power, and Authority

    Given that both journalists and sources often have something to gain and lose in
their exchanges, the practice of sourcing can also be thought about as an exchange of power.
The journalist-source relationship can be adversarial as well as mutually beneficial.
For example, a journalist may benefit from having frequent access to a high-ranking
official, who in turn benefits from having a sympathetic ear during times of distress.
Conversely, a journalist may receive public acclaim for producing a story that details
a previous source's dishonesty.

    This negotiation of power is further implicated by notions of reputation and
authority. Journalists are more likely to receive access to sources and cooperation from
them if the journalist (or the organization they work for) is perceived to be prestigious,
or if they have access to an audience of interest to the source. For example, a highly
partisan commentator on YouTube may get an exclusive interview with a high-profile
politician because the politician is trying to increase their outreach with younger
members of their base. There is considerable inequity in who is able to draw on
specific information sources, and often in ways that favor high-profile, mainstream
journalistic outlets or news media with desirable niche audiences.

    In a similar vein, sources are themselves more likely to be selected by journalists if they
are located prominently within a power structure. Put another way, the closer a source is
to the locus of power, the more likely it is that a journalist will believe that they are
worthy of being interviewed. This is because cultures of journalism often treat those
with power as being particularly worthy of attention (given their ability to influence
society or some development), and because their position of power is often seen as
an indicator of some measure of `legitimacy' (at minimum to some group of people).

    Scholars have found that individuals who occupy positions of authority are more likely
to have their versions of `truth' be more readily accepted both by journalists and news
audiences. Conversely, those who are seen or treated as `outsiders' or `underdogs'
are typically not taken as seriously. For example, journalists have historically been

                                                                 - 160 -
                                            News Sources

more deferential to a police officer's account of an officer-involved shooting than the
victim's.

    Growing polarization has challenged this, however, especially when it comes to
political actors. In such cases, powerful individuals are simultaneously more likely
to have their version of `truth' readily accepted by one group and readily rejected by
another. Nevertheless, the apparent existence of a hierarchy of credibility points to
a journalistic bias to be more deferential to institutional sources like police officers,
military commanders, and other government officials -- even in cases where journalists
do not fully trust them.

    While deference to sources in positions of power (or produced by people or
organizations in positions of power) is a common finding across countries, scholars
have also found that journalistic trust in institutional structures can vary considerably
across countries. For example, journalists in some countries (e.g., Estonia and the
United Arab Emirates) express a relatively high degree of trust in the police, while
those in others (e.g., Argentina and Tanzania) express low trust. Journalists in the U.S.
tend to have relatively low levels of trust in the institutions they cover. Put another
way, most U.S. journalists approach claims with a healthy skepticism, even if they're
coming from powerful institutions like the U.S. government or the military.

Congruence and Availability

    Sourcing practices aren't defined solely by power structures, though. Journalists
and their sources are human beings, and they are thus subject to a range of human
biases.

    One particularly important bias is homophily, or the tendency of individuals to
associate and bond with people who are similar to them. In the context of journalist-source
relations, it produces a phenomenon wherein journalists are more likely to interview
people who share their characteristics. Put another way, male journalists are more
likely to interview male sources while female journalists are more likely to interview
female sources. Similarly, journalists of color are more likely to interview sources of
color, and so on.

    There is less and less-clear evidence about how this phenomenon impacts how
sources respond to journalists -- that is, if it impacts their willingness to speak to a
journalist who does not share their characteristics. However, there is enough evidence
from psychology and sociology to presume that sources would be less willing to open
up to someone who appears to be a stranger. This, in turn, raises important concerns
about the historic over-representation of white, male journalists both domestically

                                                                 - 161 -
                                            News Sources

(in the case of the U.S.) and internationally (as foreign correspondents reporting on
developments around the globe).

    Another important consideration has to do with the simple availability of sources.
Reporters typically operate on deadlines, be it a fixed deadline in the case of traditional
media or a continuous, ASAP deadline in the case of many online media. Because
of this deadline pressure, journalists are drawn to sources who are predictable and
responsive.

    Put another way, journalists will often turn to sources who respond often and quickly.
They maintain address books with recurring sources, which in turn increases the
likelihood of the same sources being interviewed. This is especially the case for public
information officers or press agents, or public relations professionals whose job it is to
respond to media requests and whose training allows them to promote perspectives
favorable to their employer.

    The growing resource constraints and inequities within journalism has thus re-
sulted in an even greater reliance on sources who are readily available, since journalists
continue to be pressed to do more work with fewer resources (and the same, if not
quicker, time restrictions). That, in turn, benefits official and privileged sources who
have the resources to respond often, quickly, and with a well-managed message. In-
deed, empirical studies of news coverage -- both domestic and international -- routinely
find an over-representation of government sources and spokespeople.

    Key Takeaways

    » News sources refer to people, organizations, documents, or objects that

        provide information to journalists. This may include a spokesperson or a
        report produced by an agency.

    » News sourcing involves exchanges of power, with both journalists and

        sources having something at stake. Additionally, both journalists and
        sources are more likely to be interacted with if they are located in high
        places within their respective power structures.

    » Journalists are more likely to interview sources who share important visible

        characteristics with them. Additionally, sources who are more readily
        accessible are usually more likely to be interviewed by journalists.

                   Fixers

    International journalism is often associated with foreign correspondents who visit
new locations and doggedly unearth important stories through their enterprising
individual labor. However, international journalism actually depends heavily on local
workers. So-called `fixers' make up one such group of workers that is crucial to the
production of international news.

    Fixers are local workers who are hired by foreign correspondents (or their organizations)
to serve as translators or guides, or who provide other kinds of reportorial assistance. Fixers
frequently work for local media outlets in the country, and are often staff journalists
themselves for those outlets. However, in the context of working as a fixer, they
will usually help explain the context to the foreign correspondent, connect that
correspondent with the contacts and sources the fixer has developed over the course of
their career, and serve as translators during interviews conducted by the correspondent.
Sometimes, they are given more menial, logistical tasks, such as reserving a vehicle or
hiring protective services for the foreign correspondent. They may also play a role
in safeguarding the correspondent by being more sensitive to worsening conditions
during an interview or site visit.

Fixers as Ad-Hoc Laborers

    Fixers play key roles in setting up a story but they are seldom given the opportunity
to become deeply involved in how the story is told. Put another way, their involvement in
the latter stages of news production, such as the writing of the story, is limited. A major
consequence of this is that unlike stringers or freelancers, who are typically credited
by name in a story (either as a co-author at the top of a story or as a contributor at the
bottom), fixers typically receive little or no public credit. They are often only known
to the journalists they work with and are discovered largely through word-of-mouth.
For example, a foreign correspondent visiting Bolivia may ask fellow correspondents

                                                                 - 163 -
                                                 Fixers

who are part of a Slack channel or Facebook group about the Bolivian fixers they
would recommend. The foreign correspodent would then establish contact with the
suggested fixers, and work with whomever is available or best suited for the given
story. Thus, despite their crucial contributions, fixers occupy one of the lowest ranks
within the hierarchy of international journalists and have limited opportunities for
advancement.

    For example, consider the case of a white, Christian foreign correspondent work-
ing for The Washington Post who is sent to Egypt to cover the emergence of the Muslim
Brotherhood as a political force during the country's parliamentary elections. That
correspondent may not speak Arabic, and thus may not be able to ask many of the
locals about their impressions of that political party. As such, someone fluent in the
local language is necessary. The correspondent may have done some background
research on the Muslim Brotherhood and recent political trends in Egypt, but the
information they are coming across is likely written in English and filtered through a
Western perspective. As such, someone with local expertise would be helpful in order
to not perpetuate some important biases. The correspondent may not be allowed to
enter certain areas because they do not share the local faith, or because they are not a
local citizen (as might be the case for a voting site). In such cases, someone who meets
the requirements to ethically enter those places in order to observe things first-hand
(or speak to a more diverse cast of sources) is necessary.

    Given the circumstances in that example, a fixer would be a crucial aide in re-
porting that story. However, even if they performed all of those tasks -- translating,
contextualizing, and even doing some original reporting -- they may still not receive
any credit on the published story. Instead, they would be employed for a couple of
days' work, and perhaps paid as little as $50 each day (depending on how big of a deal
the event or incident was). They would likely not be eligible for any additional benefits,
such as extended medical care if they were to get hurt in the course of reporting of
the story. And, often most importantly to some fixers, they may not have much of a
voice in how their country is ultimately presented to an international audience.

Fixers and Consequences

    While the lack of recognition presents both monetary and professional issues for
fixers, perhaps the even bigger issue is that they often feel greater repercussions when
things go wrong than the correspondents and outlets that hire them.

    For example, a fixer may be willing to leverage their connections with a local
militant group to connect a foreign correspondent with the group's leader. During the
course of the interview, the correspondent may break an agreed-upon arrangement,

                                                                 - 164 -
                                                 Fixers

such as by capturing video of the group's compound despite pledging to not record
anything. The correspondent may also mischaracterize important aspects of the
interview or depict that group under an unduly negative light, in ways that the fixer
would never have done if they were reporting the story themselves. By the time
the story is published, the correspondent may have returned to a safe location in
their home country. In contrast, the fixer may not be able to go anywhere else. The
correspondent's actions may thus not only jeopardize the fixer's sourcing network
but potentially put them (and their family) in harm's way.

    Foreign correspondents must thus be sensitive to the harms their actions and
reporting can cause to their local collaborators. While many foreign correspondents
are cognizant of this and behave accordingly, the pressures to do more with less
and to provide news reports that stand out in a crowded information ecosystem
can push correspondents to neglect their impacts on fixers. Thus, there is arguably
an ethical imperative for the institution of international journalism to offer more
structural support for fixers, both in terms of the reward mechanisms for their work
and harm-minimization solutions.

    Key Takeaways

    » Fixers are local workers who are hired by foreign correspondents (or their

        organizations) to serve as translators or guides, or who provide other kinds
        of reportorial assistance. They frequently work as journalists for local
        media organizations in a country but are hired on an ad-hoc basis to
        support the correspondent.

    » Despite their crucial contributions to the reporting of a story, fixers receive

        little public credit or monetary reward for their work. They are rarely given
        a byline on a story and receive small stipends and few benefits. This, in turn,
        limits their professional development opportunities within journalism.

    » Fixers often feel greater and stronger consequences for the actions of a

        foreign correspondent than the correspondent themselves because the
        fixer may have to stay in the country long after the story is published. This
        may involve losing future access to some of their sources as well as being
        placed in harm's way.

                                                                 - 165 -

         Non-Governmental
             Organizations

    Contemporary journalism -- whether domestic or international -- draws heavily
on information subsidies, or ready-to-use information products created by third parties
interested in gaining access to media time and space. An information subsidy may take the
form of a press release by a company that includes quotes from its chief executives,
which a journalist can easily copy into a story involving that company. Alternatively,
it may take the form of video or audio produced by that company that can be used
as B-roll, or supplemental content that journalists intercut with their main content
when producing an audiovisual story. Such content is thus typically designed to
be used directly by journalists. That is, they are produced in a journalistic style but
are either designed to promote narratives that are favorable to their authors or to
highlight issues, problems, and solutions that the authors advocate for (e.g., providing
ready-to-use footage of a starving polar bear to call attention to climate change). In
addition to information subsidies, journalists also increasingly rely on the reports and
observations of third parties.

    One particularly important set of third parties in this context is NGOs, or non-
governmental organizations. An NGO refers to entities that are at least nominally inde-
pendent of government, voluntary in nature, and interested in the pursuit of some public
good (e.g., advancing human rights, mitigating climate change, reducing poverty). This
includes entities like Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, and The Red
Cross.

The Journalist-NGO Relationship

    While NGOs' primary mission is to advance their respective cause -- such as
fighting disease in the case of Doctors Without Borders -- they also often seek media

                                                                 - 167 -
                            Non-Governmental Organizations

coverage to achieve a range of objectives. This may include boosting awareness of
the issues they care about, lobbying political and business leaders to take certain
actions, raising funds from would-be donors and foundations, and promoting their
organizational brands.

    As a result of declining revenues, journalistic outlets in many countries -- and
especially in Western Europe and North America -- have reduced their coverage of
topics that are important to many NGOs because those topics often fail to generate
large audiences. Moreover, budget cuts have reduced journalists' ability to visit places
that are of particular interest to NGOs -- and often the places where conditions
for a particular issue may be worst. Consequently, NGOs have ramped up their
information offerings in recent decades in order to provide journalistic outlets with
highly professional information subsidies that are easy to integrate into the outlet's
journalistic work. Indeed, larger NGOs often have individuals who monitor news
coverage to identify advocacy angles and have taken to hiring former journalists who
can produce content that mimics typical news formats and norms.

    NGOs also routinely employ researchers who produce rigorous, factual reports that
are of great use to journalists. These reports are often sent directly to journalists who
regularly cover related issues (in addition to other stakeholders), with accompanying
fact sheets and summaries. NGOs will often make the authors of those reports
available to journalists so the journalist may interview the researchers themselves.
While this is less certain to generate positive coverage than a direct information
subsidy, it at least increases the likelihood that the issue will receive coverage.

    The relationship between NGOs and journalists can be beneficial to both parties.
For journalists, it provides them with cheap, yet often useful and reliable, content
for their stories. Indeed, many NGOs are rigorous in their work and produce reports
that are at minimum factually sound. Moreover, they often provide action recom-
mendations from experts, which can be useful to journalists' desire to offer potential
solutions in their reports (in addition to the usual objective of identifying problems).
Finally, they provide journalists with a network of potential sources who are on the
ground and can describe situations in places journalists cannot access, such as areas
where conflict, disease, or natural disasters have broken out.

NGOs and News Coverage

    There are important journalistic downsides to the relationship between journalists
and NGOs, though. For one, it risks turning journalistic outlets into a platform for
advocacy and fundraising, especially if the proximity between the two parties ends
up promoting uncritical coverage. Indeed, while NGOs often produce rigorously

                                                                 - 168 -
                            Non-Governmental Organizations

researched, factual information, they are not designed to be journalistic outlets. They
thus sometimes have objectives and employ practices that are inconsistent with
what is considered ethical journalism. Moreover, many NGOs now have their own
information channels via their websites and platforms like Facebook and YouTube
for distributing the content they produce, which potentially allows them to bypass
news media altogether.

    However, scholars have found that NGOs often struggle to either make the news
or draw large audiences to the information products they distribute via their own
channels (e.g., Instagram account). Instead, government officials (who frequently
dismiss critical claims by NGOs) tend to receive far more attention and deference
from journalists, such as by being quoted more often and more prominently within a
story. This puts NGOs at a relative disadvantage in their quest to generate publicity
and acceptance of their recommendations. However, research has found that NGOs
have been more effective in shaping the news agendas for particular kinds of issues,
such as those related to the environment.

    Key Takeaways

    » Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) refer to entities that are at least

        nominally independent of government, voluntary in nature, and interested
        in the pursuit of some public good. An example of an NGO would be
        Reporters Without Borders.

    » NGOs, and larger NGOs in particular, often produce their own information

        materials and actively work with journalists to promote both their causes
        and perspectives. This relationship can be beneficial to both parties, such
        as by generating attention for the NGO's work while providing journalistic
        outlets with high-quality information subsidies.

    » Journalists must be careful not to approach NGOs uncritically, though.

        While NGOs can be helpful and trustworthy, they may have objectives
        and employ practices that are inconsistent with those of journalists.

      User-Generated Content

    User-generated content, also known as UGC, refers to content that is created and
shared by users of platforms and products, including social media and news websites.
UGC may come in an array of forms and formats, such as text, photos, videos, audio,
and memes.

    The proliferation of networked devices and interactive platforms has led to an
explosion of user-generated content. Many of today's most popular service-oriented
websites are based in whole or in part on user-generated content. For example,
TikTok's content base is largely comprised of user-submitted videos; Yelp revolves
around citizen reviews of businesses; and Rotten Tomatoes features movie ratings from
regular people alongside reviews by professional film critics. Even major platforms
like Facebook and Twitter could not exist without user-generated content.

    The explosion of user-generated content has led some scholars to argue for an in-
between category of individuals called produsers, who readily interchange from being
the users of a product to producers of product-related content. For example, highly
motivated fans of the TV show My Little Pony can create a wiki-based community
around the show that details each pony's backstory and offers original analyses of the
show's main themes. As such, scholars have argued, the distinction between producers
and audiences has been further blurred in recent decades.

UGC in Journalism

    Although user-generated content is common across all digital domains, it plays
a unique role in the context of online journalism. Journalists utilize user-generated
content to complement, augment, inform, and even provide the basis for their own
journalism. Meanwhile, audiences use it to make their own voices heard and to engage
in the process of reporting and sharing information.

                                                                 - 171 -
                                   User-Generated Content

    To illustrate the evolution of user-generated content within the context of jour-
nalism, consider the letter to the editor. Before the internet, such letters were the most
common means for audiences to get in touch with news producers. People wrote
letters to the editor reflecting on the news, sharing their own stories, complaining
about specific types or topics of coverage, asking questions for clarification, and shar-
ing news tips with journalists. Some of those letters would then go on to appear in
the newspaper -- typically in a designated area within the Opinion section -- making
them an early form of user-generated content. However, those letters were limited to
text as a medium, depended on the publisher's schedule for publishing letters (and
willingness to publish a letter), were generally subject to an editor's alterations (they
would often abridge the letters), and were frequently in competition with other letters
about the same topic. In short, space constraints meant that only a tiny fraction of
letters were ever published and rarely on the letter-writer's terms.

    In contrast, today's news websites, apps, and social media pages regularly solicit
and share user-generated content alongside journalist-produced news. Journalistic
slideshows of sporting events (e.g., a local high school football game) frequently feature
fan-taken photos. Comments sections at the bottom of articles invite readers to share
their thoughts about (or responses to) news. Journalistic outlets' Facebook accounts
ask readers for their worst weather-related disaster stories. Hashtags allow Twitter
and Instagram users to connect their own stories and images to coverage of a topic
appearing on news websites through different widgets on the page. Some news
websites even allow community members to upload events to be included in the
outlet's online calendar page. And, some news aggregation websites focus largely
on user-generated content, as with sports news portals that source from popular fan
blogs.

    As such, some journalistic outlets have turned to user-generated content as a way
to advance their objective of providing the public a forum for engaging with civic
information and to make journalism more participatory. Others have turned to UGC
primarily as a cheap source of content or to increase the time users spend on the
website. In short, the extent of the use of user-generated content, and the ways in
which UGC are incorporated into news products, does vary widely across outlets, but
the industry as a whole makes use of a lot more user-generated content today than in
prior decades.

Benefits and Complications

    There are many reasons why user-generated content is valuable for journalistic
outlets. At an ideological level, it can be a way to give news audiences a voice in

                                                                 - 172 -
                                   User-Generated Content

the coverage and dissemination of information, and engage them with the news and
the process of reporting it. For example, CNN's iReport was an early attempt by a
journalistic outlet to create a digital platform designed to help audiences easily share
their own video-based citizen journalism.

    At an economic level, research suggests that creators of user-generated content
tend to become more active and loyal members of the spaces they contribute to
(e.g., an online community or news website). That engagement and loyalty can help
generate positive financial outcomes as well, since such users may visit more frequently
and feel even more motivated to pay a subscription fee or make a donation. Moreover,
user-generated content can be a free alternative to professionally produced content
(e.g., fan photos from a game that replace a photojournalist's work) or inexpensive
filler (e.g., free opinion columns or a replacement for person-on-the-street interviews).

    However, user-generated content also presents journalistic outlets with some
challenges. It has the potential to blur the traditional boundaries of journalism by
elevating the work of non-professional actors who aren't trained in the professional
norms and ethical standards of journalism. For example, user-generated photos or
embedded social media posts are usually clearly distinguished as such by credit lines
and other signals that make clear that the author of the work is not a journalist.
However, research has shown that audiences often do not meaningfully distinguish
messages produced by different authors (who may employ different standards). That
is, while audiences can accurately identify that a news story and a tweet embedded
within it were produced by different people, they often muddle the messages together.

    This can become especially problematic when it comes to forum-style user-
generated content appearing alongside news products (e.g., comments under an
online news story). Such content may feature personal opinions and stories, many
of which are much more overtly biased than journalistic standards allow. They may
also include misinformation and disinformation, as well as deeply unprofessional
elements, such as insults or curse words. Journalistic outlets therefore have an ethical
duty to engage in some form of content policing. This can be both morally prob-
lematic (e.g., determining what kind and amount of moderation is appropriate) and
economically challenging (e.g., having to hire a team of moderators). It can also be
legally problematic if a journalist excerpts user-generated content that is defamatory
without engaging in basic fact-checking measures.

    Finally, journalistic outlets must increasingly cope with the fact that user-generated
content and online discussions about news are increasingly being produced or taking
place on platforms outside their own. Put another way, while letters to the editor were
previously sent to the journalistic outlet (giving them control over if and how to use

                                                                 - 173 -
                                  User-Generated Content
that content) more of today's engagement is occurring on platforms like Facebook,
Instagram, and Twitter (not only resulting in less journalistic control over the content
but increasing their dependency on third-party platforms). Thus, in a way, professional
journalistic work is becoming a content subsidy of its own for discourses that largely
take place on forums outside the outlet's own.

    Key Takeaways

    » User-generated content refers to content that is created and shared by

        users of platforms and products. It can include text, photos, videos, audio
        files, memes, and other types of content.

   Crowdsourcing and Ambient
               Journalism

    While journalists have historically worked in a more solitary fashion, this is be-
coming less so the case today. Journalists are now more likely to work within teams
in their organization, participate in collaborations across organizations, and involve
their audiences in different aspects of news production.

    This latter development -- the incorporation of active audiences -- is largely the
result of new communication technologies and platforms that make it easier for audi-
ences to engage with each other and with journalists. However, it is also the product
of cultural changes and economic imperatives that have made audience participation
appear more beneficial to -- and in some cases necessary for -- the production of `good'
journalism. Moreover, in addition to inviting contributions from audiences, new kinds
of journalists have emerged whose job it is to tap into, and synthesize, the collective
wisdom of the general public by monitoring their exchanges.

Journalistic Crowdsourcing

    Within the context of journalism, the term crowdsourcing refers to a practice by
which the cultural (i.e., knowledge), social (i.e., networks), or economic (i.e., money) capital of
some public is harnessed for a specific task in the news production process.

    Here, `crowd' refers not only to the audiences of a given journalistic outlet but
to the broader public they can reach via multiple communication channels, such as
Twitter, Facebook, or even their own media products. `Sourcing,' in turn, refers to the
practice of collecting the resources (such as knowledge, material, or money) needed to
advance an organizational or news production task. Journalistic crowdsourcing can
thus involve the participation of non-journalists in identifying news, gathering news

                                                                 - 175 -
                       Crowdsourcing and Ambient Journalism

information, verifying and making sense of the gathered information, and distributing
the produced form of that information. In the case of its sister act, crowdfunding, it
can involve soliciting ad-hoc contributions to support a particular news production
task, story, or project.

    There are many reasons why a journalistic outlet might want to engage in crowd-
sourcing. For example, they may have access to more material than their reporting
team can process, as is the case with large leaks of private documents or when govern-
ments aim to hide embarrassing information by overloading journalists with materials
following a public information request. In this sense, crowdsourcing can be a free
form of labor. Alternatively, journalistic outlets may believe that having more eyes will
reduce mistakes and perhaps help their reporters identify important things that they
missed. In this sense, crowdsourcing can be a way to improve traditional journalism.
Or, journalistic outlets may find that they can build a following and increase brand loy-
alty by making audiences feel like they're part of a team. In this sense, crowdsourcing
can be a way to make journalism more sustainable.

    For participants, the reward is often non-monetary since journalistic outlets rarely
ever pay or reimburse participants for their labor. Instead, the reward is usually
symbolic, such as by receiving some form of recognition for the work. This might be
something as small as an icon or `badge' next to their username on the website. It may
also be more intrinsic, such as a feeling of satisfaction from having contributed to a
social good or addressed a social problem. Sometimes, participants simply believe
they've gained a skill or knowledge as a result of their participation.

    Crowdsourcing can go very wrong, however. For example, shortly after the Boston
Marathon bombing, online crowds on Reddit pored through pictures of the event
to identify the perpetrators. They eventually zeroed in on two men and published
photos of them that supposedly offered proof that they were the bombers. The New
York Post famously took one of those pictures, enlarged it to cover its entire front page,
and suggested that those two men were responsible for the bombing. It soon became
evident that those men were not the bombers. However, by that point, their names
had become public, their reputation had been tarnished, and they began receiving
online and offline abuse. That abuse did not go away even after the actual perpetrators
of the bombing were charged and convicted.

Kinds of Participation

    The majority of crowdsourcing efforts to date have sought to incorporate audi-
ences into the formative stages of news production, such as when stories are being

                                                                 - 176 -
                       Crowdsourcing and Ambient Journalism

identified, basic information is collected, and collected information is verified. Some-
times, journalists will solicit audience help for disseminating stories, in order to increase
its reach. However, audiences rarely ever have a chance to participate in the editing
stages -- though it is theoretically possible for them to do so.

    Scholars have identified five kinds of crowdsourcing activities that are designed
to help non-journalists share their individual knowledge to create a form of collective
knowledge. The first kind is voting, wherein the crowd helps prioritize the stories that
reporters should tackle or flags phenomena of interest. The second is witnessing, or
the sharing of first-person accounts of what happened during a breaking event. The
third is sharing personal experiences, or the conveyance of experiential knowledge to
reporters. The fourth is offering specialized expertise, wherein members of the crowd
are able to contribute expert knowledge drawn from their professional experience or
hobby. The fifth is completing a task, where the support comes by way of volunteering
time to engage in semi-structured (and sometimes menial) efforts, such as sorting
documents, cleaning datasets, or flagging information that may be of journalistic
interest.

    One of the first major examples of news organizations engaging in large-scale
crowdsourcing occurred when The Guardian, a newspaper based in the United King-
dom, published 700,000 pages of information related to an information request about
the expenses paid by members of the British Parliament. They asked members of the
public to read through those pages and flag information of interest, such as overly
expensive dinners or the use of government funds to pay for seemingly personal
expenses (e.g., a mortgage). The Guardian created a website that would randomly assign
a document in their trove to a visitor. That visitor could then flag particular pages
from the document and note why they thought it was interesting. Each document
would be reviewed by multiple people, and the system would average out the scores
to surface the most flagged documents and pages to the professional journalists. The
Guardian got more than 20,000 people to look through the expenses, and they were
able to cover 170,000 pages within the first four days alone. Participants received no
reward beyond feeling like they were part of something bigger. If they were particu-
larly involved, they also received some symbolic resources by having their username
appear on a leader board appearing on The Guardian's website. (The Guardian thus
gamified the experience to increase participation.)

Ambient Journalism

    The ability, and willingness, of crowds to participate in journalism has also helped
spawn new kinds of journalism. An example of this is ambient journalism, or journalism

                                                                 - 177 -
                       Crowdsourcing and Ambient Journalism

that is produced, distributed, and received continuously via new communications technol-
ogy, such as social media and microblogging, and within which the journalist serves as the
clearinghouse for crowdsourced information.

    Ambient journalism is different from traditional forms of journalism because it is
both more fragmented in nature and it requires audience participation. It is fragmented
in that news is typically -- though not necessarily -- presented in small bites, as with
tweets. It requires audience participation because ambient journalism focuses on
gathering news information from the streams of collective intelligence made available
through social media platforms. The journalist's primary functions within this form
of journalism are to actively monitor networked media (e.g., Twitter) for newsworthy
information, triangulate and verify that information with the help of other actors
using those media (e.g., other Twitter users), and serve as an authoritative source of
information within that platform. It is thus a particular approach to crowdsourcing
journalism.

    To illustrate the value of ambient journalism, consider the case of Andy Carvin's
coverage of the revolutions in Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt in 2011. Few Western
journalistic outlets had people on the ground in those countries during the initial stages
of their revolutions. Moreover, it quickly became difficult to report from those places
as governments cracked down on reporters and restricted outside communication.
Some of the foreign correspondents who were able to report on-site also did not fully
understand the many facets underlying the anti-government movements.

    Andy Carvin, who was then a digital media strategist at National Public Radio -- so
not even a foreign correspondent himself -- quickly noticed that there were a lot of
people in those countries who were tweeting about their experiences and capturing
video of what was going on. Instead of hoping that NPR could dispatch journalists to
those countries (and hoping that those journalists could find their way to the right
places at the right times to capture breaking news), Carvin opted to tap into the
collective intelligence of the citizens of those places.

    Carvin recognized that the majority of the people tweeting information about
those revolutions were either anti-government activists or pro-government activists.
Put another way, the would-be sources had a stake in the issue and evident biases.
However, what Carvin realized is that there were so many people in the network that
he could work with them to triangulate the information he was seeing. If he saw video
about government forces attacking protesters in a particular city block, he could ask
others to share videos from different angles or even ask people to visit that block
and capture additional video of the aftermath. If he did not understand what was
being said by a source -- or whether it was coded speech -- he could ask the Libyans,

                                                                 - 178 -
                       Crowdsourcing and Ambient Journalism

Tunisians, and Egyptians on the network to translate or contextualize that speech. As
sources demonstrated their reliability, Carvin would return to them.

    Carvin's work earned him a huge online following during those revolutions. He
was seen as a reliable and trustworthy clearinghouse for information during a tumul-
tuous and confusing event. Amid a constant stream of information, audiences could
have confidence that the material he was putting out there was either verified or
reliable, or clearly qualified as unvetted information. Moreover, journalists working
for other outlets also kept a close eye on Carvin's Twitter feed, following his lead as
he helped break information.

    Carvin later left NPR and started his own journalistic outlet that existed primarily
on social media. Similar efforts have followed. Some of these are comprised of larger
teams covering international affairs, such as Bellingcat. Others are led by individuals
who cover smaller communities and local issues. As such, ambient journalism and
crowdsourced journalism have become distinct forms of journalism that help unite
contributions by journalists and their publics.

         Misinformation and
            Disinformation

    In 2017, the Collins Dictionary selected "fake news" as its word of the year. This
was a nod to the popularization of the term in the United States during that time,
and to broader concerns that the U.S. was entering a "post-truth" or "post-fact" era
where inaccurate information was overloading the system, disrupting everything from
journalism to business to politics.

    However, the term "fake news" is highly problematic. First, its common use is highly im-
precise: It covers a spectrum from simple and accidental mistakes to negligent behavior
to planned and strategic manipulation. Second, the term carries a particular cultural
meaning that was intentionally crafted to discredit journalistic outlets -- regardless of
how broadly (and imprecisely) the term is applied.

    Scholars and linguists alike have thus cautioned against using the term "fake news,"
and to instead draw upon more-specific terms to cover the associated issues. Chief
among these are "misinformation" and "disinformation," which similarly comment on
the (in)accuracy of information while being cognizant of the intent (or underlying
motivations) of the communicator. While intent can be difficult to ascertain, the
distinction is nevertheless useful in separating sloppy and accidental work from bad-
faith efforts designed to confuse audiences, all the while carrying less of the cultural
baggage connected to the term "fake news."

Misinformation

    Misinformation refers to information whose inaccuracy is unintentional. As media
scholar Caroline Jack notes, journalists (and people in general) often make mistakes
in the course of reporting new information. This may result from the journalist's lack

                                                                 - 181 -
                           Misinformation and Disinformation

of understanding of a topic to their misinterpretation of a source's claim (or failure to
independently verify it) to their inability to disentangle conflicting information.

    In all of these cases, the journalist may have made a simple error or been naive.
At worst, they were negligent in not double-checking some information they opted
to publish. However, the key for categorizing something as misinformation is that the
journalist did not intend to deceive but simply made an error. Ideally, and under most
journalistic codes of ethics, such errors will be quickly and clearly corrected.

    An illustrative example of this was when the Chicago Daily Tribune famously
misreported in an early edition that Governor Thomas Dewey had beat incumbent
President Harry Truman in the 1948 U.S. presidential election. The deadline for the
early edition forced the newspaper to be printed before many states had reported
results from their polling places. The Tribune therefore relied on the conventional
wisdom of the day -- many polls indicated Dewey would win by a wide margin -- and
the assessment of one of its veteran political analysts, and boldly proclaimed Dewey's
victory. When the Tribune realized that the race was far closer than anticipated, it
changed the headline of the late evening edition to reflect the closeness of the race.
(By that point, however, more than 150,000 copies of the paper had already been
printed with the erroneous headline.) Truman eventually won with a narrow margin,
leading to much embarrassment for the Tribune.

    More recently, major journalistic outlets have erroneously misidentified the per-
petrators of attacks. For example, the New York Post famously featured, on a large
cover photo and story, two individuals that were said to be the duo behind the Boston
Marathon bombing in 2013. The assertion, which came out of a crowdsourced
investigation led by online sleuths on Reddit, turned out to be false. The Post also
played a role in unintentionally promoting false rumors by retweeting claims that the
New York Stock Exchange trading floor had been flooded during Hurricane Sandy
in 2012. While these examples should not be simply excused as inconsequential
mistakes -- they can and do cause real-world harm to both the subjects of a story and
to audiences -- it is crucial to distinguish that they are not malicious errors designed
to sow confusion. They were instances of sloppy journalism.

    As these examples also show, misinformation is most often produced during
periods of unfolding crisis or fast-moving developments. Journalistic outlets have
a duty to keep people informed, especially when their safety or well-being may be
placed at risk (e.g., as news about a bombing begins to break). They thus face pressure
to report and publish quickly, which increases the likelihood of making errors. This is
doubly true when they compete for audience attention during those news-breaking
stages, and are thus incentivized to "scoop" competing outlets by being the first to

                                                                 - 182 -

report a story.

Disinformation

    Disinformation refers to information that is deliberately false or misleading. In these
cases, the would-be journalist (and, more often, communicators operating outside
of the journalism industry) are not simply making errors in the heat of the moment.
Instead, they are seeking to sow confusion or promote a particular narrative that they
know to be untrue (or, at best, only partly true).

    For example, in the aforementioned case of news organizations misinforming
the public about the New York Stock Exchange trading floor being flooded, the false
information was deliberately seeded by individuals doing it "for the lulz." Put another
way, those individuals had the intent to sow confusion -- the confusion was their
source of amusement -- and they thus sought to disinform others by leveraging the
naivete of some journalists (who were then retweeted by other journalists who trusted
them, creating a cascade).

    There are far more malicious examples of disinformation, however. For exam-
ple, in September 2014, a number of sock puppet (fake) Twitter accounts began
systematically spreading false reports about an explosion and toxic fume hazard at
a chemical manufacturing plant in Louisiana. The coordinated effort also included
stories appearing in spoofed (fake) versions of local news websites, fabricated YouTube
videos, and even text messages that were sent to some local residents. No explosions
had actually taken place, though. Researchers later traced those efforts to a state actor:
a Russia-backed organization called the Internet Research Agency. Many intelligence
services have identified the Internet Research Agency as being behind a number of
efforts to destabilize U.S. politics by flooding social media with disinformation.

    Disinformation is not limited to complete fabrications that lack any factual basis,
though. It also includes the notion of enrichment, wherein information is selectively
(and, again, intentionally) added or omitted in order to alter the meaning of a message.
This may include intentionally decontextualizing information -- which is a separate
matter from failing to offer full context due to space constraints -- as well as inten-
tionally casting information in a misleading (or unfair) light. Enrichment is more
commonly found in disinformation produced by pseudo-journalistic outlets (espe-
cially highly partisan ones) than complete fabrications because it is easier for those
would-be journalists to deny intent.

                                                                 - 183 -

Discrediting Journalism

    The term "fake news" is thus designed to lump together both intentional and
unintentional errors in order to discredit the institution of journalism. Put another
way, it is designed to blur lines in order to more easily ascribe malicious intent to jour-
nalists -- and especially those who publish information that is critical of the accuser.

    While the term may seem new to popular communication (or at least newly
rediscovered in it), the denouncing of media and journalism through derogatory
language is part of a long-standing strategy observed both within and beyond the
United States. Allegations that the press are liars have been used as a political device
by numerous leaders (especially in autocratic regimes) to silence oppositional and
independent voices. Indeed, the very inception of the press was marked by allegations
from political and religious leaders that `the public' should not be allowed to publish
unfiltered information and opinion, and that `the public' would only be harmed by
lower barriers to publication. Newspapers in particular were often charged as being
full of lies, bias, and distortion -- or, more simply, as being vehicles for "fake news."

    However, the resurgence of the term is of particular concern to free press advocates
who have observed important social consequences. Legally, the popularization of
the term is credited with facilitating the passing of so-called "fake news" laws that
give autocratic and pseudo-democratic states more power in regulating news media.
Politically, the term is credited with increasing polarization and the fragmentation of
audiences, which may now gather in echo chambers to avoid what it considers "fake
news." Socially, it has resulted in more acts of violence against journalists by regular
citizens. This last change has been so pronounced even in the United States that
global organizations like Reporters Without Borders have begun tracking domestic
attacks against U.S. journalists.

    Additionally, the term "fake news" is today applied in a wide array of contexts -- many
of which do not involve journalism at all. For example, it is not uncommon to see the
term used to marginalize dissenting opinions, as with a political candidate who might
charge their opponent with promoting "fake news" when they simply assert that their
health care policy is better. It is even sometimes used in day-to-day disagreements
between friends, like when one asserts that their preferred team is better. ("That's fake
news!") Scholars have argued that the term has been deliberately seeded in such a
wide array of contexts in order to equate any form of inconvenient information with
journalism and, in turn, make it easier to discredit journalism via the rhetorical device
of "fake news."

                                                                 - 184 -
                           Misinformation and Disinformation

Seeding Mass Confusion

    The strong resurgence of the term in recent years has been led largely (but not
exclusively) by conservative commentators. It has been used most vociferously (and
effectively) by former U.S. President Donald Trump who, in 2018, awarded what he
called the "fake news award" to traditional U.S. media outlets.

    Trump's repeated claims that major news outlets lied about numerous aspects
of his political and personal lives even as he made a range of demonstrably false
claims at an unprecedented rate (for a high-ranking elected leader) has been linked
to the notion of gaslighting. As media scholar Caroline Jack argues, this rhetorical
and psychological strategy relies on the intentional orchestration of deceptions and
biased narrations to not only confuse individuals but further distort audiences' trust
in their own perceptions and memories. The term "gaslighting" is also not new -- it has
been traced to a 1938 theatrical play -- but it is useful in conceptualizing attempts by
political actors to use misdirection, denial, and disinformation to help sow confusion
and undermine trust in institutions.

    More broadly, the use of systematic campaigns to confuse the public and under-
mine trust in institutions has occurred multiple times throughout history and across
different international contexts. (These are different from propaganda, which is a
more common effort to strategically use information to increase trust in institutions or
build support for (or against) a cause.) For example, the former Soviet Union used
the term dezinformatsiya to conceptualize coordinated state efforts to disseminate
false or misleading information to journalistic media (among other forms of media)
in targeted countries or regions. This was just one of their activnye meropriyatiya,
or `active measures,' employed by the state to strategically undermine and disrupt
governance by opposing nation-states while strengthening the positions of allies.
These measures included spreading disinformation through multiple channels (e.g.,
through fake grassroots campaigns, a practice also known as astroturfing) to widen
existing domestic rifts, stoke existing tensions, and complicate international relations.

    More recently, scholars have used the term xuanchuan (a nod to an existing Chinese
term) to describe the use of coordinated posts on social media to flood conversational
spaces with a mix of positive messages, negative messages, and attempts to change
the subject as part of a broader misdirection strategy. Under this approach, the
goal is not to simply promote false information but rather to overwhelm the system
with information, making it harder for individuals to come across certain kinds of
information. For example, analysts have pointed to China's so-called "50 Cent Army"
(or "50 Cent Party") -- groups of online commentators thought to number in the
millions who are regularly employed by Chinese authorities -- as an example of the

                                                                 - 185 -
                           Misinformation and Disinformation

mobilization of large groups to systematically promote echo chambers, hijack hashtags,
and steer public discourse away from sensitive topics.

    It is important to note that although they can be useful in capturing specific
approaches to seeding mass confusion, terms like `dezinformatsiya' and `xuanchuan'
can also promote negative stereotypes and limit conversation. For example, there
are also related non-state efforts to disrupt specific social campaigns, as when K-Pop
fans banded together to hijack hashtags used to coordinate white supremacist activity.
These terms should thus be used with care due to the cultural associations they elicit.
Easier and cheaper access to powerful computers and high-speed internet connections
have made it easier for individuals and small teams around the world to automate the
production and amplification of disinformation in digital environments.

    The resurgence of the term "fake news" and high-profile, coordinated disinforma-
tion campaigns have helped promote a rise in civic and governmental attempts to
counter online misinformation and disinformation. In particular, several fact-checking
organizations have emerged in recent years. These organizations aim to authenticate
statements made by institutional sources (e.g., elected leaders), debunk social media
hoaxes, and assess the legitimacy of particular information sources. However, several
scholars have found that such interventions have made little headway in combating
large-scale disinformation campaigns or restoring trust in journalistic institutions.
Thus, journalistic outlets are still seeking effective solutions to countering disinforma-
tion, all the while struggling to adapt to a fast-paced environment that makes it easier
for them to produce misinformation themselves.

    Key Takeaways

    » "Fake news" is a highly problematic term that was crafted with the inten-

        tion of discrediting journalism and blurring the lines between professional
        news products and general information. Its popularization has been cred-
        ited with reducing trust in journalism and increasing violence against
        journalists.

    » The terms "misinformation" and "disinformation" help to capture the range

        of inaccurate information in an accessible way. Misinformation refers to
        information whose inaccuracy is unintentional (e.g., getting some infor-
        mation wrong during a breaking news event). Disinformation refers to
        information that is deliberately false or misleading (e.g., an individual fabri-

                                                                 - 186 -

Legal Landscape for Journalists

    The freedoms of speech and of the press are recognized as fundamental human
rights by a number of national, regional, and international legal instruments. In a
nation like the United States, it is most aptly captured by the First Amendment, which
states that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press." In regions like Europe and Africa, it is captured by pacts like the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the African Charter on Human and
Peoples' Rights (ACHPR), respectively. Internationally, such rights are protected by
pacts like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

    However, while such documents provide legal instruments for protecting journal-
ists, they are often enforced in selective ways. Moreover, national laws often supersede
broader regional and international agreements in practice, and such laws are shaped
by different traditions, norms, and histories, and are designed to deal with competing
interests in different ways. Put simply, the legal constraints journalists operate within
can vary immensely depending on where the journalist is based.

Legal Frameworks and Their Application

    The freedoms of speech and press are recognized by a variety of legal instruments,
such as treaties, conventions, constitutions, statutes, regulations, and judicial precedent.
However, the extent of those freedoms, and the ways in which those freedoms are
protected, vary immensely depending on where a journalist is operating.

    For example, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights
states that "every individual shall have the right to receive information" and "to express
and disseminate his opinions within the law." Yet, restrictions on expressive activities
in African countries are common. When Egypt signed on to the ACHPR in 1984,

                                                                 - 191 -
                            Legal Landscape for Journalists

it incorporated some important press freedoms into its legal framework. However,
it signed the Charter with the reservation that "the right to receive information"
would be confined "to such information as could be obtained within the limits of
the Egyptian laws and regulations." In recent years, Egypt has become one of the
top jailers of journalists in the world and has targeted independent and critical news
outlets for closure, blocked citizens from accessing a number of news websites, and
nationalized a number of large news organizations. Egypt has both passed new, and
more restrictive, media laws and violated existing, less restrictive, laws with impunity.
Egypt is not alone in this regard. A number of African nations, such as Algeria, Somalia,
and Sudan have long histories of censorship and control of speech, even when the
targeted activities were protected under its laws.

    Africa is hardly alone in this regard, though. In the Americas, Article 13 of the
American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR) protects the "freedom to seek,
receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds." Yet, there is a considerable
amount of violence against journalists, criminalization of expression that insults
public officials, and the targeting of journalists who reveal sensitive information about
government officials and policies. Among the worst offenders in the Americas are
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Similarly, signatories to the Arab Charter on Human
Rights include Lebanon, whose national laws forbid the publication of news contrary
to "national ethics" or "religious feelings," and Libya, where the targeting of journalists
has resulted in many of them being exiled.

    In Asia, there are presently no regional guarantees for speech and press, because
there is no regional human rights instrument akin to the aforementioned ones. How-
ever, international agreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have
favorably shaped media laws in many Asian countries, including South Korea and
Japan. Nevertheless, those countries still have national security laws that can signifi-
cantly restrict speech. For example, in South Korea, the national security laws have
been used to limit speech that promotes communism. Moreover, in countries like
China, Pakistan, and the Philippines, journalists (and citizens) are routinely targeted
by the state through legal and extra-legal means because of what they publish.

International Journalists and Legal Regimes

    Notably, journalists working abroad often have to operate under the most restric-
tive conditions of multiple legal regimes. First, they are governed by the country
where they are operating. For example, a Pakistani journalist working in Iran for a
British outlet could be detained by Iranian authorities for violating one of its many
national security laws in the process of reporting a story. That same journalist, and the

                                                                 - 192 -
                            Legal Landscape for Journalists

outlet they work for, could also be sued in the United Kingdom under that country's
libel laws. And, in their home country of Pakistan, they could be targeted under its
anti-blasphemy laws, which could result in their assets (and perhaps even their family
members' assets) being seized. This helps make international reporting a potentially
legally risky endeavor.

    A helpful resource for assessing the legal risks of reporting from a country is
the Reporters Without Borders' annual World Press Freedom Index. The Index
measures more than just legal risk -- it also takes into account things like violence
against journalists and government transparency -- but it proves insightful. Its 2021
Index ranked Norway, Finland, and Sweden as the nations with the best conditions
for practicing journalism. In contrast, Turkmenistan, North Korea, and Eritrea had
the worst conditions. As a point of comparison, the United States ranked 44th out of
the 180 countries evaluated by Reporters Without Borders.

Trends in Legal Frameworks

    Following a period of general liberalism in press freedoms (i.e., offering stronger
protections for journalists and their outlets) at the conclusion of World War II, and then
again following the Cold War, there has been a general trend toward more restrictive media
laws and more exemptions to existing press freedoms in recent years. This phenomenon
appears to cut across all continents, though it has not impacted all countries.

    At the heart of this shift has been more stringent national security laws that
have criminalized, or increased the penalties for, a range of activities that overlap
with journalism. These include activities like revealing information about classified
government programs, protecting anonymous sources, and, in some cases, even visiting
and interviewing individuals classified as terrorists or enemy combatants.

    For example, in 2020, Hong Kong became subjected to a new national security
law by the Chinese Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The
new law criminalized the leaking of "state secrets," which is a vague term that had
been unevenly applied in China to jail journalists. Critics of the law alleged that it
could not only be used to go after journalists who engage in critical reporting but
that it also promoted self-censorship within Hong Kong. Sure enough, by the end of
2021, more than 100 individuals, including many journalists, were arrested under
the law or had their assets seized, and many others flew into exile. This led Reporters
Without Borders to allege that press freedom was in a "free fall," with several (and
predominantly pro-democracy) journalistic outlets being shut down in the span of a
year.

                                                                 - 193 -
                            Legal Landscape for Journalists

    In similar vein, Australia passed 82 different national security laws between 2001
and 2019. Those laws have been used to justify government raids of both the homes
of individual journalists and the newsrooms of major journalistic outlets. Australian
journalists have been threatened by senior government officials with prosecution
simply for receiving top-secret government documents. The country also passed a
highly restrictive defamation law in 2018 that has made it riskier to report on public
figures.

    More recently, multiple governments have used the so-called "fake news" phe-
nomenon to criminalize certain speech and publication. For example, Singapore's Pro-
tection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act requires companies -- including
journalistic outlets -- to issue corrections or remove content that the government
deems false, or face fines in excess of $700,000. Individuals who do not comply can
face fines of up to $60,000 or prison for up to 10 years. A central issue with such laws
is that the `falsity' of information can be sometimes be subjective, and the arbiters of
truth (i.e., the appointed officials who evaluate the information) are hardly objective
themselves. Nevertheless, similar laws have been enacted from Egypt to Nicaragua
to Thailand to Zimbabwe (among other places) and have been repeatedly enforced
selectively against journalists who speak out against political and business leaders.

    Finally, the digitization of journalism has also presented important challenges to
existing laws that protect journalists. A 2017 UNESCO report found that interna-
tional media laws were failing keeping up with technology in defining who qualified
for special legal protections for journalists. This resulted in journalists working for
newer, digital organizations not receiving the protections afforded to their counter-
parts in traditional media. It similarly resulted in erosions to protections for journalistic
sources depending on who interviewed them and how they were interviewed. Thus,
not only are media laws in parts of the world becoming more restrictive and being
applied unevenly, the scope of legal protections is also being limited by questions
about who is a journalist in the modern media environment.

    Key Takeaways

    » There are national, regional, and international legal instruments that are

        designed to protect journalists and the broader freedom of expression.
        However, in many countries around the world, those protections are only
        applied selectively.

    Surveillance of Journalists

    Journalists (and their sources) have become increasingly vulnerable to digital
attacks from state and non-state actors that can compromise their security, threaten
source confidentiality, and ultimately undermine journalistic activities. These threats
range from digital surveillance and the tracking of their activities and interactions to
the hacking and theft of their data to the disruption of journalistic activities through
denial of service attacks and account hijacking. These attacks have become especially
problematic as researchers have found many journalists to lack even basic knowledge
about how to integrate defensive measures like using encryption and identifying
`spear phishing' digital attacks.

Surveillance and Journalism

    In many parts of the world, unearthing wrongdoing and challenging powerful
individuals within government and society at large can carry great risk. For example,
as a consequence of his efforts to shed light on secret U.S. government activities,
whistleblower Edward Snowden (a contractor who worked with the National Security
Agency) was forced into exile in Russia. The journalists Snowden worked with were
subjected not only to legal threats of their own by the U.S. government but also to
smear campaigns by a range of political actors as well as death threats from people
around the country. This example is indicative of broader trends around the world
where, in many countries, protections for typical journalistic activities are being eroded
and, in some cases, critical journalistic activities are being criminalized.

    Within this context, it is important to recognize that there has been a parallel
trend across the world in recent years to strengthen the surveillance powers of gov-
ernment agencies. (Moreover, even private companies now have access to a wealth
of granular information about individuals.) Those efforts are not always designed to

                                                                 - 197 -
                                Surveillance of Journalists

target journalists but nevertheless affect them and their work. Specifically, increased
surveillance has made it not only harder but riskier to do journalism around the world.

    For example, the United Kingdom's Investigative Powers Act (which is also some-
times called the "Snoopers' Charter") came into effect in November 2016 and granted
comprehensive and far-reaching digital surveillance powers to police and intelligence
services. While the IPA offers some safeguards for sensitive professions, including
journalists, those protections are widely regarded as being inadequate for journalists
and would-be whistleblowers. The IPA legally forces communication service providers
to assist with targeted interception of data and makes it illegal for those providers to
reveal when a user is the subject of an investigation.

    The U.K. is hardly alone in this regard. In fact, at the center of Snowden's revela-
tions was a coordinated global mass surveillance effort led by the National Security
Agency in the United States, GCHQ in the United Kingdom, and allied intelligence
services in the Five Eyes Group. Those surveillance efforts indiscriminately targeted
all citizens' communications instead of just those belonging to citizens suspected of
wrongdoing. They also consequently ensnared journalists reporting on a range of
topics, including those that showed governments and social elites in a negative light.

    Fears about such technologies being turned on journalists are not unjustified,
either. For example, in 2006, New York Times reporter James Risen wrote a book about
U.S. efforts to combat terrorism that included details of a secret failed plot to disrupt
Iran's nuclear weapons program. Alarmed by the revelations, federal prosecutors
sought to identify the source of the leak. They eventually obtained a grand jury
indictment of a former Central Intelligence Agency employee based records of phone
calls and emails between Risen and that employee. Risen was subpoenaed to testify at
the employee's trial -- the employee was charged with disclosing classified information
illegally -- but ended up striking a deal to avoid revealing his source. Nevertheless, the
government prosecutors were able to obtain a conviction primarily through the use
of the communication records obtained from service providers who, under federal
law, were not allowed to tell Risen or the employee that their records had been seized.
Consequently, neither Risen nor the employee could challenge the data collection
used to implicate them (even if they had legal standing to do so, which American
courts have said they did not due to the lack of information).

    The broad consequence of these efforts is that engaging in sensitive journalistic
activities has become even riskier in recent years. Not only have many governments
increased the number of analysts dedicated to digital surveillance under national se-
curity laws, who can be turned to focus on specific journalists, but they have deployed
large-scale, indiscriminate nets that can turn journalists into persons of interest based

                                                                 - 198 -
                                Surveillance of Journalists

on their online activities. This becomes especially problematic as more journalistic ac-
tivities take place online, from basic research for news stories to e-mails and messages
scheduling interviews.

    Moreover, it has also had a chilling effect on sources' -- and especially whistle-
blowers' -- willingness to talk to journalists since they are more likely to fear that their
communications (and activities) might be monitored. This is especially true under
more repressive regimes around the world. Indeed, several repressive regimes and
wealthy individuals have been shown to be clients of NSO Group, a highly secretive
Israeli technology company that produces exploit-based spyware that can be surrep-
titiously installed on targets' phones. Journalists in countries spanning the political
spectrum (e.g., Bahrain, England, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Yemen)
have all been found to have been targeted by the technology -- even though it is legally
a restricted export that supposedly must be approved by the Israeli government.

Protections Against Surveillance

    In order to protect themselves against surveillance, journalists around the world
have increasingly turned to tools designed to encrypt communications and to obscure
online activity. However, researchers have found that both journalists and their
sources tend to have a very limited understanding of how those technologies work
and generally find them hard to use in day-to-day activities. This, in turn, has limited
their uptake within journalism, even as their non-use puts journalists and their sources
at risk.

    The lack of uptake is particularly problematic because widespread use of encryp-
tion is widely regarded as being important to truly circumvent surveillance. That
is, increasing the amount and complexity of encryption and anti-surveillance tools
makes mass surveillance more expensive and difficult, thereby offering a form of herd
protection. Perhaps more importantly, it helps protect those who most need protec-
tions since the use of anti-surveillance technology can attract unwanted attention to
the very activities it is designed to protect. Put another way, in the absence of mass
encryption, a journalist may inadvertently draw government attention to themselves
and their sources through the very effort of circumventing surveillance.

    Technologies like the mobile messenger apps Signal and Telegram (and, to a lesser
extent, WhatsApp) have begun to normalize secure communication by providing
user-friendly end-to-end encryption with strong privacy controls. Similarly, the
popularization of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and TOR (The Onion Router) has
made it easier for journalists and sources to anonymize their online activities. Many
journalistic outlets around the world -- from BuzzFeed in the U.S. to The Guardian in the

                                                                 - 199 -

U.K. to NRK in Japan -- now use technologies like SecureDrop to help whistleblowers
easily submit information securely and anonymously over encrypted communications.
Taken together, these technologies have helped journalists around the world regain
some measure of security and the trust of their sources. Indeed, many investigative
journalists now publicly link to secure communication channels via insecure platforms,
as with a journalist posting their Signal number on their Twitter profile.

    However, those technologies can also be repurposed by bad actors. For example,
the Telegram messaging app was purportedly used by the terrorist group ISIS as a
group messaging tool to spread propaganda, and it may have been used by terrorists
to plan the 2015 Paris attack. Consequently, many countries, including China, India,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Sudan have used national security justifications to impose
severe restrictions on the use of encryption. Those restrictions include banning
encryption outright or requiring a license for its use. Even in the United States,
encryption is classified as a `dual use technology' that can ostensibly be used as a
weapon, and its export is therefore heavily regulated.

    In short, journalists around the world must now contend with a form of mass
surveillance that was not previously possible. While they are becoming more security-
minded and have access to technologies that make surveillance harder, most journalists
are still only scratching the surface of what is needed to offer a herd form of protection.
Moreover, as the tools have evolved, so have the government responses to them,
creating a race for protecting journalists.

  Journalism, War, and Conflict

    The reporting of war and conflict displays some of the best and worst aspects
of journalism in their most acute forms. The courageousness of journalists to enter
conflict zones and their commitment to telling the truth about various forms of human
distress shows journalism at its best. However, the stresses it places on journalists'
mental and physical well-being, as well as their potential instrumentalization by
powerful actors (e.g., army commanders), shows journalism at its worst.

    Given the dramatic possibilities, it is unsurprising that media depictions of such
reporting are often romanticized in movies that show the swashbuckling journalist
rushing to the front line of history (even as that hardened journalist is frequently
subjected to intense criticisms back home). The reality of the reporting of war and
conflict is rarely so simple or extreme, though. Nevertheless, such reporting matters a
great deal given the impact it has both on public understanding of affairs involving
literal life and death as well as on the health of the journalists who engage in such
reporting.

War, Conflict, and Independent Journalism

    The emergence of war reporting dates back centuries, but historical accounts
of its modern form typically begin with William Howard Russell's coverage of the
British expeditionary forces during the Crimean War in 1853. Less than a decade
later, war correspondents covering the U.S. Civil War also helped establish important
precedents for the way war correspondence is practiced and the forms such stories
typically take. In both of these instances, journalism served both as a mobilizing force
to drum up patriotic support for a war effort and as a platform for challenging ideas
about such efforts and about war itself. This dual role continues to be taken up in war
reporting today.

                                                                 - 203 -
                              Journalism, War, and Conflict

    Historically, reporters covering war were actively involved in the war effort itself,
sometimes going to far as to serve as military assets themselves. For example, during
World War II, journalists from many countries would wear military uniform, follow
military law, and occasionally carry weapons themselves so that they could be called
upon to fight on behalf of an army if needed. Similarly, there is some evidence that,
during the Cold War, journalists covering conflict in the Americas, Africa, and Asia
were actively recruited as spies.

    However, journalists have also tried to maximize their independence under their
constraints. For example, during the Vietnam War, journalists often had access to
military transports and could sometimes follow soldiers on missions, even as they had
considerable independence, such as the ability to detach from their military escorts
to get a different view of the proceedings. This independence allowed reporters to go
where they wanted and speak with whomever they pleased (though at great personal
risk). That, in turn, resulted in considerable negative coverage of the Vietnam War,
which had a measurable impact on public support for the war effort back in the United
States. Military commanders even gave a name to this phenomenon: the `Vietnam
syndrome,' where they argued the U.S. public's aversion to war was a consequence of
journalistic depictions of its bloodshed and horrors.

    Today, journalists covering war and conflict often find themselves stuck in between
the desire to be independent and structural efforts to control them within conflict
zones. In particular, it is now more common for journalists to serve as `embeds,' or
reporters who, with the permission of military officials, are assigned into a selected
military unit for a specified period of time to cover the course of a military operation.
These embedding programs offer journalists the opportunity to gain a firsthand,
eyewitness perspective from a relatively safe vantage point. However, such programs
are not borne from the kindness of a military. The access to the war zone often comes
at the expense of journalistic independence, and includes restrictions on where the
journalist can go, who they can speak with, and, to a certain extent, what they can
write about. Moreover, the expectation of such programs is that by being socialized
into a military unit, journalists would be more likely to adopt perspectives that favored
the military -- or at least engage in greater self-censorship so as to not alienate the
individuals they were embedded with (or even risk getting kicked out of the unit).

    In contrast to the `embeds' are the so-called `unilaterals,' or reporters who do not
embed with the military. These journalists do not benefit from military protection or
assistance but have far more journalistic independence. However, their independence
is limited by a different set of factors, the chief one being that entering conflict areas
without support can be a deadly proposition.

                                                                 - 204 -
                              Journalism, War, and Conflict

    A good example of war journalism in recent times was the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
in 2003. During that war, journalists in the field claimed professional independence
but were subjected to considerable micro-management by Coalition forces. Such
management came through mechanisms like codes of conduct, strict controls over
the movements of journalists, and the use of reporting pools (where a single reporter
would be escorted to an area or event, and their notes would be shared with a group
of other reporters). Such efforts to `manage the message' have been a direct result of
the increased use of public relations strategies by military forces following the failures
of the Vietnam War.

Mediating War and Conflict

    It can be immensely difficult for journalists from a country at war to step outside
(much less challenge) the conduct or the rightness of a war. Such efforts can quickly
lead to accusations of treasonous and seditious behavior on the part of the journalist,
especially at the onset of conflict.

    The calculus changes when there are powerful domestic voices raised against it by
political leaders and societal elites, though. Accounts of war are typically dominated
by the voices of the powerful and the actions of militaries, and having powerful voices
speak both for and against war allows journalists to cover `the controversy' from a
more neutral place. Such controversy also gives journalists greater leeway to capture
the voices of ordinary soldiers and others caught up in conflict, which often don't
make it into much of the coverage of war and conflict.

    Scholars have long found that it can be exceptionally difficult for correspondents
to secure accounts of conflict that deviate from official narratives, or those provided by
actors who are promoting war efforts. This does not necessarily mean that journalists
become pawns of political and military elites but it does mean that journalists often
infuse their work with those elites' preferred ideas and terminology. For example, in
the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, scholars repeatedly found that journalists
used military jargon in their news reports. This included the use of terminology
like "surgical strikes," "collateral damage," "soft targets," and so on. The use of such
terminology could easily come as a subconscious or reflexive act resulting from
their frequent socialization among military personnel, which would become further
entrenched as other reporters repeated them.

    Nevertheless, the willingness to use the military's preferred terminology resulted
in the promotion of ideological presuppositions that were favorable to the war effort.
This, in turn, helped to sanitize the reality of the conflict for news audiences. Scholars
have found that such `sanitized' news coverage can lead news audiences to perceive

                                                                 - 205 -
                              Journalism, War, and Conflict

such conflicts to be `clean wars' that are waged with `pinpoint accuracy,' and thus
reduce their likelihood to oppose such efforts. (In more recent times, we have seen
this play out in the context of drone attacks, with officials repeatedly emphasizing
their accuracy and the quality of the intel supporting drone strikes.)

    Despite these criticisms, it is important to note that frontline journalists do have
a strong ideological disposition toward "telling things as they are" and often adhere
closely to notions of objectivity. They often recognize efforts to control them and take
active measures to reduce the impact of those efforts. And, since war correspondents
often meet regularly in different conflict zones, they typically form close-knit groups
designed to offer important forms of mutual support. In short, it is important to
recognize that they often adopt thoughtful measures and take great risks to help
mediate events that are incredibly difficult to cover.

Risks of War and Conflict Journalism

    Journalists who cover war and conflict place themselves in great risk. The most
obvious risk at the front lines is death. For example, the Committee to Protect
Journalists identified 64 journalists who died covering the U.S.-led occupation of
Iraq between 2006 and 2007. Such death counts tend to underestimate the reality,
especially among freelancers and stringers, who typically receive less institutional
support and must place themselves closer to the action to have their work get picked
up by major journalistic outlets. Freelance photographers and videographers, who
produce a substantial amount of conflict journalism, are especially at risk because of
the visually oriented nature of their jobs.

    However, journalists also find themselves at the center of an "information war"
involving both state and non-state actors. For state actors, independent journalists
wandering freely and broadcasting images and accounts of a conflict presents a
strategic risk. State actors are thus willing, and increasingly so in recent decades, to
turn their advanced military technologies against journalists -- such as by tracking
them through satellite phone signals -- in order to either kill or capture those journalists.
Moreover, journalists are sometimes deliberately targeted as proxies for their home
country's military, or even to stop them from testifying in trials over war crimes or
human rights abuses.

    Journalists have also become attractive targets for non-state actors, including
kidnappers who seek publicity for their cause. The kidnapping of journalists will often
produce coverage in the journalist's home country, which often unintentionally helps
elevate the kidnappers' message. (At minimum, it sparks a debate within newsrooms
over whether to cover that story, which elevates the perception of the kidnappers'

                                                                 - 206 -
                              Journalism, War, and Conflict

newsworthiness within editorial meetings.) For example, during Syria's civil war, more
than 100 journalists were abducted between 2013 and 2017.

    Beyond the physical threats posed to journalists, covering war and conflict takes a
serious toll on journalists' mental health. For example, scholars have estimated that
more than one-quarter of war journalists experience symptoms of post-traumatic
stress disorder -- a rate that is much higher than journalists covering other genres. They
also experience higher rates of depression, substance abuse, and divorce. This should
come as no surprise given the nature of the work. Journalists covering war and conflict
are not only subjected to the worst aspects of humanity in very graphic ways but they
are routinely forced to make sense of those intense and disturbing experiences in
order to carry out their job. Moreover, many journalists covering war and conflict
quickly become disillusioned by the response (or lack thereof ) their work frequently
receives from news audiences. One need only read the memoirs of reporters who
covered the 1994 Rwandan genocide to see the toll that the perceived inability to
motivate people to take action against the genocide can take on a journalist.

    In response to these growing risks, journalistic outlets -- and, in particular, larger
Western outlets -- have developed more substantial training programs for journalists
assigned to conflict zones. This includes military-like bootcamps as well as training
programs for identifying threats, using protective gear, and soliciting emergency
assistance. Additionally, those organizations will occasionally invest in private security
for a journalist, and there are now far more counseling options for journalists when
they return home. However, those gains -- many of which followed the 2003 Iraq
War -- typically only apply to staff reporters, and even those have become more limited
in recent years due to budget cuts. Freelance journalists and stringers rarely benefit
from such programs. As such, war and conflict journalism remains an immensely
risky and complicated, but highly important, endeavor.

    Key Takeaways

    » Journalists covering war and conflict today often find themselves stuck

        in between the desire to be independent and structural efforts to control
        them within conflict zones. This includes `embed' programs that offer
        military assistance to journalists in return for certain restrictions on their
        work.

    » Coverage of war and conflict often reflects official narratives and per-

   spectives about them. Even when journalists want to deviate from those
   narratives, it can be difficult for them to do so -- and it often comes at great
   personal risk.

  Violence Against Journalists

    To be a journalist is to doggedly pursue important information intended to inform
and serve the public. Sometimes, that information might place an individual or
organization in a negative light, threaten their reputation or livelihood, or otherwise
create conflict as a result of its publication. Pursuing and exposing the truth therefore
comes with risks.

    Journalists across the world face threats and intimidation while doing their jobs.
Sometimes, this comes as general public disdain or name-calling by members of an
audience or a person implicated in a story. But, in some cases, journalists face physical,
mental, and emotional violence both online and offline in the course of reporting.
A global trend toward violence against journalists is especially acute in countries
where the freedom of the press is not well protected (e.g., Egypt and the Philippines).
However, it is growing as a problem in the United States as well.

Attacks Against the U.S. Press

    Although the United States has historically been seen as a beacon for the free
press, its ranking on press freedom indices in recent years suggests that is no longer
the case. For example, the 2021 World Press Freedom Index ranks the United States
as the 44th most free country for journalists (out of 180). This places the U.S. below
countries like Taiwan, Botswana, and Trinidad and Tobago. Furthermore, the 2021
ranking is not an aberration: the U.S. has not been ranked better than 40th since
2013.

    The World Press Freedom Index takes multiple factors into account, one of
which is violence against journalists. According to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker,
nearly 400 journalists were assaulted and more than 130 were detained during 2020
alone. This was a significant increase from even just five years earlier, and it points

                                                                 - 209 -
                               Violence Against Journalists

to changing attitudes -- and, namely, increased animosity -- toward journalists by
different segments of society.

    Some of these attacks are encouraged (if not driven) by popular figures and
media personalities who decry journalists as "enemies of the people." Indeed, former
President Donald Trump's use of such language and frequent public attacks on specific
journalists, specific outlets, and the institution of journalism have been credited with
influencing the exceptional amount of violence against journalists during his time as
president. During Trump's rallies, it was not uncommon to hear supporters yelling at
the journalists tasked with covering those political events. Similarly, photojournalists
captured striking photos of supporters wearing t-shirts with slogans like: "Rope. Tree.
Journalist. No assembly required."

    However, the violence against U.S. journalists was not strictly enacted by partisan
supporters. Scores of journalists were detained, arrested, and sometimes attacked
by police officers and security services when covering protests in the wake of the
murder of George Floyd in May 2020. In one exceptional case, a foam bullet left one
photojournalist blind in the left eye. More frequently, journalists were shoved to the
ground and prevented from doing their jobs despite being clearly credentialed. (In
Minneapolis, police officers arrested a credentialed CNN reporter live on air while he
was reporting.)

    What was perhaps most striking to media observers about these incidents is that
the journalists' behaviors (e.g., encroaching upon the locus of action while respecting
authorities' commands) were not too different from times past. What seemed to have
changed was the response they faced from the authorities -- and the fact that such
attacks were not publicly elected by some social and political elites, or even large
segments of U.S. society.

    While only some of those assaults were captured on video (often by protesters
engaging in acts of journalism), their frequency and violence resulted in government
officials in a number of European countries calling on American officials to better
protect journalists and respect the freedom of the press. Put another way, the U.S.
was no longer being seen as a beacon of press freedoms; it was seen as a place where
journalists needed support in order to carry out their duties. These sentiments were
echoed in editorials by multiple journalistic outlets, as well as watchdog organizations
(e.g., Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists).

                                                                 - 210 -
                               Violence Against Journalists

Online and Offline Violence

    Research shows that violence against journalists is correlated with rhetorical
attacks against journalists in elite discourse. Put another way, as rhetorical attacks
against journalists have risen, so have different forms of violence against them. This is
of particular concern as partisan rhetorical attacks against journalists have become
more frequent and sustained in recent decades. This is not just a recent phenomenon,
though. Right-wing radio has consistently assailed "the mainstream media" since at
least the 1970s.

    However, mainstream politicians, especially among the Republican party, have
become increasingly bold with their attacks on news media over the past two decades.
For example, in 2019 alone, former president Donald Trump used the insult "fake
news" on Twitter 273 times and called the press "the enemy of the people" 16 times.
Trump's administration also barred well-regarded journalists from covering certain
events and canceled the historically traditional daily White House press briefing, all
under the guise of fighting unscrupulous journalists. Indeed, that same year, an edited
montage video depicting then-President Trump shooting and stabbing journalists
was played publicly at an event for his political supporters.

    Scholars and advocates of press freedom worry that actions from the upper
echelons of major political party, and those of some of their political supporters, serve
to vilify journalists and incite public attacks against them. A study from Pew Research
backs up this perception: People who supported Trump while he was president
perceived journalists to be less ethical. Moreover, mainstream journalists who covered
Trump's administration were frequently subject to an array of online name-calling
every time they posted a new story.

    The violence is not just rhetorical, though. For example, in May 2017, a Republi-
can candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, Greg Gianforte, body-slammed a
journalist covering his campaign. The attack was fierce enough to send the journalist
to a hospital. Although Gianforte was later convicted of assault, his actions were
publicly praised by then-President Donald Trump and celebrated in some corners
of society. Moreover, Gianforte would go on to win two terms to the U.S. House of
Representatives and become governor of Montana.

Violence Against Journalists Abroad

    Violence against journalists is even more prevalent and pernicious in some places
outside of the United States, though. The Middle East, Latin America, and parts of
Asia have proven to be especially dangerous for journalists. It is estimated that more

                                                                 - 211 -
                               Violence Against Journalists

than 800 journalists around the world have been killed on the job during the past
decade alone. (Such numbers likely underestimate the reality.) There are many more
global incidents of violence against journalists that include kidnapping, detention,
and torture.

    The disappearance of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi has become a
terrible symbol of the need to increase protections for journalists worldwide. The
Washington Post writer reported critically about political corruption in the Middle
East. In October 2018, he was assassinated in gruesome fashion by Saudi government
actors who wished to silence his voice. Despite the evidence linking Khashoggi's
murder to the Saudi crown prince, few concrete sanctions were placed on Saudi
Arabia by countries that advocate for press freedom.

    In another high-profile case, Maria Ressa, a Filipino-American journalist who
founded a journalistic outlet called Rappler, was convicted of cyberlibel in the Philip-
pines in 2020 after years of reporting critically on Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte. Press freedom advocates allege that the Duterte government was behind
the lawsuit -- which was advanced by a businessman who was the subject of one
of Rappler's stories -- and pressured the courts to interpret a 2012 law intended to
combat child pornography, identity theft, and libel in a "Kafkaesque" way that could
criminalize critical journalistic conduct. The National Union of Journalists of the
Philippines, as well as international watchdog groups, have decried the ruling as an
example of authorities using legal mechanisms to restrict critical journalism.

    While a range of journalists face violence, there is one group that is particularly
vulnerable: freelance journalists who cover conflict zones. Declining news budgets
have resulted in more conflict journalism being performed by freelance reporters.
Such reporters receive limited institutional assistance relative to staff reporters at
mainstream international journalistic outlets, such as limited legal support, little access
to on-the-ground resources like a security detail, and lack of access to services like
emergency extractions. However, freelancers often need to take greater risks in order
to gather information (e.g., photographs) from the front lines of conflict in order
to have their stories get picked up by major journalistic outlets (and, in turn, get
paid). Consequently, freelancers are disproportionately more likely to get killed when
reporting abroad, and especially in war zones.

Female and Minority Journalists

    Some research has found that women in journalism are more susceptible to
violence than their male counterparts, particularly online. A study by the International
Center for Journalists published in 2020 documented the variety of physical and

                                                                 - 212 -
                               Violence Against Journalists

psychological threats female journalists face online, which fall under the category of
"gendered online violence."

    Gendered online violence includes acts like cyber-bullying and online harassment,
targeted toxic attacks, threatened sexual violence, and violations of digital security and
online privacy (e.g., `doxxing'). Such acts can further complicate the already difficult
online environments that many journalists must operate within, and make female
journalists especially vulnerable. These gendered online attacks occur on a variety
of sites and platforms, from online news comment streams on a journalistic outlet's
website to social media interactions on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

    Similarly, journalists belonging to minority ethnic groups are more likely to face
online harassment than their majority counterparts. These attacks often come by
way of ethnic slurs and coordinated action, and they tend to be more personal in
nature. Newsrooms, in coordination with law enforcement, continue to develop best
practices for preventing and reacting to this type of harassment, including creating
clear standards for interactions allowed on their news websites.

    All of this serves as a reminder that the practice of journalism is not only difficult
but also dangerous.

         Journalism in Africa

    From the early 1960s to the early 2000s, the professional practice of journalism
in much of Africa was largely rooted in postcolonial structures and disseminated
through communication spaces largely controlled by its governments. Such spaces,
and especially the mediums of radio and television, were the primary hubs for public
deliberation and political communication.

    For example, governments throughout eastern and central Africa, including Bu-
rundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, and Tanzania, routinely adopted a paternalistic role
in their country's media system by being the arbiter of what information actually
`informed' public discourses, while excluding the information it deemed to be "detri-
mental to the safety of the broader polity and the citizenry." They did (and some
still do) so by establishing monitoring institutions and enacting media laws to curtail
the free flow of information and offer a measure of soft (and sometimes, not so soft)
power over journalists.

    Beyond political power structures, journalism in many African countries is also
heavily shaped by the economic conditions of those countries and the available
infrastructure. For example, journalists in many African countries must seek second
jobs or supplemental income, and there are often insufficient resources for in-depth,
investigative reporting. Moreover, poor physical infrastructures can make it difficult
to reach events in remote areas -- though the rapid growth in digital infrastructures
has been a boon for journalism in Africa.

Press Freedoms and Constraints

    In recent decades, journalism in many African countries has been severely re-
stricted by laws that limit certain kinds of content or offer government officials large
loopholes for denying journalists access to public information. For example, in Chad,

                                                                 - 217 -

Gambia, and Zimbabwe, media policy is routinely leveraged to dictate what the press
can report on or what subjects can be discussed on current affairs talk shows, as well as
who is allowed to own media companies. Those policies are often enforced selectively
to exclude political speech by activists and members of opposition parties.

    Similarly, the countries of Zambia, Mozambique, and Malawi still leverage laws
initially drawn up during the colonial era to criminalize journalistic attempts to expose
political wrongdoing. They often do so under the guise of defamation and sedition
laws. In particular, Zambia's Section 53 of the Penal Code empowers the presidency
to censor publications that it considers `contrary to the public interest,' while its
State Security Act enables officials to treat large swaths of government documents as
classified documents through broad national security claims.

    Zambia is not alone in this regard: Gambia and Zimbabwe have received very
poor ratings for press freedoms in recent years because of their liberal use of frivolous
charges of sedition and libel against journalists. Put another way, legal action, and
charges of sedition and libel in particular, have become major and effective tools for
controlling independent media in many African countries, and especially those in sub-
Saharan Africa. Similarly, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Tanzania have drawn considerable
attention in recent years because of politically related bans and suspensions imposed
against traditional and online media that challenge its governments.

    Additionally, in sub-Saharan African countries, including Eritrea, Rwanda, and
the Democratic Republic of Congo, the national government either dominates news
media ownership or plays a major role in the economic sustainability of its media
industries. For example, the Burundi government owns its main daily newspaper, its
only national television station, and its only national radio station. While the country
does have privately owned journalistic outlets, those outlets have limited reach and
are sometimes only able to publish journalism irregularly.

    It is important to note that some African countries, especially on the continent's
southern tip, do have open and generally free media systems. In fact, Namibia (south-
ern Africa) and Ghana (western Africa) have better rankings in the World Press
Freedom Index than the United States. However, the continent as a whole tends to
place serious legal and structural constraints on what journalists can and cannot do.

Professionalization and Labor Conditions

    Compared to other regions, relatively few journalists in Africa possess formal
college degrees or formal training. In Tanzania, for example, there are still fewer
than a dozen journalism schools in the entire country. Moreover, the cost of formal

                                                                 - 218 -
                                      Journalism in Africa

journalism training is unaffordable to many aspiring journalists in Africa, and media
owners in Africa have historically offered little investment in training programs for its
journalists (or for professional associations of journalists).

    In many countries in western Africa, the majority of journalists work as freelancers,
earning an average of $2.45 U.S. Dollars per day, according to data from 2011. That
adds up to a monthly salary that is often below those countries' minimum wage. Staff
reporters often work without a contract and may thus perform their jobs with the
fear of being replaced. In some countries, such as Ethiopia and Burundi, the wages
of a full-time, mid-career journalist is roughly equal to that of an elementary school
teacher.

    A major consequence of these low salaries is that some journalists are more willing
to accept so-called `brown envelopes,' or bribes and gifts, in return for favorable
coverage of political and business leaders. As such, adversarial and watchdog forms
of journalism are not only legally risky but also economically disincentivized.

    Over the past two decades, there have been concerted efforts to promote stronger
professional ethics and to provide African journalists more resources to engage in in-
dependent journalism. These efforts have, by and large, been led by grassroots groups
and the international community -- but rarely by national governments. The interna-
tional involvement, however, has raised questions about the potential `Westernizing'
of African journalism. Nevertheless, more African countries today have some form of
media council or journalists' union than ever before, which has helped raise journalis-
tic standards and offered a stronger -- though often still inadequate -- counterbalance
against government intervention.

Sociotechnical Trends

    Radio remains the primary medium for disseminating news in many parts of
Africa. In particular, community radio stations are especially robust throughout the
continent and have served as crucial tools for informing and mobilizing the public,
especially in more rural areas that have lower literacy rates. Community radio has
also proven to be one of the strongest counterbalances against largely concentrated
media ownership in many African countries and against overt government influence
over national media in places like Botswana and Tanzania.

    Notably, the development of wireless digital technologies over the past two
decades has transformed the media ecosystems in much of Africa. While wired
broadband internet and cable television remains uncommon in large parts of the
continent, the penetration of mobile devices and cell phone coverage has enabled

                                                                 - 219 -
                                      Journalism in Africa

more Africans to access major domestic and international media than ever before.
While major digital divides still very much exist in the continent, they have been
vastly reduced in recent years.

    Moreover, the rapid proliferation of mobile internet has greatly expanded the
reach of alternative (and opposition) media and enabled more participatory forms
of journalism -- which were previously uncommon. It is now quite common for
newsrooms in eastern and southern Africa to actively solicit news tips and visuals
from eyewitnesses, and incorporate them into their reporting. It is also increasingly
common for journalists to publish more critical stories online under pseudonyms, and
often through social media and blogs. Moreover, the proliferation of mobile payment
systems has also made it easier for independent media to utilize crowdfunding as a
business model.

    Key Takeaways

    » Many countries in Africa still operate under highly restrictive legal envi-

        ronments, and it is not uncommon for journalists in some countries to be
        targeted under defamation and sedition laws, or for the government to
        exercise a heavy hand over news production.

    » It is economically challenging to do journalism in much of Africa, with

        journalistic labor often being unstable and poorly paid. It is not uncommon
        for journalists in Africa to seek out supplemental income or to be tempted
        by bribes in return for favorable coverage.

    » Radio remains the primary medium for delivering news in much of Africa,

        but the rapid development of mobile internet has significantly altered the
        continent's media ecosystems.

          Journalism in Asia

    Asia is home to the full range of media organizational forms and formats. Notably,
the world's most read newspapers are found in Asia, including Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun,
which has a print circulation of 9.7 million, and Asahi Shimbun, which has a print
circulation of 7.5 million. (For comparison, The New York Times has a print circulation
of 480,000.) It is also home to the world's most read English-language newspaper:
The Times of India. Similarly, China-based Xinhua is today regarded as the largest
international news agency in the world.

    However, although it boasts a number of highly consumed journalistic products,
the majority of Asian countries lack the professional norms and institutions necessary
to support a strong and resilient media ecology. In particular, a combination of
cultural, social, and political factors makes it difficult to practice journalism in most of
the region. Moreover, many countries in Asia suffer from what the United Nations
calls `severe multidimensional poverty,' which in turn creates serious inequities in
who has access to high-quality journalism as well as who gets covered in mainstream
journalism.

Press Freedoms and Constraints

    Generally speaking, Asian countries offer journalists inhospitable working envi-
ronments that make it difficult for them to provide robust journalism and commentary
on the powerful. According to Freedom House, only Japan, Papua New Guinea, and
Taiwan could be said to enjoy a `free' press as of 2017. Similarly, four of the three
bottom-ranked countries in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index were Asian coun-
tries (China, North Korea, and Turkmenistan).

    The constraints on journalism in Asia are applied by a wide range of actors using
diverse methods. While brutal and overt forms of repression, such as jailing journalists

                                                                 - 221 -
                                        Journalism in Asia

and banning news outlets, certainly do occur in places like Myanmar and North
Korea, many states opt for more subtle forms of control that draw less attention but
are equally effective. For example, China and Singapore have granted journalists and
citizens considerable freedom to produce and access journalism, but only about topics
that do not significantly threaten the dominance of their ruling parties. Put another
way, such journalists are generally free to produce business and lifestyle stories, and
they may even engage in investigations of local corruption, but they are frequently
barred from reporting critically about the Chinese leadership or on sensitive topics
like the Uyghur genocide.

    Journalists in most Asian countries must also contend with national security and
state secrets laws that governments have made more sweeping under the guise of
preventing terrorism. Such laws have been repeatedly applied to jail journalists and
create a climate of self-censorship. Additionally, Asian countries will sometimes use
tax laws to harass independent media. For example, the 24-year-old Cambodia Daily
was forced to close down in 2017 after the Cambodian government issued a dubious
bill for back taxes. Similarly, under the Rodrigo Duterte administration, authorities
in the Philippines used dubious claims to investigate the owners of the Philippine
Daily Inquirer for alleged tax evasion, and the intense pressure led to the newspaper's
eventual sale to a pro-government tycoon.

    Governments in Asian countries have also applied economic pressure to punish
critical journalism. One widespread tactic is to withhold spending on advertisements
in media that are out of favor, resulting in a major loss of revenue in markets where
the public sector is a major advertiser. For example, the India-based Anandabazar
Patrika lost all state government advertising revenue after they opposed a powerful
chief minister's reelection bid. In Indonesia, local governments and politicians are the
main source of advertising revenue for many journalistic outlets, and it is customary
for those organizations to align their editorial positions with the ruling parties.

    Additionally, it is common for public television and radio stations in Asian coun-
tries to be directly controlled by political leaders who instrumentalize them as propa-
ganda tools. Even when there is private ownership, the licensing (or regulation) of
broadcasters in many Asian countries is controlled by political appointees rather than
independent public bodies, which results in those lucrative licenses being given to
pro-government organizations. Similarly, in countries like Malaysia and Singapore,
newspapers require an annual publishing license, which can be denied or revoked at
the government's discretion, with no reason given. As such, in many Asian countries,
there is little obvious friction between major media outlets and the government.

    Notably, many Asian governments are less sensitive about English-language media

                                                                 - 222 -
                                        Journalism in Asia

that cater to cosmopolitan urbanites and expatriates than they are about media in
the local language. Thus, laws are often selectively applied, and local organizations
end up being more tightly supervised because of their influence among the country's
broader population.

Professionalization and Labor Conditions

    In addition to legal threats from the government and interference from pro-
government owners, journalists in many Asian countries are also subject to threats
from citizens. Long before intolerant populism emerged as a major concern in the
West with the rise of far-right politicians in Europe and the election of Donald Trump,
multiple Asian countries were experiencing waves of anti-journalist sentiment. For
example, in the Philippines, journalists investigating human rights abuses by President
Rodrigo Duterte faced repeated threats of violence from his enraged supporters. In
Indonesia, the country's largest newspaper, Kompas, routinely receives open threats
from hardline Muslim groups. In China, nationalist sentiment can sometimes be an
even greater obstacle to balanced coverage of Japan than Chinese government control.
Notably, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Impunity Index, which measures the
per capita number of unsolved murders of journalists, has placed the Philippines,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India among its dozen worst offenders in recent years.

    While there is considerable variation in the level of journalistic professionalism
within Asia, and in the values and norms that journalists in different Asian countries
adhere to most, the region is generally distinct from places like the United States and
Europe. In particular, Asian journalists are more likely to favor social responsibility and
social stability over what they sometimes critique as an amoral set of newsworthiness
values in the West. Asian journalists are also more likely to believe they play a role
in nation-building and economic development, which tends to make them take a
less adversarial stance toward the ruling party. Scholars have argued that this is not a
simple, culture-bound act of deference or meekness. Instead, it reflects an attitude that
favors more paternalistic rule, which should ideally result from competitive elections.

    Moreover, many Asian journalists struggle economically. Low wages across the
continent means that the practice of `envelope journalism' is widespread, wherein
bribes and gifts are offered to journalists in return for favorable coverage of political
and business leaders. Moreover, some investigative journalists are motivated by the
chance to uncover blackmail, which they can then use to extract `hush money' from
wealthy individuals. As such, adversarial and watchdog forms of journalism are not
only legally problematic but also economically disincentivized.

                                                                 - 223 -

Sociotechnical Trends

    While traditional media throughout Asia have suffered declines in advertising
revenue (like the rest of the world), the magnitude of that decline (and of declining
subscriptions) has not been nearly as high. Moreover, some of those declines have been
offset by the tremendous growth of many Asian economies, which has been reflected
in booming media industries. As such, traditional media -- and print journalism
in particular -- remain viable and are still major components of many Asian media
ecosystems.

    With the increasing development of digital infrastructures and rapid media
growth, alternative online media have also emerged in some Asian countries. Such
outlets have been funded in part by international media development foundations.
However, rising standards of living and increasing amounts of disposable income
have also offered some alternative media outlets a sustainable economic pathway.
Examples of this include Malaysia's Malaysiakini, an online-only independent news
outlet, and the Democratic Voice of Burma, a radio and television network founded
by Myanmar exiles.

    Notably, some Asian journalistic outlets have begun vying for a global audience
through the use of different media technologies. Several countries now have state-
funded external broadcasting services that serve public diplomacy interests (even as
they are granted some measure of journalistic autonomy to maintain their credibility).
For example, Japan's NHK now offers an English-language television channel and
a radio service that broadcasts in 18 languages. Radio Taiwan International broad-
casts its radio programs in 13 languages. Singapore's Channel NewsAsia reaches 28
countries and territories in the region through satellite distribution.

    The biggest Asian player on the international stage today is China, though. Its
suite of global media includes China Global Television Network, which offers news
and documentary television channels in six languages and is available worldwide;
the English-language China Daily, which prints 600,000 copies and is available in
some major cities outside China; and Xinhua, which is now the world's largest news
agency by some measures. Chinese media companies have also been at the forefront
of using artificial intelligence and automation in journalism to create personalized
news products that even feature computer-generated news anchors.

                                                                 - 224 -

        Journalism in Europe

    Journalism has a long and storied history in Europe, with the world's first regularly
published newspaper, the Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien,
being published in the free imperial city of Strasbourg (now part of France) in 1605.
The Relation was quite international in nature, with news about politics, diplomacy,
and the military coming from correspondents throughout Europe. The first daily
newspaper, Einkommende Zeitungen, was published in Leipzig (Germany) about 50
years later. And, about 200 years later, in 1835, the French news agency Havas was
founded -- which later became the Agence France Press (AFP), one of the largest news
agencies in the world today.

    When it comes to the development of broadcast media, Europe in many ways
stands out from other regions. Unlike the United States, which allowed radio to
develop largely as a commercial medium, and regions like Africa and Latin Amer-
ica, where radio was frequently instrumentalized to advance government objectives,
many European governments saw the emergence of radio as a chance to develop
national public information systems. Under European public service broadcasting (PSB)
systems, citizens were taxed in different ways and the proceeds of those taxes were
devoted to creating national broadcasters whose mission was to inform the public.
The prototypical example of this is the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The
BBC was founded in 1922, financed largely by license fees and kept at arm's length
from political interests through an independent governance structure. Public service
broadcasters are still major news sources within many European media ecosystems
(which also include private broadcasters and other private journalistic outlets).

    However, it would be a mistake to view Europe as a monolithic entity because
there is considerable variation in the media systems of European countries. For
example, the more advocacy-oriented culture of journalism in southern Europe is
quite different from the more detached observatorial culture of northern European

                                                                 - 227 -
                                      Journalism in Europe

journalism. Additionally, the comparably late emergence of democracy in eastern
Europe has shaped the development of journalism in those countries.

Press Freedoms and Constraints

    Rankings of media freedom by Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders
help illustrate important differences in Europe. Northern European countries like
Finland, Norway, and Sweden routinely appear near the top of those rankings -- and,
in fact, were the top three countries in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index. However,
the eastern European countries of Belarus, Bulgaria, and Turkey (which is frequently
considered part of Europe due to its participation in the European Union) are often
regarded as countries where journalism cannot be freely practiced.

    As a whole, though, Europe offers the most hospitable environment for journalism
in the world, with countries in western and northern Europe being routinely ranked
higher than the United States when it comes to press freedom. This is bolstered by
the fact that some of the most active press freedom advocates are located in Europe.
For example, Reporters Without Borders is based in Paris, the International Press
Institute is based in Vienna, and Article 19 is based in London.

    However, even in well-regarded places like the United Kingdom, journalists face
growing obstacles. For example, national security laws approved by U.K. officials
in recent years have made it far easier for journalists to be surveilled. Additionally,
England's defamation laws -- which offer journalists far fewer protections than those
in the United States -- have been used strategically in libel lawsuits by celebrities and
business leaders to silence journalists. In fact, for many years, a practice of `libel tourism'
was used by prominent members of society to take advantage of that phenomenon.
Under that practice, a journalist based in a country with strong legal protections
against libel charges (e.g., the United States) would be sued in a country like England
by an individual (e.g., a celebrity) because it was easier for that individual to win such
cases there. Libel tourism was legally curtailed in England in 2013, but domestic
journalists in England still operate with relatively weak protections from libel charges.

    Moreover, the conditions for doing journalism are relatively difficult in central
and eastern European countries, such as Moldova, Serbia, and Ukraine. While newly
democratic eastern European countries have written constitutions that guarantee
freedom of expression and of the press, there are still significant restrictions on access
to government information. Moreover, overt government control in those places has
in many ways been replaced with self-censorship resulting from political and financial
pressures. This has created a challenging climate for journalists.

                                                                 - 228 -
                                      Journalism in Europe

    An illustrative example of this is Hungary. Even though the country's constitution
protects freedom of speech and of the press, structural reforms and media legislation
enacted and under the regime of Viktor Orbán largely undermined those protections.
By 2017, nearly all daily regional newspapers had been concentrated into the hands of
oligarchs connected to Orbán's Fidesz party. The best-selling political daily newspaper
at the time, the left-leaning Népszabadság, was suspended by the government and
its parent company was then sold to an Orbán ally, who decided to shut down the
newspaper. After Orbán's landslide reelection in 2018, one of the two national
opposition newspapers, the Magyar Nemzet, announced that it would shut down as
well. Unlike other authoritarian regimes that seek to crush opposition media with
blunt force, Orbán's regime sought to slowly strangle outlets not aligned with the
Fidesz party's objectives.

    In contrast, President Erdogan of Turkey unleashed a major crackdown against his
media critics after a failed coup d'état attempt in 2016. Following the declaration of a
state of emergency, Erdogan's regime shut down almost 150 media outlets, including
55 newspapers, five news agencies, 16 TV channels, and 23 radio stations. In short
order, Turkey's entire news media ecosystem was reduced to a handful of pro-regime
media. In 2021, Reporters Without Borders called Turkey one of the "world's biggest
prisons for professional journalists."

Professionalization and Labor Conditions

    The relatively unconstrained nature of western and northern European media
ecosystems is a result of general political stability, state investment in independent
media, and the establishment of mature institutions for media self-regulation. For
example, the idea of voluntary press and media councils that monitor journalistic
coverage and produce reports detailing its shortcomings has roots in Scandinavian
countries, with the oldest such council having been established in Sweden in 1916.
Western and northern European countries also tend to have strong, highly profession-
alized journalistic cultures and exhibit general acceptance of professional codes of
ethics. In contrast, institutionalized forms of media self-regulation sometimes do not
exist at all in southern Europe, and when they do, they are generally far less influential.
Similarly, institutionalized self-regulation is relatively rare or weak in most media
systems in central and eastern Europe.

    In much of Europe, both public (state-owned or state-supported) and private
(commercial) media coexist. In fact, the majority of media in Europe are commercial,
profit-oriented organizations that get most of their revenue from advertising. Addi-
tionally, much of Europe has seen a considerable amount of deregulation over the

                                                                 - 229 -
                                      Journalism in Europe

past 30 years, resulting in greater private use of public airwaves as well as increased
concentration of media ownership. For example, in the United Kingdom and in Spain,
just two publishers control more than half of the print market, there are only four
major publishing groups in the Netherlands. Moreover, some large companies like
Germany's Axel Springer are major players in the media markets of smaller European
countries.

    State aid to the media sector is common practice in many parts of Europe, and
especially in northern Europe. This includes not only robust public service broad-
casters but also direct and indirect subsidies to commercial newspapers to promote
public service journalism as well as media pluralism (e.g., a diversity of viewpoints
and coverage of multiple regions). In the case of Scandinavia, journalistic outlets
routinely receive tax exemptions, distribution benefits (e.g., lower postal rates), and
state support for innovative experiments.

    In many western and northern European countries, the question is not whether
there should be public or private media but rather how public and private media
should coexist. A practical consequence of this dual structure is that European
journalistic outlets are among the best resourced in the world -- especially in western
and northern Europe. This, in turn, allows for strong, independent journalism in those
places. In particular, public service broadcasters generally capture the largest share of
national audiences for news programming and are widely seen as credible sources of
information. Consequently, their journalists are able to conduct rigorous interviews
with powerful individuals without fear of losing access to them (or being subsequently
targeted). Many of these social benefits are passed on to journalists working for private
outlets, too, as the journalists working for public service broadcasters frequently use
their position to defend the institution of journalism in those countries.

    Again, the situation is quite different for southern, central, and eastern European
outlets. In particular, southern European journalists tend to adhere more strongly to
overtly partisan, advocacy-oriented journalistic cultures, and while state subsidies are
sometimes offered to ensure media pluralism, the amounts are significantly lower than
those in western and northern Europe. In central and eastern European countries,
commercial media organizations often operate on limited budgets and public service
media -- still shaped by their propagandist histories -- tend to play more subservient
roles.

Sociotechnical Trends

    As of 2016, roughly 85% of households in the European Union had access to
the Internet, making it the best-connected region in the world. Additionally, many

                                                                 - 230 -
                                      Journalism in Europe

European countries benefit from advanced digital infrastructures and affordable
access to mobile internet. Thus, unsurprisingly, Europe has been a pioneer in the
digital transformation of journalism.

    Notably, the dominant traditional media corporations are also frequently the
ones topping the online news markets by offering digital versions of their print and
broadcast media, as well as some new digitally native spin-offs. While European
countries tend to be among the most willing to pay for online news -- a 2020 survey
found that nearly 45% of Norwegians paid for online news -- their media markets
have also suffered from declining ad revenue and a plurality of freely accessible online
news sites. This has resulted in major financial challenges for commercial media in
particular.

    Additionally, in central and eastern European countries where (semi-)authoritarian
systems exist, online websites, blogs, and social media have played an important role
in giving a voice to opposing viewpoints amid crackdowns on traditional media. For
example, following the Turkish crackdown on news media in 2016, a number of
small-scale online journalism websites popped up and gave journalists a relatively
unobstructed platform for distributing their work. Those websites have since drawn
more attention from political leaders and have become targets themselves. However,
European digital rights groups have played a leading role in developing privacy and
anti-blocking technologies that have allowed information to flow more freely.

    Key Takeaways

    » Europe is arguably the most hospitable place for practicing journalism in

        the world, and northern European countries in particular are routinely
        ranked at the top of media freedom indices. This is the result of a combi-
        nation of factors, including strong legal protections for journalists, stable
        democratic institutions, and the presence of major press freedom advocacy

   Journalism in Latin America

    The first printing press of the Americas began operating in 1539 in Mexico but it
was not until 180 years later that the region would have its first regular newspaper, the
Gaceta de México. Colonial journalism in the Americas was largely influenced by both
the Church and the Crown, but to varying degrees depending on how isolated the
town or city was. Throughout the colonial period, and especially in its latter stages, the
press was crucial to the development of new Latin American nations by encouraging
unity and mutual support -- a phenomenon not too different from the press' role in
the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War.

    However, although there are some similarities in the cultures and practices of
journalism in Latin America, the development of those cultures and practices diverged
in important ways. Even today, scholars routinely find significant country-level
differences. For example, Cuba still operates largely under a state-media system where
many journalists serve as mouthpieces for government policy. In Mexico, there is
ample private ownership of media companies but such ownership is also highly
concentrated, with a journalism tradition that is largely loyal to ruling parties. And, in
Chile, journalists have a long history of adhering to interventionist journalistic values,
thereby pointedly challenging public elites.

Press Freedoms and Constraints

    Many Latin American nations have histories of military dictatorships and author-
itarian regimes, have experienced coup d'états, and have witnessed popular rebellions
against political corruption. Put another way, journalists in Latin America have histor-
ically operated under politically volatile conditions -- though much of the region is
currently operating under a relatively peaceful and democratic period.

    That volatility has made it difficult to sustain a tradition of public media in Latin
America. Instead, the relatively few public media tends to be highly sympathetic

                                                                 - 233 -

to the government and, in many cases, are more akin to state-owned media than
state-supported public service broadcasters. This is especially true in the case of
television. The time frame of the medium's development in the region coincided with
the proliferation of authoritarian regimes, which in turn led to the instrumentalization
of television to advance nation-building strategies. Consequently, public media in
Latin America routinely receive lower ratings than some commercial counterparts
and are often perceived as lacking in credibility.

    Private ownership of media in Latin America is also frequently highly concen-
trated and closely tied to political leaders. Similar to their southern European counter-
parts, many Latin American newspapers were family-owned, often by families with
close ties to political leadership. In Colombia, for example, it was very common for a
president to have some journalism background. Although officially prohibited by law,
it is not uncommon for Colombian members of Congress to hold television or radio
licenses. More broadly, politicians throughout the region are also either on boards of
directors or are partners in media companies. As such, Latin America has historically
had high levels of clientelism, where journalists write stories for the benefit of sources
or owners rather than for the civic good.

    Although the region saw the development of important press freedoms in the
1980s and early 1990s, many of those gains have been curtailed since then. Today,
press freedoms remain limited in many parts of Latin America. Press censorship -- and
especially self-censorship -- is rising and many elected leaders have solidified their
control over legislative and judicial systems. This concentration of power has allowed
political elites, and business leaders who work with government officials, to go after
independent journalists and journalistic outlets. Some of the worst offenders in this
regard are Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. In contrast, Jamaica,
Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Suriname have relatively free media systems -- in fact, all
four were ranked higher than the United States by Reporters Without Borders' World
Press Freedom Index in 2021.

    International organizations, including the Inter-American Commission on Hu-
man Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, have played a major
role in promoting independent journalism in the region. Those entities have success-
fully struck down legislation and judicial decisions restricting free speech, which in
turn have had far-reaching consequences. For example, the Inter-American Court
overturned Costa Rican journalist Mauricio Herrera Ulloa's conviction of criminal
defamation for reporting on alleged acts of corruption. It also ordered Peru to restore
a Peruvian television station owner's rights after it aired reports on corruption and
human rights abuses. Notably, there are several instances where Latin American
countries have complied with these and other orders and further gone on to reform

                                                                 - 234 -

some of their domestic laws. In short, external organizations have proven crucial to
protecting journalists and citizens' access to information in the region.

Professionalization and Labor Conditions

    Latin America is home to some of the world's most dangerous places for practicing
journalism. In particular, Mexico routinely ranks as one of the most dangerous
countries for journalists anywhere in the world. A lack of impunity allows criminal
gangs, cartels, and corrupt officials to silence critics. Organized crime is particularly
violent in places like Veracruz, Guerrero, Michoacán, and Tamaulipas. Journalists
who cover sensitive subjects, and investigative journalists in particular, are routinely
harassed and sometimes killed in gruesome ways in order to send messages.

    Mexico is not alone, though. In May of 2017 alone, the Committee to Protect
Journalists found that more than 100 journalists and media workers were threatened,
harassed, detained, or attacked while covering protests in Venezuela. That number
increased over the following months, during which hundreds of incidents of vio-
lence and intimidation of journalists were recorded. While state security forces and
armed, pro-government civilian groups were responsible for most of the incidents,
anti-government protesters also targeted journalists by robbing them and accusing
them of being government sympathizers. Similar issues arose during the Venezuelan
presidential crisis in 2019 and 2020.

    More broadly, journalists in the region still struggle with structural issues ranging
from low pay to corruption in the newsroom to varying levels of professional standards.
Several Latin American countries have professional associations for journalists (in
which membership is voluntary) or trade unions (in which membership is sometimes
required for more desirable jobs). Such bodies have helped instill greater professional
values and stronger ethical codes for journalists. In particular, those groups -- together
with international organizations -- have helped to develop a stronger practice of
investigative journalism in order to combat corruption. As such, there now more
journalistic partnerships within and across countries in order to pool resources for
far-reaching, in-depth investigations. While these developments have also helped
promote a more objective approach to journalism, journalists in many Latin American
countries still identify closely with a more interpretive approach that favors the use
of pointed language and editorializing.

Sociotechnical Trends

    Radio and television are still the primary vehicles for news in most of Latin
America. Radio, in particular, remains its most inclusive medium as it is able to reach

                                                                 - 235 -
                                Journalism in Latin America

remote areas that still lack digital connectivity. For example, Bolivia has more than
800 radio stations in the country and, in Peru, radio remains the most commonly
owned piece of media equipment in the country. As in Africa, community radio
has proven to be a crucial counterweight to state-sponsored media and its highly
concentrated private media, due in large part to its low barrier to entry. This is
especially true for indigenous populations, rural communities, and the urban poor,
whose perspectives are often missing in more mainstream media.

    However, as digital infrastructures have improved, Latin America has also become
a hub for innovative digital journalism. For example, Argentina's largest newspapers,
Clarín and La Nación, have created online teams that routinely win international
awards for their digital storytelling and data journalism. Additionally, a remarkable
94% of Latin American Internet users use some form of social media, which has
opened up a range of opportunities for digitally oriented journalists and for partic-
ipatory forms of journalism. At the same time, the prevalence of social media has
also enabled misinformation and disinformation to spread rapidly during incidents
in different Latin American countries. Those information challenges are made even
more acute due to the existing low trust in news media. However, it is important to
note that access to the internet (and high-speed internet in particular) remains highly
uneven throughout much of Latin America.

    Key Takeaways

    » Latin American journalism has developed against a backdrop of authori-

        tarian rule and state control. In many countries, public media and highly
        concentrated private media generally align with the ruling parties.

    » Violence against journalists is not uncommon in Latin American countries,

        and especially in Mexico's recent history. The resulting climate of fear
        promotes self-censorship, which also coincides with overt censorship in
        some countries.

  Journalism in the Middle East
           and North Africa

    The Middle East and North Africa present journalists some of the most hostile
working conditions in the world. The region is generally marked by government
control and threats from powerful non-state actors. While the recent so-called Arab
Spring in 2011 helped enable journalistic independence in parts of the region, such
freedom was fleeting and the region's media ecosystem is once again defined by close
ties between news media and the government and, in some cases, overt oppression of
journalists.

    Modern Arab journalism emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. Fol-
lowing World War I, the region was swept by a new sense of Arab identity and Arab
journalists were at the forefront of the secular pan-Arabism movement. Newspapers
such as Halab in the Syrian city of Aleppo openly advocated for Arab nationalism
immediately after the war (with quiet support from the British, who sought to replace
the defeated Ottoman Empire with a series of Arab states).

    However, that Arab nationalism soon evolved into an effort to combat European
colonialism, and Arab journalists played a major role in promoting a shared vision of
regional political and social justice. In the decades that followed, though, such efforts
gave way to divisions, and the region's elite news media generally transformed into
government mouthpieces (or faced immense risks by staying independent).

Press Freedoms and Constraints

    Shortly after World War II, Arab journalism enjoyed a brief window of freedom.
Lebanon, in particular, emerged as a media hub -- and it remains so today -- because of
its history of a weak central government, intellectual liberalism, and a relatively liberal

                                                                 - 237 -

culture. At the time, editors in Beirut generally expressed a more activist approach to
journalism by openly advocating for different political and social causes.

    However, this would soon change throughout the region as newly independent
Arab states sought to impose their versions of `truth' and legitimize their governments
by muzzling independent journalism. In places like Libya, Syria, and Iraq, revolu-
tionary governments leveraged control over the press to mobilize public opinion in
support of foreign policy objectives like the liberation of Palestine. Similarly, in Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf states, the government promoted private ownership but used
different legal mechanisms to ensure that the proprietors were loyal to the government.
This trend was only bucked in places like Lebanon, Kuwait, and Morocco, which
permitted relatively independent journalism but still subjected them to more subtle
pressures in order to maintain control of political discourses.

    In short, over the past near-century, governments in the Middle East and North
Africa have generally viewed news media as a tool for propaganda. Independent
and more critical forms of journalism about the region thus had to be performed
outside of it. Notably, in the 1970s, journalists and editors in the media hub of Beirut
became the targets of assassinations and kidnappings during the Lebanese civil war,
and newsrooms were bombed and their newspapers shuttered. Many prominent
journalists and publications consequently fled to Europe. For example, the respected
Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, whose founder had been assassinated, shifted it base to
London, where it joined other prominent publications like the Saudi-run Asharq
Al-Awsat and the Palestinian-run Al-Quds Al-Arabi.

    Despite being run from abroad, those publications became among the most
influential in the Middle East and North Africa -- especially among the intellectual
class. However, the outlets were still routinely targeted by state and non-state actors.
For example, Al-Hayat's offices in London, New York, Washington DC, and Riyadh
were targeted by letter bombs and Asharq Al-Awsat's Beirut bureau chief was convicted
in absentia in Lebanon for "disturbing national security."

    Even in Israel, which has the region's most vibrant and active media sector, jour-
nalists are sometimes subject to pre-publication military censorship, gag orders, and
travel restrictions within the West Bank. Moreover, Palestinian outlets have been
repeatedly shuttered by Israeli authorities and Palestinian journalists have been repeat-
edly arrested and detained by security forces. Consequently, as with earlier waves of
journalist exiles, many Palestinian journalists have left the West Bank. However, like
their predecessors, they face the risk of deportation if their reporting proves offensive
to regional governments or powerful individuals, or if it harms international relations.

    In contrast to Israel, Iran has offered a particularly repressive environment for

                                                                 - 238 -

journalists over the past few decades. While its 1979 revolution created a moment
of journalistic freedom -- more than 600 newspapers were founded within a year
of the revolution -- the next 10 years would be marked by arrests, abductions, and
even executions of journalists. Today, Iran remains one of the world's biggest jailers
of journalists, and it is not just domestic journalists who are targeted. For example,
Jason Rezaian, the Iranian-American Tehran bureau chief for The Washington Post, was
imprisoned for 18 months in 2014.

    It is also important to note that broadcast media have been especially tightly
controlled in the region. Up until the 1990s, most television channels in the Middle
East and North Africa were owned by a government and their newscasts were tightly
controlled. For example, during the first Gulf War, Saudi broadcasters did not mention
Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait for three days while the Saudi royal family
debated its official position. The emergence of satellite television has played a major
role in opening the region to new perspectives -- especially as more citizens began to
illegally install receivers in the 1990s and, in some cases, pirated encrypted, foreign
channels.

Professionalization and Labor Conditions

    While journalists in the Middle East and North Africa routinely report valuing
truth and objectivity, values which are frequently featured in journalistic codes of
ethics across the region, the degree to which journalists can adhere to those ideals
varies widely. Journalists in the region today face many of the same pressures as
their predecessors under Ottoman rule. This includes harsh penalties for criticism
of the ruler (whether a king or elected president) and the selective enforcement of
libel laws to target critical journalists and journalistic outlets. For example, in the
past decade alone, Mauritania opted to shut down private television channels critical
of the president's move to dissolve the senate; the Jordanian movement sought to
disband a leading media watchdog group; and Iran repeatedly cracked down on news
media shortly before elections.

    In addition to legal threats, journalists in the region often fear for their personal
safety. Ongoing patterns of harassment, threats, and attacks against journalists meant
that the 2017 Freedom of the Press report categorized every Middle East and North
Africa country besides Kuwait, Israel, and Tunisia as "not free." Additionally, be-
tween 1992 and 2017, the Committee to Protect Journalists identified at least 455
journalists who were killed during that period, and scores more who have been seri-
ously injured. The 2003 invasion of Iraq and the recent Syrian civil war have been
particularly deadly for journalists.

                                                                 - 239 -
                Journalism in the Middle East and North Africa

    Consequently, journalists in that region must negotiate their professional ideals
against a backdrop of widespread official censorship and unofficial self-censorship as
well as the prospect of violence against journalists. Unsurprisingly, Reporters Without
Borders have described Arab journalists as being trapped in a cycle of repression and
servility.

    There are notable distinctions between the region's dominant journalistic cultures
and that of places like the United States. In particular, journalists in the Middle
East and North Africa are far more likely to believe that a commitment to truth and
informing the public must be balanced against (and should sometimes be outweighed
by) being respectful of cultural values. For example, in 2006, a Danish newspaper
published cartoons insulting the Prophet Muhammed. While many Western news
organizations reproduced those cartoons on principle, relatively few journalists in
the Middle East did because, they openly contended, freedom of the press did not
mean the freedom to knowingly offend. Moreover, journalists in the Middle East and
North Africa are far more likely to adhere to values of political and social advocacy
than their counterparts in places like the United States.

Sociotechnical Trends

    The launch of the Qatar-sponsored satellite broadcaster Al-Jazeera in 1996 had a
transformative impact on the region's journalism. Following a bloodless coup d'état,
the new Qatari emir hired a group of journalists who were veterans of the British
Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) Arab-language service and tasked them with cre-
ating an independent media powerhouse in the region. This was done largely to
raise Qatar's regional standing and counter the narratives from its neighboring media
powerhouse, Saudi Arabia.

    Al Jazeera brought an aggressive style of investigative journalism that was uncom-
mon in the region's media. Specifically, it engaged in investigative journalism that
targeted Arab governments and dug into topics that other regional outlets were reluc-
tant to explore. While Al Jazeera's offices were quickly shut down in several regional
capitals -- and its reporters were outright banned from Saudi Arabia -- the availability
of satellite technology allowed its reporting to reach a large number of households
in the region. Not only were audiences mesmerized but other regional journalists
were inspired by Al Jazeera's pioneering work. This, in turn, increased the appetite
for a more professional approach to journalism and helped spur the creation of more
journalism schools in the region and the incorporation of investigative practices in
university and training curricula.

                                                                 - 240 -
                Journalism in the Middle East and North Africa

    Saudi Arabia responded to Al Jazeera's growing popularity by launching its own
satellite broadcaster, Al Arabiya, in 2003. Al Arabiya offered parallel programming but
from a Saudi perspective. These two broadcasters have had a major impact on regional
attitudes toward the United States, especially during the U.S.'s 2003 invasion of Iraq.
(The U.S. government, in particular, was highly critical of Al Jazeera's broadcasting
of gruesome images of civilian casualties and giving voice to groups it designated as
terroristic.) By 2017, there were close to 1,000 satellite channels in the Middle East
and North Africa that spanned a wide range of political and religious perspectives
and reached a sizable share of the region's households.

    Social media have also proved instrumental to the flow of information in the
Middle East and North Africa. Cell phone video of a Tunisian street vendor setting
himself on fire in protest of government harassment helped spark uprisings that
would shake the Arab world at the beginning of the 2010s. Citizen-captured images
and videos of protests throughout the region were disseminated on social media and
amplified by regional satellite channels, galvanizing citizens across the region. In
particular, Egyptian activists used Twitter to both inform and mobilize their fellow
Egyptians against President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years.

    However, as authoritarian rulers regained control of some of those countries, they
cracked down on journalistic independence with renewed vigor. Today, editors in
Egypt report significant levels of government interference, with large numbers of
media outlets being shut down and journalists facing more frequent and harsher
penalties for doing their work than ever before. So-called `fake news' laws have been
used to restrict access to information for citizens and to penalize journalists who
challenge the Egyptian government. More broadly, scores of journalists in Morocco,
Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia have been arrested as nervous governments sought to
contain the spread of protests. The region's journalists have thus faced remarkably
challenging conditions after a brief period of optimism.
