INTRODUCTION TO THIS RESOURCE

Neurodiversity refers to the differences in how our brains receive and process information. People who
think, behave, process information, and learn in ways that considered `typical' for a given situation or place
are referred to as neurotypical. People who think, learn, behave, and process information in ways that
considered `atypical' in a given situation or place are referred to as neurodivergent. But not all neurotypicals
(or all neurodivergents!) think, learn, or process information in the same way. You will learn more about
what this looks like as you move through this resource.

   Neurodiversity is a spectrum, and this resource "Communication and Teamwork Skills to Support
Neurodiversity"has been created with that knowledge in mind.

   This is, the aim of this resource is for it to be as accessible as possible for all brains.

How to navigate this resource:

  · Utilise the contents page on the left-hand side of the page, or the arrows at the bottom of each page
      to navigate between different chapters. It is recommended you work through this resource
      chronologically.

  · This book contains three main sections- `Getting Started`, `Teamwork` and `Communication`.
      Within each section are a number of chapters. Each chapter will have Learning Objectives at the
      beginning to give you an overview of what will covered, and Key Takeaways at the end to reinforce
      key information.

  · The `If You Need Help` chapter provides links to a variety of support resources available at Deakin,
      and there are email templates available in the `Further Resources` section to assist you with
      contacting group and staff members.

We encourage you to come back to this resource throughout your degree, as you will build on your skills
and understanding as you progress through your degree.

     What is disability?

       Disability is a condition which affects a person's body, brain, senses, or mind. Disabilities can
       be hidden or visible (Deakin University, 2024a).
       Sometimes, people with disabilities use aids to assist them. These can be communication
       or mobility aids (Deakin University, 2024a).

     Models of Disability:

       The way that we talk about disability (our language) depends on our disability model. In
       Australia, two common disability models are the social model and medical model.
       The medical model views disability as a defect within the individual. It looks at disability
       from a physical perspective and aims to `fix' and individual by diminishing their disability. For
       people with a chronic disability, this approach can be harmful, as the model implies there will
       always be something `wrong' with them. However, for someone with a broken arm, this
       approach can be exactly what is needed.
                                                                                                       INTRODUCTION TO DISABILITY | 7

The social model believes that disability is caused by society being unwelcoming of people
with an impairment or condition. The social model seeks to support disability by changing
the environment around the person (eg. using ramps instead of stairs). The social model
tends to consider the importance of building a culture that is as accessible for everyone as
possible.

Both of these models have their place in our society. Neither is inherently `right' or `wrong'.

This section has been informed by Deakin (2024b).

Disability groups:

Read through the following disabilities categories. Do any surprise you?

Physical:

     · Difficulties breathing
     · Seizures or fainting
     · Constant or recurrent pain or fatigue
     · Limited use of arms, fingers, feet, or legs
     · Difficulty moving, or physical deformity

Psychosocial:

     · Emotional or psychological conditions, such as anxiety, depression or other mental
        illness
8 | INTRODUCTION TO DISABILITY

            · Memory difficulties or confusion
            · Social or behavioural challenges

     Learning and understanding:

            · Challenges with intellectual functioning, including ability to learn and understand,
                which can impact everyday life skills.

     Sensory:

            · Loss of sight or hearing
            · Challenges when communicating verbally

     Head injury, stroke, or acquired brain injury:

            · Can include difficulties with cognitive functioning, physical and speech challenges, or
                emotional or behavioral changes that impact a person's independence, quality of life,
                and social interactions.

     Other:

            · Difficulties completing daily activities due to a long-term condition, or due to
                treatment or medication for an injury or condition.

        All disabilities have an impact on a person's ability to function in their day-to-day
       life.

       These disability groups draw from Deakin University (2024a) and the Australian Bureau of
       Statistics (ABS, 2024).
               INTRODUCTION TO DISABILITY | 9

Key Takeaways

     · Disability affects the entirety of a person's functioning and is not always visible.
     · There are two models that conceptualise our understanding of disability: the medical and

        the social model.
     · There are different categories that disabilities can fall into; physical, psychosocial,

        intellectual, sensory, head injury, stroke, or acquired brain injury, or other.

These are some of the words you may have come across in this chapter:
Aids, Communication (aids), Disability, Hidden (disabilities), Medical model of
disability, Mobility (aids), Social model of disability and Visible (disabilities)

INTRODUCTION TO NEURODIVERSITY

   Learning Objectives

          · To understand the terms `neurodiversity', `neurodivergence' and `neurotypical' and how
             to use them in day-to-day life.

          · To understand definitions for some of the neurodivergent conditions that will be
             referenced in this book.

     Interactive Activity: What do the terms neurodiverse,
     neurodivergent and neurotypical mean?

       Work through the following interactive resource to develop your understanding of the
       above terms, and check your knowledge with some questions. You can enable full screen for
       the activity to make it easier to read.

Activity text version

Interactive Activity: What do the terms neurodiverse,
neurodivergent and neurotypical mean?

To help ensure you are aware of the most appropriate language to use when interacting
with your peers, work through these key definitions as well as some example sentences for
each term.
If you are ever unsure what term to use, it is always okay to ask the person you are talking
with what terms they identify with.

Neurodiversity:

     · Is defined as "the diversity of human minds": the variation of functioning within our
        society; when multiple neurocognitive styles are represented in a group. (Walker,
        2024, Neurodiversity section, para. 1).

     · In other words, when considering a whole population or a diverse group of people,
        the group is considered neurodiverse.

     · See the next slide for some examples of correct uses of the word neurodiversity.

Neurodivergence:

     · When an individual's brain diverges or differs from what the society considers typical
        or `normal' (Walker, 2024).

     · There are many different conditions that fall under the umbrella of neurodivergence.
        Have a look at the next slide to see some examples of neurodivergent conditions.

     · If you are interested in learning more about some of the conditions and terms
        associated with neurodivergence, you can have a look at the resource by Boren
        (2022). They have some helpful graphics which explain how terms can be used
12 | INTRODUCTION TO NEURODIVERSITY

                appropriately, and what conditions come under the neurodivergent umbrella. This is
                located in the `Reference List' chapter at the end of the book.

       All these terms (and more!) come under the umbrella term of
       `neurodivergence' (Walker, 2024).

            · Autism
            · Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
            · Dyslexia
            · Traumatic brain injury
            · Bipolar disorder
            · Borderline personality disorder
            · Sensory processing disorder
            · Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

      Neurotypical:

            · Individuals whose neurocognitive functioning falls within the typical or `normal'
                societal standards. Neurotypical is the opposite of neurodivergent (Walker, 2024).

            · Neurotypical people make up the majority of the population.

      Conclusion

       Both neurotypical and neurodivergent brains are needed for society (and indeed groups) to
       function well. There is nothing inherently `good' or `bad' about how different brains
       function.
       As you move through this resource you will be able to develop an understanding of
       different brains and some strategies when working with people whose brain differs from
       your own.

Neurodivergent terms used throughout this resource:

Autism:

     · A lifelong condition that "affects how a person thinks, feels, interacts with others, and
        experiences their environment" (Deakin University, 2023b).

     · Autism can look like differences in communication, social interactions, sensory
        processing, and preferences for routines and structure (Deakin University, 2023b).
        However, every autistic person is different in their skill set, so it is important not to
        make assumptions.

     · Use the Deakin Autim webpage to learn more about myths associated with autism

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:

     · A condition that "affects your brain's executive functioning, as well as your ability to
        self-regulate and control your thoughts, words, actions and emotions" (Deakin
        University 2023a).

     · Also referred to as `ADHD' or `Variable Attention Stimulus Trait' (VAST) (Deakin
        University 2023a).

     · Use the Deakin ADHD webpage to learn more about myths associated with ADHD

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder:

     · A condition where people address obsessions (such as fear of contamination or
        germs, or the need for order) through compulsions (behaviors such as washing,
        checking, cleaning, counting, ordering and arranging) (Moulding, n.d).

     · Also referred to as `OCD'.
     · Use the Deakin Obsessive Compulsive Disorder blog post to learn more about OCD

Dyslexia:

     · Dyslexia is a "language-based learning disability. Dyslexia refers to a cluster of
        symptoms, which result in people having difficulties with specific language skills,
        particularly reading." (The University of Melbourne, n.d).

     · Use the Dyslexic Students' Guide for Academics to learn more information about
14 | INTRODUCTION TO NEURODIVERSITY

                some misconceptions associated with dyslexia

       When using the above terms, consider your language. As our society becomes more aware
       and accepting of neurodiversity, the language we use is beginning to positively frame these
       differences. The next chapter will provide a starting point for you to reflect on appropriate
       language.

   Key Takeaways

          · Neurodiversity refers to the entire population, neurotypical refers to those within the
             population who have a `typical' way of thinking, and `neurodivergent' refers to those
             with a different way of thinking.

     These are some of the words you may have come across in this chapter:
     ADHD, Autism, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Dsylexia, Neurodivergence,
     Neurodiversity, Neurotypical.

LANGUAGE TO USE WHEN TALKING
ABOUT DISABILITY

   Learning Objectives

          · To understand the difference between identity-first and person-first language.
          · To understand what terms are appropriate to use when talking about disability, and

             which ones may be inappropriate.

     Person-First and Identity-First Language

       Person-first language respects the personhood of people with disabilities. Person-first
       language puts the person before the disability. We might say,

            · "People with disability" or "people with disabilities"
            · "People with mobility disability"
            · "En Le has schizophrenia"
       Many government services, workplaces, and schools in Australia use and recommend
16 | LANGUAGE TO USE WHEN TALKING ABOUT DISABILITY

       person-first language. However, many disability advocates and support services have raised
       concerns with person-first language and prefer to use identity-first language.

       Identity-first language recognises that disability is a part of who the person is. Identity-
       first language doesn't only describe the person's mind or body, but also the person's
       membership of a wider group of people. We might say,

            · "Disabled people"
            · "I'm Australian and part of the Deaf community"
            · "Autistic students and teachers"

       There are many arguments for, and against, person-first and identity-first language. The
       argument for person-first language is that the person isn't themselves disabled: the person
       is only disabled by society.
       The argument for identity-first language is that disability isn't negative and may be part of
       how the person sees themselves (their identity).

       Language is very personal. When talking to a person with a disability, a general rule of
       thumb is to check or replicate the language that the person uses to talk (or not talk) about
       disability so that the space is accessible and inclusive for everyone. It can be a good idea to
       ask, "Do you identify as a person with a disability?" To ask someone how to talk about their
       disability, you might say "How would you like me to refer to (or not refer to) your
       disability?". Or you could also ask "What language do you use when talking about your
       disability?".
                                                                             LANGUAGE TO USE WHEN TALKING ABOUT DISABILITY | 17

    Interactive Activity: General Language for Talking About
    Disability

      The language that we use to talk about disability in general, and about disabled people in
      particular, has changed over time. Some of the words that we used to use are no longer
      acceptable or appropriate. For example, `accessible parking' is now used instead of `handicapped
      parking'.
      The following activity will help develop your understanding of disability inclusive language
      instead of outdated or inappropriate words. Drag and drop each word or phrase into either the
      `appropriate' or `inappropriate' side.

      This is only a starting point: there are lots of different resources online to help you
      learn more about current disability inclusive terms, or the reference list at the end of
      this book has some good options.

                            An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it

Interactive Activity: How does the information on this page fit with
your understanding of appropriate language?

This activity asks students to type their response to the following prompts in a text box: What did you learn
from these resources? How has your understanding of language use changed?
                                                                            LANGUAGE TO USE WHEN TALKING ABOUT DISABILITY | 21

   The next slide asks the following question:
True or false? All autistic people are the same.
The correct answer is false. Every autistic person is different, just as every neurotypical person is different.
We all have different support needs, capacities and abilities.

   Key Takeaways

          · When talking about a disabled person, it good practice to check whether they prefer
             identity-first or person-first language when talking about their disability. Eg. Do they
             prefer to say "I am autistic" or "I have autism".

          · Be aware of outdated terms when talking about disability.
          · To ask someone how to talk about their disability, you might say "How would you like

             me to refer to (or not refer to) your disability?". Or you could also ask "What language do
             you use when talking about your disability?".
          · Develop an understanding of autism specifically and the language preferences of the
             autistic community.

HOW DO YOU LEARN BEST?

   Learning Objectives

     After completing this chapter, you will:
          · Be able to consider your strengths and challenges when working with others.
          · Have an understanding of some suggestions for growth.

     You will also have completed the following activities:
          · A learning styles quiz
          · A Welcome to Me resource and
          · A Group Strengths quiz

     Introduction:

       Now that you understand some of the key terms to use when looking at disability, we're
       going to have a look how you might learn effectively.

       We all learn in different ways and have different strengths and weaknesses. Thinking
       about our strengths and weaknesses can help us in identifying what we do well and areas
       where we may need to improve. For example, you may be great at planning, but really
                                                                                                            HOW DO YOU LEARN BEST? | 23

  struggle to start writing a task. Or you may learn better when information is given to you
  verbally.

  Have a think about some of your strengths as a learner. What activities excite you? Do you
  prefer visual, auditory or kinesthetic (touch-based) learning? Do you enjoy presenting in
  front of a group of people?

  It's okay if you don't know yet; this chapter will help you find out!

Interactive Activity: Learning Styles Quiz

Your first activity is to complete a free learning styles quiz. This quiz is important because we all
learn in different ways. Knowing your learning style will help you figure out how you learn best
and allowing you to ask for help if your team is not supporting your learning needs.

It will take about 5 minutes to complete. All you need to do is put your gender, age
range and reason for completing the quiz (put which reason feels best). Then start the
quiz.

At the end of the quiz, there is an option to input your email address to receive a copy of your

results. Please be aware that this link is hosted by a third-party site and providing your
email address is not required in order to access the results
24 | HOW DO YOU LEARN BEST?

     Complete the quiz, at the Learning Style Quiz website.
     Once you have your results, read through them and reflect on these prompts:

          · Is there anything you are surprised about?
          · What did you learn about yourself?

     No one learning quiz will perfectly capture who you are as a person, but the more you reflect on
     your abilities and strengths, the better you will understand yourself. Knowing your strengths,
     weaknesses and areas for growth are incredibly valuable, not only at university, but also when
     you go into the workforce.

   Interactive Activity: Welcome to Me

    Welcome to Me is a resource for you to fill out to reflect on who you are as a person
    and what you need to succeed. Try to be as detailed as possible.
    At the end, download and save the document for you to refer back to, and for sharing
    the information you feel comfortable to with your teammates. This might include
    things like communication preferences, availability for meetings, any challenges with
    working with others, or anything else you think is important to consider when
    working with others.

Further Information:

For further information about how different brains might think, have a look through the
article below which discusses different autistic thinking styles. Specifically, it talks about
visual thinkers, verbal/logic thinkers and pattern thinkers. It also talks about the
differences between bottom-up, associative, analytical and lateral thinkers (Silvertant,
2023).

Even if you do not identify as autistic, this could be something you are interested in
learning about when working with others in your team. Feel free to visit the website and
read through in your own time.

INTRODUCTION TO TEAMWORK

   Learning Objectives

          · To understand how teamwork is defined.
          · To reflect on previous experiences of teamwork and consider ways to improve for the

             future.

     Teamwork

       Over the course of your engineering degree and in your future carer (wherever that may
       be), you will be working in teams.
       For this resource we define teamwork as 2 or more people working collaboratively and
       effectively together to achieve a common goal.

       In your degree this may look like a team project with more than 4 people, or it may be pairs
       or teams of 3 for practical's and class work. More information about the types of work you
       will be completing in your team is in the next chapter.
       Sometimes you will have positive experiences in your team, and sometimes you may have
       negative, or more challenging experiences. This resource is designed to help scaffold some
       of the situations you may face working with others and provide you with some supports to
       navigate this.
36 | INTRODUCTION TO TEAMWORK

       Sometimes it can be frustrating to work in a team, especially with people you may not
       know. However, it is a very important skill to learn and something that will serve you well in
       your future carer. No person ever works in isolation, so it is important to develop your
       skillset.

Activity Text Version

Interactive Activity: Your 4-year Engineering degree

This activity will give you an example roadmap for the different activities a student will
undertake over the course of a 4-year engineering degree. Students will experience similar
learning activities in other vocational degrees.
Students are then invited to click on a bubble which tells them about a part of their degree, or
involves an interactive activity. The content is presented sequentially here.

First Year:

In first year, you will focus on learning some of the key teamwork skills needed throughout
your course and when you graduate. The unit team will try to help you understand where you
currently are with regards to your teamwork skills, as well as what it takes to be a good team
member. Working through these modules is part of that. Teamwork in first year will be more
structured, but make sure you take advantage of incidental teamwork in seminars and
workshops to improve your skills. Your teams are also more likely to be specified in first year
(eg. your lecturers may assign you to teams rather than you choosing your own).

True/ false question 1:

    1. The teamwork skills you learn in first year will help set you up for success in later years.
The correct answer is true- Well done! It's important to start developing skills in first year so
you have a baseline for the rest of your degree.

Second year:

In second year, you will focus on strengthening the skills you have started to develop. You will
see a lot more self and peer reviews which are designed to help you reflect on how you can
improve your teamwork skills. Make sure you come back and look over the activities in this
resource to help you in this year.

Multiple choice question 1:

    1. Which of the following is true regarding self and peer reviews?
        a. Self and peer reviews are designed to make extra work for students.
        b. Self and peer reviews help to reflect on an individuals skills and contribution to the
        project.
        c. Reviews don't improve teamwork skills.
40 | YOUR 4-YEAR DEGREE

     The correct answer is b) Self and peer reviews help to reflect on an individual's skills and
     contribution to the project.

    Third and Fourth Year:

     In third and fourth year, you are reaching the final stages of your degree, and we expect you
     will be working with more autonomy. You are more likely to work in multi-disciplinary teams at
     this point, similar to what will happen when you move into the workplace. It is important by
     this point that you know your strengths and weaknesses, particularly where you are defining
     team tasks. The teaching teams will expect you to ensure that, where necessary, you assign
     yourselves and your team mates tasks that sit within their discipline.

    Types of tasks you'll complete:

     Now you have an understanding of what you might expect in each year of your degree, click
     through the next bubbles to learn about some of the different tasks you'll be completing.

    True/false question 2:

         1. You will be expected to complete all of your group work with the same people each time.
     The correct answer is false- That's right! There will many opportunities to work with different
     peers in group tasks.

    Labs and Pracs:

     Throughout your studies, you will engage in labs and pracs, generally completing the lab as a
     team. It is important that the whole team engages in the task so everyone has an
     understanding of the content, and also experiences working together as a group. Many
     students comment that they learn a lot during practical activities as they develop first-hand
     experience of what they have been learning.

    Workshops and Seminars:

     Students at all year levels will participate in various workshops and seminars that will
     sometimes require teamwork. Much of this is incidental, that is, you will be asked to work with
     other people you happen to be sitting with. These sessions are designed to develop skills such
     as leadership, communication, and collaboration, essential for success in the engineering field.
     They give you an opportunity to practice some of the skills you will need in your more formal
     assessments.
                                                                                                                    YOUR 4-YEAR DEGREE | 41

Peer Review:

Throughout your course you are likely to encounter peer review multiple times. In most
instances, you will be asked to rate the performance of yourself and team members. It is
important to be honest in this process because, as you progress, you will be asked to use these
opportunities to reflect on how you interact with a team and how you are improving in this
respect. You will also sometimes be asked to comment on other student's work. This is often
done as a way to get some constructive feedback before the teaching team assesses the work.
It is important that you provide constructive feedback- that is, something that is clear, balanced
and focuses on solutions to improve the student's work, rather than just highlighting
shortcomings.

Design Projects:

Deakin University's approach to teaching means you will encounter design projects throughout
your degree at every year level. These will often (but not always) include elements of
teamwork. In these instances, you would be expected to collaborate towards the completion of
a design of build (similar to what you would do in a work environment). You may be expected
to contribute to part of the design, or you may be expected to work as a team in the entire
design process, contributing towards all components of the design. It is important that you and
your team are on the same page for this, particularly with the approach you are going to take.
The outputs of design projects can be variable. You may all need to contribute to a report or
provide a presentation or demonstration of your project. What is most important is ensuring
that whatever form this takes, that it is not just a series of sections "stapled" together. You
want to ensure that the work is properly integrated and flows well. As a team, you should all
review the outputs before they are submitted, so make sure you allow some time for this.

Multiple choice 2:

    1. Select from the following all of the different tasks you will complete as part of your
        4-year degree:
        a. Peer review tasks
        b. Labs
        c. Design Projects
        d. Practical's
        e. Workshops and seminars

The correct answer is all the tasks- That's right! You'll complete all these tasks in your degree.

YOUR FIRST MEETING AS A TEAM

   Learning Objectives

          · To understand what to discuss in your first meeting as a team, and to have resources to
             support this.

     Strategies for your first meeting:

       It can be difficult to navigate your first team meeting. This chapter provides you step-by-
       step instructions to help understand your team members, their interests and establish some
       ground rules for teamwork.
       It is okay to feel anxious or uncertain; you can use these activities to get to know others in
       your team. You may find your teammates feel the same way. Talking about how you feel
       and using some of the strategies identified below might help you overcome feelings of

      anxiety. This activity has been informed by Benavides (2022).
       At the end of this section there is a simple version of these strategies you can download to
       use at your first meeting. The steps are explained in more detail here.
44 | YOUR FIRST MEETING AS A TEAM

         · Strategy 1: Introductions and Icebreakers

                      Ensure everyone introduces themselves and has the opportunity to share
                        something about themselves (eg. Favourite food, hobbies etc.). It is also a good
                        idea to engage in an icebreaker activity (as outlined below), which can help
                        everyone feel comfortable in the team space.

           Ice-breaker Activity

             Ice-breakers are often a dreaded activity in classrooms or teams, but they can be fun.
             Icebreakers are activities designed to `break the ice' between team members, to help ease the
             anxiety team members may be feeling about working with unfamiliar people. The aim is to
             start a conversation, learn something new about your teammates or share a laugh together.
             The activity is designed to put you out of your comfort zone a little bit, but remember, all your
             teammates are feeling just as uncomfortable and apprehensive as you!

             Here are some prompts you might like to consider getting to know your teammates:
                  · What colour socks are you wearing? (This can be a good opportunity to share why you
                     chose those particular socks today, or if there is a story behind your socks).
                  · If you could pick any superpower (eg. super speed, flying, strength etc.), what would it
                      be and why?
                  · What is your favourite animae? (This would only work if everyone watched animae).
                  · If money was not an issue, where is your ideal holiday destination and why?
                  · What are you currently watching on Netflix (or Disney +, or your preferred steaming
                      service)?

             Feel free to come up with any other questions that might help you to get to know your
             teammates better.
                                                                                           YOUR FIRST MEETING AS A TEAM | 45

· Strategy 2: Sharing contact information

         Record the contact details below for each of your team members. It is also
           helpful to discuss preferred mode of communication that you will use as a
           team, eg. Email or a messenger groupchat.

Team Contacts List

Access the PDF template below and have everyone share their preferred contact information.
Decide as a team what your main method of communication will be. Ensure everyone has a
copy of the contacts list.
Team contacts list (PDF)

· Strategy 3: `How Do You Learn Best' chapter resources

         Use the information in the chapter `How do you learn best?' to discuss your
           results from the `Welcome to Me' resource, learning styles quiz, and group
           strengths quiz with your teammates. Mention any specific communication
           needs or accommodations you can make as a team to support each other. Only
           share what you feel comfortable to.

· Strategy 4: Establishing ground rules

         This can form your team charter and can be something everyone refers to
           throughout the project. Ensure everyone signs and has a copy of this team
           charter to refer to throughout the project. Complete the `Ground rules' activity
           below together to determine these rules. Discuss what good teamwork looks
           like.
46 | YOUR FIRST MEETING AS A TEAM

           Ground Rules

           Every team operates according to some rules, but they are often unspoken.
           These can be changed over time as you work together, but establishing a
           starting point is important. This activity will guide you to create some
           strong ground rules you can use as a team to ensure everyone agrees and
           understands the boundaries of the project.

                  · A good starting point would be to consider:
                            Where and when the meeting will take place
                            Methods of communication that will be used
                            Shared aims, goals and outcomes
                            How will the workload be shared
                            Agreement on each member's contribution, commitment to make teamwork
                              successful
                            What you'll do if you don't hear from a team member after a certain number of
                              days
                            Expected standards and behaviour
                            Avoiding plagiarism

             Print this charter so everyone has a copy. Ensure everyone signs it to indicate
             agreement with it.
             Time required: 20-30 minutes

         · Strategy 6: Setting goals and timelines

                   These could be directly related to the assessment task but may also
                                                                                            YOUR FIRST MEETING AS A TEAM | 47

          be about working as a team or other broad goals. Complete `Setting
          and Achieving Goals' below, including the handout to identify aims
          for the team project.

         Establish a rough timeline for each part of the assignment based on the
           timeline suggested by your lecturer. This can be created as a visual planner,
           dates in diaries/ calendars or aligned to trimester dates (eg. Week 1, 2 etc.).

Setting and Achieving Goals

It is important to have goals as a team, so you know what you are working towards, and why
you are working together. Having a goal allows you to know what your focus is and can give
you something to celebrate at the end of the project.

Instructions

    · Brainstorm what you would like to achieve as a team. Start big (e.g. complete the
        assignment), and use the handout below, or the website below to refine your broader
        goals into more manageable ones. You can also find your own way of creating goals if
        something is more suitable.

Goblin tools is a website that can help you to refine your goals.
Time required: 15 - 20 minutes

Note: if you find it overwhelming to look at
the whole task in one go or find yourself

losing motivation over the course of the team project, breaking the task into small,
manageable chunks can be really helpful.

When considering who is responsible for each task, also consider whether
everyone has a fair amount of work. Is one person doing all of the admin work?
How can you share the tasks fairly for everyone?
48 | YOUR FIRST MEETING AS A TEAM

             Here is an example template your team might like to use when creating your goals: Example
             Goal Template (PDF)

         · Strategy 7: Organise your next meeting

                      Organise the next meeting time and location at the end of your first meeting so
                        everyone knows when you will next meet.

             solutions to these challenges.

     Introduction:

       When you first form a team there will always be a period while you are getting to know one
       another and learning how to work together. Settling into your team and learning how to
       work with different members of your team can be tricky.
       Bruce Tuckmans's Team Development Model shown below will help you understand the
       different stages of team development, and some of the challenges you may face in each
       stage.Even if you think that your team is working well, this model can be useful in
       understanding what characterises success in each stage and the skills your team can learn
       along the way and benefit from.
       It is important to understand that working cohesively as a team requires time and input
       from every team member, and rarely happens straight away. Work through this section and
       the activities in the next chapter to develop some solutions and strategies for if your
       teamwork becomes challenging.

Interactive Activity: Stages of Team Formation

This activity invites participants to click along a graph. The graph is labelled `team
effectiveness' on the y axis, and `time' on the x axis. As you move through the five stages of
teamwork there is an initial drop in effectiveness during the `storming' stage, before
increasing as the team moves through the `norming' stage. Team effectiveness reaches the
highest point in the `performing' stage before it drops slightly into the `adjourning' stage.
Students are invited to click along each stage to learn more about them. The stages are as
follow:
Forming:
In this stage the team is getting to know each other. At this stage of the team project, you
may be wondering what you need to do for the project and whether you will fit in with your
team members. You may be feeling anxious, exited or indifferent about the task ahead.
52 | TEAM STAGES

             It is important for everyone to be heard, particularly at your first meeting. This means it is
             everyone's responsibility to ensure each person has the opportunity to speak. This may also
             mean considering alternate methods of communication such writing out information or
             emailing it to the group. More information on communication can be found in the
             `Communication' chapter.

            Storming:

             This is the most challenging phase for teams. Often there is conflict and competition. The
             overall cohesiveness of the group may decrease as disagreements may occur over team goals
             or tasks. This can cause frustration, unease and even anger in team members.
             The next chapter of this resource looks at some of the different challenges you can experience
             in a team, as well as some possible solutions. Working through these activities will be very
             helpful for you in this stage.

            Norming:

             The conflicts have largely resolved by this stage and a sense of unity becomes apparent. There
             is consensus and clarity over everyone's roles, and everyone generally feels comfortable to
             share their thoughts with the group.

            Performing:

             In this stage, the group can effectively deal with problems and is generally working cohesively
             and cooperatively. The project is likely almost ready to submit or be presented and the team is
             able to generate one last push in order to finish.

            Adjourning:

             This is the final stage of the team project, and the main assignment is either already
             completed, or almost completed. At this point, it is a great idea to celebrate your success. Even
             if the project didn't turn out how you wanted, celebrate what you have achieved and reflect
             on what you could do differently next time.
             Work through the `As the Project is Finishing' chapter which has some questions and activities
             to guide reflection. You will also be completing self and peer assessments which will help you
             to develop critical reflection skills, helping you to improve your abilities and skills for future
             projects.

Key Takeaways

· Teams rarely experience no conflict or challenges. Being aware of the various stages your
   team might move through can help you to consider these challenges before they occur
   and allow you to reflect on them.

   Learning Objectives

          · Learn about the different challenges you might face when working in a team and
             develop some possible solutions.

     Challenges in Teamwork

       Regardless of the career you choose and irrespective of where you work (location) or who
       you work for (for yourself or for an employer), it is highly likely that you will work in a team
       environment. Working in a team environment often comes with its own challenges.
       Additionally, you will have the challenge of working through and delivering on your tasks. In
       this chapter, you will learn about a few challenges (problems) that you might face, how to
       overcome those challenges and develop important teamwork skills.

Interactive Activity: Challenges and Solutions

This activity lists 12 challenges of groupwork and students are invited to click on each
challenge to learn about possible solutions.
Challenge 1:
Navigating social interactions as the team gets to know each other and decide on roles within
the team.
Possible Solutions:

    · Each member sharing the "Welcome to Me" resource and discussing as a team
        everyone's communication styles and preferences and how these can be met.

    · Learn about any specific learning styles in your group- eg. Neurodivergence, mental
        illness, physical illness, and discuss what you can do to help make the space more
        inclusive for everyone. Remember: some people may not feel comfortable disclosing
        personal information about themselves. It is important to respect this, and instead
        focus on ways you can help everyone feel included.

    · Discussing the different roles in the group project and who might take on which role.
56 | CHALLENGES OF TEAMWORK

                  · Reducing the demands of social communication by keeping in person meetings short or
                      offering alternative communication options (such as messaging).

             This challenge is common at the start of the teamwork project.

            Challenge 2:

             Scheduling problems- it may be challenging to find a time for the team to meet, or it may feel
             like one person is always compromising.

             Possible Solutions:

                  · Consider using different options for meetings- zoom, messenger chats or email and try
                      to be respectful of the different schedule's others may have. Also look at online
                      collaboration tools such as Google docs, which can allow multiple people to work on a
                      document at the same time.

                  · Consider sharing your availability with team members at the start of the project so
                      everyone is aware of each other's schedule.

            Challenge 3:

             Different expectations- sometimes some team members are aiming for a high distinction (HD)
             while others may simply be aiming to pass. Or some people might like starting a project early
             while others wait until the last minute.

             Possible Solutions:

                  · Early communication is very important in these situations. Perhaps it is possible to split
                      the assignment into different parts and members of the team who like to do things
                      early can complete that first, and then other members can complete other parts closer
                      to the due date? Ensure you discuss these preferences openly and early with your
                      group mates and keep your goals realistic. Compromise may be necessary in these
                      situations.

                  · If different team members are wanting to achieve different grades, discuss this. Maybe
                      instead of a HD, everyone aims for a Distinction or Credit. Or maybe each person
                      completes a specific part of the project to the standard they want to be marked at.
                      Recognise not everyone will want to put in the same amount of effort as you and
                      instead consider how you can all come to an agreement. This is also likely to require
                      compromise.

                  · You could say to your team "I prefer to start the project early, so I am not rushing to
                     meet the due date. Would it be possible for me to work on the part of the assignment
                     due first so I can start it early?"
                                                                                                CHALLENGES OF TEAMWORK | 57

Challenge 4:
One or two people dominating conversation

Possible Solutions:
    · If you feel confident, politely call out the people who tend to be dominating the
        conversation. If you don't feel confident to do this in front of the team, speak to the
        person at the end of the meeting.
    · Reflect on your own engagement with the group. Are you letting others have a say?

This may become a challenge during the early stages of the group work (the norming stage).

Challenge 5:
Some people not having the opportunity to speak up

Possible Solutions:
    · If you feel your team is not giving you the opportunity to talk, try to talk to one of the
        members one-on-one about your concerns so you have someone who can help you
        when the group comes together. You can also send your team members an email
        expressing your concerns. If you have tried at least 2 different ways to express your
        concerns to the team and it hasn't worked, you can email your unit chair to ask for
        some help, using the email template for a staff member provided in the further
        resources chapter
    · Use phrases such as "could you please repeat that?", "can we pause for a minute, I can't
        hear what anyone is saying", "I noticed you haven't had a chance to speak [insert
        person's name], what do you think about this?" or "I don't understand the issue/
        concept, could someone please explain?".

This may be something that happens early in the team assignment as members are getting to
know each other.

Challenge 6:
Conflicting ideas over the project

Possible Solutions:
    · Brainstorming all the ideas as a team so everyone can share their ideas, before voting
        on the key ideas.
    · Refer back to the team `rules' you created at the start and reflect on whether each
58 | CHALLENGES OF TEAMWORK

                      member is following these `rules'.
             This may be a challenge early in the project when everyone has lots of ideas about the project.

            Challenge 7:

             Team members not completing their tasks.

             Possible Solutions:
                  · Discussing the team `rules' together to ensure everyone clearly understands their part
                      of the assignment.
                  · Using a compassionate approach when talking with and about team members. You
                      may find it frustrating if they are not completing their role, but perhaps there is
                      something else going on for them. Consider whether the meetings have been accessible
                      (see `Making your meeting accessible' in the communication chapter) and the team
                      members role/ task is clear.
                  · If you have tried 2 different ways to solve the problem as a team, you can reach out to
                      the unit chair for support, using the email template for staff members provided in the
                      further resources chapter.

             This is a challenge that may occur early in the group project, or it may be something that
             comes on as the project progresses.

            Challenge 8:

             Team members disengaging or not replying to communications.

             Possible Solutions:
                  · Reach out to unresponsive members (using different medians- email, Messenger- if
                      possible). See the template for emailing a team member in the further resources
                      chapter. If you are still unable to reach them, consider discussing the problem with a
                      staff member.
                  · If you are a team member who finds it difficult to reply to emails, ensure you
                      communicate this to your peers. Perhaps if they want to reach you, a voice message is
                      easier. Discussing this as early as possible is the best way to avoid any
                      miscommunications, or emails being missed.

             This might be a problem as the assignment progress and team members become busy with
             other assignments or lose track of email communications.
                                                                                                CHALLENGES OF TEAMWORK | 59

Challenge 9:
Not much focus on the task- Team members can easily become sidetracked.
Possible Solutions:

    · It can be helpful to identify priorities for each meeting so that team members focus on
        these goals rather than becoming distracted with any conflict. This may look like a `to
        do' list each meeting.

Challenge 10:
Uneven contributions- Sometimes it may seem like team members are not contributing to the
project as much as others which can cause frustrations and tensions.
Possible Solutions:

    · Ensure you set up clear role expectations in the first few meetings, so everyone has an
        equal role in contributing to the project. If members are not completing their tasks, be
        respectful when discussing this with them and use a compassionate approach to
        understand their reasoning. (They may not understand their role and be afraid to ask
        for help).

Challenge 11:
"Groupthink"- this is a concept that occurs when team members agree with other members to
avoid any conflict. This can mean ideas are missed or some team members feel frustrated
their ideas aren't heard.
Possible Solutions:

    · It is helpful to brainstorm (or mind map) lots of possible ideas and then work as a group
        to evaluate which ideas are most suitable. It is also good to acknowledge the value in
        considering unconventional ideas that may initially seem too difficult or unreasonable.

    · Break the task into smaller sections and focus on them one at a time.

Challenge 12:
Feelings of regret as the project ends.
Possible Solutions:

    · Holding one final group meeting to reflect on the work you've done together and
        acknowledge your efforts.
60 | CHALLENGES OF TEAMWORK

                  · Have an informal catch-up, such as getting pizza or going for coffee, to provide a
                      relaxed environment to debrief.

                  · It can also be helpful to complete the individual reflection or add your thoughts to the
                      keep, stop, start padlet, which will help you to reflect on your experiences.

          Interactive Activity: Now it's your turn!

             Prompt to reflect on: Think about the challenges and solutions in the previous activity. Do you
             think they were helpful to consider? What are some other challenges you can think of? What
             are some solutions?

 may be struggling?

  Based on the challenges discussed above, and your own experience working in teams,
  reflect on the following prompt- What are some signs your team may be struggling?
  Consider the overall productivity of the group, interactions with group members and what
  the overall quality of your project might look like.
  You are welcome to add your reflections to the Mentimeter activity and reflect on what
  others have shared. Consider whether some of the solutions discussed in the activity above
  may be of benefit if you notice your team struggling.
  Note, the numerical code for the Mentimeter activity won't work, so you will need to use
  the QR code on the page instead.
  Access the Mentimeter Activity website.

  The next chapter will provide some activities you can use to navigate disagreements as well
  as activities that may help develop your teamwork skills.

Key Takeaways

     · You will understand some of the different challenges you may experience in a team and
        be able to list possible solutions.

     · You will be able to reflect on what it might look like if your team is struggling.

Remember: Sometimes there are elephant-sized problems (really big problems), and sometimes
there are ant-sized problems (small problems). What may seem like an ant problem to you
62 | CHALLENGES OF TEAMWORK

     may feel like an elephant problem to someone else in your team.It is important to keep
     this in mind when you are experiencing challenges with those you are working with.

ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN TEAMWORK
SKILLS

Learning Objectives

     · Work through a range of activities with your teammates to scaffold discussions and
        strengthen teamwork skills.

     Getting Started with the Project

         No bad ideas...

          There are no bad ideas when it comes to a team project, right?
          Sometimes it can be challenging to know where to start with your project, so this activity is
64 | ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN TEAMWORK SKILLS

             designed to set you up for success, by allowing the team to have a laugh together and
             generate some ideas for the project.

             For this activity, you will need a whiteboard, a large piece of paper or a digital collaboration
             tool like Google docs.

                  1. As a group, briefly discuss the topic your project is on, or the problem you are trying to
                      solve.

                 2. Using the whiteboard or paper, have everyone write down their worst ideas. This
                      might be something like `copy an existing project', `take a nap' or anything, really! There
                      are only bad ideas!

                 3. Once everyone has written their ideas, step back and have a good laugh.
                 4. Discuss your favourite worst ideas.

             You now have a starting point for your project; you know what you will not be doing/ working
             on as a team which now means you can start brainstorming some good ideas! This activity
             also helps your team to resist the urge to self-censor when it comes to good ideas, because all
             the bad ideas are already on paper.

       The above activity has been informed by Atlassian (n.d).

     Navigating Conflicts

       This activity will help scaffold your discussion if you find yourself disagreeing as a team. If
       you can practice this activity early in the project, you will be better equipped to work
       through disagreement without a heated argument! It can also help you clarify ideas.
                                                                           ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN TEAMWORK SKILLS | 65

    1. Discussing without arguing

     Instructions:
          · Agree the subject the team is to discuss (eg. one person not contributing as much to
             the project).
          · Choose one or two people to present each side of the discussion. The rest of the team
             acts as an audience.
          · While the discussion is held, follow these rules:
                   You can ask for clarification, but you can't disagree with what the other side has
                      said
                   You can point out areas of agreement between the two sides, but you can't point
                      out areas of disagreement.
                   The audience can't intervene in the discussion.
          · After each side has had their chance to mount a case, the audience can join in by asking
             questions. They still can't argue or disagree.

     Suggested time required: 20 - 30 minutes

This next activity will help you to look at both sides of a conversation, so you can consider
the situation from a different angle. The aim is to encourage insight into other person's
point of view.

    2. Making a case for the opposite

     Instructions
     This is a quick and simple way of trying to diffuse arguments between members in a team
     who disagree strongly.

          · The two people who disagree literally swap seats.
66 | ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN TEAMWORK SKILLS

                  · They then take turns to make a case for the opposite point of view (without being
                      sarcastic).

                  · They try to reach a mutually acceptable decision, or to agree to disagree where practical
             Suggested time required: 15 - 20 minutes

       This final activity will help you to weigh up ideas or choose what to do. It is a good way of
       reducing discussions that keep going around in circles.

          3. Pros and cons

             Instructions
                  · List the competing ideas and divide up into pairs (A small group can list pros and cons
                      as a whole group)
                  · Each pair lists the pros and cons of each idea
                  · Each pair then decides, based on the number and strength of the pros and cons, which
                      ideas they think are the best.
                  · You come back together as a whole group, compare results and look for agreement.

             Suggested time required: 15 - 20 minutes.

       These activities can be useful to help you see a problem from a different perspective. Often,
       working in teams requires making a compromise.It can be very difficult and frustrating
       when you are so sure you have the right approach but no one else can see it. In a team, it is
       more important to be able to agree on a solution together than have one person making all
       the decisions, or always getting their way. Working together to resolve a conflict or issue is
       one of the most valuable team skills you can develop.

    Interactive Activity: Communication Differences

     This activity is an interactive book and invites students to read through the following
     information and learn about communication differences.

    Before you begin:

     These interactive activities will give you an understanding of, and insight into communication.
     Specifically, this section covers the different ways we communicate and how neurodivergent
     communication might differ to neurotypical communication.

    How do we communicate?

     Click on the image hotspots to learn more about the main ways we communicate.
     The background image depicts a small, white terrier dog's face looking forward. The hotspots
     are located to the side of his face, on his eyes, nose and his ears, in an anticlockwise order.

          · Written language is also form of verbal communication. This might be emails, texts or
             handwritten reminders. Dogs haven't yet advanced to this form of communication!

          · Eye contact is another form of non-verbal communication.
          · Some of our communication comes from speaking (verbal-communication). This is simply

             the words we are saying. Or, for this dog, it might be barking...
          · Some of our communication is non-verbal- this might be hand gestures, tones, body

             language and facial expressions. Non-verbal communication actually makes up between
             70-90% of the way humans communicate! Or, for dogs, their ears or their tail often give
             an indication of their intentions.
                                                                                                              COMMUNICATION STYLES | 75

Neurodiverse communication:

Click through the follow categories to learn more about how communication may differ
between neurotypical and neurodivergent people.
Neither way is right or wrong; both are perfectly valid methods of communicating. Learning
about communication differences will help you to understand your peers and teammates better
and ultimately help you all to work constructively together.

Stimming:

Stimming or self-stimulating behaviour is common among neurodivergent people. But really,
everyone engages in stimming to some extent.
It can look like the repetitive use of an object, such as flicking a rubber band, picking your
fingers, using a fidget toy, or actions such rocking or jumping.
Neurodivergent people often engage in stimming because it is enjoyable, it can help to reduce
stress and anxiety, or it can help increase or reduce sensory input (e.g. focusing on one object
may help reduce overwhelm associated with a loud environment). For someone with ADHD,
movement may help them focus on what is being said.
Neurotypical expectations around communication usually see stimming or fidgeting as `rude' or
as though the person is not listening. This is not the case at all. Sometimes additional
movement can help neurodivergent people absorb information. The same can also be true for
neurotypical people.
This section was informed by the National Autistic Society (2020).

Eye Contact:

When communicating with someone, there is often an expectation that you will make eye
contact to show you are listening.
However, for neurodivergent people eye contact can be particularly challenging, and some even
describe it as physically painful. This may mean when you are communicating with a group
member, they may prefer not to look you in the eyes. This is not them being rude, rather they
are wanting to give themselves the best chance to process what you are saying to them
(McGlensey, 2016).
If eye contact is something you find challenging, it can be helpful to let your group members
know so they don't have that expectation.
If you are interested in learning more about eye contact and autistic people, check out the blog
post by McGlensey (2016).

Tone:

Autistic people in particular may experience differences with tone. They may find it difficult to
76 | COMMUNICATION STYLES

     interpret the tone of other people, and/or they themselves may speak with a `flat affect' or have
     less changes in their tone when speaking.
     This may mean they miss things like sarcasm or humour in a conversation. Or, when they speak,
     it may seem like they are not interested or engaged.
     When working in your group, use clear and direct language. Listen to their words, not their
     tone.
     If you are interested in learning more about tone, check out the article by Autistic Science
     Person (2021).

    Small talk:

     Neurotypical conversation often begins with small talk, such as questions about the weather,
     how a person's day is going or other neutral topics to ease into the conversation.
     However, neurodivergent people may find small talk confusing, or they may prefer a more
     direct, factual conversation style.
     In your meetings, be mindful of different communication preferences. Instead of traditional
     small talk, maybe you can discuss something you all enjoy or are passionate about. This could
     be the book/movie/tv show you are currently reading/watching, or something interesting you
     are learning about.

    Masking:

     Masking is something that neurodivergent people, or people in a minority group often engage
     in. Sometimes it occurs unconsciously, and sometimes it occurs consciously.
     To some extent everyone engages in masking. For example, being a bit louder and more
     confident with friends, or speaking more formally and politely to grandparents. However, the
     form of masking described here, in the context of neurodivergence and specifically autism, is
     much more pervasive.
     Masking is the process of adapting, changing or hiding ones natural behaviours or way of being
     in order to `fit in' or appear `socially acceptable'.
     For autistic people, masking may look like suppressing stimming behaviours, forcing themselves
     to make eye contact, or ignoring overwhelming sensory stimuli. Long term consequences of
     masking might include exhaustion, maladaptive coping strategies, or burnout.
     Masking is included here so that you can be aware of the importance of creating a safe group
     environment for peers to be themselves. Remember that how a group member presents in the
     project is not necessarily an indication of their functioning. They may leave the group
     environment and sleep for 3 hours because of how draining it was or they may leave and be
     overstimulated from trying to suppress all their energy and movement.
     This section was informed by The Autistic Advocate (n.d)
                                                                                                              COMMUNICATION STYLES | 77

Test your understanding:

Answer the following four questions to test your understanding by selecting either a) or b) as
the correct response.

    1. Eye contact is
        a) something you should expect from everyone in your team.
        b) something some people may struggle with. It is not always necessary in conversation.
        B was the correct answer!

   2. If someone's tone suggests they are not interested in the conversation
        a) don't bother including them; they obviously don't want to know.
        b) listen to their words and focus on those instead.
        B was the correct answer!

   3. Non-verbal communication makes up
        a) 70-90% of the way humans communicate.
        b) 10-30% of the way humans communicate.
        A was the correct answer!

   4. If someone has different non-verbal cues to what you are used to (for example, less eye
        contact, minimal facial expressions),
        a) you will never be able to communicate effectively with them.
        b) that's okay! We all communicate in slightly different ways.
        B was the correct answer!

Well done! Now you've learnt something new!

          It is important to look at the differences between neurotypical and neurodivergent
          communication so we can understand why everyone communicates differently.
          Unfortunately, sometimes we focus on these differences and decide "it's all too hard". This
          can lead to groups lacking understanding and a shared language when working together.
78 | COMMUNICATION STYLES

                Team members can be excluded or ignored and overall, the team experience is generally
                negative.
                So, what can we do about it?

   Interactive Activity: Enhancing Team Communication

     Work through the next activity to look at some ways simple ways you can enhance team
     communication. Remember, clear and direct communication is always the easiest way to ensure
     effective communication. The activity was informed by McCrum (2023) and Hamilton and Petty
     (2023).

Interactive Activity: Enhancing Team Communication

This interactive activity invites students to read the communication tip on each flip card, before
clicking on it, to turn it over and learn more. There are six communication tips to learn about.

1. Use clear and direct language.

Where possible, avoid figures of speech such as "it's raining cats and dogs" as these can be
interpreted literally. Sarcasm is not something everyone can understand.
Also try to avoid `hidden agendas'. If you need something from someone, explaining clearly
what you need.

2. Understand different types of non-verbal communication.

While the person may not be looking at you, or may appear disinterested, it is important to
remember this could be their normal behaviour. There are also different ways we communicate
non-verbally, and non-verbal communication may not always mean what we think. Listening to
the person's words is most important.

3. Allow additional time to process information especially during meetings
or when asking questions that require comments or answers.

Sometimes people might need more processing time.
Similarly, if someone is talking you, be patient and give them time to share their thoughts.

4. Be specific and clear about any issues or challenges you have with a
team member.

Clearly and politely explain the problem and ensure the other person understands what you
have said. Even though it may seem obvious to you, the other person may not see the problem.
Most people, neurotypical or neurodivergent, can be sensitive to criticisms or corrections.

5. Consider the different learning needs in your team.

Complete reliance on written assessments can be challenging for someone with dyslexia. If
someone discloses this in your team, they may feel more comfortable working on a part of the
assignment that involves less writing.
Similarly, someone may prefer to take notes by hand instead of a laptop, or vice versa. Be aware
of simple accommodations you can make to best support your whole team.
80 | COMMUNICATION STYLES

    6. Reflect on your own biases and understandings.

     Consider whether you have any particular biases about the people you are working with. This
     could be anything from their gender, their race, their neurotype, or their age. Consider whether
     this may be affecting (positively or negatively) how you interact with your teammates.

    Interactive Activity: Test Your Understanding

     This multiple-choice activity asks the following question:
     Which two of the following are not beneficial ways of communicating with a team member?

         1. Communicating what you find challenging when working in a team so other members
             understand why something might be harder for you.

         2. Not communicating with someone in your team because they never sound interested in
             the project.

         3. Expecting an immediate answer when you are talking to someone.

   4. Considering whether you are being inclusive of all team members, even if they seem
        `different' to yourself.

The correct answers are 2 and 3. Well done!

MAKING MEETINGS ACCESSIBLE

   Learning Objectives

          · Have an understanding of what you can do to make your meetings more accessible for
             every team member.

     What to Consider:

       While you are working with your team to plan your meeting, it can also be helpful to think

      about ways to make the meeting inclusive and accessible for all members. Use the
      following questions as prompts to either reflect onindividually ordiscuss as a
      group whether they wouldbenefityourteam.

       These questions have been adapted from The Autism NOW Center (2013).

            · Is the meeting space accessible to everyone?
                      Ensure the meeting space can be easily accessed (eg. easy for everyone to find
                        and physically easy to get to), has comfortable seating options, and there are
                        minimal distractions (eg. it is in a quiet area and the room itself does not have
                        lots of busy decorations). Choosing somewhere central like the library or the
                        engineering building is usually a good start.
                                                                                             MAKING MEETINGS ACCESSIBLE | 83

· Does everyone know what the meeting will be about prior to arrival?

         Eg. Someone sends email or message in the group chat reminding everyone
           about the upcoming meeting and what will be discussed/ what the aim of the
           meeting is.

         Hint: if you discuss what will be covered at the next meeting each time you
           meet, this will already be covered!

         Understanding the purpose or the meeting also helps keep the group focused
           and on task and reduces uncertainty for those who like structure.

· Have you made sure there are breaks during the meeting?

         Especially if they are longer than an hour, sitting for long periods of time can be
           challenging for some people and decreases overall productivity.

         Accessing the Pomodoro timer website and using the timer there can be
           helpful to keep meetings on track and maximise productivity.

· Has everyone had the opportunity to share their thoughts?

         Some people may prefer to write something down instead of talking.
         If you notice someone hasn't had a chance to speak, find a way to include them

           in the conversation so they can have their voice heard. Some people don't like
           being put on the spot, so it may be better to talk to them 1-1 during a break, or
           after the meeting.

· Is the meeting environment free from strong scents, loud noises and harsh
   lighting?

         Be aware of the sensory environment for the meeting. This can include any
           strong scents such as perfumes, loud noises, or fluorescent lighting which may
           be uncomfortable for some team members.

· Is the discussion moving too quickly for everyone to keep up?

         As a group, be mindful of the speed of discussion. Sometimes talking really fast
           can be difficult for other members to keep up with, meaning they miss lots of
           information.

         At various points, it is good practice for a team member to briefly summarise
           the key points that have been raised so the whole group can understand.

· Are you ensuring all forms of communication are accepted?
84 | MAKING MEETINGS ACCESSIBLE

                      Remember everyone communicates in different ways: not everyone is
                        comfortable with eye contact, some people have a flat affect (not outwardly
                        indicating emotions), some people stim to regulate, some love to engage in
                        small talk throughout a meeting. These differences are all valid and important.

                      Look over the previous chapter titled `Communication Styles' to deepen your
                        understanding of this topic and reflect on any biases you may be holding
                        towards your teammates.

            · If the meeting is online, have you discussed considerations as a team?
                      If your meeting is online, consider what you can do to help everyone have a
                        chance to speak. Do you use the raise hand function on zoom, nominate one
                        person to run the meeting each time or use the chat function predominantly?
                        Online meetings often require a few additional considerations, as opposed to in
                        person meetings.
                      Have a discussion as a team about what you might all need when meeting
                        online, or any suggestions that may help. Also consider discussing whether
                        everyone will have their cameras on, if everyone has a working microphone
                        and whether the meeting will be recorded if other team members are unable to
                        attend.

       you want your own copy for reference: Making Meetings Accessible Checklist

   Key Takeaways

          · It is important to consider different needs when having a team meeting. Have a think
             about what you can do to help make others feel comfortable and also what you might
             need from others in your team.

SELF-ADVOCACY

   Learning Objectives

          · To understand what self-advocacy is and some ways to apply it to your life.
          · To understand what self-care is and reflect on how you look after yourself.

     Self- Advocacy

      Self-advocacy is how we communicate our needs, wants and rights to access
      required accommodations or support (Hoey, 2024). Self-advocacy is important for
      everyone to understand to ensure they receive the appropriate support. No one
      else knows what you need better than yourself. So, recognising the reasonable
      accommodations you may need when working with others or in day-to-day life is
      an important skill to develop.

Learn more about each tip by expanding the arrows:

1. Understand how your brain works
     · Do you prefer visual, auditory, or written communication?
     · Do you find yourself wanting to move around often?
     · Do you find it challenging to talk to others?
     · When you understand how your brain functions you are in a much better position to
        think about what your needs are. If you are unsure how your brain works you can use
        the `Welcome to Me Resource' (found in the chapter `How do you learn best?), ask
        family and friends for their thoughts, complete the provided learning quizzes or use
        Google to learn about the different ways people learn.

2. Know what reasonable accommodations you can ask for.
     · Do you prefer all communication to be written down?
     · Do you need a summary after each meeting?
     · Do you need more stepped instructions?
88 | SELF-ADVOCACY

            · Would it be more helpful if the team met online? In a quieter space?
            · Think about what might help make the team project more manageable for you. This

                does not mean you do less work than your teammates, but it might mean
                information is presented in such a way that it is easier for you to do your role. Talk to
                the Disability Resource Centre (DRC) about what specific accommodations may be
                available to you.

       3. Know who to talk to about any supports or accommodations

            · If you do not feel comfortable talking face-to-face to your team members about the
                accommodations you need, you can email or message them after the meeting with a
                written version.

            · Also know the DRC is available to support you if you need, as is the Diversity, Equity
                and Inclusion team. Links to all of these resources are available in the next chapter.

            · Talking to your lecturers is also beneficial, especially if the accommodations you are
                asking for will be helpful for you to have in the classroom too.

       4. Be polite but firm

            · Continue to advocate for yourself in the team project in a polite but firm manner. If
                your team members are not respecting the reasonable accommodations you have
                made, you can discuss the situation with your tutor or unit chair.

            · Before you go to your tutor or unit chair, ensure you have tried at least 3 times to
                advocate within your group. This may also include bringing a support person along to
                meetings or discussing the challenges with friends outside of the unit.

            · Learning the skills to advocate for yourself is incredibly important so do ensure you
                try yourself first. However, it is also important to be able to ask for help if you are
                unable to access the supports you need on your own.

       5. Practice

            · Without practice, you will not be able to build your skills. It can be scary at first, but
                the more you advocate for what you need, the easier it will be become, and the more
                comfortable you will feel advocating for yourself in different environments.

            · You can look through the reference list to find some more information, as well as
                using the email templates in the `Further Resources' chapter.

       Sometimes it can be difficult to know when, or if you need accommodations or supports, or
       if your rights are being supported by other students in your team. If you are unsure, or you
                                                                                                                        SELF-ADVOCACY | 89

feel as though you are not supported in your team, it is best to talk to your lecturer or unit
chair about how you are feeling.

Self-Care

Self-care encompasses any activates that feel good for you and have your wellbeing at
heart. For some people this might be playing with a pet, exercising or catching up with
friends. Self-care can also involve things we may not always want to do but are often
necessary to maintain our health and wellbeing. This might be getting enough sleep, eating
well, taking time to rest or visiting your doctor.
It is important to focus on the things you enjoy and to recharge your battery, particularly if
you find working in a team environment or communicating with others challenging.
We have shared a few strategies that have worked for us throughout this book, think about
what self-care looks like for you and feel free to share strategies that work for you.

    Interactive Activity: Add Your Contribution to the Word Cloud

     Reflect on the questions `What does self-care look like for you?'
     If you would like to, add your anonymous contribution to the Word Cloud.

   Key Takeaways

          · Self-advocacy and self-care are both vital parts of working in a team. It is important to
             ensure your needs are met, and you are looking after yourself.

     These are some of the words you may have come across in this chapter:

IF YOU NEED HELP

What help is available to you?

Your peers:

     · Discuss any problems with other teammates and peers to see if you can produce a
        solution together. You may need to be creative with your solutions; the chapters on
        `Challenges of Teamwork' and `Activities to Strengthen Teamwork Skills' can offer
        some guidance.

Your unit site:

     · Here you can access the Discussion Board where you can post questions about the
        assignment (and see answers to other students' questions too).

     · You can also access assignment information, the rubric and all your content here.
        Ensure you read the assignment information documents and rubric to see what is
        required.

     · The unit guide will give you an overview of all the assignments for the unit, as well as
        their due dates.

     · If you are needing an extension, or to apply for special consideration, more
        information can be found via the Deakin Life Blog.

Staff members:

     · This might include your lecturer or unit chair.
92 | IF YOU NEED HELP

            · When contacting staff, try to do so during business hours (9am-5pm Monday to
                Friday) using the email address on the unit site.

            · Allow at least 3 working days for the staff member to reply. If you have not heard
                anything after that, you can send a follow up email.

                emails you send to a staff member.

            · You can request a meeting with a staff member to discuss any concerns in person by
                sending them an email. When meeting a staff member, you can take notes, or your
                project work in with you. You can also go as a group. It is helpful to write down/ have
                typed some record of what you want to discuss, particularly if you are worried you
                will forget something.
