PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

What is This Book About?

This online textbook has two goals:

    1. To help readers find information in places, mostly online, where they usually don't
          look, and

    2. To help readers evaluate the credibility of the information they find.

Who is This Book For?

Although we wrote this textbook for a required college-level journalism course, anyone who
navigates information on the Internet can benefit from the concepts and skills presented
here.
The primary audience for this book are students in Journalism 302: Infomania, a course we
teach at the University of Kansas. When they take this class, these students usually are in their
second or third semesters in the William Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Commu-
nications. They have varied career aspirations. A few of them want to be "traditional" jour-
nalists, writing for online news sites, magazines, or newspapers. Some of them want to be
broadcast journalists. Many of them want to work in strategic communications, which encom-
passes public relations, advertising, marketing, and related fields.

Why Did We Write This Book?

The Journalism 302 course was conceived originally as an introduction to journalistic research
2  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

methods. It is also a companion to a media writing course in which students learn the con-
ventions of presenting the information they gather. The initial goal of the course was to teach
students who do their research almost exclusively with Google and Wikipedia, to become
familiar with other information sources, like scholarly and business databases.

Journalism 302 also is designated by the university as a critical thinking course. This means
that students are expected to reflect on their own thinking, to question their assumptions,
and to support their arguments with evidence. Students are challenged to identify their own
information needs, and to examine the credibility of their sources within the context of their
current and future work as professional communicators.

Over time, and in conversations with colleagues at the University of Kansas Libraries, it
became clear that Journalism 302 is an information literacy course. Information literacy,
according to the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) definition, is about how
individuals find information, understand its sources and structure, evaluate it critically, and
use it responsibly (or don't use it). Information literacy has been a key concern for library and
information scientists for several decades. In our case, ACRL's concept that the authority of
information is constructed and contextual aligned well with the concept of credibility, which
had become a unifying theme in the Journalism 302 course.

To teach information literacy and journalism practice, we needed a textbook that would
deconstruct the process of judging the credibility or authority of sources, and that would
align with the professional standards of journalism. As we searched for textbooks and other
instructional materials, however, we concluded that there wasn't anything on the market that
met our students' needs and the goals of this class.

This textbook, therefore, is the result of a collaboration between journalism and library fac-
ulty. It is an illustration of what happens when concepts developed in library science and
instruction get applied to a specific field, in this case, journalism education. Our overarching
intent in writing this book was to help undergraduate journalists develop the skills and a skep-
tical stance for accessing, evaluating, and using information, and in the process, to build their
own authority as credible communication practitioners.

What Is in This Book?

The book is structured chronologically and topically, using the order in which concepts and
skills are presented in the Journalism 302 course.

The first section focuses on the research process by breaking down the concepts and skills
BE CREDIBLE  3

that are essential to assessing and contextualizing the authority of information. To begin,
we define and explore the concept of credibility as it relates to practicing journalism. In the
next chapters, we walk readers through the fundamentals of developing a topic, using search
strategies, collecting evidence, and attributing the sources of information in writing.

Section 2 covers several approaches to evaluating the credibility of sources. We reinforce the
link between evaluating sources and students' own credibility, by encouraging students to
approach every source with the question, "If I use this source in my writing, will it contribute
to or diminish my own credibility?" Over four chapters, and a chapter on bias, we deconstruct
and present several methods for engaging in the credibility assessment process. We provide
step-by-step instructions and examples of identifying specific credibility cues, collecting evi-
dence, conducting the assessment, and presenting a conclusion. Our methods are based on
those presented in the 2017 online textbook, Web Literacy for Student Fact-Checkers by Mike
Caulfield, and in the 2010 article, Using a Targeted Rubric to Deepen Direct Assessment of
College Students' Abilities to Evaluate the Credibility of Sources by Erin Daniels, published in
the journal College & Undergraduate Libraries.

Section 3 focuses on several sources of information with which journalism and strategic com-
munication students need to be familiar, and about which they need to develop a critical atti-
tude. We begin where most students begin their research: with Google and Wikipedia. We
discuss the limitations of Google and the dangers of its filter bubbles, in order to prompt stu-
dents to advance their research beyond Google. In the Wikipedia chapter, students learn why
open-sourced encyclopedia is a good place to start but a bad place to stop, and how they can
participate in improving Wikipedia. The remainder of the textbook covers news sources, pub-
lic records, nonprofits as sources, information filed by public companies, research studies,
data, historical sources, and interviews. In each of these chapters, we discuss how journalists
and strategic communication practitioners use these information sources, we provide text
and video instructions on how to access these sources and retrieve information from them,
and we reinforce the process of assessing the credibility, or authority, of these sources.

Credibility is the thread that holds these sections together. As we argue in the first chapter,
credibility is key to a journalist's ability to produce trustworthy news and to a strategic com-
municator's ability to represent and retain clients. Communicators establish their credibility
by critically assessing their sources, and by using only the information that is credible enough
to support their own credibility.

At the end of several chapters, testimonials from professionals who are alumni of our journal-
ism school support the arguments presented in these chapters. In suggested activities at the
end to the chapters, we also invite students to apply their new knowledge, and to contribute
to the textbook by developing tutorials about the book's content. In the spirit of open peda-
4  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

gogy, we hope that with time, we will integrate these tutorials into the textbook's chapters. By
serving as contributors to this book, we hope that students will come to recognize themselves
as credible creators and consumers of information.

Who Helped With This Book?

Several incredible colleagues helped us write this textbook. Our work began as a week-long
Research Sprint, in which we were joined by Carmen Orth-Alfie and Callie Branstiter. During
that week and throughout this project, Carmen and Callie generated insightful ideas, wrote
content, and edited our writing. Their expertise in undergraduate learning and information
literacy helped shape this textbook from beginning to end.

Roseann Pluretti assisted us as a project manager. The textbook's production benefited from
Roseann's organizational skills, and from her practical experience teaching Journalism 302
five times as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.

We were grateful to receive an Open Educational Resources Grant from the University of
Kansas Libraries, which partially funded the production and promotion of this textbook. Josh
Bolick and Ada Emmet in the Schulenburger Office of Scholarly Communication & Copyright
helped to inspire this textbook's possibility, and supported its creation.

Kerry Benson, Lisa McLendon, Eric Thomas, and Scott Reinardy from the William Allen White
School of Journalism and Mass Communications contributed content, editing assistance, and
administrative support for this project. Jonathan Peters from the Grady College of Journalism
and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia also contributed a chapter.

In the University of Kansas Libraries, Jamene Brooks-Kieffer, Caitlin Donnelly, Angie Rathmel,
Marianne Reed, and Paul Thomas offered ideas for content, wrote chapters, provided feed-
back on drafts, and assisted with the distribution and promotion of the textbook.

Short bios of all contributors are located at the end of the book.

We thank all the students in Journalism 302 and in other classes we have taught, whose work
informed and filled the pages of this text.

What's on the Cover?

The cover photo comes from a folder of historical photos at the Kenneth Spencer Research
BE CREDIBLE  5

Library that feature University of Kansas journalism students. It was taken in the early 1950s.
An inscription on the back reads, "Students testing out the old Washington hand press in the
typography lab, west end, 2nd floor, Flint Hall." The press itself is now archived at the Spencer
Research Library.

Only two of the five students pictured in the photo have been identified. Furthest left is Shirley
Piatt (later Shirley Frizzell), KU class of 1954. She was one of the first women to serve as editor-
in-chief of the University Daily Kansan, and went on to a career in public relations at Cessna,
The Wichita Eagle, and Wichita State University.

Furthest right is Rich Clarkson, KU class of 1956, who became an award-winning sports pho-
tographer. The Clarkson Gallery, which is located in the west end of the first floor in Stauffer-
Flint Hall, is named in his honor.

We hope that this book can help our students pursue fruitful careers as credible communica-
tions professionals, akin to their predecessors pictured in this photo.

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Demonstrate an understanding of professional licensing.
         Explain the role of credibility in journalism and communications professions.
         Link the professional credibility of communication professionals to the credibility of
            their sources.

Licensing and the Professions

To understand better the reasons for why you are reading this book, let's think about profes-
sional licenses.
Many professional fields require individuals to obtain licenses before they can begin employ-
ment in those fields. The way this works is that a license-granting entity like a state agency
or a professional association sets a standard for what it takes to become a professional in
a particular field. Through a licensing process, this entity then ensures that only people who
meet this standard are allowed to practice in that profession. The standard often consists of
specialized education and the successful completion of an exam.
8  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

For instance, when someone wants to become a lawyer, she goes to law school and takes a
bar exam. If she passes it, she is admitted to the bar by a bar association (that is, the licensing
entity for the legal profession), which means that she is licensed to practice law in a particular
jurisdiction. Similarly, when someone wants to become a physician, he goes to medical school
and then takes a series of licensing exams. If he passes these, he is certified as a physician by
a medical board. If someone wants to be a barber, he goes to barber school and then takes
a barber licensing exam. If he passes it, he is licensed to practice barbering. Pilots, architects,
public school teachers, accountants, engineers, real estate agents, and many other profes-
sionals all need licenses before they can legally practice their chosen professions.

The license is an indicator of trust. By granting a license, the licensing entity vouches that the
license holder is competent in her field, and that the public can trust this individual to per-
form the skills she is trained to perform. A licensed attorney can be trusted to represent his
clients, a certified physician can be trusted to diagnose and treat her patients, and a licensed
barber can be trusted to cut his clients' hair.

Conversely, when a professional does something that breaks this trust-when a lawyer acts in
a way contrary to the accepted standards for lawyerly behavior, for example-the license can
be taken away. The revoking or non-renewing of a license can have very real consequences
for an individual: She can no longer practice in the profession she trained for and may need
to find a new way to support herself and her family.

Licensing in Communications Professions

So what about getting a license to become a communications professional like a journalist,
broadcaster, public relations practitioner, advertiser, or marketer? What are the license-grant-
ing organizations for individuals pursuing these professions? What specialized education and
exams are required before one is certified to practice in one of these fields?

All of these are trick questions because in the United States, communications professionals
do not get certified or licensed. There is no barrier to entering these professions. Nothing
stops you from printing a bunch of business cards right now and identifying yourself as a pub-
lic relations practitioner or as a broadcaster. If you do identify yourself as a member of these
professions, you are not breaking any laws, nor are you usurping the power of any organiza-
tions that would designate you as a licensed professional through a licensing process.

That sounds pretty great, right? If you choose to continue pursuing a career in communica-
tions, you won't have to study for a fancy exam to get certified as a journalist or a PR practi-
tioner. Is there a downside to this? Well, think about the public: a license signifies to the public
BE CREDIBLE  9

(that is, potential clients), that they can trust a plumber, esthetician, or pilot. In the case of the
communications professions, what signifies to the public that they can trust a journalist, PR
practitioner, or advertising professional?

The answer is, credibility. Credibility is the license to practice communication.

A credible professional communicator will have an audience or clients who trust the infor-
mation she conveys, enabling her to make a living in this profession. Do you know anyone
who only turns on the news at a certain time because that's when a specific news anchor or
weather forecaster is on TV? (If you grew up in Kansas City, you might be thinking of people
who religiously tune in to see Gary Lezak's weather forecast.) TV audiences place deep trust
in their favorite news personalities to present the news or weather to them. As you pursue
a communications profession, it's that level of credibility--the credibility that favorite news
anchors and weather forecasters exude--that you want to strive to achieve.

Guidance on Professional (and Credible) Conduct

A credible communicator demonstrates through her work that she meets the qualifications
and standards of her profession. But how does she know what the professional standards
are? Although the professional organizations for communicators do not issue licenses like bar
associations and medical boards, these organizations do articulate the standards that profes-
sional communicators are expected to observe. So if you are looking for guidance on how to
build your credibility, look up the professional organization that corresponds to your commu-
nications career.

If you are thinking about print or online journalism, magazine journalism, and broadcast jour-
nalism, the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) is your professional organization. In its
Code of Ethics, SPJ charges professional journalists to "seek truth and report it," and to "be
accountable and transparent" in order to build trust with the public and establish a credi-
ble reputation. Are you leaning more toward strategic communications, like advertising? If
so, then the American Advertising Federation (AAF) is your professional organization. Its Insti-
tute for Advertising Ethics follows the same logic on credibility as the SPJ. It prizes "a common
objective of truth and high ethical standards" as one of its eight pillars of practice.

When Credible Professionals Behave Incredibly

Without licenses, how are communications professionals held accountable for their profes-
sional conduct? Communicators' professional organizations charge their members with being
10  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

accountable to themselves and to one another in upholding their credibility. SPJ, for example,
dictates that journalists quickly correct their own inaccuracies, and "expose unethical conduct
in journalism, including within their organizations." As a result, a professional communicator
who lacks credibility may have trouble keeping employed in her chosen field.

There are many examples of journalists and other professional communicators being
expelled from their fields after losing credibility in the eyes of their peers and the public.
Stephen Glass's peers, for instance, ousted him from journalism after they discovered that
Glass falsified an article, "Hack Heaven," for the magazine The New Republic (TNR). As The
New York Times reported, Glass's peers at TNR trusted him in part because he was a hard-
working, former fact-checker for the magazine. But since his fall from grace 20 years ago, he
has been unable to work as a journalist or a lawyer (he got a law degree after leaving TNR).
All told, Glass had completely fabricated not only "Hack Heaven" but 27 of the 41 articles he
wrote for TNR, as well as articles published in Harper's, Rolling Stone, The New York Times
Magazine, and Mother Jones, as Vanity Fair reported. Glass's lost credibility was the subject of
countless news articles, a movie (Shattered Glass), and his own book.

Stephen Glass broke his colleagues' and his readers' trust when he fabricated information.
The codes of conduct of all professional organizations for communicators agree that making
stuff up violates professional standards. But telling the truth and not fabricating information
is a bare minimum as far as professional standards go. This book focuses on a more nuanced
set of professional standards, that is, the standards relating to the sources that professional
communicators use.

You Are Only as Credible as Your Sources

A communications practitioner's credibility is only as solid as the sources he or she uses.
Much of the work that journalists, public relations practitioners, advertisers, and marketers
do consists of taking information from sources, packaging it, and presenting it to an audience.
In order to produce credible work, communications professionals must be experts at finding
and using credible sources.

Adam Penenberg is the journalist who first uncovered Glass's fabrications in "Hack Heaven."
The research process that led Penenberg to determine that Glass was making up stuff illus-
trates the importance of examining and questioning sources in journalism and in other
communication professions. At the time, Penenberg was an editor for Forbes Digital Tool
(Forbes.com), and considered himself to be pretty knowledgeable about the emerging field of
digital business. When he read Glass's article about a 15-year-old computer hacker success-
BE CREDIBLE  11

fully extorting "money, porn magazines and a sports car" from an Internet company called
Jukt Micronics, Penenberg seriously doubted his own research and reporting skills.

Glass's article seemed like a story Penenberg should have found and written about. He set
out to find more information about it, and began by pursuing the sources that Glass included
in his article. However, after conducting several internet searches, interrogating government
records and officials, and interviewing several hackers, Penenberg could not verify any of the
information that Glass wrote about.

Penenberg eventually forced Glass to admit that the article was complete fiction. By detailing
his research methodology in posts for Forbes Digital Tool, Penenberg illustrated his own cred-
ibility and adherence to professional standards, while cementing Glass's reputation as a hack
journalist.

The process that Penenberg used to uncover Glass's lies is the same process that this book
and the course you are taking will teach you. To become proficient in this process, you will
learn where and how to access sources of information, and how to evaluate whether or not
the sources you are looking at are credible enough for you to use in your work. You are
reading this book because communication professionals must be, first and foremost, experts
at using information sources because their credibility--their license to practice communica-
tion--depends on it.

A Practitioner's View

                              I have worked both as a news reporter and as a public relations
                              professional at a large research university. In both professions,
                              I've always felt that credibility was the most important element to
                              maintain.

If your audiences don't trust you as a source, you've lost everything you're trying to do.

As a news reporter, I used to ask people if they've ever had a news article written about
them. For those that had, they could usually identify one element that was flat incor-
12  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

    rect or missed the mark somehow. People will think, "If they miss these details about
    me, then how can I know the rest of this stuff is accurate?"

    As a public relations professional, I work on many messages that are tailored to pre-
    sent the organization in its best possible light. However, if we were to simply invent
    facts from thin air, it would quickly be discovered and reporters (and the general pub-
    lic) would look elsewhere to get the information they want.

    In many ways the work of a public relations professional is similar to that of a journal-
    ist. Statements need to be vetted and verified before disseminated publicly. The wrong
    information at the wrong time can cause real reputational damage to an institution
    and its bottom line. This is particularly true in a crisis, where information is flowing fast
    and furious.

    The ability to sort good and useful information from the bad is a critical skill.

Activity 1: This Is How Credibility Crashes and Burns

      Recent history is littered with examples of journalists who have undermined their own
      credibility. Here's a partial list:

         Jayson Blair
         Monica Crowley
         Kevin Deutsch
         Sabrina Erdely
         Jonah Lehrer
         Brian Williams

      Public relations practitioners, advertisers, and marketers also regularly lose their cred-
      ibility, but those individuals or agencies usually are not named. What we see instead
      are brands and companies losing their credibility because the communications profes-
      sionals who work for them were not producing credible work. Here's a partial list of
      companies whose credibility took a hit recently:

         Pepsi-Kendall Jenner "tone deaf" advertisement
BE CREDIBLE  13

   Red Bull will "give you wings" lawsuit
   Volkswagen sued for cheating emissions tests

Research the actions and circumstances that led to these individuals' and companies'
loss of credibility. What have been the professional implications of these actions? What
was the role of sources in these individuals' and companies' problems with credibility?

Activity 2: Can I Get a License?

      Do professional organizations for communications professionals engage in licensing?
      Examine the website of one of the professional communications organizations listed
      below, and determine whether or not this organization engages in the licensing or cer-
      tification of its members. If it does issues licenses or certifications, how do these cre-
      dentials differ from the licenses issued by organizations such as like the bar association
      or the barber licensing board?

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Know how to start the research process.
         Develop search phrases and keywords.
         Understand the circular nature of research.

Where to Start With a Research Topic

No matter what you end up doing in the field of communications, many of your daily tasks
will require you to search and re-search information about topics. Common topic categories
that journalists and strategic communicators research include:

      events,
      issues,
      individuals or groups of people,
      businesses other organizations,
      products,
SEARCH AND RE-SEARCH AND RE-SEARCH  15

      behaviors or attitudes.
Finding information about topics will be fundamental to what you do, whether you work for a
television news station, a public relations agency, or a corporate marketing office. Over time,
you may become an expert on some topics that you research regularly. You also may be
called upon to learn about topics in which you have little background. Our goal in this chapter
is to help you think about research topics and how to begin figuring out what a topic is about,
regardless of what the topic is.

There are two ways to enter the search and re-search process: with a topic that someone has
assigned to you, or with a topic that you identify for yourself. In the workplace, it may be more
likely that you will have topics assigned to you by news directors, editors, or managers. While
you're in school, in some classes you will have more leeway to identify research topics, while
in other classes you will have topics assigned to you.

It may seem easier to research topics that you identify yourself, that aren't imposed on you.
This is because your motivation may be higher to find information in which you are intrinsi-
cally interested, than information that others ask you to research and understand. Regardless
of how motivated you are initially to research a specific topic, keep in mind that your credibil-
ity as a communications professional depends on the quality of the information you find and
communicate. The credibility of the information you find, in turn, is shaped by the quality of
your research process, so it's important to begin with sound research.

In this chapter, we discuss a number of expectations to keep in mind as you initially explore a
research topic. It may be worthwhile for you to have a preliminary research topic in mind as
you work your way through these expectations.

Reasonable Expectations

In the following paragraphs, we discuss several expectations about the research process that
novice researchers sometimes miss. Having these expectations at the forefront of your mind
will help you navigate and persevere in the research process.

This is the wheel. Don't reinvent it.

Whenever we are struck by a good idea, including when we come up with an interesting
research topic, it feels like we are inventing something new. Most of the time, however, our
ideas are only original to us. Chances are that there already is information out there on what-
16  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

ever topic we come up with, or whatever topic is handed to us. This means that we don't have
to start from scratch: don't invent information that already exists. Instead, every researcher's
first goal is to figure out what information on the topic is out there already.

Come up with an initial search phrase. Refine it. Refine it again.

To know what has been written already about a topic, a researcher first needs to identify the
most precise search phrase, that is, the words others have used to write about this topic. You
probably have noticed that sometimes when you Google something, you get results that are
on point to what you're looking for, while at other times it takes a few tries to get the most
appropriate results. The difference is the search phrase you used in Google. Sometimes the
search phrase is straightforward because everyone uses the same vocabulary to name the
thing that interests us. At other times, this is not the case.

For example, several years ago one of our students was interested in researching why some
college basketball players only played with their college teams for one season before declar-
ing for the NBA draft. The student called this the "one-and-done rule," and used this expres-
sion as his initial search phrase. He wanted to learn about why this phenomenon existed but
was frustrated with his search results. All he kept coming up with were news reports and
speculative articles about which players were going to be one-and-done players in any given
year.

It wasn't until he changed his search phrase to "NBA draft eligibility," that he was able to find
more informative documents about this "rule." Through these results he learned, in fact, that
this wasn't so much a rule, but the result of eligibility requirements for the NBA draft. The
one-and-done phenomenon developed because players only can declare for the draft a year
after finishing high school. He also learned that these requirements were governed by the
collective bargaining agreement between the NBA players' union and the NBA. The second
search phrase led the student to the primary document on his topic, and commentary on the
appropriateness and implications of the eligibility requirements. The refined search resulted
in credible sources that helped this student understand his topic in a deeper way than from
the information he initially found.

This example illustrates that the words you use to search matter. Any search engine or data-
base will try to exactly match your search terms to terms that appear in documents or web-
sites. It is important to be open to new search terms and phrases, and to keep track of them
as they evolve throughout the research process.

The circle of research

The following video reinforces the practice of refining a search term, while also putting this
practice in the context of a circular process that all research entails.

books.pub/becredible/?p=36

What are this video's key takeaway points?
One takeaway is that the research process is not linear. Good research rarely proceeds from
beginning to end the way we initially imagine it will go. As researchers, we need to be open to
our research results leading us in directions we do not initially plan on going.
Another takeaway is that research sometimes can feel like we are running in a hamster wheel.
The circular process this video outlines, of doing exploratory research, refining the initial
idea, and then doing more research, can appear like it could go around and around without
18  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

end. Student researchers sometimes are tempted to short-circuit this process by writing their
research reports or papers before they explore fully where the search and re-search process
leads them. Again, it's important to be open to the unexpected directions in which research
takes us.

Based on these takeaways, an important expectation to have about any research is that it will
take longer than we initially anticipate it to take. This has implications for how you plan your
research in this class and beyond.

If the one source doesn't exist, stitch together a bunch of sources.

The next video addresses another set of expectations that novice researchers often have, that
there exists an information source that perfectly fits their topics.

What are this video's key takeaway points?

The video's main point is that an information topic may be too specific for there to be good
sources that discuss it exactly. Even if this is the case, however, there likely are good sources
that address parts of a topic. The strategy that this video discusses consists of breaking down
the original topic into subtopics and searching for combinations of these subtopics.

The video also suggests finding a variety of sources on these subtopics, including news arti-
cles and academic articles. We will discuss the different types of sources available, and where
to find them, in later chapters.

Activity 1: Topics and Topic Categories

      Identify a research topic for each of the topic categories listed at the beginning of the
      chapter. For each topic, identify questions you would want to answer about that topic.

Activity 2: Search Phrases

      Using your topic or developing one of the proposed topic areas above, develop a list of
      search phrases.

         Your goal in this exercise will be to develop as many search phrases as possible,
            including broad terms (basketball) and more narrow terms (NBA) and more casual
            (one-and-done rule) or more specialized language (NBA draft eligibility).

         You could look at a thesaurus, Google a couple of news articles about your topic, or
            draw from your own well of knowledge.

         Make certain to keep track of your search terms, whether you jot them down on a
            sheet of paper, in a Google or Word document, or in a mind map you create.
20  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Activity 3: Researcher Commandments

      Summarize the reasonable expectations discussed in this chapter. Re-state each
      expectation in the form of researcher commandments (i.e., "I shall ...", "I shall not ...").

Activity 4: Open Pedagogy

      In a video or slideshow, illustrate how your research process takes you places you
      didn't initially anticipate going.

Search More Effectively

PETER BOBKOWSKI

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Use search operators to conduct effective and efficient searches.

Search Operators

As we set off on our research process, let's cover some strategies that can make our informa-
tion searching more efficient.
We all have had the experience of typing some search phrase into Google and being over-
whelmed by the millions of search results that come up. The following strategies, also known
as operators, can streamline our searching so that we waste less time sifting through links
and sources that don't address our topics.
These operators all work in Google, and some also work in specialized databases that you
access through a library or another website.
22                                     PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Use quotation marks

Watch this video on phrase searching.

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://otn.press-
books.pub/becredible/?p=44

The key takeaway from this video is that multi-word search terms enclosed by quotation
marks return more specific results than the same search terms without quotation marks.
For instance, the search phrase

      unicorns in Kansas
returns 440,000 Google results that contain the words unicorns, or Kansas, or both (but not
necessarily both).
SEARCH MORE EFFECTIVELY  23

The search phrase
      "unicorns in Kansas"

returns two Google results, both of which contain the exact phrase "unicorns in Kansas."
An additional important point made in the video is that it may be worthwhile to use different
versions of a phrase when using quotation marks. For example, the search term

      unicorn in Kansas

returns 14,500 search results. Apparently writing about one unicorn is more popular than
writing about a unicorn herd.
Remember that using this operator only makes sense for two or more words. Putting quota-
tion marks around one word will not alter the search results

Use AND and/or OR

Watch this KU video on combining search terms.
24  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://otn.press-
books.pub/becredible/?p=44

These operators are useful for exploring the search results of combining two or more search
terms. To see how the results differ after using these operators, open two browser tabs to
Google and type two unrelated words in the search bar. In one, place AND between the two
words, and in the other, place OR. Click between the two windows and explain the differences
in the order of the search results.

Use the minus sign

Sometimes when we search for a topic that's similar to a very popular search topic, it's hard to
find the search result in which we are interested because of the overwhelming popularity of
the other topic that's not-quite our topic. Inserting a minus sign in the search string, followed
by the search term we don't want to see, will eliminate results with that search term from our
results list.
SEARCH MORE EFFECTIVELY  25

For example, let's say that we are interested in researching the sources of whale mortality,
and we want to use the colloquial search phrase "whale killer." If we type

      whale killer

with or without quotations, Google will return for us a ton of results on killer whales.

But if we use the search string

      "whale killer" -"killer whale"

we will get results that contain the exact phrase "whale killer," and no results about killer
whales.

We can use the minus sign as many times as we want in one search string. For example, if we
want to scrub our results of all possible mentions of killer whales and anything else that may
be related to them, we might use the search term

      "whale killer" -"killer whale" -orca -blackfish

because orca is another term for the killer whale, and Blackfish is a popular 2013 documen-
tary about these whales.

Note that there is no space between the minus sign and the word of phrase you want to leave
out. Adding the space confuses Google.

In the Libraries' subscription and other databases, instead of using the minus sign you can
perform the same feat by using the operator NOT.

Specify the domain or website

A top-level domain is a group of websites whose URLs end in the same letters. We know them
as .edu, .gov, .org, and .com websites. Top-level domains also can designate a website's home
country, like .ca for Canada, .mx for Mexico, and .dj for Djibouti. (Here is a list of all the possi-
ble top-level domain endings, most of which we never see used.)

Can you think of research topics that would make it useful to narrow down our search results
to a specific top-level domain?
26  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

We may be looking for official government sources on a specific topic. If so, we would type
our search term, followed by site:gov.

For example, our search string might look like this:

      "killer whale" site:gov

Or we may want to look only for nonprofit sources on a topic. Our search string might look
like this:

      "killer whale" site:org

We can further narrow down a search to a more specific domain or website. For instance, if
we want to find experts at the University of Kansas who specialize in killer whales, we might
use this search term:

      "killer whale" site:ku.edu

because ku.edu is the top level domain for all web pages at the University of Kansas.

Or, if we want to read an article published by a specific publication, we can narrow down our
search to that publication's website.

Let's say that we want to search the website of our local newspaper, the Lawrence Journal-
World, for the address 803 Massachusetts. This is where the popular The Burger Stand restau-
rant is located, and we want to learn what other businesses operated in this building before
the Burger Stand. To do this, we might use the search term:

      "803 Massachusetts" site:ljworld.com

for articles published on this newspaper's website.

Note that that there are no spaces between the word "site," the colon, and the domain name
or extension. Spaces make operators inoperable.

Specify the document type

The names of computer documents end in specific filetype endings, like .doc or .docx for
Word documents, .ppt or .pptx for PowerPoint presentations, and .pdf for PDFs (which stands
SEARCH MORE EFFECTIVELY  27

for "portable document format," by the way). You might guess where this is going: we can nar-
row down our searches to a specific filetype.

Can you think of research topics that would make it useful to narrow down our search results
to a filetype?

Official documents, research reports, and forms often are saved as PDFs. Specifying

      filetype:pdf

after our search term will turn up only PDF files in our search results.

Teaching and professional presentations, meanwhile, are often saved as PowerPoint docu-
ments. Specifying

      filetype:ppt

will result only in those files showing up in our search results.

Specify a date range

Sometimes we may want to access the most recent information on a topic, while at other
times, we may be searching for the oldest information out there. Most search engines and
databases provide the option of organizing results by date. Some databases organize results
from newest to oldest by default, while in other databases, we have to specify our prefer-
ence for this ordering or another. It is usually also possible to designate a date range for our
results.
28  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

To specify the date range in Google, after typing a search term and getting initial results, click
"Tools" below the search bar, and use the drop-down menu next to the "Any time" tab.

Combine the operators

We can make our search strings as elaborate as we need them to be, so feel free to combine
any number of these operators in the searches you perform.

In Google, you can also access an Advanced Search form in which you can specify a number
of these and other operators without using the shortcuts we discussed here.

Reverse image search

This last Google search trick we discuss in this chapter may not be useful when researching
a regular topic, but it may be handy when verifying the authenticity of a photo. It also is used
by people who suspect that images belonging to them are being posted around the Internet
without their permission.

Here's a short video about reverse image searching.

Keep Detailed Research Notes

KARNA YOUNGER

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Understand the professional need for collecting and documenting evidence.
         Design and maintain a research collection system that is usable for you and your
            research collaborators.

Research Notes Back Up Your Credibility

Think back to the Stephen Glass scandal discussed in the first chapter. Glass's notebook was
at the center of the investigation into his fabrications. This eventual scrutiny showed that
Glass got away with publishing made-up information because he falsified his reporting notes
before submitting them to the magazine's fact-checkers, and convinced the fact-checkers not
to interrogate these notes. For instance, he requested that his "very nervous" sources not be
contacted, and created fake websites to make it appear as though he properly researched
his articles. Glass cracked after Forbes Digital Tool questioned his article about a teen hacker.
Glass forfeited his career because he forged his research, including the notes that supported
it.
In this chapter, we discuss how your research notes will factor into the workflow, particularly
32  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

the fact-checking process, of increasingly transparent news and marketing organizations. By
the end, you will understand why tracking your research is important for your professional
reputation and for your personal sanity.

The Problem: Credibility and Public Opinion

In the years since the Stephen Glass scandal broke, we've witnessed the rebirth of and politi-
cization of "fake news," misinformation, disinformation, and other communications prob-
lems. In this environment, some members of the general public have developed a negative
opinion of journalists and communications professionals. This may be due to negative per-
sonal interactions with the press, or to a belief that communications professionals lack cred-
ibility. Even though large majorities of surveyed Americans have "at least some trust" in the
reporting of professional news outlets, Pew Research Center found that 74 percent believe
the media's reporting is biased.

Moreover, people across generations trust about "four-in-ten of the sources they are familiar
with" and distrust "about two-in-ten," Pew found. If you read between the lines, even when
folks are familiar with a news outlet, they are likely not to trust the information it presents
because they believe it may be biased or otherwise faulty. Such lack of trust is causing 38 per-
cent of surveyed Americans to avoid the news altogether, according to the Reuters Institute
for the Study of Journalism. To combat audience drop, the media must garner the skeptical
reader's trust and maintain its credibility.

News consumers take a number of factors into account when judging the credibility of news
sources, according to Pew. Readers consider the credibility of the sources that are cited, cred-
ibility of the news brand, and their "gut instinct." If someone sends them a news article, they
also factor into their decision-making process the trustworthiness of the person who shared
the news with them.

As a communications professional, you only have so much control over "gut instincts" and
your readers' Facebook friends. But you can strengthen people's faith in your sources and
brand by elevating the quality and transparency of your research.

Solution: Fact-Checking Your Research and Notes

Having well-organized notes to submit to fact-checkers is key to establishing your and your
employer's credibility.
KEEP DETAILED RESEARCH NOTES  33

Fact-checking has been used to stifle deliberate fakers, like Glass, for about a century. Time
magazine instituted one of the nation's first fact-checking processes and, later, fact-checking
departments to support muckraking journalists who used facts to take down corrupt politi-
cians and institutions.

Today, there is a growing public demand for more fact-checking, particularly of political news,
and a whole lot of studies on its importance. In turn, news outlets seeking to regain the pub-
lic's trust are striving to be more transparent by publicizing their fact-checking and research
processes. In fact, the International Fact-Checking Network explicitly states in its code of
ethics that transparency of sources and research methodology are vital to combating the
public's distrust of the media.

Peter Canby, senior editor and head of The New Yorker's fact-checking department, provides
a good overview of the fact-checking process he oversees. This process starts with the writer,
who must submit the notes, tapes, transcripts, phone numbers, web addresses, books, mag-
azines, and anything else that he or she consulted during the writing of an article. Recreating
the research process can be tedious because fact-checkers assume that they know nothing at
all.

Fact-checkers then cross-reference the writer's facts, notes, and sources with other author-
itative sources, such as scientists and other really smart people. They either verify that the
writer's research is accurate, or challenge the writer to re-write or provide better support.
Checkers also call (not email) everyone who was interviewed. They do not read quotes verba-
tim but will give interviewees the jist of what they said.

Fact-checkers are particularly vocal about their penchant for grilling reporters about their
notes. For instance, Canaby once spent months digging through one writer's 25 file cabinets
of notes to fact-check a piece that took 16 years to write. As the number of file cabinets indi-
cates, this writer was particularly detail-oriented, but that didn't mean Canaby could take it
easy on his facts.

Similarly, a This American Life researcher and fact-checker had to "interrogate the living hell
out of every single utterance of fact" for about a year before the seven-hour podcast S-Town
was released and downloaded more than 40 million times. In one instance, the researcher
cross-examined the host's script against interview notes, transcripts, photos, interviewees,
and independent expert testimony, just to find out what kind of glue an interviewee men-
tioned off-hand. Was it a shellac, or was it an epoxy? The host couldn't remember what the
interviewee said, and the interview audio was patchy.

This American Life couldn't say someone schellaced something if they used an epoxy, even if
34  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

the interviewee was cool with it. The podcast staff felt that they could have been easily chal-
lenged by a knowing listener, so they had to get it right to avoid publishing a correction. The
host's scrupulous research methods eventually paid off when the fact-checker found a pic-
ture of the interviewee standing next to a particular can of glue.

At publications such as Time, the involvement of lawyers in the fact-checking process are
a preventive measure against libel lawsuits and embarrassments. In the mid-1990s, Time
and Newsweek asked their fact-checkers to take on additional reporting and writing duties.
Almost immediately Newsweek was hit with a scandal, as Craig Silverman reported for the
Poynter Institute. Without full-time fact-checkers, the weekly mistakenly told its readers that
it was okay for five-month-old infants to chomp on chunks of carrots and zwieback (sweet,
bite-sized crackers). Hoping to avoid instigating choking incidents and accompanying lawsuits,
Newsweek recalled and reprinted its issues, and published a retraction advising infants to
stick to pureed solids.

To avoid such awkward moments, most publications hold their reporters' facts to high stan-
dards. As The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates reflected, it is rare for a media outlet not to have
either full-time fact-checkers or editors who serve as "a dam against you embarrassing your-
self" or "being so arrogant that [you] don't even realize you've embarrassed yourself." To build
and sustain Coates's culture of honesty, fact checkers double-check each individual fact, but
also calculate whether or not the writer's argument is true on a whole. In other words, they
ask, do all the facts add up?

From start to finish, your research and writing may take longer than your memory can hold
this information. You will have to keep track of everything you find so that you can complete
your work and then, weeks, months, or maybe even years later, delineate the minutia of your
research process to a fact-checker. Where did you find this piece of information? How did you
search for it? Who told you about this fact? Did you use your source's words accurately? Your
research notes need to hold these answers.

Practice: Transparency in Reporting

If news consumers were more aware of the in-depth fact-checking that goes on at news out-
lets, would they put more trust in journalists and the news? Maybe journalism's credibility cri-
sis can be solved by having more transparency about journalistic research and fact-checking
practices?

There seems to be a growing agreement that news organizations should be more open about
their research and fact-checking. At the 2017 Poynter Ethics Summit, a number of the nation's
KEEP DETAILED RESEARCH NOTES  35

leading journalists, including The Washington Post's executive editor Martin Baron, pledged
to be more transparent with readers regarding their research processes.

Baron made this public vow shortly after his newspaper published evidence of its reporters'
research process. This particular research was prompted by a woman approaching the news-
paper with the false allegation that, as a teenager, she had a sexual relationship with a much
older Roy Moore, a 2017 Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama. The Post's trans-
parency in this instance serves as a useful example of how organizations can use a reporter's
notes to nurture credibility among the public.

The Post's tale began November 2017 when the paper reported allegations that a 32-year-
old Moore engaged in a relationship with a 14 year old. Accusations of sexual misconduct
dogged Moore until his loss in the December special election. Shortly after the publication of
the November article, a woman contacted the Post to share her own story, off the record. This
means that she was not ready for the Post to make her story public.

As detailed in the Post's expose, the paper immediately started its customary practice of
investigating the woman's identity and her story. The Post's fact-checking process typically
begins with the original reporter, who holds "primary" responsibility for fact-checking his or
her stories, according to the newspaper's policy. Once a reporter submits a complete story,
one or more editors review the piece.

Shortly after the woman's first point of contact with the Post, alarms bells sounded. The Post's
reporters and researchers came up with more questions than answers about the woman's
story. Based on their research evidence, the Post's editors decided that "this so-called off-the-
record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us."

The Post's reporter Stephanie McCrummen arranged a meeting with the purported accuser
in a public place. The following video was recorded during this meeting. It illustrates the
research process that McCrummen and her colleagues undertook to confirm the woman's
backstory and allegations, before and during McCrummen's meeting with the accuser.
36  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

First, as McCrummen repeatedly tells the interviewee and as we can see, the Post recorded
the interaction between the reporter and her informant. Additionally, McCrummen seems to
make a show of taking notes in the videoed interaction. McCrummen positions her notepad
so that the interviewee can see it and read it. Then the reporter stops and asks the woman
to repeat herself several times, drawing attention to the fact that she is taking diligent notes.
Because the Post staff believed the woman was trying to trick them, McCrummen clearly
wanted to be as transparent as possible and stressed her note-taking process to avoid being
accused of being unethical.

McCrummen is also transparent about the Post's background research. After offering a print-
out of the interviewee's Go Fund Me webpage to her companion, the reporter explains why
the Post was interested in the information, and asked the informant to confirm and comment
on the webpage. Having a physical copy of the webpage allowed the Post to retain a record
of the page's existence if it were deleted. This all happened while the cameras and recorder
are capturing a conversation that later can be transcribed and consulted.

In all, the Post's expose on the purported Roy Moore accuser illustrates the importance of a
thorough, well-documented, and transparent journalistic research process.
KEEP DETAILED RESEARCH NOTES  37

Practice: Advertising Substantiation

The need to document research extends to the advertising industry. Advertisers adhere to
self-imposed standards about researching and validating facts that appear in the adver-
tisements they publish and air. Advertising companies are held to the Federal Trade Com-
mission's (FTC's) Policy Statement on Deception. This FTC policy demands that advertisers
substantiate all claims made explicitly or implicity in their advertisements. This is meant
to ensure that advertisers do not mislead the public in a way that could cause harm. For
instance, advertisers can't promise that orange juice is a healing elixir unless they document
research from scientists and health professionals that substantiates this claim.

This means that if you are planning a career in advertising, you too will need to substantiate
your claims by keeping track of and being transparent about your research. Your manager
and the FTC will hold you accountable for every element of your advertisement, from the
name of the product to the fine print, and for how the whole package adds up to a consumer's
"net impression" of a product.

In all, regardless of the profession you pursue after college, getting in the habit of keeping
track of your research will pay off in the long run.

Application: How to Create a Note-Taking System

To make sure that your research eventually can be verified, you should get in the habit of
keeping of all of your research ideas, from new ideas to project drafts. Doing so will allow you
to retrace your steps and allow others, like fact-checkers or managers, to follow your tracks.
You can think of your notebook as the tool that will help you transition from interviewing and
researching to actually writing or creating, and getting published. There are three ways you
could document your work:

Reporter's notebook

A notebook doesn't have to be a pad of paper, but you should track all elements of your
research and sources from start to finish in a central location. This is key to being able to
recall and recount what you did. Some suggested content for your notes:

      Ideas. Write them down so that you can develop them. For example, "What tools are
         journalists using to make their work more transparent to news consumers?"

      Keywords. Turn your ideas into keywords to use when searching. Make lists or mind
38  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         maps of broader and more specific terms. Keep track of when and where you use the
         keywords or phrases to replicate your successful searches. For example, "journalism,
         transparency, and `digital tools.'"
      Source notes. Once you have found, read, or talked to a source, you should document
         it.

            Write a summary (2-3 sentences) of the source to give yourself a quick glance at
               why the source is important to your research.

            Make careful notes of important statements. Be certain "direct quotes" are "prop-
               erly marked" to make it clear when you are, or are not paraphrasing your source.

            Multimedia formats. Don't forget that your notebook may include pictures, screen
               captures, videos, or audio of sources and information. (Remember: always get
               someone's consent before recording them, as The Washington Post did in the
               above example.)

      Tools

               long as they are affiliated with KU. They lose access to these files once they gradu-
               ate.)

Scrapbook

While you are backgrounding your topic, you should save the sources you discover so that
you can locate and properly cite them while you are writing. The tools listed below will allow
you to bookmark and save websites and other sources in one location.

Data Management

Data management sounds like it might involve lots of numbers. But in reality it just means
that you need to know how to consistently and properly name and store your stuff so that
you and those pesky fact-checkers can easily find it. Jamene Brooks-Kiefer, KU's data librarian,
recommends the following to ensure that you are kind to your future self.

      File naming conventions

            Rules

                  Keep it short (fewer than 25 characters)
                  No spaces. Use_underscore_or-dashes-orNoSpaces_instead
                  Don't use special characters (bad = [$pecia|F!le\}
            Put the date at the beginning or end of the file name, if the date is important.

                  YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD
            Use leading 0s for numbers (ex. SpecialFile01, SpecialFile02). This is useful if you

               are saving different versions of a draft.
      Example file naming structure:

      Back it up. Follow the maxim, "Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe" (LOCKSS). This means

         that you shouldn't rely on your hard drive to be around forever. Keep three copies of
         your work: one on site (like on your hard drive), and two on different storage sites (like
         on a couple of different clouds). Here are some free cloud storage sites:

Here is Jamene's handy handout of tips on data management.

Activity 1: Fact-Checking Disclosures

      Investigate whether or not your favorite news source posts any information about its
      fact-checking process online.

         If so, how accessible is the information about its fact-checking process?
         Is it easy to find, read, and understand?
         If not, is there information about it elsewhere? How do your findings impact your

            opinion of this news source?

Activity 2: File-Naming Conventions

      Using the information about file naming conventions from the chapter, draft some
KEEP DETAILED RESEARCH NOTES  41

sample rules for how you will name and save files related to your research projects
and coursework.

Activity 3: Open Pedagogy

      Explore the recording and storage tools listed in this chapter, and select tools to use
      for your notebook, scrapbook, and cloud storage.

         Create a tutorial of one of the tools you will use throughout the semester.
         In your tutorial discuss such aspects as its ease of use and why it integrates into

            your workflow.
         You may create a voice-over PowerPoint slideshow, video, or some other presenta-

            tion format.

Ladybug Rock, by Mark Caton

My father, a Presbyterian minister, rarely used the King James Version of the Bible, so I
remember vividly when he referenced the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans from the KJV.
Romans 13:17 reads: "Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; cus-
tom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour."
Because I was a child, the language of the passage confused me, and I asked my dad what it
meant. He laughed before briefly summing up Paul's message.
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  43

"It pretty much means you give people recognition for what they've done," my dad said. "Like
when your mom and I really liked the ladybug rock you brought home from school and you
told us Mark Caton was the one who painted it. You gave Mark what was due to him, the
credit for being the painter, instead of telling us you'd done it."

Not everyone needs a biblical lesson on giving credit where it's due. And credit isn't necessar-
ily an acknowledgment of excellence, as Mark Caton could have done a poor job of painting a
ladybug on stone, but in journalism and strategic communications attribution is like that lady-
bug: a rock. It's one of the ethical (and often lawful) foundations of a news or feature story, a
documentary, a company news release, a digital ad, or a marketing PowerPoint.

This chapter will help illuminate the concept of attribution, why it matters, who uses it, who
benefits from its use, when it's used, and why professionals may disagree on its use. This
chapter also will address how to journalistically cite sources, how attribution can go wrong,
and where to find more on the topic.

What is Attribution?

Reputable and engrossing writing, whether it's journalism or strategic communication, starts
with responsible and principled research and reporting. Attribution is vital to all ethical
reporting because it identifies information sources.

The Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC),
which accredits journalism schools, lists core values and competencies all graduates should
be able to meet. Among those competencies is the ability to "demonstrate an understanding
of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and
diversity." Attribution is key to the quest for veracity and transparency. Attribution's job in
journalism is to answer the "who" of a quotation, the "where" and "what" of background infor-
mation, and - sometimes - the "how."

Who said what? Where did reporters or editors get their data? What research was used to
support an opinion? How did a human source provide those statistics?

Understanding attribution requires understanding sources.

Primary Sources

If a human contributes information for a story, whether it's in-person, on the phone, or via
44  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

email or text, that woman, child or man is a source. The most credible human source is a pri-
mary one, a person with a direct connection to the information or situation pertinent to the
story.

This first-hand relationship provides for an accurate telling of that person's experience. Even
though the source's personal viewpoint can be an opinion, it can also provide a reporter with
facts. It's the reporter's responsibility to confirm the facts. An exception to this is if the jour-
nalist is the witness to events. Journalists can't name themselves as sources in articles.

Primary human sources also add what it sounds like - humanness. They put a face to the facts
and a person to the perspective. Often they can synthesize information in a way that makes
it accessible and easy to understand for other people.

Any person who contributes any kind of information to a story is a human source, even if that
material is never published or broadcast.

      Primary human source examples:

      Chadwick Boseman, star of the 2018 Disney and Marvel Studios film "Black Panther,"
      says in an interview with USA Today how respectful he is of the cinematic history the
      movie has made.

      Infections, like the kind caused by what the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
      vention call "nightmare bacteria," are drug-resistant and "virtually untreatable with
      modern medicine," CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat said in a press
      briefing.

The reporter in each scenario above indicates to readers or viewers where the information
originates. The importance of primary source credibility is clear. The main actor in a film will
know about acting in that film. Schuchat, who served as acting director of the CDC twice, will
know the agency's public health concerns and alerts.

A journalist could probably get the same information from a non-human source, but Bose-
man and Schuchat put a trustworthy human face to the communication they're sharing.

Primary sources also can be nonhuman. Government records, reports of original research
studies, and polls, are examples of primary sources because they are the original locations of
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  45

the information they contain. A nonhuman source is the primary source for a piece of infor-
mation if it does do not cite other sources for that information.

Some sources, like research studies, often are both primary and secondary sources, because
they both re-state information found elsewhere, and are the original sources of other infor-
mation.)

      Primary nonhuman source examples:

      April is designated as Alcohol Awareness Month by the federal government. A journal-
      ist developing a story about drug and alcohol trends among seniors, or in a specific
      geographical region, might use data published by the National Council on Alcoholism
      and Drug Dependence (NCADD), a primary nonhuman source.

      Marketers at a major health care organization choose similarly to highlight the impor-
      tance of alcohol awareness, and they also provide NCADD data in a story in their
      monthly e-zine or quarterly newsletter. NCADD serves as a primary nonhuman
      source. The marketers supplement their story with human primary sources from
      within their organization, such as physicians and counselors.

Journalists and strategic communicators should not leave their audience to question informa-
tion or sources' legitimacy. The exception is if something is a well-known - or widely reported
- fact that's reasonably indisputable.For example, it would not be necessary to cite a source
for "Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, delivered what would come to
be known as `The Gettysburg Address' in November 1863."

Secondary Sources

Both human and nonhuman sources also can be secondary sources, or research material. A
secondary source is information containing others' reporting and data gathering, and it's usu-
ally information used for a purpose other than a journalist or strategic communicator's pur-
poses.

Journalists must determine if the secondary source information is fact or opinion, or both,
which they usually do by cross-referencing the information with other verifiable sources.
46  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

If a reporter looks to a website for background information, or reads other media reports on
a story, it's the reporter's responsibility to go to the information's original, or primary, source.

Avoid quoting The New York Times or Fox News as a source from their stories on obesity in
the United States. Go to the primary source those media reference. If they cite a study, or
data released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), go to that study or to
the CDC website. After verifying the information, cite the study or the CDC.

For example, a reporter working on an article about border crossings along the United States'
southern border sees a CNN report on a similar story, using data about who is crossing and
where. The reporter should look for the source of the data, not CNN's information. If the num-
bers are from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the reporter should go to CBP
for its facts and figures, and cite it as his or her source.

Often journalists use secondary sources as a springboard to develop a story idea, including
a single expos, an in-depth series of articles or podcasts, or a documentary. From these
secondary sources, they look for the primary sources of information, and use those in their
reports.

When To Attribute?

The late journalist Steve Buttry, whose rsum included editor, reporter, newsroom trainer
and teacher of digital journalism, wrote the following in a blog post, "You can quote me on
that: Advice on attribution for journalists":

      "Attribute any time that attribution strengthens the credibility of a story. Attribute
      any time you are using someone else's words. Attribute when you are reporting infor-
      mation gathered by other journalists. Attribute when you are not certain of facts.
      Attribute statements of opinion. When you wonder whether you should attribute, you
      probably should attribute in some fashion."

Buttry's advice from the same post on when not to use attribution is shorter:

      "Don't attribute facts that the reporter observed first-hand: It was a sunny day. Don't
      worry about attributing facts where the source is obvious and not particularly impor-
      tant and the fact is not in dispute."

Journalists and strategic communicators who write or report factual information or opinions
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  47

should attribute all those facts and opinions to a source. In some circumstances, attribution
is particularly important. Attribute facts if controversy might surround them, such as when
gun permit requests go up or down, or the number of middle-aged men addicted to opioids
changes dramatically. Also, always attribute evaluative facts that depend on the rule of law,
or facts that rely on an expert's information.

In broadcast, reporters and podcasters should identify the source of any statement, particu-
larly one of questionable accuracy. The source interviewed in a radio, podcast or video-taped
segment must be identified at the start. The newscaster, reporter or podcaster can identify
with a sound bite before the source speaks.

With video, a source can be acknowledged verbally and with a lower third super, a graphic,
usually the interviewee's name and location, superimposed along the bottom of the screen.

Why Attribute?

Both journalists and strategic communicators use attribution to signal to their audiences that
they're reliable and sincere. It indicates that they've vetted the sources, which helps read-
ers, listeners and viewers understand the information effortlessly, without having to stop and
question the content's accuracy and authenticity.

Journalists and strategic communicators benefit from using attribution, because the trust that
their audience places in the sources they cite extends to the journalists and strat comm. prac-
titioners themselves.

Good attribution says to the audience, "You can trust me because the sources I use are trust-
worthy."

Individual media companies underscore the importance of attribution in their values state-
ments. According to The Associated Press, the goal of attribution is "to provide a reader with
enough information to have full confidence in the story's veracity."

Attribution also lets the journalist or strat comm. practitioner share or shift the responsibility
for any information in a story. If a reader disagrees with something he or she sees in an
article or report, attribution can take the heat off the journalist or strategic communicator
who wrote the piece, and direct it toward the source of the information.

When a reader or viewer questions the veracity of some information, attribution says, "Blame
the message source, not the messenger."
48  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Attribution also allows audience members to examine a topic further. By pointing to their
sources, journalists and strat comm. practitioners invite their readers and viewers to find
those sources for themselves, and to take deeper dives into the topics they cover.

Attribution is like the entryway to Platform 9 3/4 in the Harry Potter books, from which read-
ers can set off on their own journeys into the subjects that interest them.

Finally, attribution can be the antidote to journalism's biggest transgressions of fabrication
and plagiarism. A journalist or strat comm. practitioner who points to his or her sources is
less likely to have made up something, or taken credit for someone else's words, than one
whose sources are hidden.

There is sometimes a misguided perception that attribution is less important in strategic com-
munication than it is in news and broadcast journalism.

The Public Relations Society of America, for one, opposes this view. It argues in its Ethical
Standards Advisories - Best Practices, that despite the pressures of time and shortage of
resources that all content creators face, public relations practitioners have a duty to disclose
their sources:

      "Public relations professionals may be . . . challenged when facing a deadline, an
      assignment in a new area or even the lack of a good idea and the easy solution may
      be to use someone else's words or ideas. However, an ethical practitioner respects
      and protects information that comes into his or her possession and makes an effort
      to preserve the integrity of that information.

      An ethical practitioner also uses the works of others appropriately, with proper
      author/creator attribution. There are many ways to do this ... including footnotes, par-
      enthetical references to the original author or a reference to the original work within
      the text. When words are used verbatim, it is important that they be enclosed in quo-
      tation marks and the exact source of the quote be provided either within the text or
      in a reference section."

These guidelines reflect the professional standards expected of all communications profes-
sionals.
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  49

How To Attribute?

How to select quotes is part of learning to build an article, newscast or magazine story, but
how to assign responsibility to quotes is part of understanding attribution.

Direct quotes

The following comes from guidelines used in the School of Journalism and Mass Communica-
tions at the University of Kansas.

A direct quote must be exactly what a source says. Direct quotes should add zest to the story.
Don't use quotes to deliver boring-but-necessary facts, or use quotes that don't drive the story
forward.

Direct quotes are used also for precision. An accurate direct quote can add confirmation of
controversial facts.

It can convey a person's information and attitude, which adds character and flavor to a story.

      Examples of direct quotes:

      "It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up," boxer
      Muhammad Ali said.

      "I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-
      six times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed," basketball leg-
      end Michael Jordan said. "I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that
      is why I succeed."

      "That's all I could ever hope for, to have a positive effect on women. `Cos women are
      powerful, powerful beings," singer Rihanna said. "But they're also the most doubtful
      beings. They'll never know - we'll never know - how powerful we are."

Say "no" to quotes that add nothing, such as "we're so excited," and "we went out there and
did our best." Obvious. Goofy. This may be difficult for strategic communicators whose bosses
or supervisors may press for hyperbole. Resist. It damages credibility.
50  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

But journalists and strategic communicators often include direct quotes from public officials
or company executives, even if what's said doesn't push the story forward or add flavor,
because readers and viewers see those figures as authorities who should know what's going
on.

Paraphrasing

A paraphrase, or indirect quote, is a re-wording of what a source says. It must reflect the
source accurately, even though it's not relayed word-for-word. An indirect quote must not
alter the meaning of what someone said.

In incorporating quotes into their writing, journalists often mix direct and indirect quotes.

      This is the direct quote:

      "When I first started teaching J101, I like, was happy to have - wow, like, 450 students,
      but then I had doubts," Benson said. "But I wanted to teach many students at once.
      I thought I could teach that many. But, wow, managing a huge class is like turning a
      cruise ship in a hurricane."

      This is the paraphrase, or indirect quote:

      Benson said she is happy to teach J101, a course with 450 students, but initially had
      doubts.

      The writer could then use a partial quote to support the paraphrase:

      "Managing a huge class is like turning a cruise ship in a hurricane," Benson said.

Handling human quotes

When referring to information given by specific human sources, the verb in print is "said,"
even if a writer isn't directly quoting a source. "Said" is best because it can't be wrong. If
a source said something, the source spoke and said it. "Said" doesn't stop thought when a
reader sees it.
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  51

Verbs, such as "explained" or "disclosed" or "exclaimed" require a reader to process differ-
ently. Such verbs draw attention to themselves and away from the content that matters.
Readers have to think about each verb because those have connotations that "said" does not.

Weird verbs of attribution, such as argued, claimed, concluded, warned, urged and remarked,
are just that, weird. Writers don't want to imply meaning that might alter the larger article's
credibility. "Said" as a verb is neutral. It doesn't hint at any meaning beyond its action.

Handling nonhuman quotes

"According to" is used to attribute information to nonhuman sources. Journalists and strategic
communicators should use "according to" for documents, news releases, studies, statistical
abstracts, infographics, or secondary sources in general.

In journalism and strategic communication, writers do not use in-text citation. That is, in jour-
nalism, there is no MLA, APA, or Chicago citation style. Save that for English, history, and polit-
ical science research papers. In journalism, for in-text source identification, if it's not "said," it
is usually "according to."

As with "said," there is no need to come up with different terms.

      Examples of nonhuman attributions:

      Teachers in the district make at least three times as much per year as teachers in
      other area school districts, according to state employment records.

      According to a World Health Organization report, this season's flu strain may infect
      millions worldwide.

      Student athletes are graduating at rates twice as high as they were a decade ago,
      according to NCAA findings.

But that's so repetitive

Journalists and strategic communicators, particularly if they hear their English composition
teachers in their heads, may resist "said" or "according to" for every attribution in a story. They
52  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

fear the repetitive use will make their writing dull and unvaried. But readers appreciate the
ease-of-reading, so they're not usually troubled by "said" or "according to."

Attribution terms may vary by news organization or publication. Some journalists have the
option to use alternatives, such as "stated" for human sources. Magazine writers often have
the editorial leeway to use "says" - using present tense even if they're attributing content a
source provided in an interview a day, a week, or a month prior to publication. But writers
can't be wrong with "said" when attributing a human source.

Order matters

Attribution can work at the beginning of a sentence, but often is even better at the end of the
sentence. This places the emphasis on the information first, then on the source.

Starting with the quote or paraphrase, and then providing attribution, is more interesting for
readers than the other way around. Presumably, what a person is saying is more interesting
than who's saying it. If it's a well-chosen quote, the information is what's important or rele-
vant, and the attribution is just for context and credibility.

Grammar notes

In English, writers usually put the verb after the subject in declarative sentences. Not always,
but it keeps the emphasis on the subject. Remember, "Jesus wept."

The order of name and verb is, when possible, name, then verb.

      Correct example:

      "The scientist examining the evidence couldn't conclude the origin of the DNA,"
      Fontaine said.

      Incorrect example:

      "The scientist examining the evidence couldn't conclude the origin of the DNA," said
      Fontaine.
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  53

      Exception example: When there's a title or description that makes it awkward:

      "The scientist examining the evidence couldn't conclude the origin of the DNA," said
      Elliot Fontaine, Colorado Springs police spokesman in charge of the investigation.

      Incorrect exception example:

      "The scientist examining the evidence couldn't conclude the origin of the DNA," Elliot
      Fontaine, Colorado Springs police spokesman in charge of the investigation, said.

Broadcast specifics

Broadcast attribution differs from print in several ways. Direct quotations are rare. Radio,
television and podcast writers prefer indirect quotes or statement summaries.

Direct quotes, if used, should be preceded by a phrase such as "in his words" or "what she
called." Quotation marks should also be shown. They give broadcasters a clue, or signpost, to
change their vocal pattern.

      Broadcast example:

      President Donald Trump says he will roll back all policies and laws from what he called
      "Obama's clown car of a presidency."

If it's critical that a source be quoted directly, a broadcaster or writer may use sound bites,
or actualities, in the audio. Always attribution is given before sources speak. It must be clear
from the start that the quote is not the broadcaster's thoughts or opinions.

With radio or podcasts, because listeners use only their ears to absorb the information, they
need to know right away who's responsible for what's being said. It's too cumbersome to
inject "quote and unquote" into broadcast to indicate to listeners what is and isn't a direct
quote.

An identifier, such as a title, always goes before the name in broadcast.

      Broadcast identifier example:
54  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

      New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio says he will support the new NYPD policy change
      on overtime pay.

With TV or video, the visual shows who's making the statement, and a character generator
super (or lower third) identifies the person after three or four seconds of video. The anchor or
reporter may or may not identify the source by name in the introduction, but usually provides
an identifier for context.

      Broadcast lead-in example:

      If the KU chancellor says, "The number of both undergraduate and graduate students
      suffering from food insecurity rose 48 percent between 2015 and today."

      The broadcaster might lead into the sound bite with a synopsis: Chancellor Doug
      Girod says food insecurity is on the increase among students at KU.

In broadcast, source attribution and identification should be written conversationally. Think
of it as the difference between a formal, engraved invitation delivered by the postal service
and an e-vite via email or social media.

Be careful with pronouns. Again, because listeners and viewers can't refer back easily in a
video or audio story, they may not remember, "She? Who is she?" It's better to repeat a name,
office or title to prevent confusion.

Use "says" and not said, as if it's happening now. "Says" is present tense and describes an
ongoing action. But when broadcasters are speaking to something a source said in the past,
"said" makes more sense.

      Broadcast says/said example:

      Chancellor Doug Girod says food insecurity is on the rise among KU students. Before
      he became chancellor, Girod said he would address food scarcity across campus.

Broadcast style also may allow for "according to" when using human sources. It may be a mat-
ter of news organization policy.

Embedding Links: Digital Attribution

The Internet allows journalists and strat comm. practitioners to elevate their attribution game
by embedding links in their work to the sources that are available online.

If you are producing content for digital distribution, link, link, link. Linking goes hand-in-hand
with attributing online content, whether it's news or strategic communication. Readers can -
even if they don't - click on links that provide background and full context to the cited infor-
mation.

Linking is about transparency and trust with readers. Linking to sources in articles and reports
increases the transparency of the journalists' and strategic communicators' work. It brings
readers closer to the sources, encouraging them to verify the veracity of the information they
are reading.

If attribution is like giving your friend an address to a restaurant, embedding a source's link is
like holding the restaurant's door open for your friend when they arrive.

Any source that can be linked in an online article, should be linked. Not doing so can raise
questions in an audience's mind about why the source isn't linked.

What Embedded Sources Look Like

Here are two examples of what embedding looks like in professional publications.

The following screenshot shows a paragraph in a Lawrence Journal-World, July 13, 2018, arti-
cle titled, "New Kansas AD Jeff Long addresses still-defunct KU-MU Border War."

The link in the paragraph takes readers to a October 22, 2017 article titled, "Bill Self on playing
Mizzou: `I don't think there's been any change in our position.'"

The next screenshot shows two paragraphs are from a July 14, 2018 article, "IceCube: Unlock-
ing the Secrets of Cosmic Rays," published on the website Space.com.
56  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

The link in the second paragraph leads to a FAQ page on the website of the University of Wis-
consin's South Pole Neutrino Observatory.

The URLs for the articles presented above are:

      http://www2.ljworld.com/weblogs/tale-tait/2018/jul/13/new-kansas-ad-jeff-long-
      addresses-still/, http://www2.kusports.com/news/2017/oct/22/bill-self-playing-miz-
      zou-i-dont-think-theres-been-/, https://www.space.com/41170-icecube-neutrino-
      observatory.html, https://www.space.com/, https://icecube.wisc.edu/about/faq, and
      https://icecube.wisc.edu/.

But the professional examples do not show their readers these strips of URL code.

This is because a name or description that identifies exactly where readers are going when
they click on the link is more welcoming than an incomprehensible string of URL. A linked
snippet of text gives readers the ability to choose their web source with confidence, and it
looks much more professional than raw URL code.

How to Embed Links to Online Sources

You probably already are familiar with inserting source links into documents, emails, social
media posts, or presentations, by copying and pasting the URLs of the sources. It takes eight
steps to embed a link (also called a hyperlink) in text.

    1. Browse to the source's webpage.
    2. At the top of the browser, locate the URL field (URL stands for "uniform source loca-

          tor").
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  57

3. Highlight the entire URL and copy it (Command+C, or Control+C, or Edit > Copy).
4. In the document you are writing, write a statement that will serve as the link. It could

     be a descriptor, such as KU J-School Technology, or it could more directive and fun,
     such as Start here to learn how best to use your technology.
5. Highlight the text you just typed.
6. Use the "insert hyperlink" tool in the platform you are using. Here are some visual
     examples of where to find these tools. The link tool often is represented graphically
     with two of links of a little chain.

What If a Source Wants To Remain Anonymous?

Avoid using unidentified sources for news or strategic communication documents. But this
might depend on newsroom or organization policy. It's usually not acceptable, as trust and
transparency are the agreement readers, viewers and listeners have with media content
providers.

Exceptions are sometimes made when the only way to get a story is to offer source
anonymity. It shouldn't be given lightly and without understanding that the information must
still be reliable and accurate.

Reasons to offer anonymity could include, if the source provided a name the source would
suffer public humiliation, lose a job or position, or go to jail.

If an anonymous source must be used, offer as much detail as possible about the source and
explain the reason for anonymity.

For example, name a source as "a university official with ties to the administration who
requested anonymity because his superiors had ordered him not to speak publicly or he
would lose his position."

When a source requests anonymity, get the source's name and contact information, just in
case an editor needs it.

The following are examples of ethical codes and policies journalists follow when deciding to
use anonymous sources or pseudonyms.

Under Associated Press rules, material from anonymous sources may be used only if:

      The material is information and not opinion or speculation, and is vital to the news
         report.

      The information is not available except under the conditions of anonymity imposed by
         the source.

      The source is reliable, and in a position to have accurate information.
The Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics on anonymous sources:

      Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as
         possible on sources' reliability.

      The most important professional possession of journalists is credibility. If the news
62  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         consumers don't have faith that the stories they are reading or watching are accurate
         and fair, if they suspect information attributed to an anonymous source has been
         made up, then the journalists are as useful as a parka at the equator.
      To protect their credibility and the credibility of their stories, reporters should use
         every possible avenue to confirm and attribute information before relying on
         unnamed sources. If the only way to publish a story that is of importance to the audi-
         ence is to use anonymous sources, the reporter owes it to the readers to identify the
         source as clearly as possible without pointing a figure at the person who has been
         granted anonymity. If the investigating police officer confirms John Doe has been
         arrested, the officer is a "source in the police department" and not even a pronoun
         should point to the gender.
The Washington Post Standards and Ethics: Attribution of Sources

      The Washington Post is pledged to disclose the source of all information when at all
         possible. When we agree to protect a source's identity, that identity will not be made
         known to anyone outside The Post.

      Before any information is accepted without full attribution, reporters must make
         every reasonable effort to get it on the record. If that is not possible, reporters should
         consider seeking the information elsewhere. If that in turn is not possible, reporters
         should request an on-the-record reason for concealing the source's identity and
         should include the reason in the story.

      In any case, some kind of identification is almost always possible - by department or
         by position, for example - and should be reported.

      No pseudonyms are to be used.
      However, The Washington Post will not knowingly disclose the identities of U.S. intelli-

         gence agents, except under highly unusual circumstances which must be weighed by
         the senior editors.

How To Attribute Information From an Email, a Text, or a Social
Media Post?

If a credible source responds to an interview in an email, attribution should indicate this.

      Email attribution example:
ATTRIBUTE ALL SOURCES  63

      The CEO of Mosette Healthcare Group, Lana Dunham, wrote in an email that she
      plans to merge the group with St. Catherine's Health Systems.

Social media posts are tricky and should serve primarily as story ideas to pursue.

According to National Public Radio's ethics handbook, social platforms can serve as good
newsgathering tools, but NPR said that it:

      "requires the same diligence we exercise when reporting in other environ-
      ments. When NPR bloggers post about breaking news, they do not cite anonymous
      posts on social media sites -- though they may use information they find there to
      guide their reporting. They carefully attribute the information they cite and are clear
      about what NPR has and has not been able to confirm."

Also, social media users aren't always who they say they are, which poses a verification prob-
lem. If it's reasonably possible to identify an account and the posts or tweets coming from it,
use something like this to attribute:

      Social media example

      Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, who gave birth to her second child on April 9,
      tweeted on April 19: "May have to vote today. Maile's outfit is prepped. Made sure she
      has a jacket so she doesn't violate the Senate floor dress code requiring blazers. Not
      sure what the policy is on duckling onesies but I think we're ready."

Tweeted, posted, shared. Use the appropriate attribution verbs for their social platforms.

How To Attribute a File, Archive or Stock Photo or Video?

It must be attributed to its original source. Include the title, author, source and date it was
accessed.

      Example:

News Releases

Reproducing news releases - either sent or gathered from a website - has been a lively topic
in nearly all news centers that use releases and among all organizations and businesses that
send or post them.

Raymond James attorney and KU alum Ellyn Angelotti Kamke wrote about attribution and its
squishy spots for The Poynter Institute. In a 2013 article, Kamke addressed the sometimes-
disputed issue of plagiarism-without-attribution in which some journalists view verbatim
news release use.

In her article, Kamke raised the question many in the industry ask frequently, "How should
journalists use and attribute information that comes from an official source via press release,
a prepared statement an official social-media account or some other widely distributed
avenue?"

Attribute. Attribute. Attribute. For transparency and credibility. Attributed material, Kamke
wrote, "even when it comes from an official source, gives the audience more context about
that information and how it was acquired by the writer."

Strategic communicators, such as those specializing in public relations, want their material
used and more-often-than-not put the research and good writing into a news release so it's
fit for immediate publication with minimal editing. But even PR professionals see the value of
readers knowing the sources and making their own decisions about their veracity.

                                  Rotoworld and ProFootballTalk, serves a sports audience that
                                  craves sports news and analysis. How do we do that? We do some
                                  original reporting and we rely on extensive story aggregation.

    Any story that isn't reported by our writers is explicitly credited and linked to high up
    in the story, sometimes in the initial graf. Our editorial standard is that we don't do
    lengthy excerpts or extensive quoting (why reproduce what the original story already
    has?), because we don't want any confusion as to where the original story originates.

    Excerpts are italicized, set off with quotes, or both. It should clearly be separated from
    the rest of the story.

    For us, this places the onus on our writers to extend that aggregated story with a spe-
    cific editorial take or analysis that drives the story forward. If we can't break the story,
    we tell our audience why it's important, which helps the original story's credibility (we
    create awareness) and gives us some authority through analysis.

EVALUATING INFORMATION
CHAPTER 6

Evaluate Information Vigorously

CALLIE BRANSTITER AND PETER BOBKOWSKI

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Appreciate the need to vigorously evaluate the credibility of information.
         Differentiate between primary and secondary sources.
         Trace the primary source of information.
         Identify clickbait articles and content farms.

What You Know About Evaluating Information Isn't Enough

You have been taught how to evaluate online information. This may have started all the way
back in elementary or middle school, and it definitely happened in high school and college.
English or social studies teachers, or a librarian, cautioned you to be careful about what web-
sites your research came from. You learned to confirm facts using two or more sources. You
learned to consider who was the author of the information you were quoting, about check-
ing what sources this author used, and whether there was bias in the author's writing. Some-
where along the way, you also learned that Wikipedia is a terrible, horrible, not good, very
bad source of information.
EVALUATE INFORMATION VIGOROUSLY  69

So far, these evaluation standards have served you well. But now that you're in journalism
school, you need to raise your information evaluation game.

Psychologists say that there are two ways in which we process information. We either process
information quickly and with little thinking, using tried-and-true heuristics. They call this type
of processing System 1. A heuristic here means a simplistic signal that we use to form an
opinion, or to make a decision. The second way we process information, System 2, is by being
deliberate, carefully considering the varying dimensions of the matter that's in front of us.

To understand this distinction better, think about the information processing we do while
shopping. Sometimes a simple sign, like a banner screaming "20% off!" or a cute salesperson
saying that some garment looks good on us, convinces us to make a purchase. That's what
System 1-based shopping decisions are like.

At other times we wrack our brains about whether it's the right time or circumstance to
spend our money, whether the quality or price is quite right, what others will think of us, and
whether we will regret our decision after we walk out of the store. Such deliberations suggest
System 2 decision-making.

When it comes to evaluating the credibility of information, we have found that most of our
students start this class using System 1 processing. This means that they pick up on simplis-
tic signals in the information they are evaluating -- heuristics -- and use these to make their
credibility judgments.

Some of our students' favorite heuristics are a website's top-level domain (e.g., Does the infor-
mation come from a .com website?), an author's credentials (e.g., Does the author have a
Ph.D.?), and whether an article shows its sources (e.g., Does it have a bibliography or a Works
Cited page?). Our students also often invoke the "I checked the information in two sources"
heuristic. And all of our students assert that Wikipedia is not a good source of information,
even though all of them regularly use Wikipedia as a source of information.

As a result of using the heuristics they have relied on for years, and System 1 processing, our
students tend to start this class with credibility evaluations that are pretty shallow and not
well-thought out.

Your credibility is too valuable to rest on heuristics. Before using a source in your writing or
in other media you produce, you need to consider carefully whether the source will add to or
diminish your credibility.

In this and in the next three chapters, we present and practice evaluation tools that will help
70  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

you consider the credibility of information at the systematic, deliberate, System 2 processing
level. These strategies are organized in order of intensity, from least to most intense. We start
in this chapter by discussing the CRAAP model and its shortcomings, and the importance of
distinguishing between primary and secondary sources, including how to rabbit-hole toward
primary sources. We end this chapter with a discussion of clickbait and content farms. We
hope that you will become proficient in all of these strategies, and use elements of all of them
whenever you have to consider the credibility of an information source.

Oh, CRAAP

CRAAP stands for currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, and purpose. It is a method for
evaluating information that has been taught to many students, in many schools, for many
years. You may have been taught CRAAP, or elements of it, in your prior schooling.

CRAAP may be a good place to start with credibility evaluations, but we believe that this
method also leads students to rely too much on simple evaluation heuristics like the ones we
mentioned above.

As librarian Kevin Seeber has argued, a simple checklist for evaluating information does not
make sense in the face of the misinformation and disinformation that infiltrates our society
today. Seeber suggests that we spend more time mulling over CRAAP's five concepts.

If you have used CRAAP before, the evaluation tools we present in this book are like CRAAP
on steroids. If it's worked for you before, there is no reason to stop using CRAAP's framework.
Our goal is to help you think much harder about each of CRAAP's elements.

Primary and Secondary Sources

A key question that information experts must ask when coming across a new piece of infor-
mation is: Is this a primary source, or not?

The attribution chapter introduces and provides examples of primary and secondary sources.
Here, we consider what primary and secondary sources have to do with credibility.

A primary source generally is produced at the time of the event, according to a Society of
American Archivists (SAA) definition. Primary source documents contain first-hand and most
authoritative evidence of something being the case. Examples of primary sources include
EVALUATE INFORMATION VIGOROUSLY  71

diaries, interviews, photographs, letters, newspaper advertisements, news or audio footage,
official records and some government documents.

Secondary sources cite information from primary sources, or provide interpretation or analy-
sis of primary sources, according to the SAA definition. Examples include most news articles,
books and editorials.

Journalists and strategic communicators strive to be the secondary sources of the informa-
tion they present to their audiences. They rarely are the originators of information, that is, the
primary sources. So being the secondary source of information is the most credible position
for journalists and strategic communicators to hold.

It's like the game of telephone we played as kids: the closer we sat to the origin of the tele-
phone message, the more accurately we communicated the message to the next person in
the chain.

Establishing credibility by using credible sources lies in the ability to track down the primary
sources of information. Provenance, which means the origin of something, is particularly
important in journalism and mass communications. Only by looking at the primary source of
information can we be sure that a secondary source is accurate. As a future communication
professional, you need to develop an instinct to find and cite primary sources.

Rabbit-holing Bill Self's words

Let's consider an example of how primary and secondary sources work in journalistic
research.

Read this Kansas City Star article about KU men's basketball facing off against Syracuse, and
consider this question: Is this a primary or a secondary source?

Answer: It is a secondary source because it quotes the head coach, Bill Self, extensively about
the upcoming game and the status of his players.

Another question: If you also were writing an article or report about this game, or about the
team at this point in the season, would it be acceptable for you to use this article as the source
of Bill Self's quotes?

Answer: No, because that would make you a tertiary (that means, third) source of Self's words.
As a journalist, you want your work to be the secondary source, not further down the source
chain.
72  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

So how can we trace Self's quotes to the primary source? The process of tracing back a pri-
mary source is sometimes called rabbit-holing. Like a rabbit, we need to enter a tunnel of
sources that, ultimately, will lead to the primary source.

The caption of the primary image of the article states that Self spoke to reporters on Nov. 30,
2017. In other words, Self held a press conference on this date.

We know that there were plenty of other reporters at this event, so one of the local news sta-
tions might have recorded the press conference. But this would still be a secondary source,
and we want to find the primary source.

We know that KU Athletics has its own public affairs team that handles media relations and
communications for the team. So if we search for "KU Athletics press conference Syracuse,"
for instance, we might be able to track down first-hand evidence of this press conference.

Lucky us, on the KU Athletics website, there is a transcript and video of this press conference.
This is the primary source, the end of this rabbit hole. If you want to quote Bill Self in your
article or report, this is the source you will read and listen to, and then cite.

Who cares the most, and can pay for, being primary?

When tracking down primary sources, you should try to think of who has a vested interest in
preserving the information, and who might be able to afford to compile the information.

Think about it. KU Athletics would probably have the most interest in putting a recording of
the press conference out there. Doing so would ensure that the press would be able to report
on the upcoming game, even if they weren't able to send a reporter to the press conference.
It also would ensure that reporters accurately relayed what Self said. By putting the press
conference online, KU Athletics minimizes the chance of a news outlet misunderstanding and
misquoting its star coach.

But all of this publicity and accuracy comes at a cost. To record and transcribe a press con-
ference requires a lot of expensive video and audio equipment. You would likely also have to
pay several people to set up the press conference, communicate its happening to the press,
and record the whole thing. Then you need money for a person or program to transcribe
what was said, before you fork over some money for people to double-check the transcrip-
tion, write a press release, create the web posting, and send a notice out to folks that it was
all available. Did we mention that you would have to do this as quickly as possible so that the
information was still timely and accessible to the press to publish on their deadlines?
EVALUATE INFORMATION VIGOROUSLY  73

Being a primary source, or being the custodian of a primary source, requires a vested interest
and resources. Considering these two elements can help you efficiently identify and track
down primary sources.

Clickbait and Content Farms

Two other initial questions that anyone who comes across new information on the Internet
should ask are: Is this clickbait? and Am I on a content farm?

Clickbait is the intentional act of over-promising or otherwise misrepresenting -- in a head-
line, on social media, in an image, or in some combination of those -- what a reader is going
to find in an online story, according to Techcrunch. The Washington Post also described click-
bait as a teaser headline without context to what a news story is really about.

Why is clickbait not credible? It's because the quality of a clickbait article is secondary to the
article's ability to attract readers.

Clickbait is not about quality information, but about advertising rates and making money
from advertisements. Online publishers charge advertisers based on how many people view
(that is, click on) these publishers' content. The more traffic that a web page generates, the
more money a publisher can charge for the advertising space on this web page. Clickbait dri-
ves up traffic, which drives up advertising rates, which drives up publisher revenue.

Online publishers that specialize in clickbait are sometimes referred to as content farms or
content mills. A content farm is a website that exists solely for the purpose of generating
advertising revenue from content that produces a lot of interest and web traffic. The more
that a content farm can masquerade as a legitimate information source, the more likely it is
to dupe readers into clicking on its content.

Examples of content farms abound. Columbia Journalism Review reported that Slant mag-
azine incentivized their writers to generate clickbait. The magazine offered writers financial
kickbacks for every 500 clicks per three pieces they wrote per week. RealNewsRightNow is a
website that parodies media outlets by posting information that reads like legitimate news
headlines. The website was created solely to generate advertising revenue. And in the months
leading up to the 2016 presidential election, two men made thousands of dollars by posting
fake news stories about both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees on their
clickbait website LibertyWriters.

The insidious problem with clickbait is that because this content is engineered to match what
74  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

people search for, and because it generates a lot of web traffic, clickbait content tends to rank
high in Google search results. Since we tend not to look very deep in search results, we often
end up reading clickbait.

Activity: Get Primaried

      Below are two secondary sources. Select one of these sources and locate the primary
      source from which the secondary source was created. You must provide the hyperlink
      to the primary source and explain how you found and evaluated its credibility.

         This is a Lawrence Journal-World article about Lawrence commissioners debating
            regulations on where and when food trucks can operate in the city. This is a sec-
            ondary source.

         This is a KCUR radio story and its transcript about a study on the potential cost-sav-
            ings of using Uber in place of ambulances. This is a secondary source.

Go Lateral With Cues and Evidence

PETER BOBKOWSKI

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Identify a series of credibility cues for any information source you come across.
         Use lateral reading to organize the credibility evaluation process.
         Identify evidence to support your assessment of every credibility cue.
         Use credibility cues to decide whether an information source would contribute to or
            diminish your own credibility.

Fact-Checkers, Historians, and Stanford Undergrads

In this chapter, we introduce a strategy for evaluating the credibility of sources that's based,
in part, on a process called lateral reading, according to the online textbook Web Literacy for
Student Fact-Checkers by information educator Mike Caulfield. We put our own twist on this
process and call it the cue-and-evidence method, following a journal article by college librar-
ian Erin Daniels.
The usefulness of lateral reading was illustrated recently in a study from the Stanford History
Education Group (SHEG). In this study, Stanford researchers pitted professional fact checkers
76  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

against Stanford undergraduates and historians with Ph.D.s. They gave each group the same
article and a limited amount of time to figure out if the article was credible.

They found that fact checkers were always right when judging the validity of a piece. Sur-
prisingly, though, the historians got it right about half the time, and undergraduates did not
fare so well. Are you surprised that educated folks, undergraduates, like you, and professors,
struggled? The Stanford researchers were a bit taken aback as well. But they figured out the
difference in performance.

Fact-checkers all deployed a very similar technique for judging a news source, the Stanford
group found. Historians and students spent a lot of time reading an article in order to assess
its authority. Fact-checkers, on the other hand, spent as little as eight seconds looking at the
article before moving on to researching it. Essentially, once fact-checkers identified a credibil-
ity cue, they immediately started researching it in other browser tabs.

The Stanford group called this "reading laterally." Fact-checkers would see a name of an orga-
nization, for instance, and then pop open tabs in their browsers to find the organization's
website, Wikipedia entries and bibliographies about the organization, its staff, and its larger
field. They also checked out what other news sources had to say about the topic.

After gathering and weighing the results of their research, the fact-checkers then would
declare the source crap or not. In other words, the fact-checkers read, evaluated, and judged
information against the greater network of information. This does not mean that you simply
go with what the majority of other websites or people have to say about a topic. You use the
network to reason a source's credibility.

Add Cues and Evidence

Opening a tab for each new piece of information we want to search seems like good orga-
nizational practice. Our cue-and-evidence method, which we discuss in the remainder of this
chapter, provides directions for what to search in all these tabs.

The cue-and-evidence method consists of four steps. They are:

      Identify credibility cues.
      Examine each cue and collect evidence about it.
      Articulate how each cue contributes to or detracts from the overall credibility of the

         piece of information. Support each point with the evidence collected previously.
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  77

      Provide an overall credibility assessment.
Let's walk through each of these steps, and see how they work with a piece of information we
might come across in the results of a Google search.

Let's say that an assignment for your job requires you to learn and write about gluten and
gluten-free eating. Gluten-free diets have received considerable attention in recent years. You
may have friends or family members who have stopped eating gluten, or you may be fol-
lowing a gluten-free diet yourself. A Google search leads you to the article The Truth Behind
Gluten-Free: Is Gluten-Free a Fad by August McLaughlin on the website Livestrong.com.

The question before you is: Is this a credible enough article for you to cite in your own work?
In other words, will citing this article make you look credible?

Please read this article now and keep it open as we work through the remainder of this sec-
tion.

Identify All of the Cues

The first step in the cue-and-evidence method is to identify all of the cues that we can use
to evaluate this article's credibility. Let's go from the article's top to its bottom and list these
cues:

      Livestrong.com
      Article title
      Date
      Author
      Dominant image
      The article's substance, that is, the information the article provides
      The style in which the article is written
      The sources used in the article
      The ads that surround the article
This is not an exhaustive list; there may be other cues. But nine cues is a solid start.

To follow the lateral reading approach, we would open at least one new tab for each of these
cues. In some cases, we would open two or more tabs per cue. We would use these tabs
78  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

for the second step in the cue-and-evidence method: examine each cue and collect evidence
about it.

Examine Each Cue and Collect Evidence

Publisher

Most of the information we come across has a publisher, that is, it is one of a collection of
pieces of information published in the same place or on the same website. In this case, the
publisher is Livestrong.com. What should we be asking about this publisher?

A key question for any publisher concerns the presence of quality control. As we discussed in
the note-keeping chapter, established media organizations like newspapers, magazines, aca-
demic journals, book publishers, and television stations, employ layers of fact-checkers and
editors whose job it is to verify the accuracy of information before it is published in print or
on a website, or broadcast on TV. "To seek truth and report it" is the first principle of the Soci-
ety of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics. Serious news media organizations want to get
it right, and having a staff that ensures the accuracy of the information contributes to a pub-
lisher's credibility. The absence of a fact-checking staff and process, or the absence of infor-
mation about such resources, can detract from the publisher's credibility.

Another question that we can ask about a publisher is whether the publisher has a reputation
for being a credible source of information. Some publishers are considered credible because
of their long-standing record as reliable information sources. These organizations employ
reporters who specialize in specific issues or geographic areas, and have long-standing rela-
tionships with key sources on the issues or places they cover. The New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal, and Time magazine are just a few examples of established media organizations
that generally are considered authoritative and credible on the basis of their reputations.

Smaller, more regional media outlets, may have a similar level of authority about information
concerning the geographic regions where they operate. The Lawrence Journal-World, for
example, is the authoritative information source about Lawrence, Kansas, and its surround-
ings. Non-news organizations, also, can be credible by virtue of their authority on an issue.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, is the health and medical
authority in the United States. In the public records chapter, we look at documents and other
information published by local, state, and federal governments. These governments and their
agencies are the authoritative publishers of records and data over which they have jurisdic-
tion.
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  79

But what about a site like Livestrong.com that doesn't have an established reputation as an
information source? How to gather evidence about its credibility? And how do we answer the
first question, about its editorial process?

It is tempting here to rely only on what we know about Livestrong to evaluate this publisher.
Livestrong is a foundation established by the disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise funds
for cancer treatment and research. Armstrong is no longer involved in the foundation so we
shouldn't use Armstrong's lack of credibility as evidence against the credibility of the founda-
tion. Collecting money for cancer treatment and research seems like a noble cause, but is that
enough to judge Livestrong.com as a credible source of information?

Two places that we can use reliably to learn more about Livestrong.com is the website's About
link, and the WHOIS directory. Most websites provide some information about themselves on
an About or About Us page. Time for a new tab, to explore a link to Livestrong.com's About
page in the footer of the article page. It displays the organization's mission statement, and a
visual staff directory. Flipping through the staff positions, we see a few content editors, but
we also note the absence of fact-checkers. Curiously, the staff also does not include any writ-
ers. Most of the staff seems to be managers and engineers. This should give us some pause.

Next we see a statement that says "We are a proud licensing partner of the LIVESTRONG
Foundation." A licensing partner is not the foundation, so neither is this website the foun-
dation's website (because Livestrong.org is). Adidas is a licensing partner of the University of
Kansas but that doesn't make Adidas a credible source of information about anything that's
being researched or taught at KU. If the Livestrong Foundation is like KU in this partnership,
who is like Adidas? At the very bottom of the About page, in the right corner, there is a logo
that we haven't seen before for something called Leaf Group. New tab. The WHOIS direc-
tory, which provides information about the owners of Internet domains, confirms that Live-
strong.com is owned by a Santa Monica company called Leaf Group.

What is Leaf Group? This is a clue we need to resolve to understand fully the credibility of Live-
strong.com. Clicking on the logo in the bottom right and opening a new tab brings us to the
LeafGroup.com website, where we learn that this is a web publishing company that, in addi-
tion to Livestrong.com, also runs the websites Cuteness.com, DenyDesigns.com, eHow.com,
Hunker.com, Leaf.tv, Sapling.com, and Techwalla.com. It seems like Leaf Group is a content
creation company. But is it credible? Googling "Leaf Group" and browsing through the news
reports that pop up gives us a clearer picture.

We can search for news about the Leaf Group in a new tab. Leaf Group, formerly called
Demand Media, has been referred to as a content farm, which we discussed in the last chap-
ter. Demand Media has been criticized further for creating content to match the questions
80  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

people search for most frequently. For example, if the company noticed in Google search
data that people were searching for information about gluten-free diets, it would commission
an article on gluten-free diets. Finally, the reason why we didn't see any writers among Live-
strong.com's staff is that the company relies on freelance writers.

Using this evidence, we might collect evidence from all of our open tabs and write the follow-
ing summary of whether Livestrong.com contributes to or detracts from this article's credibil-
ity:

      Livestrong.com does not contribute to this article's credibility. [<- this is our conclu-
      sion; and here is our evidence ->] Livestrong.com relies on freelance writers, and
      employs only three content editors or managers, according to its about page and
      an article about its parent company. Its quality control resources, therefore, do not
      seem to be extensive, which does not contribute to this website's credibility. Live-
      strong.com's staff listing does not show anyone who is a health or nutrition special-
      ist, which further detracts from its credibility. Finally, Livestrong.com is part of Leaf
      Group, a large company whose purpose, judging from its website, does not seem to
      be to inform, but to maximize its advertising revenue by producing highly desirable
      content.

Phew! That was a very long evaluation of a single cue. But it was a complicated case. The next
few cues won't be as complex.

Article title and Date

Next on our list of cues is the article title, but evaluating this cue makes more sense after we
read the entire article. So let's save this cue for later.

Evaluating credibility based on the publication date concerns the timeliness or timelessness
of the topic. How important is it for information about this topic to be recent, or to come
from another specific time period? If the topic is continually developing, with new information
adding to our understanding of it, then we want the source to be as recent as possible.
For instance, new developments in how a wildfire spreads, or how the search for a missing
person unfolds, call for the most recent information sources. For other topics, especially
historical ones or ones that have remained stable over time, the fact that a source is contem-
poraneous to some event or issue in the past may contribute to that source's credibility. For
example, we may not need a source published yesterday to determine what Frederick Dou-
glass's next venture is.
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  81

In the case of our gluten-free diet article, how important is it that it be recent? This is a good
opportunity to open a new tab and look up gluten-free diets. Well, gluten-free diets have
gained in popularity among non-celiacs since 2009, and new research on these diets probably
is being published continually. So it seems important for a source on gluten-free diets to be
recent, but not necessarily published yesterday. The publication date of our article is October
3, 2017. Depending on when you are reading this, that may or may not seem recent enough.

Based on this reasoning, here's what we might write about how the article's publication date
contributes to its credibility:

      This article's publication date of Oct. 3, 2017 contributes to its credibility. (<-this is our
      conclusion, and here's our evidence ->) This is because gluten-free diets are a devel-
      oping topic. A credible source of information about these diets needs to be recent,
      therefore, but not necessarily published yesterday.

Author

We turn next to considering the article's author. Most of our students recognize that this is an
important cue to consider. In a recent exercise, more than two-thirds of our students wrote
about an article's author as a way of evaluating the article's credibility. So let's make sure that
we do this the right way.

An author contributes to the credibility of a source through authority over, expertise on, or
experience with the source's topic. Let's first list the places where we can find information
about the author's background. Some websites will link an author's byline (that is, the line
that says By So-and-so) to a summary of his or her biography and/or to a list of his or her
most recent articles. Alternately, the website's About page might provide a list of its writers,
along with their bios and links to their prior work. Outside of the home website, LinkedIn can
be a good source on an author's background. An efficient Google search strategy may be to
enclose the author's name in quotation marks, and follow it with a word related to the topic
of the source we are evaluating.

So how about August McLaughlin, the author of our gluten-free diet article? Where can we
find information that will help us determine if this author has authority, expertise, or experi-
ence with gluten-free diets or nutrition? Clicking the byline at the top of the article brings up
a pop-up window with the author's photo (which shows that August is a woman), and the fol-
lowing summary:
82  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

      August McLaughlin is a health and sexuality writer with more than 10 years of expe-
      rience as a nutritionist. Her work is featured in the Huffington Post, DAME Magazine,
      The Good Men Project and more. She specializes in eating disorders and loves con-
      necting with readers and writers via her blog and social media.

This summary contributes to this author's credibility because it lists nutrition as one of her
specialties. However, the summary provides no information to help us verify this expertise.
There are no clues about this writer's educational background, and other than a list of publi-
cations in which her work has been featured, we know nothing about the quality or quantity
of her expertise. It is curious that there are no links to this writer's other work. Anyone can be
a nutrition writer on the Internet these days, so we need more information to gauge whether
August McLaughlin is a credible one.

New tab and Google. Fortunately for us, "August McLaughlin" is not a common name, so find-
ing her LinkedIn page is not challenging, and the page appears to be thorough and updated.

Let's consider first her education. There are two entries: "Edison Inst.: MA program, holistic
nutrition," and "AFPA, IFA, St. Cloud State: CN, CPT, psychology, nutrition, fitness, communica-
tion." Since "Edison Inst." is not a household name, let's open up a new tab and Google it. It's
hard to know for sure, but this probably refers to the Edison Institute of Nutrition. Browsing
through this organization's website, we learn that it is a Canadian online program that offers
a one-year Diploma in Holistic Nutrition. The prerequisite for this program is a high school
diploma or its equivalent. There is no indication on this website that the institute offers an MA
degree (MA generally stands for Master of Arts), as the LinkedIn profile indicates. It is possible
that there was an MA program in the past, and that it is no longer offered. A cursory Google
search does not return any information about a former MA program at Edison Institute.

The other credential listed is even more difficult to decipher. In a new tab, Googling "AFPA,
IFA, St. Cloud State" does not lead to information about any programs at St. Cloud State Uni-
versity in Minnesota. In fact, the search afpa site:stcloudstate.edu returns zero results. New
tab, and Googling "AFPA" returns the organization American Fitness Professionals and Associ-
ates, which offers a host of certification programs for personal trainers, nutrition consultants,
and other fitness professionals.

Step back and think: when someone wants to use an educational credential to support his or
her credibility, isn't it best to be transparent about this credential, to specify exactly what it is,
and the institution that granted it? Professionals with solid and authentic educational qualifi-
cations have no need to hide behind educational acronyms that aren't easily verifiable.
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  83

One last education-related consideration: what does it take to be a nutritionist? New tab and
Google. Standards vary by state, but in Kansas, an individual has to be licensed as a registered
dietitian (RD) in order to legally practice in this profession (this should induce a flashback to
our licensing and credibility chapter). KU Medical Center's Department of Dietetics and Nutri-
tion lists these licensing requirements: a bachelor's degree in nutrition and dietetics from an
accredited program, supervised clinical practice, a national exam, and continuing education.
As far as we can tell from her LinkedIn, the article's author does not have the qualifications to
practice as a nutritionist in Kansas.

But education isn't everything. There are plenty of business and technology leaders who did
not complete college, or who are not educated formally in the fields in which they excel.
Does August McLaughlin's work experience tell us anything about her credibility? Back on her
LinkedIn page, there are two nutrition-related entries in her experience. She has been a self-
employed nutritionist since 2002, and she was a nutritional therapist at Bridges to Recovery
for nine years. New tab and Google. This is a company that runs three upscale residential
treatment homes for psychological conditions in southern California.

The author's LinkedIn also leads us to Girl Boner (new tab), a website and podcast she hosts
about women's sexual empowerment. The website contains a longer narrative about the
author's biography and experience, and a list of her articles. There is a lot of interesting read-
ing on these pages, but none of it adds to the author's authority as a nutrition expert. It
appears that the author's focus in her writing has been women's sexuality and, to a lesser
extent, eating disorders.

So let's summarize what we have found about whether the author contributes or detracts
from the article's credibility.

      The author does not contribute to the article's credibility. (<- this is our conclusion;
      here is our evidence ->) The author does have some background in nutrition, having
      worked for nine years as a nutritional therapist for a psychological treatment com-
      pany, according to her LinkedIn. The author does not appear to have the educational
      qualifications to practice as a Registered Dietitian, as outlined by KU Medical Center.
      The educational background she lists on LinkedIn is difficult to decipher. The author
      does seem to be a prolific producer of online content, but most of her writing is
      focused on women's sexuality. The author does not appear to be an expert on nutri-
      tion or the gluten-free diet.
84  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Dominant image

Next let's consider the article's dominant image. How can an image contribute to or detract
from the credibility of an article? Let's start with the latter. An image can detract from the
credibility of an article when it has nothing to do with the substance of the article. Images
drive web traffic. Web publishers sometimes drive web traffic to their websites by enticing
readers to click on links that feature compelling images. Then it turns out that the content of
the website has little to do with the image.

An image can contribute to the credibility of a source when it deepens the information that
the source presents, or provides additional evidence for this information.

The image that accompanies the gluten-free diets article shows a bunch of different grains,
oats, breads, and crackers. The caption underneath this photo does not elucidate what's in
the image. We can open up a tab and do a Google Image Search on the image (see the effec-
tive search chapter for instructions). This does not lead us to any other websites where this
image has been used. How would our understanding of the article change if the image was
absent? Probably not much. So the presence of the image may be neutral. Here's how we
might summarize our evaluation of this cue:

      The image that accompanies the article neither detracts from nor contributes to the
      article's credibility. Although it's unclear whether or not the food items pictured in
      the photo are gluten-free, the photo features grains and grain-based food, which are
      related directly to the article's topic. The photo illustrates the topic but does not add
      expand on the information discussed in the article.

Article content

Let's evaluate the article's substance, that is, the content or information this article presents.
Some of the questions we might ask to assess the article's credibility based on substance are:
Does the information seem factual? Is the information focused on a specific topic? Is the infor-
mation thorough? Is the information unique?

The article discusses, what appears to be, factual information about gluten, and about two
reasons why people tend to follow a gluten-free diet, which are celiac disease and gluten
intolerance. The article discusses symptoms of both these conditions. The article concludes
with several paragraphs listing gluten-free foods. The information presented in this article is
focused on gluten and gluten-free diets. But the information doesn't seem especially thor-
ough or unique. If we open up a new tab and find the Wikipedia article on gluten-free diets,
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  85

we note that it is about three times the length of the Livestrong.com article, and appears to
be more thorough than the article.

How to summarize the extent to which content contributes to the article's credibility?

      The article's content does not contribute to its credibility. (<- this is our conclusion;
      here's our evidence ->) The article provides, what appears to be, factual, focused
      information about gluten and gluten-free diets. It does not appear to be an especially
      insightful or thorough treatment of the subject, as compared to a Wikipedia article on
      the same topic.

Article title

Now that we have a good grasp on the article's content, we can go back and consider
whether the article's title, "The Truth Behind Gluten-Free: Is Gluten-Free A Fad?", contributes
or detracts from the article's credibility. The main criteria to consider is: Does the title accu-
rately reflect the substance of the article? In this case, the answer seems to be "no."

The title's "truth behind" element suggests that the article reveals some sort of heretofore
unknown or secret information. But this isn't the case. The article discusses, what seem to
be, basic facts and common-sense knowledge. The post-colon "Is Gluten-Free A Fad?", mean-
while, suggests that the article is focused on answering this question. While the answer is sug-
gested in the article, answering this question does not shape this article's structure. In both
cases, it seems like the title is designed to lure in readers for content that isn't there.

Comparing the title to the article's content suggests that this is a piece of clickbait. In sum:

      The title detracts from the article's credibility. (<- this is our conclusion; here's our evi-
      dence ->) The title does not reflect accurately the substance of the article, but seems
      designed to lure in readers. It suggests that the article provides unknown informa-
      tion (i.e., "the truth behind"), and focuses on answering a specific question (i.e., "is
      gluten-free a fad"), but the article does neither of these. Instead, it discusses basic
      information about gluten and gluten-free diets, and focuses on a subject matter that's
      broader than the fad question.

Writing style

Our third-last cue is the style in which the article is written. The article's style concerns the
86  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

author's tone, bias, whether or not the author uses persuasive language, as well as the quality
and organization of the writing.

Reading through the article, we might characterize the author's tone as neutral and infor-
mative. She does not use any emotion-charged language, there is no indication that she is
attempting to persuade us of anything, and any bias she might have toward gluten-free diets
is not evident. The writing is clear, it follows general standards of journalistic writing (i.e.,
short, informative, error-free paragraphs). The article is organized into four clear, distinctly
focused sections.

A summary of this evidence is as follows:

      The style in which the article is written contributes to its credibility. (<- this is our
      conclusion; here's our evidence ->) The writing style is informative and journalistically
      sound, and it does not contain any persuasive or biased language.

Sources

We come to sources, a credibility cue that our students in the past have used most frequently.
In a recent exercise, 85 percent of our students used an article's sources as criteria for evalu-
ating the article's credibility. There are several questions we should ask about sources.

First, should we expect the source we are evaluating to cite other sources? If we are looking
at a primary source of information, such as a public record or a transcript of a in interview,
then no, we would not expect a primary source to include other sources. We would expect
a secondary source, however, like most news sources, to indicate what are their sources of
information.

Once we determine that the source we are evaluating should show its sources, the next
question is: Does it? The standards for showing sources differ from one genre of writing to
another. In research articles and college essays, and in some books, sources are cited in text
and in a References or Works Cited page. Sometimes they're cited in footnotes or endnotes.
As you might now from the attribution chapter, this is not the standard for showing sources in
journalistic writing. In journalism, sources are fully identified and cited in text. Strategic com-
munication documents usually use a hybrid approach, identifying and citing sources in text,
and also including a References section.

Another convention of online journalistic writing is that online sources are linked to from an
article by way of embedded hyperlinks. This is a way for journalists to increase their trans-
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  87

parency. By providing links to their sources, journalists help their readers verify the accuracy
of the information they report. So the question we should also ask about sources in online
articles is: Are they linked?

The last and most significant question about sources is: Does the nature of the sources con-
tribute to or detract from the article's credibility. While each cited source could be examined
in as great a depth as the original source, a simple question may help us not get mired in an
infinite evaluation of sources: Is the cited source more credible than the original source?

So let's answer these questions for the gluten-free diet article. Should it show its sources? Yes,
it is a secondary source of information. Does it show sources? Yes. Since it is a piece of online
journalism, we expect it to identify and cite its sources in text, and we also expect it to link out
to its online sources. It cites and identifies its sources in text, but it does not link to them. This
last point detracts from the article's credibility.

Here are the sources the article cites.

      Minh-Hai Tran, a registered dietitian and owner of Mindful Nutrition in Seattle,

      National Foundation of Celiac Awareness,

      A 2011 Forbes magazine report, and

      Robyn Goldberg, a registered dietitian in Beverly Hills, Calif.
The article also cites the following source: Dr. Alessio Fasano, medical director of the Center
for Celiac Research and Treatment. If we look closely at how this source is cited, however,
it's clear that the Forbes magazine article cited this physician, and our article simply re-cites
him. This makes our article a tertiary source for Dr. Fasano, with the Forbes article being its
secondary source. Remember what we said about primary and secondary sources: A piece of
journalistic writing should be the secondary source of information, not a tertiary one. The way
that our article's author cites Dr. Fasano also suggests that she did not access this physician's
statement or research on her own. Had she done so, she would have been able to cite him
directly as a secondary source.

Looking at the four sources cited in the article, do they contribute to the article's credibility
by being more credible than the original article? Googling the websites of the two registered
dietitians in new tabs brings us to Minh-Hai Tran's website and Robyn Goldberg's website.
Based on information in these websites, these two dietitians appear to be more qualified to
speak on nutrition than the article's author.

Opening a new tab for the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness, we find that it is now
88  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

called Beyond Celiac, and the statistics in our article that are attributed to it are on its website.
It does appear to be more credible than our article.

Finally, in a new tab, we Google and find that this is probably the 2011 Forbes magazine article
(found using a search term with the operator site:forbes.com and a date restriction). This arti-
cle does cite Dr. Alessio Fasano, but it doesn't really say that "No hard statistics are available
for non-celiac gluten intolerance," which is the statement for which our article cites it. Over-
all, the Forbes article seems only slightly more credible than our article. It is more thorough,
it does use more sources, and it links to some of its sources, but Forbes is no more credible
as a source of information on gluten-free diet than Livestrong.com, and the Forbes article's
author is not more qualified than our article's author to write about this topic. So on balance,
the Forbes article does not contribute to the credibility of our article.

This is how we can sum up our examination of sources as a credibility cue:

      The article's sources contribute marginally to the article's credibility. (<- this is our
      conclusion; here's our evidence ->) The article does cite four sources, and three of
      them -- two registered dietitians (Minh-Hai Tran and Robyn Goldberg), and a celiac
      awareness nonprofit -- contribute to its credibility. However, the article does not link
      to its online sources, which diminishes its credibility. The content of the fourth source,
      a 2011 Forbes article on gluten-free diets, does not match what this article cites it for,
      and it is not a more credible source of information than the Livestrong.com article.
      The article also re-cites a source from the Forbes article, and it doesn't appear that
      the author accessed this source before citing it.

Ads

Our last credibility cue to examine are the ads that surround the article. Like most websites
run by for-profit media organizations, Livestrong.com content is encircled by advertising con-
tent. Advertisers purchse the ad space on these websites. Revenue from the ads is used to
pay for the work that goes into generating content and maintaining the website. In addition to
buying ad space, advertisers buy our (that is, the readers') eyes and our attention. In the trans-
action between content-providing websites and advertisers, we, the readers, are the com-
modity.

Does advertising featured next to an article detract from an article's credibility? In most cases,
no. But neither does advertising contribute to an article's credibility. Unless you are a purist
who believes that any profit motive ruins the credibility of an information source, advertising
is a necessary element of the news media environment.
GO LATERAL WITH CUES AND EVIDENCE  89

Undoubtedly, some ads are annoying, some ads are in bad taste, and some ads are designed
to distract us with compelling (or weird) images and headlines. At established, credible infor-
mation organizations, there is a clear differentiation between the editorial side of the busi-
ness, that is, the people who produce the news or other content, and the ad side, that is, those
who sell ad space. In many cases these days, the ads that are displayed on a website are not
controlled by the organization that runs the website, but by an ad company such as Google
Ads, TripleLift, or Taboola. Increasingly, the ads you see are tailored to your prior search and
browsing history, which are stored on your computer.

Our summary of this credibility cue is as follows:

      The ads that surround the article neither contribute to nor diminish its credibility. (<-
      this is our conclusion; here's our evidence ->) Advertising is a necessary element of
      the news media system, generating revenue that supports news organizations and
      the work they produce. The ads displayed alongside this article are no more or less
      credible than other ads displayed across the Internet.

Provide an Overall Credibility Assessment

Finally, we are ready for the fourth step of the cue-and-evidence system: To provide an overall
credibility assessment of this article, based on the nine credibility cues we examined. Recall
that the question we set out to answer is: If we used this article in our own writing about the
gluten-free diet, would using this article contribute to our credibility?

A simple answer: No. This article would not contribute to our credibility. In fact, by citing this
article in our work, we might jeopardize our credibility. It's best for us to find a more credible
source of information about gluten-free diets. Let's list the conclusions of all our cue evalua-
tions. If we were doing this for credit on an assignment, we would write each cue's full evalu-
ation summary here.

      Livestrong.com is not a credible publisher of gluten-free diet information because its
         purpose is to create highly desirable content and maximize its ad revenue.

      The title diminishes the article's credibility because it is misleading.
      The recent publication date contributes to the article's credibility.
      The article's author does not contribute to the article's credibility because she is not

         qualified as nutrition specialist.
      The dominant image neither contributes to nor detracts from the article's credibility. It
90  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         is relevant but does not enhance the article's content.
      The article's content does not contribute to its credibility. It appears factual but is not

         new or groundbreaking.
      The writing style contributes to the article's credibility because it appears unbiased,

         well-organized, and well written.
      The article's sources contribute marginally to its credibility. Sources are not linked

         from the article. Three of the sources are more credible than the article, but the
         fourth is not.
      The ads around the article neither contribute to nor detract from its credibility.

Activity: Publishers Weakly

      Evaluate the "publisher" cue for each of the following websites. Based on your evalua-
      tions, can you organize these websites into two or more different categories?

         Buzzfeed
         Cracked
         Crave
         Diply
         The Odyssey
         Upworthy

Tap Into a Credibility Network

KARNA YOUNGER

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Use four fact-checking moves to research the credibility of information.
         Identify critical questions to ask about the content of an information source.
         Use context culled from other sources to contextualize the credibility of an informa-
            tion source.

Going Deeper With the Tabs

In the previous chapter we walked through identifying and evaluating credibility cues. We pin-
pointed these cues (e.g., publisher, article title, date, etc.), and started opening lots of tabs
in our browsers to research the different elements. We pinpointed these cues, and started
opening lots of tabs in our browsers to research the different elements. If you followed along,
your browser probably looked something like this:

Looking at all those tabs is exhausting. But it's also what successful fact-checking looks like,
so let's get used to it.
92  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

In the Stanford study we mentioned at the beginning of the previous chapter, the fact-check-
ers were more adept at evaluating the credibility of information than historians and Stanford
undergrads. In addition to opening up a series of tabs, the fact-checkers read, evaluated, and
judged information against the greater network of information they accessed. This does not
mean that they simply went with what the majority of other websites or people had to say
about a topic. They used the network to reason a source's credibility.

In this chapter, we focus on four moves that the fact-checkers in the Stanford study repeat-
edly made. Our goal is to practice the cue-evidence method some more, while also drilling
down on some concepts that we didn't cover fully in the last chapter. The following list of
these moves is adapted from the textbook Web Literacy for Student Fact-Checkers by Mike
Caulfield. Using these moves can help us dial into the greater network of knowledge and
make an informed credibility call about an information source we are evaluating.

Check for previous work

Look around to see if someone else has already fact-checked the claim or provided a synthe-
sis of research. Checking for previous work allows you to weigh what you are reading against
other accounts, and determine what is fact and opinion. If you are researching an event that
occurred in the past, you may also look at things that have been published since the event
occurred. Also, "work" is not restricted to any information type or genre. You may look at pri-
mary or secondary sources or news articles, dictionary or encyclopedia entries, or scholarly
information. This process and those below involve opening a lot of tabs to research our work.

Go upstream to the source of the claim

This is another way of saying that we should rabbit hole, as we did in the chapter on primary
and secondary sources. Going upstream to the source means that we need to find some pri-
mary source(s) that relates to an author's claim. This could mean finding a video of an event
or an interview with someone who was directly involved. Comparing what a primary source
says against what our original source (typically a secondary source) argues will help us better
understand how the author of the secondary source is interpreting events or what bias the
person holds.

Read laterally

You already know this move: Start opening those new tabs. Reading laterally also should push

us to further question what possible interpretations and biases are put forth by our original
source and any primary sources we have found.

Circle back

Circling back helps us get our bearings in this maze of tabs. It reminds us to return to the
source we were originally assessing to evaluate different components. Think of this as the
repeat button. You can walk through this entire process for each credibility cue, for instance,
and circle back to the original source after successfully evaluating each cue.

This is not necessarily an ordered process. And, as you can tell from your above experience,
you will likely have to do this repeatedly. Not only for the cues in your original article, but also
for cues you find in the resources you are using to fact-check your original source. This could
get messy, which is why it is good to take good notes along the way.

Keep in mind, there can be some overlap between these steps. For instance, if you are eval-
uating an older claim or source, checking for previous work and reading laterally may yield
some of the same results. This is fine. But you should gather some history on the topic (pre-
vious work) and more current things (reading laterally).

First cues: Publisher and author

Let's walk through this process together with an article on Serena Williams published by The
New York Times.

Before we even begin reading the article, we ask ourselves if we trust the sources of infor-
mation, newspaper and the author. The New York Times is one of the nation's largest news-
papers and has been in business for a while. But we shouldn't just rely upon our knowledge,
but should go upstream to find some primary source material about the publication. If we
scroll to the footer of websites, we will often find information about the company. If we do
that now, we can click on The New York Times Company link to find out more about the Times
through its parent company.
94  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

This next page takes us down a rabbit hole. At a quick glance, we can see the paper has been
in business for over 100 years and has garnered some Pulitzer Prizes, journalism's top prize
for reporting. We can look at the leadership, but instead focus on standards and ethics to
learn more about their credibility standards.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  95

Here we can see that the publication claims to adhere to fairness, integrity, and truth. Below
this are explicit and lengthy explanations of their Guidelines of Integrity, which include their
fact-checking process, and a Ethical Journalism Guidebook, or their code of conduct for staff
members. We could cite these sources in our evaluation of the Times. For instance, we could
say that we believe the Times is a credible source because it is transparent about listing its
staff and policies, and that its policies carefully delineate the paper's fact-checking processes
and standards of ethics, which stipulate an adherence to reporting the truth.
96  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

We could also search laterally to see if other publications ever quote the Times. This search
yields a Wikipedia entry and numerous stories quoting Times reporting and analyzing their
business strategies, so we know that the Times is a well-known source of information that is
critically evaluated and relied upon by its peers.

Next, we turn to the author. Liz Robbins was a sports reporter for the Times back in 2009
when she wrote about Serena Williams's loss to Kim Clijsters at the United States Open.
The first thing we could do is search laterally and go upstream by clicking on her hyper-
linked name to scroll through her other writings at the Times. This tells us that she has most
recently been reporting on immigration. This is not too similar to the topic of professional
tennis, so we might ask why she is the reporter in this situation.

Continuing to search laterally, we plug her name and "New York Times" into a search, to see
what other sources say about her. This would yield her Twitter page. Here we read that she
currently covers immigration for the Times's metro section, but that she used to be a sports
reporter, is a cyclist, and published a book about some race. If we search for her book title
and her name, we find a listing on Amazon that tells us the book is about the New York City
Marathon.

Based on all of this information, we might tell ourselves that Robbins seems to have some
experience reporting on sports for one of the top newspapers in the nation, is an athlete her-
self, and has even published a book on a major sporting event, but that we are not certain
about her authority as an expert in tennis.

Then we can start reading the actual article.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  97

Next Cue: Content

The article focuses on how Williams forced to forfeit a match in the 2009 US Open after being
assessed a point penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Williams garnered the penalty after
she disagreed with a line judge's foot-fault call. Below you can read the reporter's summary
of events in her lede, that is, in the first paragraph of the article.
98  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Reading over the lede and maybe skimming over the subsequent paragraphs, we can start to
figure out the substance of the article. We know that Williams and Clijsters faced off in the
semifinals, and that Williams lost her temper just when she was serving to break the tie. Rob-
bins plays up how differently Williams and Clijsters acted from one another, positioning Cli-
jsters as "composed" and Williams as a vitrolic. It isn't until the fourth paragraph that Robbins
reveals what got under Williams's skin.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  99

We discover that the upsetting incident occurred during the second set of the game while
Williams was serving. At this point, a line judge foot faulted Williams, which caused Williams to
approach the line judge and shake a ball in the judge's face. Robbins cites courtside reporters
and television replays as her sources. The author could be citing other sources here because
she may not have been in a position to directly see or hear what Williams might have said to
the line judge.
100  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Possible questions to answer

At this point, we have been reading and skimming for several seconds. While we are trying
to understand the substance of the article, we probably have many questions that we can jot
down. In parenthesis we can note which of the four steps may help us answer our questions.
Between each question, we will circle back.

      What is is a foot fault and was it the correct call? (Check for previous work to fact
         check the author's claim that Williams' faulted before her reaction to the judge.)

      Why did Williams react like this? What really happened? (Go upstream to an original
         source to judge the author's style and sources)

      Was Williams's reaction really "shocking?" (Read laterally to determine if the article's
         substance and sources are supported by other resources)

This list is not exhaustive. Additionally, you could easily and correctly argue that different or
all four of Caulfield's steps could answer our questions. These are just a few ideas to work
through these steps together.

What is a foot fault?

First, let's check for previous work to see what a foot fault is and if someone else fact-checked
the claim that Williams faulted. Maybe another author could verify what Williams said to the
line judge. We open the next tab and Google "foot fault" in quotes. We might also add the
term tennis to this.

Some of our top results are dictionary definitions, which can be useful. But then we spot an
interview with a former line umpire from National Public Radio (NPR) that was published at
the same time as the Times article. We can listen to the audio or read the transcript of the
radio interview.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  101

This source tells us that a foot fault is when a player touches the baseline, or line at the back
of the court, while serving the ball in tennis. However, the former umpire equivocates on
whether or not Williams did commit a foot fault.

The umpire states that he has only seen footage of the match, and that he could not tell from
the angle whether or not Williams touched the line. He does seem to support the line judge
who made the call, explaining that she "absolutely" would have known if Williams committed
a foot fault from her vantage point.

As we mapped out in the previous two chapters, we could then go down the rabbit hole,
researching the NPR interview's primary sources. For instance, we could research the reliabil-
ity of NPR as a source, the background of the NPR reporter, or the former line judge's career
to verify his credibility as a source. We will not go down these rabbit holes for the sake of time
and, instead, we will circle back to our larger question of whether or not Williams committed
a foot fault, knowing what a foot fault is, but still questioning what actually happened.

Was it the correct call?

Back with the Times article, we can take a closer look at what sources Robbins cites when
describing what happened. Robbins is pulling this information from "reporters courtside and
television replays."
102  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Later in the article, Robbins gets a bit more specific. She refers to audio from CBS's broadcast
of the match and The Miami Herald.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  103

The author has given us two sources. First, the broadcast of the match would be a primary
source that might yield more results. We know that the video might not give us exactly what
we want. Robbins was able to listen to Williams on the CBS broadcast, but the umpire inter-
viewed by NPR couldn't quite see if the call was fair. We should search for similar coverage
to evaluate the happening ourselves. Additionally, The Miami Herald and other "courtside
reporters" covered the event, so we can be certain to find other accounts to play off Robbins's
account and our own interpretation of the video.
104  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

To get our bearings on the situation, we will swim upstream to the source. In this particular
case, it is to a video of the match brought to us by YouTube. Keep in mind, YouTube often
has several different versions of a video, so you should take time to consider all of the possi-
bilities. This version was the one that provides us with a decent view of Williams's serve and
some snippets of the courtside conversation.

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://otn.press-
books.pub/becredible/?p=64

After reviewing the video, we could make some judgement calls. First, we might be willing to
say whether or not we agree with the line judge's call. The umpire interviewed by NPR said he
couldn't tell from the video he watched. Can you tell from this video if Williams faulted?

Additionally, we can notice other elements of the scene. We can witness Williams's interaction
with the line judge and other tennis officials, deliberating whether or not she became
"unhinged in a shocking display of vitriol and profanity," as Robbins described. Would you
describe Williams's behavior with these words? Can you hear what she said to the line judge?
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  105

What about her verbal exchange with other tennis officials. What does this interaction tell
you? What about Williams's exchange with Clijsters?

We also can notice the behavior of the crowd, the Williams family, camera-toting courtside
press, and other tennis officials. Do they act shocked? As a primary source, the video provides
us with greater context to judge the credibility of our Times article. It places us in the shoes of
Robbins, and pushes us to understand and interpret what happened.

What do other sources say?

Now that we have witnessed the event as best as we could without actually being at the
match, let's get some other reportings by reading laterally. We will focus on some of the
claims and content of the article, and compare it to primary and secondary sources. This will
enable us to weigh our own interpretation of events against the viewpoints of the Times's
Robbins and even the umpire interviewed by NPR.

We can read the different opinions and interpretations to see what other evidence is out
there, and, based on the evidence, which argument we most agree with. Ultimately, even
though these additional sources may not directly address the Times article, they will help us
evaluate the Times article by reinforcing or contradicting Robbins's argument or by introduc-
ing new information.

A quick Google search yields an article from The Christian Science Monitor that promises to
introduce new information. Robbins was not certain of what Williams said the the line judge.
The Monitor provides the missing evidence of what Williams actually said. (If you are unfa-
miliar with the Monitor, you could skim the about section to learn more about its editorial
policies and history to research its credibility or search for what other reputable publications
have to say about its bias.)
106  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Mark Sappenfield's account does not contradict Robbins's reporting. He does offer more
detailed first-hand accounts of the what happened though, including what Williams said to
the judge.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  107

By citing other reporters who were at the scene, Sappenfield followed the same reporting
techniques and sourcing that Robbins did for the Times. Unlike Robbins, Sappenfield named
his sources, making it easier for readers to fact-check and judge the credibility of Sappen-
field's account.

For instance, we can deduce that Sappenfield's quotation from a CBS outlet could be reliable
because, as we know from Robbins's account and our video searches, CBS broadcast the
match. Sappenfield even tells us how close one of his sources was to the court, enabling us to
postulate if the source would be physically able to hear and see what happened on the court.
108  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

As a result of his research, Sappenfield provided quotes of what Williams said, filling in that
piece of the puzzle for us.

Next, it is important to note how Sappenfield's approach to the story and style differs from
Robbins's approach. As you recall, Robbins's coverage largely compared Williams's behavior
to her competitor, Clijsters. Sappenfield places Williams's "spectacular meltdown" within the
broader history of players being driven "over the edge" by foot-fault calls.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  109

By focusing on similar behavior exhibited by other players, Sappenfield gives us more infor-
mation about the culture of tennis. Perhaps the author's biggest insight is that there is an
unspoken rule that foot-fault infractions are not called during pivotal match moments, such
as Williams' serving match point (or being one point away from losing). Learning how other
players have literally protested officials for making such calls at "important moments" helps
us understand that Williams's behavior is maybe not as anomalous as we initially thought.

Sappenfield's placing of Serena Williams's reaction in this broader context of tennis culture
and players' expectations and behaviors does not invalidate Robbins's coverage of the event.
But if it is so common for players to get upset over untimely foot fault calls, why was it such
a big deal that Williams acted this way? It might make us wonder if Robbins treated Williams
fairly in her coverage, or if she provided us with adequate context for the event.

What about a previous tennis match?

At this point, we should circle back to re-examine the tone in the Times article. We can
see that Robbins did provide her readers some greater context, but focused on the history
between Williams and Clijsters. This is something we have not garnered from other sources,
so it can help us see the situation from this lens. Robbins details that Clijsters and Williams
played against each other before at Indian Wells Masters in California. Despite the fact that
Williams won the 2001 match, she has not played at Indian Wells since. Williams and her sis-
ter Venus have remained absent because the crowd hurled racial epithets toward them.
110  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Even though Clijsters said the 2009 US Open was "a completely different situation" from
Indian Wells, we can make a note that the crowd's racist taunts left a lasting impression on
Williams and influenced her playing decisions. To investigate Robbins's reporting further, we
can examine what other sources have to say about the Indian Wells match-up or the influence
of race on Williams's career in general.

To find other sources on Indian Wells Masters, we could check for previous work to learn
more about the tournament or to see what was written at the time about the Williams-Cli-
jsters match and related racial taunts. Or we could go upstream for a recording of the match
to verify what happened. Finally, we would then read laterally to see fact-check different
cues.

For the sake of brevity, however, we will skip researching the Indian Wells tangent, and focus
on reading laterally about the aspects of race and racism that Robbins touched upon. Again,
we will take to Google.
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  111

Racism in tennis?

We could try searching for "Serena Williams racism." This will give us a host of articles: another
tennis player padded her shorts and chest in an imitation of Williams during a match, a for-
mer grand slam winner was once banned from tennis and fined for his racist comments
about Williams's unborn child, and Williams has argued for equal wages for black women in
Fortune magazine. Anyone of these could be useful if we wanted evidence that Williams has
encountered racism during her career.

We are specifically examining the 2009 US Open, though. So we could add that to our search
terms. Because we already have done one sweep of the 2009 US Open coverage when we
retrieved The Christian Science Monitor article, we should strive to find a source that we
wouldn't ordinarily read. Scrolling through the results leads us to a post, Referring Serena:
Racism, Anger, and U.S. (Women's) Tennis, on "The Crunk Feminist Collection" blog. Accord-
ing to the headline and first couple of paragraphs, the post promises to dissect the roles that
race and racism have played in the press's coverage of the Williams sisters and in their tennis
careers.
112  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Before we dive into reading the article, we should first see if it is worth our while. Or if we
think it might be credible. We will start reading laterally again, by checking out who wrote it
and then the "About" section on the blog.

First, we can note that this post is filed under the anonymous name of "crunktastic." To figure
out who might be publishing under this name, we should hop over to the "People" section for
a full list of staff and writers.

Here, we see a full list of contributors to the blog. None of them are listed under the
name "crunktastic," so we might assume that this posting was an anonymous post that was
approved by the administrators of the blog. Skimming through the authors' biographies, we
read that many of the people identify as feminists and scholars. Most of them hold their
Ph.D.s and professorships at prominent American universities.

Then we notice one of the two co-founders, Brittney C. Cooper, refers to herself as "Crunk-
tastic" in her biography. So we have found our author! We see she holds a Ph.D. from Emory
University and is a assistant professor in Women's and Gender Studies and Africana Studies
at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and that she focuses her research on Black
feminist thought and Black women's intellectual history.

We then laterally search for Cooper to verify her academic appointment and to see what
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  113

else she has written. This will help us confirm that she is a researcher and expert in the field
of black feminism. We can confirm her department affiliations at Rutgers, take a peek at her
Twitter account, and read an National Public Radio (NPR) interview she had about dealing with
racism before going upstream and landing on a primary source, her curriculum vitae (CV or
academic resume) posted on her personal website.

Culling information from these sources, we can deduce that she has published a fair amount
in her field. Though there is no evidence that she is an expert in tennis, she has written books
and several articles on race, racism, and women, and even about how these areas relate to
popular culture. NPR views her as a reliable source of information on these topics, and Rut-
gers has recently gave her an award as well. Cooper has been promoted to associate profes-
sor at Rutgers as a result of her scholarship. We could use all of this as evidence that Cooper
is an educated and reliable authority to address the ways race may have impacted Williams's
tennis career and performance.
114  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Why did Williams react like this: The alternative perspective

Let's jump back to the blog post and read what "Crunktastic" Cooper has to say. Writing two
years after the 2009 US Open, Cooper is responding to an incident at the 2011 US Open that
reminded her of the match we are studying. During the 2011 tournament, Williams disagreed
with a referee's ruling. "Serena gave the ref the business for the next three games," Cooper
writes, because Williams mistakenly believed the referee was the same referee who "screwed
me over last time." Williams' incorrect identification of the referee is beside the point, Cooper
implicitly contends. The point of the situation is how Williams's anger is depicted and inter-
preted by the press.

Cooper lays out how the press and US Tennis Association are much harder on Williams than
on her white male peers, such as John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors, who also are guilty of hav-
ing their own emotional outbursts on the court. To begin, Cooper summarizes that the press
has a long history of labeling the Williams sisters as "hypermasculine, unattractive women
overpowering dainty white female tennis players."

Citing specific sports announcer and analysts, Cooper provides numerous quotes about the
Williams sisters that focus on their physical strength while failing to acknowledge their intel-
lect, but emphasizing that of white players. Drawing on her academic training, Cooper deter-
mines that Williams's outbursts in 2009 and 2011 and the press's portrayal of them could
"reinforce stereotypes of the Angry Black Woman."
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  115

Such misrepresentation of Williams, Cooper explains, feeds a narrative of white supremacy
that is played out through officials and the press policing Williams's behavior. To prove her
point, Cooper cites the fact that Williams was levied the largest fine in US Tennis Association
history, $82,500, for the 2009 incident. This is a much larger fine than any of Williams's white
male predecessors and colleagues have received.

Cooper reminds her readers that in 2011, the tennis association seemingly celebrated one of
Connors's outbursts in a highlight reel at that year's tournament. The author contended that
the association wishes to curb and control Williams's anger but essentially encourages white
men to express theirs by celebrating them with highlight reels.

Cooper has a different take on Williams's behavior. She argues that rather than an angry black
woman who cannot control her emotions, the player should be understood as resisting the
prejudices she has encountered as a black woman playing in a historically white sport.

In this sense, the press and the association are the ones who should be punished for further-
ing negative stereotypes of black players, specifically women. Williams's arguments with ref-
erees should be understood as her striking out against such racial injustices.

This is a lot to digest, but Cooper gives us a perspective that has not been covered by any of
the other reports we have read.

Cooper also leads us to circle back to Robbins's New York Times article. With Cooper's criti-
cism in mind, we can take a second look at the language Robbins used to describe Williams
and Clijsters, and begin to question her writing style.
116                                     PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

The original article's tone in context

In the opening passage above, we can see that Robbins used the adjectives "ugly and improb-
able spectacle" to describe Williams's actions. She depicts Williams as "frustrated" and behav-
ing "angrily" throughout the match as she whacked the net with her racket before appearing
to "threaten" the judge.

Clijsters, meanwhile, is drawn as the "composed" player who "dominated Williams all night."
In the middle of describing the ways in which Clijsters remained calm and in control, Robbins
TAP INTO A CREDIBILITY NETWORK  117

lets it drop that Clijsters "is the mother of a toddler." Why would Robbins mention this? Tod-
dlers, going through a major development stage, are known for their tantrums.

The author's description of Williams's behavior focuses on the player's anger, physical dis-
plays of frustration, and seemingly lack of control throughout the match. Is Robbins paral-
lelling Williams's behavior to that of a two year old having a tantrum? Clijsters, it is implied,
was able to remain calm because she likely was used to such behavior from her toddler.
Williams's behavior, Robbins concludes, prevented Clijsters from celebrating her "joyful"
return to tennis and her skilled play.

Notice some things? Thinking back to Cooper's blog post about the portrayal of Williams as
an "angry black woman," we might have a new string of questions and ideas about the cred-
ibility of this Times article. Did Robbins unfairly portray Williams as an angry black woman?
What does Clijsters's motherhood and toddler really have to do with the match? Who did Rob-
bins view as the skilled player in this match? Did Robbins appear to favor one player over the
other? Why?

We found that Robbins provids us plenty of verifiable facts about the match. Williams did say
something to the line judge, which resulted in her being assessed a penalty and losing the
match. We had to seek out other sources to know what was said and to determine for our-
selves if Williams did commit a foot fault.

But the author's language may have us second-guessing if she treats Williams fairly in the
article. She does focus a great deal on Williams's anger and singularized it as unusual behav-
ior. Sappenfield and Cooper maintain that white men have a long history of getting angry on
the court with far fewer negative consequences from the tennis association and the media.
Finally, Robbins does seem to emphasize Clijsters's ability to control her anger and her skillful
play, which might imply that Clijsters had some sort of mental and emotional superiority to
Williams. This, we know, Cooper would fault as a plotline in a false narrative of white superi-
ority.

Is This Article Credible Enough To Cite?

In the end, we very well could use the Robbins article in our writing, but note that it is not a
perfect source. We could say that the substance of the article, or the fact that Williams lost
the match after being assessed a penalty, is credible.

But we also discovered that other reporters were able to uncover more information by using
different sources than Robbins. So we would need to supplement the article with other
118  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

sources that provide greater detail about what Williams said, and, perhaps, our own reading
of the call based on the recording of the game.

We might, moreover, question the tone of the article. To do this, we, again, would need to use
different sources than Robbins. We could cite Cooper's blog posting, or maybe dig deeper to
read academic sources written by Cooper or other scholars about black feminism, the angry
black woman stereotype, or race and racism in tennis. Based on this evidence, we might ques-
tion whether Robbins was unfairly hard on Williams. Following Sappenfield and Cooper, we
might even compare Williams's actions to McEnroe, Connors, or other players who have lost
their cool over a foot-fault call. All of this would provide our readers with greater context and
understanding of the 2009 match between Williams and Clijsters.
CHAPTER 9

Contend With Bias

KARNA YOUNGER AND CALLIE BRANSTITER

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Distinguish between explicit and implicit bias.
         Define a number of bias categories.
         Identify bias in an information source.
         Discuss biases in search engine results.
         Include diverse perspectives when considering the credibility of information
            sources.

What Is Bias?

When evaluating the credibility of information, it is important to consider its bias. Bias is the
"inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group, especially in a way considered to
be unfair," according to Oxford Living Dictionaries. Think back to our discussion in a previous
chapter of Liz Robbins's coverage of Serena Williams for The New York Times, and how bias
factored into our evaluation. Though somewhat subtle, there were hints that Robbins seemed
to favor and maternalize the white Kim Clijsters while alternatively infantilizing or portraying
Williams as an "angry black woman."
120  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

You may also remember that one time Pepsi partnered with Kendall Jenner to appropriate
the Black Lives Matter movement to sell some soda. Audiences were quick to call foul, and
Pepsi pulled the "tone deaf" ad. Roxanne Gay, a bestselling author and associate professor
of English at Purdue University, for one, called out Pepsi for its bias and not including black
people in the creation of the video. She argued on Twitter that if creators had sought more
perspectives beforehand, the commercial likely would not have made it to air.

In this chapter, we will define several categories of bias, and discuss how they may manifest
in the information we evaluate, or in information we produce.

Implicit and explicit bias

At the outset, it is important to acknowledge that all information is biased in some way.
There are two primary types of bias: explicit and implicit. The Office of Diversity and Outreach
at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) offers an easy way to distinguish between
the two. Explicit bias is a conscious bias, meaning that we are aware of it. Implicit bias is a bias
we are unconscious of, or that we don't even realize we hold.

Implicit bias starts taking root during our early childhood, so that by the time we are in middle
school we already hold prejudices against certain groups, even if this runs against our con-
scious morals or ethics. The good news, though, is that our implicit biases can change, and
are often more of a product of our environment than anything else, researchers find.

Implicit and explicit bias become problems because of the way our brain processes informa-
tion. In the first chapter on evaluating sources, we discussed how psychologists say that we
either process information quickly based on our prior knowledge, or that we are very delib-
erative and think critically about information. We rely upon our biases when we make quick
CONTEND WITH BIAS  121

decisions but can override such preconditions when we think deliberately and critically. There
really isn't a clear cut way to "teach" ourselves how to become better critical thinkers, cogni-
tive psychologist Daniel T. Willingham says, but it is possible, and anyone can do it. Among his
suggestions, Willingham has found that learning deeply about a subject, drawing from and
challenging our life experiences, and developing critically thinking strategies to follow when
evaluating information, help us avoid cognitive biases.

In this chapter we identify some of the biases you may encounter while evaluating and creat-
ing information. There are over 170 identified cognitive biases, and we will cover only a small
number of these. Learning and about and improving our own biases is a lifelong process that
cannot be summarized in a short chapter. In order to help you down this path, though, we
will conclude our discussions of biases with some strategies communications professionals
use in their work to overcome bias.

Categories of Bias

Cognitive bias

Cognitive bias is an error in judgment as the result of our own implicit or explicit bias. Many
biases stem from cognitive bias, and these biases have lasting effects on how we choose to
consume information and news.

As information specialist Lane Wilkinson explains, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 loos-
ened federal restrictions of media ownership. This legislation allowed mass communication
companies, such as cable news companies, to compete with one another. The result was that
for these companies, increasing shareholder value became much more important than main-
taining their journalistic integrity. This, in turn, segmented the news media and the general
public, with some people gravitating to some news outlets and completely avoiding others.

The filter bubble phenomenon, which we discuss more in a later chapter, has been fueled by
this segmentation. Filter bubbles refer to our tendency to consume news and other informa-
tion that support our preconceived notions, and to reject information that challenges these
notions. Three categories of cognitive bias seem to sustain these filter bubbles:

      The Hostile Media Effect is one such cognitive bias with roots in mass communication
         theory. It is the tendency of those with strong opinions or beliefs to assume that the
         mass media is against them, in favor of the counter point of view.

      The Dunning Kruger Effect is another form of cognitive bias about overconfidence. It is
         the tendency of those with low ability or knowledge of a topic to overestimate their
122  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         competency in that topic.
      Confirmation bias occurs when we only seek out and trust sources of information that

         confirm our own opinions. Have you ever chosen a topic for a research paper and
         sought out sources that only confirmed your thesis of that topic? That is an example
         of confirmation bias. Biases shape filter bubbles in which we consume information
         and, as you will read below, play into cultural biases as well.

Gender

In November 2017, NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie announced live on the Today show
the her co-host, Matt Lauer, had been terminated due to revelations of sexual misconduct.
While he was officially terminated as the result of one specific incident involving an anony-
mous NBC News colleague, there was reason to believe that this was not an isolated incident,
but rather an ongoing cycle of systemic sexual harassment involving Lauer at NBC News.

In light of his termination, USA Today published a video compilation of moments in which
Lauer exhibited sexist or crude behavior during interviews of prominent celebrities and politi-
cians, including a moderated discussion between Hillary Clinton and then-Presidential can-
didate Donald Trump. While Lauer grilled Clinton on her use of a private email server, he
breezed through his conversation with Trump. It can be argued that, based on the totality of
these instances, Lauer exhibited gedner bias.

Race

The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which has
taken a programmatic response to defeating racism and other forms of discrimination glob-
ally, defines racism as follows:

"Racism is a theory of races hierarchy which argues that the superior race should be pre-
served and should dominate the others. Racism can also be an unfair attitude towards
another ethnic group. Finally racism can also be defined as a violent hostility against a social
group."

UNESCO's definition is incredibly broad for a reason. Racism can take many forms, and may
be encountered through a number of overt racial macro-aggressions, such as the time people
marched down Lawrence's Massachusetts Street with versions of the Confederate battle flag,
and more subtle micro-aggressions.
CONTEND WITH BIAS  123

Such racial aggressions are able to occur because of white privilege. White privilege is "an
invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day," as Women's
Studies Scholar Peggy McIntosh defined it in her seminal essay, White Privilege: Unpacking
the Invisible Knapsack. In this piece, McIntosh delineates the ways in which whites are "care-
fully taught" not to recognize how they benefit daily from various forms of racism and the
racial hierarchy. Her examples include being able to socialize with people in their own racial
group and disassociate from people they've been "trained to mistrust and who have learned
to mistrust my kind or me." In other words, white people can choose to only associate with
white people and get by just fine, whereas a group of non-white people might raise suspi-
cions.

Ethnicity

Ethnic prejudice is a close sibling to racism, and the two and are often conflatable. Ethnic big-
otry also occurs through similar acts of micro- and macro-aggressions.

Particular to the area of journalism, ethnic biases have come to the forefront when the media
reports on Latinx communities and on the topic of immigration. For example, Cecilia Men-
jvar, a KU Foundation Distinguished Professor of Sociology, has found that negative media
portrayals of Latinx immigrants often reinforce negative stereotypes of Latinx people, which
leaves Latinx people striving to debunk such misperceptions in their daily lives. Joseph Erba,
assistant professor of journalism at KU, likewise found that such stereotypes threatened the
experience of Latinx college students, forcing them to combat the negative perceptions of
their non-Latinx classmates throughout their time on campus.

Corporate bias

Corporate bias occurs when an information agency is biased toward the interests of its own-
ership or financial backing, such as an employer, client, or advertiser.

A recent example of corporate bias occurred at Newsweek. In early 2018, Buzzfeed broke
the news that the publisher of Newsweek and International Business Times (IBT), Newsweek
Media Group (NMG) had been buying web traffic to inflate its advertising rates and sales. In
other words, NMG had committed ad fraud involving US government ads.

One Manhattan District Attorney's raid later, Newsweek reported that the magazine was
under investigation, in part, because of it was sending millions of dollars to Olivet University,
a Christian university founded by David Jang. NMG's journalistic practices have been scruti-
124  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

nized in the past, but NMG management soon had just about enough of this negative press
from its own publication.

A serious breach of journalistic ethics occurred while Newsweek investigated NMG's advertis-
ing practices and its connections to Olivet University. NMG's actions demonstrate how corpo-
rate bias can influence the production of a story. First, NMG management fired a reporter,
and its executive editor and editor-in-chief. All played roles in reporting on NMG's scandals.
Next, NMG launched an internal review during which NMG management directly questioned
sources, tried to strong-arm reporters into revealing their anonymous sources, and showed
drafts of the article to subjects of the story.

The Society of Professional Journalists commands that journalists "resist internal and external
pressure to influence coverage." By revealing the article to subjects, NMG management
directly applied such pressure to its editorial staff in hopes of altering content. In other words,
the corporate entity tried to control the editorial content of Newsweek.

Rather than being bullied into submission, CNNMoney reported, Newsweek staffers contin-
ued working on the story outside of the office. NMG allowed them to publish the story only
after they threatened to resign. The story ran under a disclaimer explaining Newsweek's
struggles to publish the article and a promise that the content of the story was free of corpo-
rate bias. The company's owners promised Newsweek "newsroom autonomy going forward."
But, judging by its past, the future appears to be dubious for Newsweek.

In advertising and strategic communications, corporate bias is part of the nature of the work.
Your client essentially pays you to represent them in a positive light. But you have to walk an
ethical line when doing so. Advertisers must remain mindful of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion (FTC), which enforces truth-in-advertising laws, and PR practitioners guided by the Public
Relations Society of America's code of ethics.

In your role as a communicator, you act as a type of intermediary between the public and
your client. Even though your client may pay you to promote them or their product, you must
do so with best the interest of the public in mind. For instance, if you represent a celebrity
who is paid to Instagram themselves with products, you will have to remind them to clearly
state that it is a paid advertisement and not just a cute photo in order to adhere to the FTC's
advertising regulations.

Or, if you are developing an ad campaign for Rice Krispies cereal, you should make certain
that scientists have verified that the cereal will boost a child's immunity. When the FTC fined
Kellogg's for not backing up such a claim with scientific evidence, the cereal company had to
pull all advertising that sported this claim.
CONTEND WITH BIAS                                                                                               125

It can be difficult to talk a client down from Instagramming their way to a new beach house
or from promising that curing all ills is a snap, crackle, pop. But this is why communicators
must establish good agency-client relationships that value transparency (so they will tell you
the truth) and clear and collaborative communications (so that they can tell you the truth).

Algorithms: Human-inspired bias

In her book Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, Safiya Umoja
Noble details the biases inherent in Google searches. Much of her research stems from a
2010 incident in which the top results of a Google search of "black girls" yielded explicit porno-
graphic content. Noble argues that these primary representations of black women in Google
searches are representative of a "corporate logic of either willful neglect or a profit imperative
that makes money from racism and sexism." You can watch this video to learn more about
Noble's work.

In his book, The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is hiding from you, internet activist Eli Pariser
predicted that personalization and Google News would forever change the media's role in
democratic societies. He summarizes his argument in the following TED Talk video:

A TED element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://otn.press-
books.pub/becredible/?p=68
126  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Historically, Pariser argues, the media has acted as the informed mediator between politi-
cians and voters, who typically read one preferred newspaper to inform their decisions. Now,
though, people can access a variety of sources indirectly through Google News. Google News,
like all Google products, is designed to create a personalized experience and provide people
with information that they prefer to read.

The problem with this, Pariser warns, is overpersonalization, which can exclude important
news from a person's feed completely because it does not fit with someone's reading profile,
or it just isn't really popular. In other words, depending on your preferences and reading his-
tory, you may not know if our country goes to war, but you'll be totally up on who won this
year's Puppy Bowl.

Bias in Journalism

Let us not despair that all is lost to bias. By being aware of our own biases, we can mindfully
work to produce more balanced and inclusive work. According to Harvard's Project Implicit,
"If we want to treat people in a way that reflects our values, then it is critical to be mindful of
hidden biases that may influence our actions."

Taking an implicit bias test, reflecting upon its results, and intentionally countering our own
biases is one important step we may wish to take. Below, we share how some professional
journalists have worked to counter their own biases to benefit their work.

One Atlantic Monthly reporter was shocked to realize that he only quoted women 23 percent
of the time across 24 articles, and that 35 percent of the time he didn't include any female
voices in his writing at all. Ed Yong frequently covers the field of science, which has its own
gender problems, and never thought that he would be part of the problem that marginalizes
and devalues women and their scientific contributions.

But gender bias in journalism isn't just a guy thing. In fact, Yong reflected upon his work after
reading that a female colleague, Adrienne LaFrance, suffered the same fault. LaFrance got
help from a computer scientist for some serious number crunching of her own writing. This
analysis made her realize that she didn't even consult women for 60 percent of her work, and
often gave men more space in her stories when women were included. Ouch.

Issues of race are equally problematic. In one study we conducted, we found that undergrad-
uate students often use familiar, white-authored resources when producing their own work.
For instance, students overwhelmingly consulted The New York Times as a primary source in
CONTEND WITH BIAS  127

their research, even when they were in classes that focused on non-white historical perspec-
tives, or counternarratives.

Now, The New York Times isn't a bad primary source to use. It has been one of the nation's
leading newspapers since it was founded in 1851. But for most of its history, white men have
helmed the paper and produced its contents. Moreover, during our discussion of one New
York Times reporter's coverage of Serena Williams in one of the credibility evaluation chap-
ters, we likely saw hints of white privilege, and journalist-turned-artist Alexandra Bell has
made a career of critically assessing race and racism in the media.

Some Ways Forward

We can't pretend to have a simple fix for these deeply problematic and complicated issues.
We will provide you with some examples of how professional journalists have fought to
decrease bias in their own work.

First, LaFrance and Yong pledged to be more intentional. For the most part, Yong has contin-
ued to do what he has always done, but spends about 15 more minutes searching for sources
until he has a list of female contacts. Additionally, he is tracking who he contacts and inter-
views for stories. As a result of his mindfulness, Yong is now citing women about 50 percent
of the time. This also has catalyzed him to start tracking how many times he includes voices
of color, LGBTQ folks, immigrants, and the disabled.

LaFrance, meanwhile, realized that she needed to change up her list of go-to sources and
consider seeking out stories that focus on the achievements of women. It works for Yong and
LaFrance, so it will probably work for you, too.

Once you have identified a diverse pool of sources, it is important to conduct inclusive report-
ing. Writing about the developing journalism ethics of covering transgender people, reporter
Christine Grimaldi outlines some important tips. She suggests asking people their preferred
pronouns (she, him, they, xe, or ze), and then using such preferred pronouns in your work.
She cautions against asking everyone anything, citing the need to respect a person's right to
privacy. When the AP Stylebook fails you, turn to the stylebook for the National Association of
LGBTQ Journalists or the GLADD Media Reference Guide. Finally, don't be afraid to ask your
editor, manager, or experts inside and outside of your workplace for guidance.

Recognize that there are many experts and professional organizations you also can turn to
for guidance. For instance, the National Association of Black Journalists also has its own style
128  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

guide, and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists offers points of guidance. These
are just a few examples.

We want to reinforce that everyone is biased in some way or another. But there are ways to
use this bias for the greater good. It simply means that you have to remain aware of how your
bias may affect your work. Ronan Farrow exemplifies how a journalist may do so. Farrow is
son of Hollywood actress Mia Farrow and director Woody Allen, a former Hollywood It couple.
In 2017, he published a story in the New Yorker recounting explicit details of alleged rape and
abuse by disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.

While Farrow's piece was not the only one or the first one, it caught a lot of people's attention
because of Farrow's family history and his possible bias. Farrow has long been a staunch
advocate for victims of sexual abuse since he first vocally supported his sister, Dylan Farrow.
As a child, Dylan Farrow accused their father, Woody Allen, of sexually molesting her, and, as
an adult, has called out the Hollywood elite for continuing to support Allen's career. Though
Allen was never prosecuted, the allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate relation-
ships have caused some to question if Allen's time is up.

What is important to note is that Farrow was mindful of his possible bias throughout his
reporting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter (THR), Farrow said: "Probably, yes, the
family background made me someone who understood the abuse of power from an early
age." Even Weinstein himself tried to stop the story by alleging a conflict of interest, Farrow
disclosed. Though Farrow believes his life experience helped him relate to survivors of sexual
abuse with empathy, he denies that his life experience biased his reporting. Farrow told THR:
"My mandate going into the Weinstein story was never to believe all survivors; it was to listen
to all survivors. I think it's completely possible to be both a skeptical, judicious reporter and
also create a space for survivors to be heard."

Creating a space for others to be heard is a good place to end this chapter and to begin your
own research. Remembering to respect everyone's voice and to not overpower it with your
own can be difficult. By being mindful of your own biases, you can make a brave attempt to
focus and listen.

Grammar and Spelling Review

Finally, let's make sure that we are all on the same page about how to spell and when to use
variations of the word "bias."

      Bias. This is a noun, signifying a singular bias. Correct ways to use this word:
CONTEND WITH BIAS  129

            He or she has a bias toward something.
            They have a bias against something.
            There is bias in this piece of writing.

      Biased. This is an adjective, which means that it describes something, like a person or
         another information source. Correct ways to use this word:
            He or she is biased.
            They are biased.
            This piece of writing is biased.

      Biased. This also can be a verb, in the past tense. Correct ways to use this word:
            This experience biased me.
            This information biased them against something.

      Biases. This is a noun signifying more than one bias. Correct ways to use this word:
            He or she has several biases.
            There are biases in this piece of writing.

      Biases. This also can be a verb. Correct way to use this word:
            This experience biases the people who go through it.

A Practitioner's View

                   Scott Collin

                   B.S., KU Journalism, 1994
                   Executive Creative Director, Havit Advertising

                   One might assume that you develop -- if not need -- bias to be a
                   smart advertiser. Especially when it comes to conducting and
                   evaluating research. Why? In advertising, your job is to get poten-
                   tial customers to love products and services. So ... you need to be
                   the ultimate brand advocate, right?
130  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

     Well, not always.

     Business isn't about what you're selling. It's about what the consumer is buying. So you
     have to remind yourself constantly that facts are facts. And whatever it is you feel or
     assume about information needs to be placed carefully to the side, possibly across the
     room.

     You have to remove your own emotions and take on those of someone who is not sit-
     ting at home waiting for your commercial to run, or print ad to delight them as they
     turn the page.

     Prospects don't know your product, and possibly not even the brand. And just like you
     can't walk into a party and tell someone you're `cool' ... you can't just tell someone they
     need to buy something because you think it's great.

     I created campaigns for infant formulas long before I was a dad, and for Formula 1 rac-
     ing while driving a 14-year-old Jeep. And the way I did it was to fully understand the
     target audience and its bias (for or against) a product, and then went from there.

Activity 1: Ad Bias

      Evaluate the credibility of a news article or an ad campaign of your choosing. Identify
      the primary form of bias in the piece, and provide suggestions for minimizing its bias.
      Use evidence from the evaluated piece and other sources to support your argument.

Activity 2: Search Bias

         Watch Safiya Noble's critique of Google's algorithm. In her talk, Noble is critical of
            how Google's search results portray women of color.

         Google a topic that you know is politically polarizing, or that you have seen por-
            trayed in a biased manner in the media.

         In a two-minute video, discuss what biases you notice in your search results, if any.
CONTEND WITH BIAS  131

If possible, compare your search results with those from someone else's computer.

Activity 3: Implicit Bias

      Take Harvard University's Implicit Bias Test. Your results of this test are private and you
      are under no obligation to share them with anyone. Without divulging details, reflect in
      one paragraph on the difficulties in addressing implicit bias in a professional setting.

Activity 4: Diverse Voices

      Read Christina Selby's tips on including diverse voices in stories. Although Selby
      focuses on the sciences, much of her advice is useful for other areas of journalism and
      advertising. In 1-2 pages, reflect on how you can incorporate some of Selby's ideas into
      your own work.

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Describe how Google is designed to provide results based on the information need
            expressed by the user's search query.
         Describe Google's business model and Google's influence as the dominant internet
            search engine.
         Identify perspectives that might be missing from Google and other Internet search
            engines.
         Describe several ways that Google privileges some perspectives and present barri-
            ers to others.

Google It

Do you need directions to a friend's new apartment? Want to find that website your adviser
recommended? Thinking about upgrading your cell phone? Looking to rent your textbooks
for next semester? Resolving a bet on who put up the winning goal in the 2008 NCAA champi-
onship? No matter the domain, our instinct is to Google the information we need.
134  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Choosing to use Google before all other research tools may seem like a no-brainer. After, all
Google gives us what we want, and it is so fast and easy! We might not know how or why,
but Google always seems to give us the results that we like. And Google is not shy about
telling us how great it is. At the top of each search engine results page (SERP) a software
program declares that "About X results" were retrieved in "0.XX seconds." This humble-brag
seems unnecessary when all we really want is for the answer to our query to appear on the
first page. In fact, we really want it to be on the first screen so we don't have to scroll down,
or maybe even as the top result. Fortunately, so often, Google delivers just that.

You are not alone if your preferred search engine is Google. Most Internet users rely on
Google. During 2017, approximately 75 percent of desktop computer users and approxi-
mately 93 percent of mobile device users searched the web using Google over all other inter-
net search engines such as Baidu, Bing, or Yahoo!, according to NetMarketShare, a leading
company that analyzes web traffic and web technology.

Using Google without questioning how it works makes sense to most of its users. Media schol-
ars Ken Hillis, Michael Petit, and Kylie Jarrett, in their book, Google and the Culture of Search,
state it succinctly: "Today Google feels like a good deal to most of its users. It is free, easy to
use, and doesn't require a searcher to reveal his or her ignorance about a subject in front of
another human being such as a librarian."

Given how much we rely on Google for our information needs, it's helpful to consider just
how Google does what it does, and whether or not we should be more critical when scanning
through our Google results. In this chapter, therefore, we consider several questions about
Google. Thinking about information systems, that is, about who and what -- Google, libraries,
librarians and information and computer scientists -- organizes information and how and
why they do it, can help us become more conscious and critical consumers of information.

Does Google Have It All?

To understand how Google achieves its fast results, and to judge whether or not it is actually
saving us time, it is helpful to consider how, and how much content, is included in Google's
database of information. There is a myth that everything is on the Internet, and that all we
have to do to access it, is to Google it. Despite Google's mission to "Organize the world's
information and make it universally accessible and useful," not all the world's information is
included in Google's database. If you want to be a expert at finding relevant information, you
will have to think beyond this myth.
GOOGLE  135

How does stuff get on the Internet?

First off, not all of the world's information is on the Internet. For information to be included in
the Internet, it has to be in electronic format and stored within one of the many connected,
networked computer systems. But the content indexed by Google is only a small fraction of
the Internet. Unless the information is open to search engine crawlers, Google's algorithms
will not be able to retrieve it. Google results only provide access to approximately "0.03 per-
cent of the information that exists online (one in 3,000 pages)," according to a 2015 Popular
Science article.

You can watch the following Google video to learn more about crawlers, or spiders.

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://otn.press-
books.pub/becredible/?p=56

As the video and other content explain, Google and other search engines use programs
generically referred to as crawlers or spiders, which are algorithms that follow links on web-
136  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

pages to discover, scan, index, and sort webpages. But because the spiders' crawling and
copying can only include what is made openly available, Google's index includes just a portion
of the web.

Google not only scans, indexes, and sorts every word on a web page, but it also does this for
every metadata field. Metadata means "data about data" that accompanies Internet content.
It can be created automatically or manually.

You probably are familiar with basic metadata fields such as title, author, creation date, and
subjects, that are created for articles and books to enable fast search retrieval. Similarly, when
you take a picture on your phone, the date the picture was taken is automatically assigned
as the image's metadata. If enabled, other data such as location and address book contacts
also may be saved in the metadata. Users can manually add to the metadata by, for exam-
ple, identifying everyone in the image or adding information about the event where the photo
was taken. Google indexes all the metadata associated with an image or a document which
help its algorithms to quickly match the words and phrases when searched.

Once spiders index information, many factors contribute to how Google quickly recalls and
ranks results with precision. In its results ranking, Google favors websites that display quickly,
over content that loads slowly. Google doesn't have time to wait for pages to load because
Google wants users to think its search is lightning quick.

What can't I find?

Not all web content is created equally. Some content on the Internet is intentionally hidden,
while other content is fraught with errors that cause web crawlers and spiders to not discover
and index it. This portion of the web is referred to as the deep web. If it includes illegal activity,
the content is considered to be part of the dark web.

There are many techniques that webmasters use to prevent Google and other search engines
from scanning and indexing their materials, according to Google. These blocking options
include not publishing their URLs, embedding instructions in websites' html code for access-
ing the websites or other content, and storing proprietary content in password-protected
directories.

Proprietary information not indexed in Google may actually be the stuff that you need now,
but is stashed behind paywalls. This includes information like scholarly journal articles and
other primary sources. Google discriminates against some content, and in favor of other con-
tent, and maintains guides and tools that favor some websites in search results ranking. This
GOOGLE  137

means that the stuff you really need as a student or professional may not even show up in
your search results.

Is Every Google Search Treated the Same?

One way that Google speeds up its searches is by guessing which category each search falls
into.

In a seminal article, A taxonomy of Web Search, Andrei Broder, a distinguished Google scien-
tist, identified three categories of search types: navigational, transactional, and informational.
Google also hinted that it divides user intent into these three categories in a 2017 handbook
for search quality evaluators.

Let's consider these three categories in greater detail.

Navigational searches

A navigational search happens when a user wants to go somewhere in real life or online. Nav-
igational searches are fairly easy to recognize and for Google to execute successfully.

There are two subcategories of navigational searches: "visit-in-person" and "website"
searches. If you enter a street address or a name of a business, the search engine assumes
that you are interested in visiting this place in person, and it offers you directions. Alternately,
if you enter part of a URL, the search engine guesses that you want to visit the website, and
will navigate to a specific website. If the search engine predicts your navigational queries cor-
rectly, then you are more likely to see the search engine as accurate, reliable and easy to use.

Transactional searches

When a user performs a transactional search, he or she expects to end up having a dynamic
interaction with an internet site. Google defines the transactional query as a "do" query
because the user wants to do something on a website. These interactions could be anything
from filling out an application, to writing reviews and ratings, to downloading files, to making
purchases.

Transactional searches are the most easy to monetize, that is, to make money off of, accord-
ing to Broder. Monetization occurs when the search engine recognizes that a user is poten-
tially in the market to buy something. Users who perform transactional searches are identi-
138  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

fied as optimal recipients of targeted advertising. Internet industry leaders assert that many
users view targeted advertising favorably. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said as much
during the questioning session of a 2018 congressional committee hearing,

      "What we have found is that even though some people don't like ads, people really
      don't like ads that aren't relevant. And that while there is some discomfort for sure
      with using information to make ads more relevant, the overwhelming feedback we
      get from our community is that people would rather have us show relevant content
      there than not."

Zuckerberg and others believe that Googole and other platforms retain their users' loyalty by
sufficiently responding to their transactional queries not only with relevant results but also
relevant ads, as opposed to annoying, irrelevant ads.

Informational searches

In an informational search, the search engine algorithm might not determine the full intent of
a user's query. To identify and address the intent of search users, Google conceptually divides
an informational query into two levels: the "know simple" query, and the more complex
"know" query. A "know simple" query is one that easily can be be asked in a trivia night con-
test question, or in a multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, or short answer test question. Google
provides a "know simple" response in a familiar format on the results page, often without nav-
igation to a specific site. You've seen these "know simple" results framed in a box at the top
of the results page.

A "know" query, in which a user is doing research to gain insight and develop knowledge, is
much more complex and challenging for Google to fulfill. In library science circles, a "know"
search is also called a cognitive exploratory search. An exploratory search is a process of
learning and investigating that requires looking at multiple sources of information, according
to information scientist Gary Marchionni. This process of exploration requires more human
engagement in browsing, comparing and contrasting, and evaluating results than simpler
searches. Contrary to Google's mantra of "fast and easy," exploratory search takes time and
requires us to examine results in an iterative process of searching, evaluating, and reformu-
lating questions.

Does Google Know What I Want?

It may seem like magic to have Google offer relevant suggestions and useful results. So, does
GOOGLE  139

Google divine our intent? The short answer is, no. Dan Russell, a research scientist at Google,
described Google's combination of understanding user intent and user behavior as "divining
intent." But it is really the result of good computer programing based on data and research.

Internet search engines such as Google are designed to meet the information-seeking needs
of their users, even when these users do a lousy job defining what they are searching for.
Google is built on the assumption that internet users are not search experts, and that they
do not use advanced search functions. That is, most Google users don't identify keywords to
describe their information needs, and they do not know search operators.

Does that mean that Google can read its users' minds when they don't explain well what they
want to search for? Not exactly.

Google is programmed to help us "not sweat the small stuff," by accommodating for our vari-
ants in capitalization, punctuation and spelling.

More importantly, it turns out, what we search for is not that unique. Other users before us
have asked Google about similar things. Google reports that only about 15 percent of search-
ing on any given day is unique. The repeat searches (approximately 85 percent) appear as
autofill as we type a search.

Because most searches aren't new, this allows Google to collocate and organize information
into efficient, precise results. Once this information is organized, Google's algorithm guesses
what the most relevant information might be for the search term entered. The more users
search for the same thing, the more accurate Google's guesses become.

Google's algorithm also personalizes the relevancy of our results and the order in which these
results are displayed. This personalization contributes to our immediate satisfaction with
Google, and adds to our perception that Google is easy. In order for Google to make it seem
so easy to provide fast, precise, personally ranked results, algorithms interpret the intent of
the user queries and inform result ranking.

Is Google Free?

We do not directly give Google money for the results it presents us, so that sense, Google is
free. But we do pay Google indirectly. By feeding queries into Google's search box, we con-
tribute information about ourselves, and about the things that interest us. Google and other
search engines store data about us and about our collective searches. Google uses this infor-
mation to make its search results better, and to motivate users to continue relying on it for
140  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

their search needs. So the first way we pay indirectly for using Google, therefore, is by having
Google use the information we leave with it to make itself function better.

Another way we pay Google indirectly is by contributing to the research that Google conducts
on its search users.

For years, scientists, engineers, and researchers at Google (and other industry, academic and
government institutions) have been trying to improve their understanding of human-com-
puter interaction (HCI) and information retrieval (IR), which is about figuring out what you
want from the internet and how you get it. This research has included controlled scientific
experiments, ethnographic observations of how people conduct online searches, and analy-
ses of search logs.

Google and other online companies engage in constant surveillance to collect information
about our online internet activities, and in analyses of what we look at, what we click, our
reading level, and more. Such research helps technology firms discover what we prefer, dis-
like, understand, don't understand, use, misuse, observe, ignore, remember, and forget, in
order to design information systems that meet our expectations.

Each new search triggers a complex network of programs, to the point that no one outside of
Google really knows how specific search results occur. It is even possible that the results that
a user looks at are part of a current experiment that Google is running. Researchers outside
of Google refer to this testing as "noise" in the results.

The last way we pay Google indirectly is that Google uses the stored data about us and
our searches to play matchmaker, pairing us with targeted ads that are displayed alongside
search results. Google's main business model is to sell very targeted advertising to its users,
based on the search terms these users provide it.

Google feeds our data into an advertising program called AdWords. AdWords is a real-time
online broker that displays ads from the highest bidder that match the search terms and
phrases a user types into the search bar. As you probably have observed, if you search for a
pair of boots, Google will sell advertising space next to its search results to a company that
identified boots as one of the keywords it wanted matched with its ad. Loyal and returning
Google users are essential for its business model to succeed, because the more information
users feed Google, the more targeted and successful its advertising can be.
GOOGLE  141

Are Google Search Results Biased?

Google wants its users to feel that searching with Google is fast and easy, because this
ensures that these users keep returning to Google. But we know from experience that doing
research and learning, in the way that our teachers have taught us to do it, is slow and frus-
trating. What is the result of this difference between fast results and slow research?

We are drawn to fast and easy. But because fast and easy search results are possible only
when result options are narrowed, using Google means that we continually put ourselves in
a filter bubble.

Anytime search results are narrowed to make the results come up faster, results are actively
left out while some results are favored. It may not be obvious what is appearing in our filtered
results and what is missing from them. Thus, search results are never completely neutral.

Two aspects of Google's search engine function illustrate the concept of bias: Relevancy
results instead of possible null results, and biases in programming algorithms.

Google and other search engines are designed to avoid giving us zero search results, which is
also known as null query results. If we misspell a word, an algorithm automatically searches
for alternate spellings or correctly spelled words. If we do not know jargon, another algorithm
retrieves semantically similar and related words, as if we had entered additional terms using
a thesaurus. Unfortunately, we are often unaware how these algorithms affect the results.

While algorithms are learning from our null query experiences, we might not be learning as
much from the experience. For instance, the search engine might learn from others' Internet
searchers that the phrase "one and done" is related to the NBA Eligibility Rules. So instead
of getting results that only include the phrase searched "one and done," the results might
include the NBA Eligibility Rules, which lacks the phrase "one and done." This example makes
it seem that always presenting something related is always a good thing.

However, consider an instance of when the lack of null results present inaccurate information
when credible sources are not available. Consider the case of school shooting misinformation
reported in the Atlantic.

The problem of relying on algorithms to construct our search results, even if there are no
search results, is that algorithms can be biased. When a computer program is designed to
make assumptions about a query, any bias that we experience in the real world can creep into
the computer program and present biased results. This video, Machine Learning and Human
Bias, published by Google in 2017, describes a few forms of bias acknowledged to be present
142  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

in search engine algorithms. Google has been criticized for not aggressively addressing vari-
ous biases in its search results.

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://otn.press-
books.pub/becredible/?p=56

We recognize that search engines are not neutral, and we know it is impossible to completely
remove bias. At the same time, it is very difficult for us to understand why the programming
provided our specific search results. We do, however have a phrase to describe the phenom-
enon: The black box problem. To close this section, consider the quote from Science maga-
zine's staff writer Paul Voosen:

      It [machine learning algorithms and search results] is all about trust. If you have a
      result and you don't understand why it [computer neural network] made that decision
      how can you really advance in your research? You really need to know that there's
      not some spurious detail that's not throwing things all off.

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Explain Wikipedia's history and operations, and how these features can influence
            the site's contents.
         Articulate the appropriate uses of Wikipedia.
         Participate in Wikipedia as an editor, creator and curator of original content.

The Least Reliable Source, Or Is It?

Wikipedia is a popular online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone. Because of its open
nature, many teachers and professors often warn students that it should never, under any cir-
cumstances, be used because it is "unreliable." As with all things, the situation is much more
nuanced than that. While Wikipedia is by no means a replacement for scholarly books and
articles, it can be of immense use as an exploratory, tertiary source. Of course, it is not a per-
fect resource, and its contents should always be judged critically, but much of the fear sur-
rounding the site comes from a place of ignorance.
In this chapter, we will explore the history of Wikipedia, what type of resource it is, whether
or not it's reliable, when it is appropriate to use the source, and how to become an editor.
WIKIPEDIA  145

By the end, you should be more familiar with how the site operates, what roles editors have
in maintaining this digital resource, and the benefits and downsides to using Wikipedia when
doing research.

Brief History of Wikipedia

Arguably, we could trace the origins of Wikipedia back to the 1930s, when the sci-fi writer H.
G. Wells proposed that a "Permanent World Encyclopedia" be created, compiled and edited by
the world's greatest minds. Or we could trace its origins to the mid-1990s, when Eric Hammer
and Edward Zalta of Stanford University suggested that a "dynamic encyclopedia" be created,
whose entries "can be improved and updated on a continual basis without requiring the pro-
duction of an entirely new edition."

However, most people consider the site to be a direct continuation of the project Nupedia,
which was launched by Jimmy Wales in 1999. This encyclopedia project was intended to be a
free online encyclopedia that was accurate and -- perhaps most importantly -- "academically
respectable." Like previous traditional encyclopedias, Nupedia was written only by experts,
but it was open and free to use, making it quite revolutionary at the time.

Unfortunately, because Nupedia was written by unpaid experts, only about 20 articles were
created, and due to this sluggishness, the project was soon abandoned. Wales, however,
did not want his idea to go to waste. Using the wiki software that had sustained Nupedia,
he launched a new site: Wikipedia. With this project, Wales originally wanted select content
experts to peer-review and copy-edit material submitted by the public. Initially, few academics
wanted to work on this new project, given how far-removed it was from traditional academic
scholarship. So Wales left the project open to anyone. In time, the site became popular and
grew rapidly. As of April 2018, the English version of the site boasted over 33 million editors,
who collectively helped to create over 5.6 million articles, with an average of 800 new articles
being created every day.

The truly remarkable thing about the site is that anyone -- with or without a Wikipedia
account -- is free to modify the contents of the website. As such, Wikipedia, in many ways,
is working to ensure that everyone the world over not only has access to knowledge, but can
contribute to that vast collection of knowledge.

Is Wikipedia Reliable?

The question of whether Wikipedia is reliable has raged both online and offline since about
146  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

2005. Research studies have shown that Wikipedia is roughly as reliable as other sources
commonly-accepted as "accurate." Arguably, the one to demonstrate this first was science
journalist Jim Giles, who wrote a 2005 Nature article, "Internet encyclopaedias go head to
head." Giles combed through articles on both Wikipedia and the popular hard-bound Encyclo-
pedia Britannica, concluding that between the two, "the difference in accuracy was not par-
ticularly great: the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;
Britannica, about three."

Further studies by The Guardian, the Journal of Clinical Oncology, PC Pro, the Canadian
Library Association, and Library Journal have all found that Wikipedia is, for the most part,
reliable.

None of this is to say that Wikipedia is perfect or 100 percent accurate. It is a human-
produced product, and like all human creations, is bound to have flaws and inaccuracies.
Because there is no one at the site whose sole job is to ensure that all articles are up to a
certain standard, some articles have grammatical errors, poor organization, or out-of-date
sources. Sometimes, an article will have good sources, but these sources may be misinter-
preted or added to an article without meeting established standards.

But perhaps most dangerous is that Wikipedia articles can be heavily biased depending on
the topic at hand. This is especially true for articles about famous people, places, and things,
or controversial topics (e.g. U.S. presidents, climate change, certain religions). In articles such
as these, some unscrupulous editors try to put forward an agenda by carefully wording cer-
tain sections or by adding biased sources. While their behavior is not to be commended, it
can be said that these editors are clever. After all, they have realized that, because Wikipedia
is used so often, by injecting their bias into an article, they can almost unconsciously affect
readers' opinions on the topics at hand.

Many times, this bias can be easily spotted, as inexperienced Wikipedia editors often make
use of "peacock terms" in their writing. According to Wikipedia itself, peacock terms are
grandiose words that tend "to promote the subject of an article, while neither imparting nor
plainly summarizing verifiable information." For example, in the sentence, "Company XYZ is
the best publishing house in the United States," the peacock term is the claim that the com-
pany is the best in the United States.

Others make use of "weasel words." These are vague terms or phrases that, according to
Wikipedia, "creat[e] an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said,
when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated." For example, in the
sentence, "Some people say that Company XYZ is the most innovative publisher in the last 100
years," the words "some people" signal the use of weasel words. Articles that feature these
WIKIPEDIA  147

sorts of expressions often sound amateurish, and resemble puff pieces or promotional press
releases, more so than encyclopedia articles.

Other times bias in articles can be much more insidious. One of the more infamous examples
of this sort of problem is Wikipedia's gender bias. According to a 2015 article published by the
MIT Technology Review: "Despite well-publicized efforts to promote equality, Wikipedia arti-
cles are deeply biased against women, say computer scientists who have analysed six differ-
ent language versions of the online encyclopedia."

For a simple example, consider a 2011 survey conducted by the WikiMedia Foundation, which
revealed that 91 percent of editors identify as male, whereas only 8.5 percent of editors iden-
tify as female. A later 2015 study by information scientist Eduardo Graells-Garrido and col-
leagues found "systematic asymmetries" on the site, meaning that many Wikipedia articles
are biased towards one gender, usually men. The good news is that Wikipedia's gender bias
is currently being exposed and discussed.

It is now up to current and future Wikipedia editors to add good quality prose and sourcing
to articles, thereby reducing this sort of bias, as well as other forms of bias that can lurk in
articles. And the good news is that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone. That means that you
can create an account and start to affect this sort of change.

When To Use Wikipedia?

When not to use it?

It is of paramount importance to realize that Wikipedia is a tertiary source. These sorts of
resources, which also include encyclopedias, dictionaries, and thesauri, often collect primary
or secondary sources, and arrange them in an easy-to-use way. They rarely have credited
authors, and are almost always based on previous research. In other words, they merely com-
pile or synthesize what has already been researched, proposed, or argued by others.

An excellent example of a tertiary source is a dictionary. While there might be an editor or a
main compiler of a dictionary, it can't be said that this person is the author of the dictionary.
Furthermore, while dictionaries often add new words to new editions, in can't be said that the
dictionary invents these words. It merely reports which terms and phrases are being used by
others and what these terms and phrases mean.

There's nothing wrong with using tertiary sources for your research. In fact, they are often
very helpful when you are trying to get a feel for an unfamiliar topic. But they should never
148  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

be the only sources you consult, and dictionaries and encyclopedias should never be used to
back-up the majority of your research or writing. Why might this be? For one thing, there are
simply better sources out there than tertiary ones. Remember that tertiary sources effectively
repackage those things which have already been argued or written about. Why would you
cite an encyclopedia that relies on a handful of primary or secondary sources when you could
simply use those primary or secondary sources themselves? There often is an expectation at
the university level that students use scholarly or peer-reviewed sources for their research.
While tertiary sources might undergo editorial review, they rarely are peer-reviewed to the
level of a scholarly journal article or book.

When to use it

The tertiary nature of Wikipedia (and not its open access) is the main reason why you should
not use it as your only source. With that said, that there is a time and a place to use Wikipedia.

Let's say that you have just been given an assignment to write about the history, structure,
impact, and so on, of the Associated Press. You'll notice that at the very bottom of the Associ-
ated Press's Wikipedia article, there is a section called "References." In this portion of the arti-
cle, there are a number of useful links and citations, including two books that were published
by university presses. If you're wanting reliable secondary sources that discuss the AP, then it
would be better to use and cite these sources listed in the References section, rather than the
Wikipedia article itself.

Throughout the AP article, you'll also note that many sentences, paragraphs, and sections are
followed by footnoted numbers. These numbers lead the reader to specific sources that are
listed in the "References" section at the bottom of the article. These footnotes can be very
helpful if you need to know both a specific piece of information and the exact place (e.g., page
number, website, chapter) where that piece of information came from. Once again, Wikipedia
can be very useful in leading you in the "right direction" while you are researching.

A caveat to all of this: You might also notice that some sections in Wikipedia articles don't
have any footnotes backing up their claims. While the information contained in these sections
might be accurate, the fact that they lack footnotes is a major red flag, suggesting that their
assertions should be taken with a grain of salt or ignored entirely. If you're using Wikipedia,
you should ideally be looking for sources, not assertions lacking attribution.

Summary

The key to successfully using Wikipedia as a scholar is being able to evaluate whether or not
WIKIPEDIA  149

the information and sources that you see in an article are reliable. While Wikipedia requires
that all sources be of a certain standard (not to mention that seasoned Wikipedia editors
often try their best to weed out bad information on the site), subpar and dubious information
does linger in many articles.

So when exactly is it okay to use Wikipedia? While all situations vary in regards to context and
academic expectations, if you find yourself in one of the following instances, it is generally
appropriate to use the site:

      To quickly look up a fact for general interest or when the stakes are low.
      To begin research by getting an idea about what has been said about a given topic.
      To look for useful sources (e.g., peer-reviewed articles, books published by a reliable

         third party, pertinent grey literature).
Conversely:

      Don't cite Wikipedia in an academic paper or presentation.
      Don't use Wikipedia as your only source.
      Don't blindly accept what Wikipedia articles tell you just because there is a source

         attached. Like any source, the source listed in Wikipedia might be bad or inappropri-
         ately used.

What and Who Are Editors?

The lifeblood of Wikipedia are its contributors, or "editors." Anyone in the world with internet
access is allowed to be a Wikipedia editor. Most edits to the site are made by those who have
not secured an account. They are identified in edit histories and on discussion pages by an
Internet Protocol (or IP) address (e.g., "204.16.36.56").

Anonymous and unregistered editing has several handicaps. First, IPs are unable to create
new article pages. Second, they cannot upload pictures or other files. Finally, they must
answer a CAPTCHA (a type of word-based test used to tell if someone is a human or an auto-
mated machine) if they want to insert an external link into an article. These handicaps exist to
curb vandalism (i.e. the malicious disruption of article content).

Why should a person become a Wikipedia editor? There are many reasons, ranging from the
idealistic ("You will be contributing to the global sum of knowledge") to the pragmatic ("More
editors means less work for everyone involved"). Perhaps the most important is that, as stu-
dents of journalism, you are likely motivated by the desire to create reliable, accurate, and
150  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

neutral content that will be used to inform the public about the world in which we all live.
This, too, is the goal of Wikipedia editors.

Think of Wikipedia as a well, where everyone -- whether they want to admit it or not -- gets
their water. If someone poisons that well, it can make the whole community sick. Likewise,
if someone adds bad or erroneous information to Wikipedia, it will be read the world over,
which could have a very negative impact. It is thus the job of the Wikipedia editor to "remove
the poison from the well" and prevent the spread of this false information. And given that
as journalism students you are learning many key skills that can aid in this task (e.g., how to
report objectively, how to collect references and evidence, how to be transparent in where
you get your sources), you are among the best individuals to become editors and help make
the encyclopedia a better resource for all.

How To Become an Editor

Although IPs make up the majority of Wikipedia's editors, they carry less clout than their
named counterparts, because their identities are highly anonymized and therefore seen as
impersonal. Follow these steps to create a named account.

    1. Navigate to the top right corner of any Wikipedia article and click on the link that says
         "Create account."
WIKIPEDIA  151

    2. You will be asked to create a username and password. NOTE: Don't use your real
         name or other information that someone could use to ID you in real-life.

How To Edit Wikipedia

Making basic edits

Anyone can edit a Wikipedia article, whether or not they are a registered member. Articles
can be edited by clicking on the link at the top of the screen that reads "Edit."
152  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

To the left side of any article heading is another "Edit" link.
After you click on either of these "Edit" links, you will be redirected to the editing screen,
WIKIPEDIA                                                               153

wherein you can add or delete characters.

Linking to another Wikipedia article

Follow these steps to insert a hyperlink to another Wikipedia article.
    1. Highlight the word or phrase that you want to link.
154  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

     2. Select the "Link" button from the options near the top of the editing screen:
     3. You will see the following screen:
WIKIPEDIA  155

A. "Target page or URL" is where you will put the name of the Wikipedia article to which
    you'd like to link.

B. "Text to display" is where you will put that text that you want to appear in the
    Wikipedia article itself.

 (The reason there are two different fields is because some Wikipedia articles have dis-
 ambiguating phrases attached to their titles to separate them from other articles with
 similar names. For instance, "The Sun (New York City)" and "The Sun (Sydney)" are two
 separate articles about two different newspapers that are both named The Sun. If you'd
 like to insert a hyperlink to the former in an article, you'd want the "Target page or URL"
 box to read "The Sun (New York City)", but the "Text to display" box to simply read "The
 Sun.")

4. Now, add in the appropriate target page and text (often, these fields will be identical),
    and click insert:
156                                               PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

     5. Now, navigate to the bottom of the editing screen and click "Publish Changes."

     6. This will add the link into the article.
WIKIPEDIA                                                157

To insert a reference

Adding references to Wikipedia is of critical importance. Thankfully, Wikipedia has an easy
way to format these citations.

    1. Place your cursor where you'd like to insert a citation. Then, on the edit screen, click
         on the tab that reads "Cite."

2. Select what citation template you would like to use.
158                                               PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

     3. A citation manager will pop up; enter in the necessary information and then click
         "Insert."

     4. The citation will appear in the edit box
WIKIPEDIA                                                                                159

5. Go to the bottom of the edit screen and click "Publish Changes." After doing so, you
    will see that the citation has been added to the article.

You'll want to make sure that your article has a reference list template. Most large articles
will already have one. If you are the first person to add a citation to a page, then you will
need to add {{reflist}} to the end of the article.

To do this, go to the bottom of the article and click "Edit." Then enter the following:

==References==
{{reflist}}

It will look like this:

6. When you're all done, click "Publish changes" at the bottom of the editing screen. You
    can then see if the references are displaying correctly:
160  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Activity 1: Wikipedia Sources

      Locate a Wikipedia entry related to a topic you're working on. Using the steps outlined
      in this chapter, locate at least two credible sources cited in the Wikipedia sources. In
      a one-to-two page reflection, state which entry you found and what two sources you
      selected. Then explain why you believe the sources are credible and how you may use
      them in writing an article on your topic.

Activity 2: Cue-Evidence a Wikipedia Entry

      Locate and read a Wikipedia entry related to a topic you're working on. Using your
      knowledge from this chapter and preceding chapters on credibility, evaluation, and
      bias, write a one-to-two page evaluation of your selected Wikipedia entry. Make certain
      to clearly cite the Wikipedia entry under review, and state and explain your criteria for
      its credibility, providing clear examples. You might discuss such aspects as: Was the
      entry helpful, well sourced, well written, complete, accurate, biased? In what ways?
WIKIPEDIA  161

Activity 3: Source Genres

      In your academic assignments your instructors might require a variety of sources or
      even specific genres, or types of sources to be cited. Identify and compares/contrast
      the different types of sources used in the Wikipedia article used for Activity 1 or 2. Crit-
      ically analyze if these genres are appropriate for the article, and if or how citing addi-
      tional genres would improve the credibility of the article.

Activity 4: Open Pedagogy

      Create a live-action tutorial for creating a Wikipedia account or editing an article. You
      can use technology of your choosing, but the tutorial must be fewer than three min-
      utes.

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Understand what public records are, why they exist, and why they are public.
         Access and retrieve information from a variety of online public records.
         Articulate arguments about the credibility cues of public records, and provide evi-

         Participate in Wikipedia as an editor, creator and curator of original content.

All These Directory Websites

Have you ever searched the Internet for someone you once knew? Or someone you came
across and found interesting? Or yourself? Or one of your relatives?
If you have, chances are that you ended up on a website that claimed to have a ton of infor-
mation about that person, showed you a tiny preview of this information, and then offered
to hand over all of it for something like $7.99, or for a $26.99 monthly subscription. There
are dozens of websites that function this way, like WhitePages, Pipl, BeenVerified, Intelius,
PUBLIC RECORDS  163

PeopleFinder, FastPeopleSearch, PeopleSearchNow, TruePeopleSearch, PeopleLooker,
TruthFinder, 411, SpyTox, GoLookUp, USSearch, and AnyWho.

Or, you have searched for information on a small company? If you have, you may have come
across websites like Bizapedia, Manta, Buzzfile, OpenCorporates, and PropertyShark. Like the
people directory sites, these business directory websites preview information about busi-
nesses and their owners, and promise more information for a premium.

Why are there so many websites offering, essentially, the same service?

The answer is that these websites use a very simple business model: They find free informa-
tion, aggregate it, present it in an appealing way, and then sell it. The technical term is "mone-
tizing": These websites monetize free information. Every day, millions of Internet users search
for people and businesses, and some of them are willing to pay for the convenience these
websites offer. Many users probably don't know that the information they are buying is avail-
able for free.

There are two key sources of this information: Social media and public records. Most of us
won't be surprised that someone is making a buck off the personal information we feed to
Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites.

But what are public records? Where do they come from? Why and how do we access these
free records? And, are they credible? These are the questions this chapter addresses.

What Are Public Records

Public records are produced by government agencies in the course of conducting the busi-
ness with which these agencies are charged. Laws and regulations require government agen-
cies to collect various pieces of information, or records, about individuals and other entities
that are under these agencies' jurisdictions. Records make governing possible. The govern-
ment agencies use these records to provide services, administer oversight, forecast trends,
determine funding, and perform various other functions.

Think about all of the different records that various government offices have created about
you.

Most of us have birth certificates, visas, or naturalization documents that designate our resi-
dent status in this country. Those of us who weren't born here also have immigration forms
that precede these resident documents. We have social security numbers and related files
164  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

that document our age, social security contributions, and when we will be eligible to be paid
back from this system.

If we drive and own a car, there are records about our driving proficiency tests, licenses, our
cars' registrations, and the taxes we pay on them. Every time we return from a trip to another
country, we complete customs forms indicating our whereabouts and what we are bringing
back.

If we sought federal student loans, the Department of Education has those applications and
follow-up documents. If we happen to be licensed as teachers, cosmetologists, pilots, or other
professionals, there are records of these licenses and when they are up for expiration or
renewal.

Every year, we fill out and submit tax records, and every ten years the census bureau collects
information about where we live and what we do. All of this information assists government
agencies to make our society function properly.

Each of these records helps a government agency fulfill some kind of a function. For example,
without census records, election commissions and legislatures would not know how to reap-
portion representation on local, state, and federal governing bodies, to reflect population
changes. Without property records, counties and school districts would not know how much
money to expect every year from property taxes. Without driver's license records, motor vehi-
cles departments would not be able to ensure that all drivers have basic knowledge of traffic
safety.

Many of these records are not public. For example, the public does not have access to individ-
ual driver's license records. Other records are embargoed for some time, that is, they are not
made public right away. Census records, for example, are released 72 years after a census is
taken. This means that the 1950 census records will be made available to the public in 2022.

Why Are Public Records Public

Many public records are public. By virtue of living in a transparent democratic society, we
have the right to see how our governments conduct their business. Public records are an
important element of keeping our governments transparent and accountable. Property tax
records, for example, allow us to determine whether property owners are being taxed even-
handedly.

Another reason for keeping public records open to the public is that many of these records
PUBLIC RECORDS  165

are available for our benefit. Voter registrations, for example, tell us where and when we
can participate in the next election, while food safety inspection records tell us whether our
favorite restaurants are keeping their kitchens clean. In short, public records are open to keep
government agencies accountable, and to help us effectively function as members of society.

So, what records are public? One way to understand the scope of what's available to the pub-
lic is to look at retention schedules, which are lists of government agency records that specify
for how long these agencies are required to keep their records. The Kansas Historical Society
maintains a list of these retention schedules for the state. The National Archives maintains
lists of records control schedules for all branches of the federal government. These lists con-
tain thousands of record types. Most of these records are available by request from the agen-
cies that maintain them, under state and federal open records laws, which govern the public's
access to these records.

But an increasing number of public records is available on the Internet, through the websites
of the various government agencies that create and update these records. This chapter con-
tains several videos on how to access and interpret some of these records.

Why Look For Public Records

Journalists and strategic communication practitioners may be tasked regularly with finding
information about individuals and entities. Journalists often need to search for information
about individuals or businesses that are the subjects of news stories. Strategic communi-
cations practitioners may have to find information about individuals or businesses that are
potential clients or competitors of their clients.

Some information like this is aggregated on commercial directory websites such as Pipl or
Manta that come up high in Google results. In our experience, while these websites provide
some accurate information, oftentimes this information is not complete, or no longer accu-
rate. Think back to our discussions of primary and secondary sources in the chapters on
evaluating credibility and attribution. Much of the information in directory sites comes from
public records, that is, public records are the primary sources of this information. This means
that it's incumbent on communication professionals to find and verify information on these
websites in public records, where this information originates.

How To Access Public Records

Public records generally are not searchable from Google. This means that to access them, we
166  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

first have to figure out which agency produces the record in which we are interested. Second,
we have to find our way to that agency's website. Finally, we have to learn how to operate the
agency's online database.

This section contains links to six videos on searching public records, and links to several
other records without instructional videos. The first two videos focus on searching informa-
tion about non-human entities. The other four videos focus on searching information about
individuals.

How Credible Are Public Records

Public records are the official, primary sources of the information they contain. Government
records generally do not cite other sources, so whenever a journalist cites a public record, he
or she is in the desired position of serving a secondary source of information.
172  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

While a personal directory website might list University of Kansas basketball coach Bill Self's
address, such a website also is a secondary source of this information. The primary source for
Bill Self's address is the Douglas County property record that shows what property or prop-
erties Bill Self owns in the county. Another primary record is in the Kansas Business Entity
database, showing the address where Bill Self's businesses are registered.

Records created and maintained by government agencies need to be accurate. Otherwise,
the government will not function properly. To ensure the accuracy of records, these records
are created as part of some process, with a specific set of requirements needing to be met for
the record to be issued.

For example, a renewal driver's license in Kansas can be issued only when eight requirements
are met: an individual presents his or her expiring license, another ID showing Kansas resi-
dency, an ID showing his or her social security number, plus the individual needs to pass a
vision exam, pay the renewal fee, get a new photo taken, provide a signature, and do all this
in person at a motor vehicles division office.

In other words, the accuracy of public records is safeguarded by the processes required for
their creation.

Moreover, it generally is illegal to create false government information. For example, in sub-
mitting an annual report about a company operating in the state of Kansas, which constitutes
the public record of this company's existence, an agent of this company (that is, its owner or
representative), has to sign his or her name above a line that says, "I declare under penalty of
perjury under the laws of the state of Kansas that the foregoing is true and correct." The pub-
lic agent has a strong incentive to create a truthful public record, thus avoiding legal trouble.

Public records oftentimes constitute the authoritative documentation of something happen-
ing. Government agencies have an interest in keeping track of information that otherwise
would not be recorded, or not recorded in a centralized place.

For instance, if a county register did not keep records of properties being bought and sold in a
county, it would be difficult to figure out who owns a property, who sold it, and whether any-
one owes any money on the property. Banks that lend money for property purchases would
have some records of these transactions, real estate agents would have some records of the
sales they facilitated, and individual owners would have other records. Each of these parties
would have only the information in which they were interested, and the length of time they
kept this information would be unpredictable.

A county register's office, in contrast, has a standardized way of recording and retaining
PUBLIC RECORDS  173

records of property sales so that these records are easily searchable and referenced when
the information they contain is needed. For this reason, the county register's records are the
authoritative records of the properties owned, bought, and sold in the county.

Of course, some public records contain errors because clerical mistakes happen. But for the
most part, we put considerable faith in the accuracy of public records. These two qualities --
the authority and accuracy of public records -- combine to make public records some of the
most credible sources of information we discuss in this book.

Activity 1: A Classmate's Public Records

      Conduct a short interview with a classmate, recording his or her basic demographic
      information (e.g., name, hometown, etc.). Use a combination of Google searches and
      public records searches to identify as many public records as possible about this class-
      mate and his or her family.

Activity 2: Local Business Public Records

      Identify a local business to which you do not have any personal connection (e.g., store,
      restaurant, bar, apartment, gas station, etc.). Identify the address of this business. Use
      a combination of Google searches and public records searches to identify as many
      public records as possible about this business, its owners, and the property where this
      business operates.

Activity 3: Open Pedagogy

      Create a tutorial for accessing a public record that isn't covered in this chapter. Use a
      format that you learn from best, like a short video or a narrated slideshow.

Freedom of Information Requests

JONATHAN PETERS

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Determine which public records are readily available to you.
         Define the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
         Access public record using the provisions of FOIA.

FOIA at Work

"German Bosque's personnel file looks more like a rap sheet than a rsum," the Miami Her-
ald-Tribune reported. When you are a cop, this is not a good thing.
The Herald-Tribune uncovered flaws in Florida's Internal Affairs agency, which is charged with
"policing the police." After obtaining Bosque's personal file from his police department, Her-
ald-Tribune reporters were able to piece together why the system had failed to protect the
citizens of Opa-Locka, Fla., from a police sergeant with a violent and criminal past.
Bosque had retained his post despite undergoing 40 internal reviews for misconduct, includ-
ing 16 instances of battery or excessive violence. Bosque also was "fired five times and
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS  175

arrested three, he was charged with stealing a car, trying to board an airplane with a loaded
gun and driving with a suspended license." Kind of unbelievable, huh?

Well, to prove their credibility, the reporters uploaded each relevant piece of Bosque's file to
Document Cloud so that their readers could read the original source of information through-
out the article.

But how did these reporters pull this off? If someone published your work history online,
wouldn't you think that was an invasion of your privacy? It probably would be because
most employee personnel files are confidential. Bosque, however, is a public official and an
employee of a government agency, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is held
to a standard of transparency and accountability to the general public.

The authors of this piece were able to obtain Bosque's troubled past by filing a request for the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement's discipline cases under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). Analyzing and sharing these records allowed the reporters to call into question a
system that was failing to fulfill its duty to serve and protect Floridians.

Moreover, their transparent research and reporting proved their credibility as journalists.

Journalists are "watchdogs over public affairs and government," the Code of Ethics for the
Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) mandates. In this role, they are "to ensure that the
public's business is conducted in the open, and that public records are open to all."

In our example, the Herald-Tribune forced the secrets of Florida Department of Law Enforce-
ment into plain sight and kept it there so that the citizens of Florida would be informed of
what was wrong with their local police department. As outlined in SPJ's Code of Ethics, they
had proven their credibility in uncovering and reporting information that was essential to the
public making informed decisions about their government.

In this chapter, you will learn what public records are, and gain a general sense of which ones
are readily available to you. For those records that are not freely accessible, we will discuss
how FOIA can be a useful tool for you to access government information. By the end of this
chapter, you will have a sense of how to access undisclosed public records using FOIA.

Public Records

As we did in the Public Records chapter, let's reflect again on the documents that tell the
story of you: birth certificate, school records, phone book, driver's license, diploma, voter
176  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

registration rolls, military records, discharge document, marriage certificate, mortgage lien,
pilot license, diving certification, criminal record, inmate locator records, bankruptcy records,
divorce decree, and, finally, a death certificate. If your life results in the production of all of
these documents, then you'll know you lived a very full life, indeed.

But who can access all of this stuff about you? That is, what information about you is public,
and what is private? Better yet, what information can you access?

There is an abundance of information that is available to everyone in the form of public
records, which many journalists have used to craft compelling and credible journalism. For
example, public records have been used by a teenager who blogs about the Supreme Court of
the United States, or to create a database that people can use to police local homicide rates.

There are many branches and agencies that are required to publish their records. This means
that the information you need may already be available through the Government Publish-
ing Office (GPO). The GPO catalogues publicly available government information and links to
the websites for other government branches for more focused searching and browsing. Most
current government information is produced digitally, but this has not always been the case.
As a result, you may have to work with a Federal Depository Library, such as the University of
Kansas Libraries, which archives printed government information.

Your Right To Access

The right to access public records and demand a transparent government is deeply rooted in
a strain of political philosophy used in the United States to justify the continuance of a free
democratic society. This philosophy basically states that a democratic government is based
on the will of the people, and the people need to know what the government is doing, in
order to vote and make other informed decisions related to governance. The importance of
an informed public having access to information has echoed throughout political theory:

      "A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it,
      is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or perhaps both," wrote James Madison, a
      founder of the United States.

      Only an informed electorate can govern effectively, to paraphrase the beliefs of
      Thomas Jefferson, founder and author of the Declaration of Independence.
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS  177

      "People denied information will make decisions that are "ill-considered" and "ill bal-
      anced," reasoned political theorist Alexander Meiklejohn.

      "A democracy without informed public is contradiction," civil rights attorney Thomas
      Emerson, explained.

Their words recognize that citizens need transparent information to scrutinize the govern-
ment. At the same time, just as transparency is important to maintaining a free democratic
society, so are other things. For instance,

      Military effectiveness can hinge on the secrecy of tactics.
      Police officers hold information about investigatory tactics, which suspects may

         demand to know.
      The U.S. government holds information about citizens' personal health conditions, but

         would infringe upon privacy laws if it released this.
In other words, how information feeds a democratic society is really about balancing inter-
ests. We may want to make particular information available, but don't give short shrift to
other public interests or private rights.

General Rules for Accessing Public Records

Let's begin by looking at what information is publicly available and what is off limits for vari-
ous reasons. For the purpose of determining whether you have a right of access, information
can be divided into two categories: private and government. Government information can be
subdivided into three categories, based on the branch that holds information: executive, leg-
islative, judicial. Executive and legislative can be further split into two: federal and state.

For the purposes of our conversation, we are going to focus primarily on federal branches.
Each state has its own laws of access, which lie outside the scope of this chapter (and the time
you want to spend reading it).

This chart illustrates how these categories are divided:
178  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Privately held information?

The easiest way to determine right of access to documents is to determine if the information
is owned or held by private parties. If the answer to this question is "yes," then journalists (or
any person) can request access, but have no right to demand this access. You must obtain an
owner's permission to legally use privately held information. Using such information without
permission will likely lead to people distrusting you and your work, and even in legal action.
Either way, your credibility will take a hit.

Accessing government information is not a clear-cut "yes" or "no." There is a chance that the
information you seek is already available. Below, I discuss accessing information from the
judicial and executive branches of the federal government.

Judicial branch

Let's first start with the judicial branch. Be aware that courts make records, and generally
you're entitled to look at them. For instance, state and federal courts often publish opinions,
transcripts of oral arguments, case documents, and more. Accessing court information is gen-
erally governed by case law, and there is a First Amendment right of access to court pro-
ceedings and common law right of access to court documents. But in some cases, courts
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS  179

will permit restrictions on access (i.e., closing courtrooms, sealing documents, instituting gag
orders). Those are done, typically, in the interest of justice, to ensure that parties get their fair
shake in court.

So do you have access to court documents? Yes, but it may not be to everything.

Federal executive branch

As mentioned above, many offices and agencies in the federal executive branch make certain
documents readily available to the public. There are exceptions to this. Below, I will give you
a rough outline of how to predict what will and will not be at the ready through the GPO, or
the like.

Freedom of Information Act

Congress created a right of access to federal executive branch records by enacting the Free-
dom of Information Act (FOIA), which allows any person to request federal agency records for
any purpose. This means that access to executive branch records is governed by statute. Let's
break down the elements of FOIA:

    a. Any person means it. The requester doesn't have to be US citizen, or a journalist, or
         fulfill any other requirements.

    b. Agency means all executive branch agencies (e.g., Federal Communications Commis-
         sion, Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal
         Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and the entire alphabet soup), the
         military, presidential commissions, the U.S. Post Office, and other government-con-
         trolled entities. However, FOIA does not include the president, the U.S. Congress, or
         the courts.

    c. Records means any paper or electronic record. This includes documents, computer
         files, databases, photographs, videos, audio recordings, and emails. It does not
         include physical objects. For instance, you can't demand to inspect a person's com-
         puter, look through file cabinets, obtain other objects. For example, a transcript of FBI
         interviews with witnesses about the assassination of President Kennedy would be a
         record, but the guns and bullets gathered as evidence would not be.

    d. Any purpose means any purpose. You don't have to explain why you want the
         records, generally. But you may be required to state your purpose if asking for fee
         waiver. To get it, you must demonstrate that you're making a request for the purpose
         of informing the public about government operations.
180  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

This means that many of these agencies, offices, and bodies will produce some information
that is available to anyone through their website or GPO. All may have information that any-
one may request. Not all information is available for consumption, however, because it may
be classified for national security, or for other reasons. There are no clear-cut lines with this,
so you should work closely with a librarian or a professor who has experience with govern-
ment information or FOIA, before moving onto our next step, which is placing a FOIA request.

Before You Make a FOIA Request

Before you file a FOIA request, we recommend that you visit the FOIA website. Here, you will
notice and click on a tab, "Before you request" before clicking "Search government websites."
Here, you can conduct a simple topical search for the information you are seeking. This will
allow you to determine if the information is already available.

If you can't find the information in your search or have questions, call the agency with which
you will file the FOIA request. They can tell you over the phone if you will need to file a FOIA
request.

Making a FOIA Request

After determining that you must file a FOIA request, then follow this advice and procedures.

You must request records in writing. Each agency has rules defining what must be included in
the request and how the agency accepts requests (by mail, email, online submission, or other-
wise). All agencies post procedures on their website, and many provide the option of making
requests online.

As an alternative, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press has created a FOIA gener-
ator and tracking system called iFOIA that allows you to fill out a form and generate a letter
that can be emailed to the appropriate agency. It's worthwhile to play around with iFOIA with-
out submitting a request, to become familiar with the options and proper language for sub-
mitting FOIA requests.

FOIA request processing

Let's break down this whole process. First, requests must reasonably describe the record
you're seeking. As practical matter, it is important to describe records as specifically and nar-
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS  181

rowly as possible. So doing make it much easier -- and faster -- for an agency to understand
exactly which documents are responsive and fulfill the request. Agencies are not obligated to
fulfill requests that are so vague that they amount to fishing expeditions, or that require the
agency to do research on the requester's behalf.

This means that you need enough information before making a request to describe with
specificity what you want. That a request may involve large number of documents is not a
major issue. The question is whether the agency can reasonably figure out what those docu-
ments are without extensive independent research.

The statute regarding FOIA states agencies have 20 days to grant or deny a request, although
as a practical matter, it may take longer. The law acknowledges times when an agency cannot
promptly respond because it is flooded with requests and lacks the resources to respond in
timely manner.

So, if an agency is otherwise acting diligently, courts will not punish an agency for being over-
whelmed and understaffed. You might have to wait your turn, and that may take months or
years.

Processing fees

You might have to pay fees for searching and copying costs. It is possible to get a waiver if you
show that the records you want are of public importance.

But, if fees are not waived, you'll be placed in a fee category, of which there are three: (1) com-
mercial users, pay all costs, (2) noncommercial educational, scientific, or journalistic users,
pay nothing for first 2 hours of research and first 100 pages of copies, and (3) all others, who
pay for search and copy costs, but not review costs.

Journalists should include in their letter both a fee waiver request and a statement that if the
waiver is not granted, they belong in the journalism fee category. If fees will be over a certain
amount (typically $25), agency will inform you so you can decide whether or how to proceed.
But you should state the highest amount you're willing to pay.

Exemptions

In theory, government should provide records responsive to a request unless one of nine
exemptions applies. If an exemption applies, the government may withhold the requested
information. There is a concept known as "discretionary disclosure," which means an agency
182  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

may choose to release records even if the request falls within exemption, but as a practical
matter, you'll rarely get anything covered by exemption.

Let's discuss the nine types of exemptions.

    1. National Security: Congress granted the executive branch authority to determine
         which records should be withheld to preserve national security. For example, docu-
         ments pertinent to ongoing armed conflict will likely be exempt.

    2. Agency Rules & Practices: This applies to records "related solely" to internal personnel
         rules and practices. Over time, courts divided this into two, called "high" and "low."
         "Low" refers to records of mundane activities of no interest, such as where employees
         park. "High" refers to records vital to how an agency functions as an enforcer of the
         law.

    3. Statutory Exemptions: Applies to records declared confidential under other laws.

        Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits federally funded
        educational institutions from releasing educational records without consent,
        though there is some information universities can share, such as your email
        address. "Federally funded" means institution receives federal funds, directly
        or indirectly. So, almost all schools are subject to FERPA.

        Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) prohibits release of personal information
        held in Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) records without an individual's con-
        sent. This does not restrict disclosure of information about accidents, driving
        violations, suspended licenses, and similar matters. It only restricts personal
        information such as address, social security number, height, and weight.

        Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits health
        care providers from releasing protected information, such as medical records,
        without the consent of the patient. It applies to healthcare providers and busi-
        ness associates.

    4. Confidential Business Information: If record contents would qualify as a trade secret,
         it may be withheld. In other words, if someone could use the information to make a
         lot of money trading on Wall Street, then it's a no.

    5. Agency Memoranda: Allows agencies to withhold "working documents," like drafts of
         documents, internal notes, other preliminary materials that agency employees create
         or obtain in the course of doing their jobs. The reason? To allow employees to pro-
         pose ideas or have honest discussions without fear that material will be disclosed and
         used against them. Everyone can make mistakes or propose ideas that need to be
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS  183

         refined.
    6. Personnel, Medical and Other Personal files: Often called the "privacy exception," it

         applies to information about a particular individual. When determining this exemp-
         tion, the question is whether disclosure "would constitute a clearly unwarranted inva-
         sion of personal privacy." The first issue is whether there's information in the record
         that would raise a privacy issue. Second, a privacy interest must be weighed against
         the interest in disclosure.
    7. Law Enforcement Investigations: Government may withhold records compiled for law
         enforcement purposes if disclosure would (a) interfere with investigations, (b) deprive
         a defendant of a fair trial, (c) invade personal privacy, (d) disclose the identity of a con-
         fidential source, (e) reveal enforcement techniques, or (f) endanger life.

        As practical matter, broad language makes it difficult to get law enforcement
        records, at least until a matter is closed. Even then, portions of record may be
        redacted to hide names of sources or witnesses, or to prevent disclosure of
        enforcement techniques.

    8. Banking Reports: Applies to information related to examination, operating, or condi-
         tion of reports prepared by an agency responsible for regulation or supervision of
         financial institutions. it is designed to promote openness between bank and examin-
         ers, and to protect financial institutions from the release of honest evaluations about
         stability.

    9. Information about Wells: Probably the least-used exemption, this covers "geological
         and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells." Congress
         intended to protect the oil and gas industry from unfair competition when it devel-
         oped this exemption.

If the government ignores or denies request

If an agency denies a request, in whole or in part, it should say why -- e.g., because a request
is invalid (fails to specify identifiable record) or because an exemption applies, in which case
the agency should specify which exemption.

If you believe your request was improperly denied, you may appeal the agency's decision.
Each agency has different deadlines for filing an appeal. If you're not satisfied after appealing,
you can file a lawsuit, and the court will determine whether the agency acted properly.

Another resource is the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), created by Con-
gress to be a FOIA ombudsman. OGIS conducts mediation between requesters and agencies,
smoothing communication and trying to improve the process of obtaining records.
184  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

As a last resort, you may consult with an attorney or your organization's legal counsel and,
perhaps, file a lawsuit in a federal trial court.

Lifecycle of a FOIA request

    1. Before you submit a request, determine if it's necessary.
    2. Research which agency is likely to have responsive records.
    3. Request only what you want.
    4. Send request to appropriate agency.
    5. You'll receive acknowledgement that includes a tracking number and, the date the

         request was received, and whether the agency will comply within 20-day deadline.
    6. You may be charged fees. An agency should provide an estimate.
    7. Agencies process requests in order in which received.
    8. Once a search is performed, FOIA personnel review records to determine if exemp-

         tions apply.
    9. You receive releasable records in one batch or portions distributed in rolling releases.

         If any portions are redacted or denied, an agency should cite the exemption(s).
  10. If you appeal and win, the agency will process your request. Timelines for their

         response will vary.
  11. If you are not happy, contact an agency to speak to their FOIA Liaison, contact OGIS,

         or file a lawsuit.

Federal legislature

Although FOIA provides right of access to federal records, Congress exempted itself. No law
or court decision gives citizens a FOIA-like right of access to Congressional records. If Con-
gress refuses to hand out protected information, there little recourse except to an appeal to
an official's conscience -- or political opponents, who may be willing to turn over information
if they have it and it is not otherwise illegal to do so.

State laws

Every state has its own law for open records requests because they each have their own state
agencies. Some state open records laws also cover their legislature, but other state laws don't.
Some require written requests, and others let a requester show up at an agency and ask to
see records in person.

Each state is different. You must look at the law for state where you want access. Reporters

Committee for Freedom of the Press provides state-by-state compilation of laws, called Open
Government Guide, to guide reporters through their state laws and processes.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we have defined public records and discussed some general rules for deter-
mining what information is public or off-limits to us. After touching on some tips for verifying
that you will need to file a FOIA request, we discussed the lifecycle of a FOIA request.

Activity 1: Can FOIA help ya?

      Search for a topic in which you are interested at the FOIA website, and identify what
      documents are publicly available. Explain how these might be useful to your research.
      Summarize and evaluate at least two sources.

      Using the FOIA website, identify which agency you would need to contact to file a FOIA
      request.

      Navigate to the iFOIA platform, create an account, and walk through the prompts to
      generate a FOIA request about the topic in which you're interested, from the agency
      you identified on the FOIA website. Along the way, resolve any issues that arise (e.g.,
      indicate whether you're entitled to expedited processing and/or a fee waiver, and make
      your case accordingly). Decide if you will submit the request.

Activity 2: FCC Complaints

      Using the iFOIA platform, draft a FOIA request for viewer complaints about violent tele-
      vision programming.

      Assume that you're a reporter for The New York Times, and you're working on a story
      about consumer complaints sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
      about violent television programming aired in the prime-time block from 2016 to 2017.

      You want copies of any such complaints the FCC has received and copies of the
      agency's responses to those complaints. You believe it is critical for the public to
186  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

     receive this information as soon as possible, because next week Congress will review
     the authority it has granted to the FCC to evaluate whether the FCC is performing its
     duties effectively.

     With those things in mind, draft a request using the iFOIA platform. Create a free
     account, and follow the step-by-step prompts to draft the request. As you work, resolve
     any issues that arise (e.g., indicate whether you're entitled to expedited processing
     and/or a fee waiver, and make your case accordingly).

     Do not submit the request, since you're not really a New York Times reporter doing a
     story on the FCC. But you can save it to your computer, or print it out.

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Articulate how business models in the media limit readers' access to the news.
         Identify news sources for your daily news consumption and research needs.
         Use strategies for finding new and archived news on an assigned issue topic.
         Evaluate news sources for their credibility.

Playing Catch-Up on News

The City of Lawrence is planning to build a new headquarters for its police department. While
city leaders believe that a new building is long overdue, and is necessary for the police depart-
ment to continue effectively serving the ever-growing city, the plan is controversial. Some
Lawrence citizens don't believe that a brand new police headquarters is necessary, and that
the city can save taxpayer money by refurbishing existing police facilities. Others are opposed
to the location of the new headquarters because it's not central, it is on the edge of a quiet
residential neighborhood, and across the street from a high school.
Let's pretend that you arrive in Lawrence for your first post-college job, and this is a contro-
NEWS  189

versy that's handed to you. If you are a news reporter, your editor wants you to write an arti-
cle on what the city's current plans are for the headquarters, and what public opinion is like
on this issue. If you are a strat comm. professional, your manager assigns you to work with a
client that has a vested interest in the headquarters being built: the police officers' union. The
union is paying your firm to come up with messaging that will convince more Lawrencians to
support the new headquarters.

It is not unusual for a young communications professional to be handed an issue they know
nothing about, and to be told to learn all about it in a finite amount of time. Before you are
put in such a situation, you need to develop the skills and strategies for learning about an
issue effectively and efficiently. Knowing how to find and read credible news is a crucial first
step in this process.

Being an informed news consumer requires time and commitment. Back in the day, journal-
ists would read 2-3 print newspapers front to back every day, between listening to radio and
watching television broadcasts. With digital media, we have so many options, and our news
binges can go from healthy to excessive really quickly.

In this chapter, we briefly discuss the state of the news business, as we consider access to
news, and the paywalls that an increasing number of news publications are putting up. We
then walk through evaluating the credibility of a news article, focusing on the accuracy of its
content. The chapter ends with suggestions for accessing news sources, both directly and
through library subscriptions and databases.

Access to News

Access to the news is one of the most important topics in journalism today. Much of this dis-
cussion is centered on the business of news as the media shift to digital platforms and seek
new ways to generate revenue. For over 100 years, news agencies have relied on advertising
money to pay their operating costs and to reap a profit.

Today, 85 cents of every advertising dollar goes to Facebook or Google, according to The
Aspen Institute's annual report on journalism. Moreover, individuals and companies don't buy
as many print ads in newspapers as they used to, resulting in steep drops in print advertising
revenue. In 2017, newspaper companies in the United States made from advertising about
a third of what they made in 2007, according to the Pew Center's State of the News Media
report.

To compensate for the shortage of advertising revenue, many for-profit digital news agencies
190  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

are shifting from the advertising model to a reader subscription model, which restricts read-
ers' access to news. By putting up semi-porous paywalls, some news companies have suc-
ceeded in generating revenue on their digital products.

For instance, The New York Times allows non-subscribing readers to read five articles a month
before blocking their access and asking them to subscribe. In 2017, The New York Times
made $1 billion in subscription revenue, with digital subscriptions increasing by over $100
million. The Times is not alone -- after the 2016 presidential election, many major publica-
tions saw a major increase in reader subscriptions and donations, in the case of not-for-profit
outlets such as The Guardian. Readers sign up because they want access to quality local news,
or because they want to support good journalism, the American Press Institute found. The
reader subscription model can generate a lot of money.

Whether you are Googling or using some of the libraries' resources, you are likely to hit a pay-
wall eventually. However, freely accessible news does still exist. For example, not-for-profit
media agencies, such as ProPublica and The Guardian, ask for donations in lieu of subscrip-
tions and do not block content.

Paywalled news media also promise to drop their paywalls in emergency situations, so that
the public can have unfettered access to the news. But what constitutes an emergency? You
may argue that the Sudanese refugee crisis constitutes an emergency, but these agencies are
unlikely to drop their paywalls for a story like that.

Do Paywalls Signify Credibility?

While many credible news sources are moving behind paywalls, the porosity of paywalls
varies. This means that some companies are allowing more free article reads than others.

Editors, publishers, and owners of subscription publications have promised that paywalls will
enable their staff to produce quality journalism. Vanity Fair's editor, Radhika Jones, explained
that subscriptions would support "more breaking news, more in-depth reporting, more voices
in commentary and opinion, more access to our incredible archives, and more of the intel-
ligent, prescient, agenda-setting journalism" on which Vanity Fair prides itself. Some in the
business of journalism see paywalls as the only way to ensure that credible news continues.

Following this logic, you may be tempted to view a paywall as a marker of credible journalism.
For instance, you know that The New York Times will ask you to pay for for the sixth article
you read, but that clickbait websites will not do that. For instance, Buzzfeed's quizzes lure you
NEWS  191

in, and there are always those advertised headlines lampooning the latest celebrity couple or
the president. All of this stuff is free and less-than-credible, right?

But critics (and even some supporters) of the paywall or digital subscription model beg to dif-
fer. They critique digital subscriptions as a capitalistic ventures that do not benefit the news-
room, but instead fund company owners' profit margins and their side pet projects or failures.

The Denver Post paywall

The ways in which digital subscription models do not improve the quality and credibility of
news can be seen in The Denver Post's battle against its owner. The Post is owned by Digital
First Media (DFM), a company that is controlled by a hedge fund called Alden Global Capital,
which is owned, in turn, by Wall Street tycoon Randall D. Smith.

DFM, the nation's second largest newspaper chain, is infamous for purchasing newspapers,
laying off staff, centralizing content and operations, recycling content across multiple plat-
forms, and thus widening its profit margins, according to a news business analysis by Nieman
Lab's Ken Doctor. In other words, an Alden/DFM-owned local newspaper's website may not
publish any news about the local government or local happenings. Instead, it will present a
series of clickbait articles written by freelance writers, not local journalists, that were run in
several newspapers across the country about strange-yet-captivating subjects like raccoon
cats.

On April 6, 2018, the Post's editorial board published an editorial spread criticizing DFM, its
owner, throwing the first blow of a national war. Leading the charge against "vulture capital-
ists," editorial page editor Chuck Plunkett lambasted DFM for its "cynical strategy of constantly
reducing the amount and quality of its offerings, while steadily increasing its subscription
rates." Plunkett continued to explain that the Post was no longer adequately staffed to cover
Denver, the state, or its surrounding regions because its staff had been reduced from more
than 250 to fewer than 100. And more cuts were coming.

Under such conditions, the Post would not be able to muster the same Pulitzer Prize-worthy
local coverage as it did when reporting on the massacres at Columbine High School and at the
Aurora movie theater. "The inevitable result is that the reduction in quality leads to a reduc-
tion of trust," Plunkett surmised before issuing public plea for a new owner. In other words,
the Post feared its owner's lust for profits was undercutting its credibility with its readers,
who, Plunkett argued, deserved quality local journalism.

Smith is no more than a "vulture capitalist," The Nation's Julie Reynolds declared. In her inves-
192  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

tigation of Smith's finances, Reynolds uncovered that Smith buys local newspapers at rock
bottom prices, lays off staff at twice the rate of other news companies, jacks up subscription
and advertising rates, and then sells off the printing presses and facilities once the publica-
tion is defunct. Reynolds and Ken Doctor found that Smith profited greatly from this model,
making almost $160 million in 2017, and $36 million on the Post alone. What does Smith do
with this kind of money? Rather than reinvesting in newsrooms and reporting, he buys lots
and lots of Palm Beach mansions.

With the national press taking note of this threat to local journalism, other DFM newspapers
joined the protest. Dave Krieger, the editorial page editor of neighboring Boulder Daily Cam-
era, also owned by DFM, self-published a piece in solidarity with Plunkett's call for new owner-
ship. DFM fired Krieger for speaking out and got rid of the Camera's editorial section. Plunkett
pushed to publish another editorial defending Krieger. A DFM executive refused to allow it,
and instituted a policy mandating DFM approval of editorials. Plunkett resigned in protest.
Then, two senior editors and the chair of the Post's board quit in solidarity. Fifty-five Post
employees decried DFM's actions in a letter published by The NewsGuild, a newspaper union.
Post reporters gathered outside of Alden's New York City offices to protest DFM, alongside
journalists employed by other DFM publications. Even student journalists at Duke University
called on DFM to do better by the Post. All of this because a newspaper owner valued profits
over credible local news.

The case of The Denver Post illustrates that a paywall is not an automatic indicator of credibil-
ity. Some publications that use a paywall, like The Denver Post and its siblings, do not benefit
from the revenues these paywalls generate. Other paywalled companies, however, are doing
great journalism. The Washington Post, for example, operates under the digital subscription
model. Its journalists continues to thrive, winning two Pulitzer Prizes in 2018, including one
for its coverage of U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, discussed earlier in this textbook.

How to Assess the Credibility of News

News articles, in general, are secondary sources. This is because in the process of writing
the news, reporters collect information from a variety of sources, like other news articles,
news conferences, news releases, spokespeople, eyewitnesses, records, reports, and studies.
In their articles, reporters present the information from these sources in new and reconfig-
ured ways. The primary sources of information presented in the news reside outside of news
articles, but hopefully are attributed inside these articles.

Because the news is secondary sources of information, when assessing the credibility of any
news, it is important to skeptically interrogate it. This process entails retracing the reporter's
NEWS  193

steps, checking their research and sources, and determining if it is reasonable to reach the
same conclusions as they did.

To understand better the credibility of news, let's return to The Denver Post's stance against
Alden/DFM, its owner, and focus on how student journalists at Duke University helped to
localize this national story. As we know, the national topic was that DFM was threatening the
future of local newspapers by slashing newsroom staffs in favor of widening profit margins.
Even though Duke University or its home, Durham, North Carolina, were not part of DFM's
newspaper chain, Duke's student newspaper, The Chronicle, answered The Denver Post's call
to take a position against DFM with a news article and an editorial. Examining this news arti-
cle helps us illustrate how to assess the credibility of news.

Duke's involvement with the story started when the NewsGuild, the same union that pub-
lished Post employees' letter of dissent, called out Duke University for benefiting from Alden/
DFM. In two letters to Duke's president, and in a news story on its website, the national union
criticized Duke for accepting donations from Heath Freeman, a Duke alumnus, and president
of Alden Global Capital, the hedge fund that owns DFM.

The NewsGuild's president decried Duke's relationship with a "vulture capitalist" in the union's
article: "Receipt of his donations contradicts the mission of Duke and of the DeWitt Wallace
Center for Media & Democracy, and it is an insult to journalists everywhere." He argued that
Duke had no business researching journalism or training future journalists, or being home to
the DeWitt Wallace Center for Media & Democracy, as long as the university accepted profits
from Alden's destruction of local journalism. In response to the union's private communica-
tions to the university president, Duke denied having any relationship with Alden.

Duke might have gotten away with their denial if it hadn't been for some meddling student
journalists, particularly Sam Turken, who wrote a news article for The Chronicle, Duke's stu-
dent newspaper. In his piece, Turken refuted Duke's denial that the university was not bene-
fitting from a relationship with Freeman.

To assess the credibility of Turken's article, we retrace his reporting steps, focusing on a single
credibility cue: the accuracy of the article's content. We can use the lateral search process we
discussed in chapter 7.

Duke's Turken would have started his research with the main topic that is being investigated,
the controversy between The Post and Alden/DFM. If we hadn't done so already, we would
Google information about The Denver Post and Alden/DFM to learn more about the contro-
versy. Since we are informed on this subject already, we move onto locating the beginning of
the beef between Duke's Heath Freeman and The NewsGuild. We might question, for exam-
194  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

ple, if The NewsGuild's criticism of Duke is true, or whether Duke is right to deny that it
benefits from Alden/DFM's "vulture capitalism." So we quickly Google "Heath Freeman Duke
NewsGuild," and find The NewsGuild's web story among our top results of news outlets also
reporting on the topic. This story gives us (1) the primary source for much of the backstory
Turken includes in his story, and (2) the letters exchanged between Duke and The NewsGuild,
which are linked in Turken's story. So already, we have substantiated Turken's timeline for The
NewsGuild communicating with Duke, and verified the union's version of events. Additionally,
we might go back and read what other news outlets are saying. If their information aligns with
what Turken provided, then this is another point in his favor.

Next up, we could investigate Heath Freeman, his employment, and his connection to Duke.
We could try contacting Freeman directly, and could try to find his contact information via
Google. Our first instinct might be to start with his company's website. Unfortunately, Alden's
website does not appear to be functioning, even though a quick search on Whois shows that
the domain is owned by Alden. (Sidenote: This makes Alden look even more shady. What kind
of big business doesn't have a website?!)

Anyhoo, we return to Google to search Freeman's name and Duke. This yields a #NewsMat-
ters biography of Freeman, but the organization's "About" page discloses that it represents
protesting DFM employees. This doesn't seem like an unbiased source, so we should seek
other information. Moving on, we find a Bloomberg profile of Freeman and his LinkedIn pro-
file. But no contact information, so contacting Freeman directly would be tricky. However, we
know Bloomberg is an established business news company, and we see that the LinkedIn
profile confirms the Bloomberg listing. To be certain, we could jump over to Nexis Uni, a sub-
scription database available through the libraries, to research Freeman. Here, we find many
articles from business wires and other news sources that detail Freeman's latest business
deals and the DFM-Post controversy as president of Alden. We're pretty sure he is who he
says he is.

But what about Freeman's affiliation with Duke? His LinkedIn profile confirmed that he
attended Duke, but it would be better if we could get confirmation from Duke. Turken pro-
vides such information as Freeman's graduation year, what activities he participated in as a
student, and details about his fundraising on behalf of the university. The Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) allows a university to confirm some information about a stu-
dent's attendance, such as the dates they were there and their official activities. So Turken
would have been able to contact Duke directly about some of this information. However, he
hyperlinks to the 2016-2017 annual report for Duke's Freeman Center for Jewish Life. This
makes it pretty clear that Turken probably Googled The NewsGuild's assertion that Freeman
resides as the chair of advisory board for the Freeman Center, named for his family. The
report confirms the fundraising sums Turken mentioned in his report, as well as details about
NEWS  195

the Freeman family, which Freeman details in an opening letter. Through our own Google
searches, we find similar family and educational background in an alumni magazine post-
ing, and confirm Freeman's interest and involvement in Duke football in the same posting, by
Turken's link to a Duke athletic's article, and an interview of student-athletes Freeman worked
with. Looks as though Freeman's association with Duke checks out.

We could continue checking the credibility of Turken's article. For instance, we could confirm
that the journalist he interviewed, Lisa Krieger, does work for San Jose Mercury News and
graduated from Duke by looking up her profile at the newspaper, calling Duke to confirm her
graduation date, or, using the contact information on her work profile, contacting her directly
to verify her quote.

We could even check where Duke's newspaper got The NewsGuild image posted above the
article. To do this, we right-click on the image, copy the URL or the image itself. Then we hop
over to Google Image search or TinEye, and right-click again to paste the picture or URL into
the search box. Our search results confirm that the image is originally from The NewsGuild
website, and that the newspaper didn't doctor the image.

At the end of it, we can feel assured, through our prior research and skeptical verification
process, that Turken researched and published a credible news story that successfully local-
ized a national issue for his Duke audience.

As we think about the accuracy of news, it's important to keep in mind that journalists some-
times do make mistakes. Sometimes a journalist receives misinformation from a seemingly
reliable source or they may just get something wrong. However, a credible journalist and
news source will acknowledge when an error has been made and issue a correction. Being
able to judge whether or not information is accurate comes from reading and balancing the
information, argument, and perspectives presented in multiple sources. Experienced journal-
ists follow such a verification process when reporting, and we must do the same when evalu-
ating their reporting.

To recap, we used the following sources when evaluating the accuracy of the content pre-
sented in the Duke article, and recommend that you use similar techniques and sources in
the credibility checks you perform:

      Google. This is basic but, as you know, can allow you to check out a person's web pres-
         ence: Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram as well as any directory listings on a com-
         pany website, which would confirm employment. Do this for the reporter and any
         reference sources to get a snapshot of their past experiences and work.

      Use WHOIS to look up company names and web or IP addresses, which is particularly
196  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         useful if you stumble across a website that you are not familiar with. This tool allows
         you to see who or what owns a website and when they created the website.

      Subscription databases, particularly Nexis Uni, available through KU Libraries.

      TinEye and Google's image search allows you to search by images. You simply drag
         and drop an image into the search box or upload it. Use this to determine if any
         graphics included in the story are original to the source and to verify any social media
         accounts. Lots of fake social media accounts sport stock photos.

And that's how we would assess the content accuracy cue, as part of evaluating the accuracy
of Turken's article. Any news article also can be evaluated on several other cues, like pub-
lisher, author, timeliness, sources, and bias. Ideally, we would interrogate Turken's work on
these cues. As always, the balance of the evidence from these cues should determine whether
or not the article is credible enough to use in our own research or reporting.

Using News to Understand the Context of News

The process of coming to understand an issue from news articles that have reported on the
issue entails reconstructing for ourselves this issue's multi-level context. Most issues have
several levels of context, including global, national, and local or hyperlocal.

The Duke Chronicle's article on the Alden/DFM-The Denver Post standoff localized a national
story. In the article, Turken, the journalist, conveyed to his readers why they should care
about a battle in Colorado. He showed them how and why this national news was impacting
their community, Duke University.

As you research an issue, think similarly about the global, national, local, or hyperlocal lenses
through which you can view this issue. Doing so will help you more fully understand the issue.

      Global sources can help you understand the big picture of an issue. For instance,
         many of Alden/DFM's critics accused Alden or being a threat to local journalism or
         Free Speech in the United States. To get a global perspective on this, you could bench-
         mark this case against historical instances of the freedom of the press being mitigated
         by capitalistic or governmental forces. The non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists
         is constantly reporting on such threats against journalism and journalists.

      National news is valuable for a variety of reasons. It can tell you how global issues are
         playing out in the United States or the larger implications of something happening in
         your neighborhood, city, or state. It can also help you determine if and how your local
         issue has played out in other states. For instance, The Denver Post story became
NEWS  197

         national news because other DFM-newspapers across the nation faced similar prob-
         lems, and the wider journalism community responded. Additionally, the freedom of
         the press is a constitutional right, enshrined in the First Amendment, which makes it
         difficult to discuss the troubles in Denver without the context of this right.
      Local/hyperlocal news is vital but endangered. Local news helps citizens stay informed
         of the issues that are most likely to have an immediate impact on their lives. It drives
         home for readers, viewers, and clients why national and global issues are important
         or why they should care. It often answers the "So what?" question. For example,
         Turken told the Duke community why they should care about The Denver Post: one of
         their own was involved and engaging in shady behavior that stood in conflict with the
         values of Duke's (journalism) community.

Accessing News

Being an information professional entails constantly consuming the news. Good journalists
and strat comm. professionals know what's going on. They read, listen to, and read as much
news as possible, to stay informed of current events, and track how news stories develop.
This means cultivating a habit of browsing and consuming news every day. Below we discuss
tactics and resources for helping you do this without becoming overwhelmed.

Newsletters

To save time while chasing down news, you can have the news emailed to you. Nearly every
news source issues a newsletter or digest of the most important recent news. Below are
links to a few newsletters. Editors of these digests summarize the news so that you become
informed in about five minutes. The newsletters on this list are all free, but may link to items
behind paywalls.

      Lawrence World Journal
      The Skimm
      Need2Know
      NextDraft
      Poynter's Morning Mediawire
      Race/Related from The New York Times. This weekly newsletter offers provocative

         reporting on news related to race, as well as recommendations for further reading.

      The Week. Unlike those other newsletters, this one includes the best photojournalism
         of the week.

Social media

Journalists often are required to tweet throughout their workdays. By following key journal-
ists, you often can trace a developing news story for free, and find heaps of experts on a given
topic. Photojournalists also take advantage of Instagram to showcase their work. Figuring out
which social media accounts are actually helpful, though, can be difficult. Here are some tips
for getting started.

    1. Begin by following a major news agency that is reporting on your topic. Pretty much
          all news outlets have their social media bases covered and will repost their
          reporters' content. Following a reporter's employer will help you find out who is
          assigned to a particular area or beat.

    2. Find one good source.

             If you've found one good source, you've probably found a lot of good sources.
                First, read the reporter's bio and check out their other publications. If they fre-
                quently write on a topic or similar ones, then they have probably been assigned
                to cover this particular area and are the beat "experts" at their publications.

             Check out the sources. To build their credibility, reporters interview and cite var-
                ious experts. These experts likely have their own work and publications that
                they want to publicize, so you can track them down on social media to directly
                access their expertise.

             Pay attention to who broke the original story. In journalism, reporters strive to
                get it first and get it right. Doing both means that a reporter is on top of his or
                her game, that is, is an expert on a given topic. Out of respect for those who get
                it first, reporters will cite who was the first to break a story or a major lead. If
                you see this, locate that original news and reporter. Read their reporting and fol-
                low their social media posts.

    3. Follow the leader. It is also good to note that many journalists also find stories
          through social media, so you should also pay attention to whom reporters are fol-
          lowing on social media. This can lead you to find other reporters and their sources
          for your work.

Bear in mind, though, to follow the official verified accounts of news sources. Even if your best
NEWS  199

friend tweets a link to an article published by a reputable source, you should track that source
down to verify its authenticity.

If the above sounds familiar, it is probably because you would follow similar steps when using
Google News and Scholar and the Libraries' subscription databases to locate information.
Keep the above tips in mind throughout your research process.

Aggregators, Like Google News

A news aggregator is a website that presents news from a range of sources, organizing the
news around the key news topics. Google News is one of the most popular news aggrega-
tors around. Though it does not produce original content, Google culls the Internet in search
of the latest news headlines. Using Google News has its advantages. First, it serves as a one-
stop shop for reading across many news organizations. Second, you can customize your news
page to follow trends and topics that are important to you.

Customize Google News

To customize your Google News sections, click on the rotary wheel on the top right of your
Google News page. As you can see in the below image, you can then click on sections or
search for "Your interests" to personalize your News feed. Google provides detailed instruc-
tions on how to get the news customized.
200  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Set Google Alerts

To receive emails about specific topics in the news, you can sign into your Google account,
and navigate to its alerts page. Here, you may type in any topic, and determine how fre-
quently you want Google to deliver news on this topic to your email inbox. For complete
instructions and tips for managing your Google Alerts, you can read this article by TechRe-
public.

Downsides of Google News

Google News is convenient but it also has all of the downfalls and traps of its parent product
that we discussed in our earlier chapter on Google. Like the search engine side of Google,
NEWS  201

Google News uses web crawlers to find content, as this article from Search Engine Land, a
news site about search and marketing, explains. The reliance of Google News on an algorithm
also means that there is a whole lot of news that Google does not uncover.

Moreover, what Google News displays is personalized to meet what Google thinks you need,
based on your past reading history and location. This may be great when you are tracking
a particular topic, but it also puts you in a filter bubble and an echo chamber or your own
interests. An overreliance on the curated flow of news in Google News (and in all social media
platforms) may prevent you from discovering interests that may turn out to be vital to your
research, work, and life.

Finally, the popularity of a news story contributes to the algorithm that determines what news
Google News presents. As a result, Google news has been guilty of circulating false infor-
mation. The Atlantic reported that when there is an absence of credible news -- say when
news of a mass shooting is just broken and news outlets haven't have a chance to cover it --
Google News will retrieve half-baked conspiracy theories and misinformation that circulate in
the dark corners of the internet.

To avoid being deceived by such algorithmic traps, we suggest that you develop a healthy and
varied news diet. This can include visiting specific news agencies directly, such as websites for
local, regional, and national newspapers, and watching broadcast news.

Searching for News

When searching for news using either Google or the Libraries' subscription databases,
remember some of our earlier tips from the search/re-search and search toolbox chapters.
In particular, pay attention to your search terms.

If you are not finding the information you need, it may be because your search terms are
either to wide or too narrow. When researching Lawrence's new police headquarters for
example, you may first search for "new police station." This may capture some recent articles,
but not every article is going to use this phrase. Change it up and try "law enforcement facil-
ity" OR "law enforcement facilities." Or look for the specific referendum or ballot initiative that
proposed funding for the facility, such as "Proposition No. 1" AND "law enforcement."

Limiters in Google News and research databases work much like the options on Amazon or
other shopping sites. Limiters allow you to select specific dates, locations, and languages,
full-text articles, and other facets of the results. These limiters are typically listed under an
"advanced search" link, or to the left of the search results. We often start a search without
202  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

any limitations and gradually add them until we start getting more precise or relevant results.
Keep in mind, however, that adding more limiters will decrease the number or search results
we have in general. The key limiters to play with include:

      Dates. The past repeats itself, and you want to make certain that you find information
         about the specific incident you are researching.

      Location. Lawrence, Kansas, isn't the only place that has debated funding a law
         enforcement complex. For this reason, take advantage of any geographic limiters
         available, or add the city and state name to your search. Alternatively, if you want to
         find out what is happening in other places, do not limit your search geographically.

      Languages. Google News and news databases will contain information in several lan-
         guages. Take advantage of language limiters to ensure that you access languages that
         you can read, and the viewpoints you are interested in learning about. For instance, if
         you want to know what the LatinX population is thinking about immigration, limit your
         search to Spanish.

Library resources

There really isn't any sure way of getting around a paywall unless you work for Mr. Robot.
You can, however, take advantage of the subscriptions you have through university and local
libraries. These subscriptions aren't really free because they are funded by your tax and
tuition dollars, but at least you won't have to fork over any additional money to access a news
publication. Below is a short list of resources available through the KU Libraries' website.
These resources have been vetted as credible resources by information experts (i.e., librari-
ans).

Specific publications

KU and Lawrence Libraries have access to many news publications. The following is a very
small sample of what's available. To locate specific publication titles through KU Libraries,
start at the Libraries' website, and click on "e-Journals," under "Find," in the middle left of your
screen. From here, you can search for paywalled local and national publications such as:

      Kansas City Star
      Wall Street Journal
      New York Times

            KU has full access to The Times through the database ProQuest Newsstand, but it
NEWS  203

               is not presented there in the browser-friendly format as on the Times website or
               mobile app. If you prefer to look at the Times the way it's published online, the
               Lawrence Public Library is your gateway to unlimited New York Times. Because
               you reside in Lawrence as a student, you can get a library card at the LPL to gain
               access to the most recent online edition.
      Christian Science Monitor

Databases

The libraries' databases contain more than just news publications. Some also contain trade
publications, such as AdAge, scholarly articles, and business reports. You typically can filter
out the noise with the options listed on the left side of the results page.

To locate a specific database, you may type its name directly into the main search box, or
locate it under the "Articles and Databases" link in the "Find" section on the homepage.

      Access World News

            This has a bunch of news from across the globe, and it also has news sources
               from the United States and from Kansas specifically. Equally helpful, there is con-
               tent from military media and broadcast transcripts from television and radio.

      Associated Press collections online
      Nexis Uni

            This has a natural language search function and plenty of filters to make it easier
               and faster to find the news you need. Filter by time period, geographic location,
               subject, and even whether the news is negative or not.

Historical sources

      Chicago Defender

            The nation's influential African-American newspaper. Based in Chicago, two-thirds
               of its large readership was outside of the Second City. If you are researching an
               issue related to African-American history and life, check this source. We promise it
204  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

               will give you a needed perspective.
      Chicago Tribune
      ProQuest Historical Newspapers

            If you are looking for back issues, this databases of many newspapers houses
               material from the Nineteenth Century to the early Twenty-first Century.

Conclusion

When reading and using media sources for your research, remember to go through the
processes we outlined in the chapters on evaluation and bias. It is particularly important to
be mindful of the geographic, demographic, and temporal scope of media outlets. Journalists
used to read two to three newspapers a day so that they would be informed by multiple per-
spectives. You should seek divergent perspectives in your daily life and research as well.

Activity 1: Newsletter Review

      Identify and subscribe to one of the newsletters listed above. After receiving and read-
      ing at least one issue of the newsletter, write a review of this resource.

         Did it contain relevant content?

      Explore the resource's search functions, information, ease of use, limitations, and
      other positive and negative features.

         Using your findings, create a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the tool.
         Your audience for the tutorial is one of your fellow classmates.
         You may use whatever technological tool you wish to create your tutorial, which

            should run approximately 2-3 minutes.

Activity 4: News Research

      Use one of the resources discussed in this chapter to research your topic.

         Write a one-page synopsis of your search process.
         In the first paragraph, summarize the steps you took to find the information, includ-

            ing the search terms you used, what they yielded, and how your searching devel-
            oped.
         In the second paragraph, summarize the credibility of the information sources you
            found. Explain how the credibility of the sources you found led you to use some of
            these sources, but not others.
         Summarize the information about your topic that you found, attributing all of the

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Understand nonprofits as potential sources of information and expertise on a topic.
         Be familiar with several categories of nonprofits.
         Know how to find a nonprofit related to a specific topic.
         Be able to evaluate the credibility of a nonprofit using information from a Form 990.

Beyond Homeless Puppies

This chapter's primary goal is to convince you to consider a nonprofit organization as a poten-
tial source for any news article, news release, or strategic communication report you write. In
other words, as you plan your sources, I always want you to ask yourself, "Is there a nonprofit
I can contact about this issue?"
This may seem like a strange goal because, if you're like me, the word "nonprofit" conjures up
images of sad-looking puppies and kittens, and Sarah McLachlan crooning, "Will You Remem-
ber Me." Or appeals to "text such-and-such" to some five-digit number, for an automatic $5
donation to a natural disaster relief fund.
208  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

So this chapter's secondary goal is to stretch your definition of a nonprofit beyond charities.
Charities like the Humane Society and the Red Cross constitute only one category of nonprof-
its. There are many, many nonprofits that are not as well known as these charities because
they do not solicit donations from the public, and because they do not run vivid funding cam-
paigns that pull at our heart strings.

For the purposes of this chapter, let's use this definition of a nonprofit: A nonprofit is an orga-
nization of people who come together around a common cause about which they care deeply.

Nonprofits In the News

Let's consider three examples of nonprofits being used as sources in news stories.

First example: Women CEOs

An Associated Press article published in Raleigh's News & Observer and other outlets, dis-
cusses the relative absence of women CEOs in large companies. The article states that in
2017, women led only 5 percent of the top 500 companies traded on U.S. stock exchanges. It
also reports, however, that these women were being compensated on par with, or more than,
men CEOs. The bulk of this article is based on an analysis that a research firm named Equilar
conducted for the Associated Press.

About two-thirds down, the article states that, "There is a bright spot, though: female rep-
resentation on boards is improving, according to Catalyst, a nonprofit that works with com-
panies to build a diverse workforce." A couple of paragraphs down, there is a quote from a
Catalyst vice president, who argues that this change is not generational, but driven by the
recognition that diverse boards of directors are better for business than all-dude boards.

Our definition of a nonprofit as a group of people who come together around a common
cause can help us understand why Catalyst ended up being a source in this article. Catalyst is
an organization whose common cause is the promotion of a more gender-diverse workplace.
It is likely that this story's writer looked for a source that could provide some context or addi-
tional information about women as CEOs, or women in the workplace more generally. Cata-
lyst fit the bill of such a source, and its vice president served as an expert voice in the story.
The nonprofit also shared with the writer its own data about women on boards of directors.
By including Catalyst in the story, the writer ended up with a richer report.
NONPROFITS  209

Second example: Employee perks

Another workplace-related story from the Kansas City Star describes efforts by companies to
recruit Millennial employees by offering them unique employee perks. The article's sources
are representatives of several Kansas City-based companies, including Cerner, Grant Thorn-
ton, Pro Athlete, and Black & Veatch. These companies' unique employee benefits include
gyms, cooking classes, phone plan discounts, and a breastmilk delivery service for traveling
mothers.

The nonprofit source in the article is a group named American Student Assistance, which sup-
ports young people in their educational and career planning. One of the perks discussed in
the article is assistance with student debt. The article cites research conducted by American
Student Assistance, in which "76 percent of college students said such offers would be a
deciding factor in accepting a job, as the average debt on a bachelor's degree is around
$30,000."

The nonprofit plays a secondary but important role in this story, providing background infor-
mation that the local company sources didn't have. American Student Assistance, whose
cause is educational and career planning, was a natural source to plug into an article about
both career planning and, indirectly, college debt.

Third example: How these clowns suffer

An article in the Hollywood Reporter discusses the unintended consequences of the 2017 hor-
ror film It, about the murderous clown Pennywise. According to the article, the clown indus-
try suffered following the movie's release, with fewer clowns being hired for performances at
schools, libraries, and birthday parties.

Key sources in the article are members of the World Clown Association, a nonprofit that sup-
ports clowns through conferences, training, and access to an insurance policy. Yes, clowns
need insurance, and this isn't medical insurance, but liability insurance. It's to assist the
clowns in case something goes very wrong during their performances. In the article, members
of the association bemoan the negative perceptions of clowns that It and other negative
media portrayals of clowns have generated.

How do the World Clown Association and its members become sources in this article? The
writer of the article likely looked for a source that was well-versed on the plight of professional
clowns, and one that could connect him to individual clowns who could witness to their strug-
gles in the post-It era. The World Clown Association is a group of people who care deeply
210  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

about clowns, and that fits precisely this writer's needs for this story. And if nobody at the
World Clown Association responded to the writer's email or phone call, then maybe someone
at Clowns of America International, another clown-focused nonprofit, would have been avail-
able.

In all three articles, nonprofits served as one of the sources because a nonprofit, by our def-
inition, is a group of people who come together around a common cause about which they
care deeply. When the article is about a nonprofit's cause or issue, that nonprofit can be an
ideal source. The people who work at the nonprofit, or the nonprofit's members, are some of
the most educated and passionate individuals on the issue at hand. They often have access to
data and research that isn't available elsewhere. And they know individuals whose first-hand
experiences with the issue can contribute vivid details to the story.

In sum, a key question that a writer of an article covering any issue should be asking is: Is
there a nonprofit whose cause is the issue I am writing about?

Categories of Nonprofits

While there are several legally defined categories of nonprofits, let's consider a few common
categories of nonprofits that may be especially useful as sources for journalists and strategic
communications professionals.

Trade associations

A trade association is a group of people whose cause is their common trade, business, or
industry. Trade associations often are formed by companies, and these companies and the
people who work for them constitute the members of these nonprofits. Trade associations
organize trade shows, conferences, trainings, certifications, and publish newsletters or maga-
zines. All of these programs are meant to advance their members' trades or businesses. Trade
associations also can hire lobbyists to advocate for their members' interests with lawmakers.

Examples: The American Home Furnishings Alliance is the trade association for companies
that make furniture. Airports Council International - North America is the trade association
for the operators of airports, and for vendors who do business inside airports. The National
Association of Convenience Stores and the Association of Convenience Store Retailers both
are trade associations for the owners of convenience stores and the suppliers of stuff that's
sold in them. The Kentucky Blueberry Growers Association is the trade association for blue-
berry growers in Kentucky.
NONPROFITS  211

Professional organizations

A professional organization (or society) is a group of people whose cause is their common
profession. Whereas trade associations tend to focus on companies and industries, profes-
sional organizations focus on individuals. Professional organizations' programming, however,
tends to be similar to that of trade associations, often consisting of certifications or accredita-
tions, continuing education, conferences, publications, and lobbying.

Examples: Each of the professions listed in this book's title has a nonprofit professional
organization associated with it: Society of Professional Journalists, Public Relations Society of
America, American Advertising Federation, and American Marketing Association. Specialized
professionals often have more specific organizations, like the Association of Health Care Jour-
nalists, American Copy Editors Society, National Association of Black Journalists and the Asso-
ciation of LGBTQ Journalists. The two clown associations mentioned earlier -- World Clown
Association and Clowns of America International -- also are professional organizations. Other
professional nonprofit organizations with which you may be familiar: American Bar Associa-
tion, American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, and so on.

Labor unions

A union is a group of people whose causes center on the work conditions, compensation,
and employment benefits of its members. Unions represent and advocate for their members
in negotiations with their employers. Some unions double as professional associations. Most
workers in the United States do not belong to a labor union, according to a 2018 Economic
News Release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Examples: The NewsGuild is the labor union for journalists and other communication profes-
sionals. The National Education Association is the labor union for teachers and other school
employees. United Food and Commercial Workers is the labor union for food and commercial
workers. Actors' Equity Association is the labor union for actors.

Advocacy organizations

An advocacy organization is a group of people whose cause is an issue, broadly defined.
These organizations support the advancement of their issues by means that are as varied as
the issues themselves. Their programs may include education, advocacy for regulatory or leg-
islative change, assistance with legal representation, days of action, volunteering, and promo-
tion of the issue in the media and public discourse.
212  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Examples: Catalyst and American Student Assistance, discussed in the news examples above,
fall into this category. Some of these organizations are massive and known nationally, like the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Others are tiny and local, like Friends of Lawrence Area
Trails (FLATS).

Foundations

A foundation is a group of people whose cause is the financial support of some issue or entity
through fundraising and/or the stewardship of investments. Private foundations, like the Bill
& Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation, or the Ewing Marion Kauffman Founda-
tion are endowed from families or corporations, and use their funds to support causes they
like through grants. Community foundations, like the Lawrence Schools Foundation or the
University of Kansas Endowment, solicit donations from individuals who care about the enti-
ties these foundations support.

In sum, depending on the topic at hand, an organization from one of these categories -- trade
associations, professional societies, labor unions, advocacy organizations, or foundations --
can serve as an insightful source for the article or report on which a journalist or strategic
communications writer is working.

How to Find Nonprofits

In Chapter 3 of this book, we covered the use of operators in Google searching, including the
site: operator that can narrow down search results to specific domains. Because the exten-
sion .org stands for organization, many nonprofits use URLs that end in .org. Therefore, one
way to look for a nonprofit on Google is to type the issue in which we are interested, and fol-
low this with the site: operator and the .org extension. For example, the search

      journalism site:org

results in links to a number of journalism-related nonprofits: the Pew Center's website on
journalism research (journalism.org), American Press Institute (americanpressinstitute.org),
Columbia Journalism Review (cjr.org), the Poynter Institute (poynter.org), and Society for Pro-
fessional Journalists (spj.org).

A problem with this approach is that the nonprofit Wikipedia, one of the most popular web-
sites on the Internet, uses the .org extension. So the site:org search inevitably brings up a
NONPROFITS  213

bunch of Wikipedia entries related to journalism. To clean this up, we can use the - (minus)
operator, and eliminate Wikipedia pages from the search results. The search

      journalism site:org -site:wikipedia.org

returns results that do not include Wikipedia pages.

Another problem with this approach is that some nonprofits' websites do not end in .org. For
years other top level domains have also been used by nonprofits. For example, The World
Clown Association website ends in .com (worldclown.com), the American Home Furnishings
Alliance website ends in .us (ahfa.us), and the website of the Kentucky Association of Colle-
giate Registrar and Admissions Officers ends in .net (kacrao.net).

Also, in 2015, a new top level domain .ngo was introduced for exclusive use by nonprofits.
NGO stand for non-governmental organization. So the site:org search may miss some non-
profits that do not have the .org extension in their URLs.

So in addition to using Google, it is also possible to search specialized databases of nonprof-
its. Several organizations maintain such databases, including GuideStar, ProPublica's Non-
profit Explorer, Charity Navigator, and Charity Watch. The following video walks you through
using GuideStar to find a nonprofit that's related to a specific issue.

How To Evaluate a Nonprofit's Credibility: Bias

Every nonprofit is biased, and this bias should be identified when evaluating a nonprofit's
credibility. A nonprofit's cause for being points to that nonprofit's bias.
What is the bias of the World Clown Association?
This nonprofit's cause is clowns and the need to support the clowning profession. Given this
cause, this organization would never say that clowns are creepy, or that clowning is a waste
of time and a worthless profession, or that it's not a profession at all. In other words, the non-
profit's bias is what it would never say about its cause. Doing so would undermine the orga-
nization's reason for being.
NONPROFITS  215

What is the bias of the Association of Convenience Store Retailers?

This nonprofit cares deeply about the financial wellbeing of convenience stores and its oper-
ators. What would it never say? It probably would never say that convenience store prices
are ridiculously high, that its products are subpar, and that through the processed food and
tobacco they sell, convenience stores contribute to various avoidable health problems. Doing
so would undermine convenience store profits, and the organization's reason for being.

Expect every nonprofit to be biased. Identify this bias as you evaluate the nonprofit's credibil-
ity.

Other Sources of a Nonprofit's Credibility

In addition to bias, we can use other metrics to assess a nonprofit's credibility. There are two
obvious places and one less-obvious place to look for evidence of a nonprofit's credibility.

The organization's website is one obvious place to start. How much the organization says
about itself, its leadership, its members, and its programs, and how current this information
is, can provide clues about the organization's credibility. The news is another obvious place
to search. How an organization has been covered in the news, and what about it has been
newsworthy, can be revealing about how credible an organization is.

Form 990

The less-obvious source about a nonprofit's credibility is the organization's Form 990, a finan-
cial statement that many nonprofits are required to file annually with the IRS to support their
claim for tax-exempt status. One benefit of looking at the Form 990 as a source of credibility
information is that an organization is obligated to report the truth about itself in this form.
Like the individual tax returns that we file, ...

Another benefit of looking at the Form 990 is that it is standardized, that is, from one year
to the next, and from one organization to another, the form and the information it requests
stay the same. This allows us to easily compare organizations historically and between one
another.

The most transparent nonprofits will post their Forms 990 on their websites. Many nonprofits
do not make these forms this easily accessible. Fortunately, GuideStar (and other databases)
216  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

collect and make these forms available to the public. The following video shows how to access
a nonprofit organization's Form 990 on GuideStar.

How to read the Form 990

Like any tax form, Form 990 at first can be daunting to read. The trick is to know the four
or five sections of the form to look for evidence of a nonprofit's credibility. We discuss these
sections below, using the 2015 Forms 990 for the World Clown Association and Catalyst,
the workplace diversity nonprofit discussed in one of the news examples above. We include
screenshots of the specific sections of the forms we discuss. Before you read the following,
you may want to download the entire forms for yourself (they are 25 and 50 pages, respec-
tively), and find each of the sections we discuss in these actual forms.
NONPROFITS  217

Part I

The first page of the form provides summary information about the organization and its
finances. Let's compare the "Activities and Governance" boxes of the World Clown Association
and Catalyst. What is the main difference between these two organizations?

World Clown Association

Catalyst
Other than the different missions of the organizations, the main differences are the numbers
listed in lines 5 and 6, which denote the total number of individuals employed by each orga-
nization. World Clown Association says that it has no employees and no volunteers, whereas
Catalyst employs 107 people, and has 36 volunteers. The other numbers, in lines 3 and 4, are
218                      PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

similar -- both organizations have about 30-35 people on their boards of directors, and most
of these directors are independent, that is, not employed by, the organizations.

The next section provides a financial overview.

World Clown Association
NONPROFITS  219

                                                                  Catalyst

Let's focus on one sub-section (or box) at a time, and examine the Current Year column on
the right.

The Revenue box comes first. Line 12 shows the nonprofit's total revenue for the year. A key
difference between these two groups is their revenues. World Clown Association's total rev-
enue was $308,281. Catalyst's revenue for the same year was $12,432,749. Catalyst brought in
40 times as much money as the World Clown Association. The lines above line 12 also reveal
a key difference. World Clown Association makes most of its money ($204,904, or 66 percent)
from the programs it organizes and runs (line 9). The rest of its money comes from contri-
butions and grants (line 8). Catalyst's revenue sources are the opposite. Most of its money
($9,927,343, or 80 percent) comes from contributions and grants, and the rest comes from its
programs.

Do these differences in total revenue and revenue sources say anything interesting about
the credibility of these nonprofits? Maybe, maybe not. It's hard to make a clear credibility
argument based on the size of revenue by itself. For now, we can conclude that the World
Clown Association is very reliant on its programs to generate its revenue. Catalyst, meanwhile,
relies on outside grants and contributions. This difference likely translates into what these
two organizations say and don't say about themselves and their programs to potential donors
and members.
220  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

The next box presents an organization's expenses. The World Clown Association spent
$330,885, while Catalyst spent $14,004,933 (line 18). This means that both organizations
spent more money than they brought in (line 19), which is called having a deficit. Does this
say anything about either organization's credibility? It suggests that neither organization was
great at managing its finances, although the World Class Association's deficit as a proportion
of its revenue (7 percent) was smaller than Catalyst's (13 percent). This evidence can be used
in either organization's credibility evaluation.

Can a nonprofit make a profit, by the way? Yes, absolutely. Catalyst's financial summary, in
the Prior Year column (line 19), shows that the organization had more revenue than expenses
by $884,967. What happens to this leftover money? If Catalyst was a for-profit company, the
owner or investors would share the profit, but because of this organization's nonprofit sta-
tus, no individual can take home this profit. A nonprofit's profit stays with the organization,
in its savings or investments account. Having some profit is desirable, so that an organization
can add to a financial cushion it may need in a year when its expenses exceed revenues. At
the same time, we would be justified to question the credibility of an organization that has
huge profits but does not direct those to expanding its programs or benefits to its members
or clients.

Before we leave this first page, let's look at the amount of money that each organization spent
on salaries and benefits to employees. Some charities have been accused of not spending
enough of the donations they collect on the programs they say they organize. One way to
gauge this is to consider what percent of an organization's expenses goes to its employees
(line 15), versus what percent goes to grants, programs, and member benefits (lines 13, 14,
17). Catalyst spent $10,217,183, or 73 percent of its expenses on salaries. The World Clown
Association spent nothing on salaries. Could these numbers be used as evidence of either
organization's credibility? It depends on the organization's mission, and the nature of its pro-
grams. But the figure 73 percent going toward salaries should raise a yellow flag, suggesting
that we proceed with caution, and try to understand more clearly how this organization oper-
ates, before using this figure in an evaluation of its credibility.

Part III

On the next page, in Part III of Form 990, the nonprofit describes three of its major programs,
along with how much each program costs and how much revenue it generates.
NONPROFITS  221

World Clown Association

Catalyst
It's worth reading through the descriptions of these programs to get a clearer sense of what
each organization's key programs are, and how much money is tied up in each program.
World Clown Association's convention (line 4a) and liability insurance (line 4b), for example,
222  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

are revenue-generating programs. This means that the organization relies on these programs
to support its other ventures that do not make money. This can influence how much the orga-
nization promotes and spends on these programs. This may be important context for evalu-
ating its statements about these programs.

Part VII

The next important section of the Form 990 is Part VII, which lists the organization's officers
and highest-paid employees. Before reading this section, it's important to understand a typ-
ical nonprofit's governance structure. Most nonprofits are governed by a board of directors
(sometimes called trustees), which is lead by a board chair or president. These directors typi-
cally do not work for the organization and are not paid by it. They have "real" jobs elsewhere,
but meet regularly to make key decisions for the organization.

A main decision for many boards of directors concerns hiring an individual who leads the
nonprofit's day-to-day operations. This person might be called an executive director, a chief
executive officer, or something similar. He or she is a paid employee of the organization, usu-
ally drawing the highest salary. This executive also hires a staff to complete whatever tasks
need to be completed. These staff members (e.g., directors, managers, assistants) also draw
salaries from the organization.

While this structure consisting of a board of directors, executive director, and staff, is typical,
there are many other nonprofit governance variations.

World Clown Association's Part VII is three pages long (below is the first page). It lists 30 indi-
viduals, none of whom work more than 10 hours a week for the organization (column B), with
most working two hours a week. None of these individuals receive compensation from the
organization or related organizations (columns D - F).
NONPROFITS  223

World Clown Association

Catalyst's Section VII is five pages long and lists 50 individuals (see the fourth of five pages,
below). Thirty-nine of these individuals work one hour per week for the organization (column
B), and receive no compensation (columns D - F). The other 11 of these individuals work
35 hours per week, and receive between $130,106 and $259,208 in primary compensation
(column D), and between $24,571 and $109,272 compensation from related organizations
(columns E and F). Note that the title of Part VII says that this chart lists "Key Employees, High-
est Compensated Employees, and Independent Contractors." Recall from Part I that Catalyst
has 107 employees, so most of them are not listed in this table.
224  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Catalyst

It is evident that whereas the World Clown Association is run by an uncompensated board of
directors, Catalyst has both a board of directors and a well-compensated staff.

What can be done with all this information when evaluating a nonprofit's credibility? First,
each of the names listed in this table of board members and employees is searchable. There
probably is a fair bit we can learn about the credibility of an organization by evaluating the
credibility of its board members and key employees. So, Google away.

Second, the people listed in this table often are the sources quoted in news articles and other
reports. The Hollywood Reporter article quotes Pam Moody, president of World Clown Asso-
ciation, who is listed as vice-president in the form (with time, vice-presidents sometimes rise
to become presidents, so this discrepancy in titles is understandable). Like others listed in the
table, she receives no compensation from the World Clown Association. Brandee Stellings, a
Catalyst vice president quoted in the News & Observer article, is a full-time employee who
NONPROFITS  225

earned almost $175,000 in 2015. Does knowing this information affect how we evaluate the
credibility of these individuals and the quotes they gave?

On the one hand, Stellings' salary might suggest that she is not super credible because she
has a lot to lose if the organization doesn't perform well. This could mean that what she says
is always going to "toe the line" for the organization. Alternately, her high salary might suggest
that she is super-knowledgeable and qualified to speak on the issues that are important to
Catalyst. What about Pam Moody's credibility? Is she super-credible because she a passion-
ate, non-paid advocate of the clowning profession, or is she not very credible because she
doesn't make a salary from the organization (like everyone else associated with this group)?
All of these arguments could be appropriate.

Parts VIII and IX

The last two sections of Form 990 that are worth considering are Parts VIII and IX, which are
labeled Statement of Revenue and Statement of Functional Expenses, respectively. These sec-
tions provide more in-depth information about how these organizations generate and spend
money. They provide detailed explanations of the financial summary we read on the first page
of the form.
226  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

World Clown Association

World Clown Association's form shows that about a quarter of its revenue comes from
membership dues (line 1b), that is, from individual clowns paying the organization to be its
members. Insurance premiums from these member clowns bring in nearly half of the orga-
nization's revenue (line 2a). The annual convention brings in almost the last quarter of the
revenue (line 2b). That's a pretty straightforward breakdown of this organization's revenues.
NONPROFITS  227

Catalyst

Catalyst's form shows that unlike the World Clown Association, Catalyst is not a member orga-
nization. We know this because it generates no revenue from membership dues (line 1b).
Instead, it holds fundraising events (line 1c), and more importantly, it receives contributions,
gifts, and non-governmental grants (line 1f). Moreover, a number of its programs generate
revenue, including courses, workshops, and consulting services it offers. It also organizes a
conference (line 2d), and it charges for speaker services (i.e., honoraria, line 2e).
228  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Catalyst

On the expenses side, one thing we wondered about earlier about Catalyst was how it man-
aged to spend 73 percent of its expenses on salaries. The top part of Part IX gives us some
clues. While column A lists the total spent on salaries, pension plan contributions, and other
benefits, columns B, C, and D break down these totals into expenses that support programs,
management, and fundraising. Column B suggests that most of Catalyst's salaries go toward
supporting its programs. If these numbers were more skewed toward management (column
C) or fundraising (column D), we would have some evidence that the organization is spending
money on its key personnel and generating more revenue, rather than supporting the pro-
grams it claims to run.
NONPROFITS  229

Catalyst

The bottom of Part IX lists several other categories of expenses that the organization incurred,
from lobbying (line 11d), to investment management (line 11f), advertising and promotion
(line 12), and repairs and maintenance (line 24, other).

Reading these numbers can give us a good sense of how wisely an organization spends its
funds. If the number in the advertising and promotion line is exorbitant, we could argue that
the organization cares more about its public image than the programs it claims to support.
This could undermine its credibility.

One large number in the Catalyst document is its occupancy figure (line 16), or the rent it
pays for its office space. This figure is $859,594, or $71,633 per month. With 107 employees,
this comes out to about $670 per month per employee. We all know that New York rents are
expensive, and the total rent constitutes only 6 percent of the organization's total expenses.
230  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Still, it's worth considering whether the rent, in addition to the high salaries it pays its key
employees, affects the organization's credibility.

World Clown Association

World Clown Association's expenses include management (line 11a), which comprises about
12 percent of its total expenses. This suggests that the organization pays another company or
organization (or an individual) to run its day-to-day operations. While the member volunteers
listed in Section VII do some of the organization's work, a professional manager or managers
is charged with making the organization function. That's not an exorbitant cost, especially
compared to Catalyst's 73 percent spent on salaries. And unlike Catalyst, World Clown Associ-
ation pays no rent.

Comparing these two organizations' numbers gives us a sense of the diversity of nonprofit
structures, and the various costs that contribute to an organization's overhead, that is, what it
NONPROFITS      231

spends on itself. While some organizations like Charity Navigator provide evaluations of non-
profits' program expenditures, you now know where such evaluations come from, and you
can conduct them on your own using the figures listed in a nonprofit's Form 990.

In sum, an organization's Form 990 provides the journalist or strat comm. professional a
wealth of unvarnished information about a nonprofit organization, that potentially can be
used to evaluate the credibility of the organization, and help determine its appropriateness
as an information source.

A Practitioner's View

                Susan Henderson

                B.S., KU Journalism, 1995
                Director of Marketing & Communications
                Wholesale & Specialty Insurance Association (WSIA)

                As the communications professional for an insurance trade asso-
                ciation, I am frequently called upon as a source of information on
                behalf of our members, who work in a complex niche of the insur-

ance industry.

Reporters often don't fully understand the nuances of that market, but I can provide
them with industry research, trends and demographics, and I can also quickly facilitate
interviews with professionals who are experts on specific topics. Writers are always
working under deadline, so my goal is to help them gather credible information that
puts the association, our members and the media in the best position to tell the story,
and creates a win for all of us.

To ensure that we are credible and have current information, WSIA commissions
research on the industry, gathers information from our members and shares research
with other industry trade associations. That broad source of facts helps me be a trust-
worthy source for media, but it also underscores the importance of working with trade
associations for research; I do it too.

While our members are experts in certain facets of insurance, we regularly collaborate
with related associations whose members' interests intersect with ours. Those partner
associations make my job easier as the experts in their arenas, just like I do for media.
232  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

     As we work on legislative and regulatory issues of interest to our collective members,
     where we essentially become the storytellers with elected officials, those nonprofit
     partners as sources of information are key to our success.

Activity 1: Nonprofit Categories

      Identify an issue to cover in an article or a strategic communications report. Find one
      or more organizations in each of the following categories that may serve as sources
      for this article or report: trade associations, professional societies, advocacy organiza-
      tions, foundations.

Activity 2: Spokesperson Contact Info

      At each of the organizations you identified above, find the name and contact informa-
      tion of an individual you can contact, who might serve as a source for the article or
      report on the issue you identified.

Activity 3: Form 990

      Download the most recent Form 990 for one of the organizations you identified, and
      articulate 2-3 credibility arguments about this organization using evidence gleaned
      from this form.

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Understand the creation process and purpose of research studies.
         Articulate strategies for reading scholarly sources.
         Understand how the creation process and purpose of scholarly sources contribute
            to their credibility.

That Research Study Sure Makes You Look Smart

The jobs of communications professionals often center on consuming complex information,
and translating it into advertising campaigns, press releases, or news articles that busy, aver-
age people can relate to, read quickly, and learn from.
As a communications expert, you will increase your credibility if you consult the work of other
experts. As a college student, you probably have caught on to the fact that you are sur-
rounded by experts, such as your professors, who research and produce scholarly informa-
tion.
Journalists and strategic communicators can benefit from research studies in a couple of
234  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

other ways. First, new research studies often present unique insights or information that isn't
general knowledge yet. Journalists looking for new story ideas sometimes will turn to freshly
published research studies. Strategic communicators can get a leg up on the competition by
reading new research about their clients' fields.

Second, the authors of research studies and those they reference are ready-made interview
subjects. Researchers are experts in their fields, and they usually are well-practiced in dis-
cussing their work, so they often can talk about their research it in a more succinct, friendly
manner than their written work.

In this chapter, we discuss scholarly research studies like the ones that many of your pro-
fessors produce. Research studies are known by many different names: scholarly sources,
peer-reviewed sources, and academic literature, among others. We start by discussing peer-
reviewed sources, and focus on how the creation process and purpose of research can
contribute to their credibility. Then, we share strategies for accessing and reading research
studies.

Scholarly Research Is A Conversation

University faculty, that is, many of the professors who teach your classes, spend their entire
careers learning the everything of a topic, right down to the most boring details, which
they find absolutely fascinating. They then publish journal articles or books based on their
research.

Research studies don't exist just so a bunch of stuffy people can bore the rest of the world.
Many of your professors, librarians, and other members of the faculty are hired to research
and produce scholarly material. Why? Because universities are about the production of new
knowledge. Universities are measured by the research output (articles, books, patents, etc.)
that their faculty members produce, and by the research funding they generate. As a result,
many of the things that make our lives easier and richer today were invented through univer-
sity research, as this article in The Atlantic magazine enumerates.

Academics write for each other and for the rest of us. Over the course of their careers, acade-
mics write and publish their work so that other experts can read and respond to their findings
by publishing their own work. This publishing practice creates a scholarly conversation and a
community.

Most members of the public do not participate in this conversation. As a university student
who produces his or her own research, however, you do participate in this conversation. All
RESEARCH STUDIES  235

members of this scholarly community strive to uncover problems and solutions, which are
seemingly endless, because new problems, evidence, and possible solutions are always pop-
ping up.

One way to plug into this ongoing conversation is to pay attention to the citations that
authors use in their research. These citations indicate to whom an academic piece of writing
is responding. When your English and history professors ask you to cite your sources, they are
really asking you to show the scholarly conversations that your writing is a part of. Citations
allow readers to locate and read the same sources as the authors of academic writing, so that
they, too, can participate in this scholarly chit-chat. Scholarly research articles and their cita-
tions give readers a deeper understanding of a topic.

All research studies share a larger purpose of educating people who are engaged in a schol-
arly conversation. Let's examine the process and purpose of research studies more closely
using the characteristics we introduced earlier, including purpose, research, length, editing,
time, and ease of creation.

How To Recognize Good Research: Format As Creation Process

The world seems full of research, and it's sometimes hard to tell the good stuff from junk sci-
ence. Librarian Kevin Seeber recommends focusing on the creation process of information to
determine its credibility. We also recommend that you use this process to identify and evalu-
ate research studies.

Seeber suggests considering several factors of the research and publication process to deter-
mine information type: the time it took to research and publish the piece, the amount or qual-
ity of research conducted before writing it, the editing process, the length of the piece, and
how easy or difficult it was to create the piece.

You could use a scale that considers all these factors to determine how the different informa-
tion sources you encounter, like tweets, Wikipedia postings, articles of all types, and books,
stack up against each other. Chances are you are doing a version of this already.

The other element that helps us evaluate the creation process of information, and to assess
its credibility, is the information's purpose. In other words, determining why and for whom
the information is published. Thinking through the creation process goes hand-in-hand with
thinking about information's purpose.
236  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

To get a better sense of these concepts, let's use this evaluation process to analyze a tweet,
and then compare this to an evaluation of a scholarly article.

Example 1: A tweet

Let's walk through a tweet together to get a sense for how this whole "format as a creation
process" works. Exhibit A: adorable dogs doing their own research.

      @dog_rates I got my friend your book but I think her pets might appreciate it a little more pic.twit-
      ter.com/BIsCNBljko

      -- Patrick Foley (@Bevolent) June 11, 2018

While we are not certain how long the dogs were reading and researching their books, we can
probably make some accurate judgements about the human purpose and process behind the
tweet. Let's walk through evaluating this tweet using the criteria we introduced above.

Purpose. Why and for whom did the author create this tweet? We could safely assume that
the tweet exists for the enjoyment of people trapped at work or in class, who are in des-
perate need of a dog fix. If we generalize this, people tend to create social media posts to
express what they are doing, often in amusing ways, to followers. The author of this tweet
likely wasn't looking to be seen as an expert in anything dog-related, but as someone with a
sense of humor, and an appreciation for dogs.

Research. We might guess that the human who posted these photos didn't really do too
much research before doing so. How can we tell? Well, the author of the tweet doesn't refer-
ence or cite anything in the other than WeRateDogs, a delightful Twitter account dedicated to
rating dogs on a cuteness scale of 1 to 10. But the purpose of this reference only is to send
the tweet to the dog-loving account, not to document any research the human user did.

Length. It's a tweet. The user didn't come close to his 280 character limit, and it takes us a hot
second to look at those dogs and love them. Short and sweet is this tweet.

Editing. This looks like a point-click-and-post job. The photos appear to be natural shots that
haven't been Photoshopped. Plus, there isn't any standard punctuation used. It may be safe
to assume that the dog-loving user typed and posted the tweet without reading over his state-
ment, or having anyone else edit it.

Time. Looking up the WeRateDogs handle (@dog_rates) may have taken a second, and stag-
RESEARCH STUDIES  237

ing and taking the photo may have taken a minute. All said and tweeted, though, the whole
process probably took no more than five minutes.

Ease of creation. It looks as though this tweet was pretty easy to create and publish. Prop
up a book in front of a dog, don't care if the cat photobombs, snap the pictures, and post
them along with a fragmented sentence. Many folks familiar with Twitter and their phone
camera can complete these tasks pretty quickly. Plus, Twitter allows almost anyone to create
an account, and it doesn't charge users to post content. So we know that the poster probably
didn't have to jump through any difficult hurdles to make this tweet happen.

Summary. We determined that a tweet does not take much time or effort to research, edit,
or create, because it is so short and usually is an act of one person, and not delayed by any
editorial or peer-review process. The quick turnaround time and accessible platform encour-
ages a variety of people to share their thoughts with the general public. For these reasons,
a tweet can be useful if we want to know regular people's perceptions of a trending or cur-
rent topic. For instance, during the 2018 World Cup, many journalists dotted their articles with
social media posts in order to report on the reactions of fans, or on how the media was cov-
ering and tweeting the action.

The research-less and easy process behind social media posts make them suitable for quickly
sharing news with others, and for keeping your finger on the pulse of trending topics. But it
may not be the most credible source if you are wanting a deeper understanding of a topic. To
gain such deeper understanding, you will need to consult sources that have been developed
over time and with more research.

So, next, we use the same evaluation criteria to assess a peer-reviewed article. Consider the
differences between these two sources, and why your professors insist that peer-reviewed
sources are good sources of information.

Example 2: A peer-reviewed article

We illustrate the process of creation and purpose of peer-reviewed research with this article:
"The Impact of a Therapy Dog Program on Children's Reading Skills and Attitudes toward
Reading." The article is written by three researchers from The College of New Jersey, and pub-
lished in the Early Childhood Education Journal, which is owned by Springer Publishing. (We
found this article by searching for the terms "dog reading therapy" in the database Academic
Search Complete.)

Length. Most peer-reviewed articles are pretty lengthy. Peer-reviewed articles may have an
238  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

abstract, introduction, literature review, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, and refer-
ences. Not all of the sections may be present or labeled such in every article, especially if it is
a humanities article. But all of these sections and the works cited or references sections can
add up to 15 or 25 pages.

Our Therapy Dog Program article is no exception to the typical length. It is 16 pages of heavy
text, charts, citations, and more.

Research. The authors of peer-reviewed articles must be transparent about the research
they document. They usually will list the works cited or consulted at the end of their articles,
and fill their pages with footnotes, endnotes, or in-text citations. They do this to properly
credit ideas to their original authors, and to demonstrate their own knowledge of a larger
scholarly conversation.

Other indicators of research in a peer-reviewed article may be a literature review and a dis-
cussion section of the findings. If an experiment or another measurement was conducted,
there will be details of the research methods, and tables and charts illustrating the results.
While all peer-reviewed articles will cite other works to prove that they are engaged with a
scholarly conversation, these other elements may not be present or clearly labeled. What
matters is that there is evidence that the author conducted research.

Let's take a look at our dog article. There is a literature review, in-text citations, and more
than a page of references. The authors also included charts of their research and summaries
of their interviews, alongside a summary of their methods, and a discussion section. By dis-
cussing and citing other authors' works, the authors clearly communicated that they were
informed of the latest research, that they were participating in a greater scholarly conversa-
tion, and that they contributed their own original research to this conversation.

Editing. After researchers write, re-write, self-edit, and ask a buddy to look over their article
or book, they often submit it for publication at a university press or in an academic journal. At
least two other experts in the same field, called referees or reviewers, read the manuscript.
This is where the "peer-reviewed" in peer-reviewed research comes from. In many cases, the
referees do not know who authored the article, chapter, or book, and the authors don't know
who their reviewers are. This is called a double-blind peer review.

Once they have read the manuscript, the referees tell an editor or publisher to reject, revise,
or accept the article or book for publication. Acceptance rates at many peer-reviewed jour-
nals are as low as 5 or 10 percent. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, a copy editor
then edits the article or book for writing mechanics and style. The publishing company that
RESEARCH STUDIES  239

owns the journal or publishing house then prints or disseminates the work. These publishing
companies often are large conglomerates, like Springer and Elsevier (more on them later).

The Dog Therapy Program article is published in a journal as opposed to a magazine, which
usually means that it is probably peer-reviewed, and that it probably followed all of the steps
we just listed. To make darn sure that this is a peer-reviewed source, we can click on the
hyperlinked journal name in the database, or Google the name of the journal (that is, Early
Childhood Education Journal). Then we find a link that says "Instruction for Authors."

The "Instruction for Authors" opens with an explanation of the double-blind peer review
process. After this is a long list of formatting and editorial procedures authors must follow
to be accepted for review. Finally, the "Manuscript Review Guidelines" tell reviewers all the
things they should consider and edit while reading a manuscript. Based on these documents
and the look of the final article, we can safely conclude that the authors and reviewers did a
lot of editing, both before and after the authors submitted the article to the journal, which
was published and disseminated by Springer.

If you don't have time to click around a journal's instructions for authors, a library database
called Ulrichsweb indexes academic and non-academic journals. You can type a journal's title
into the database and see whether or not it tells you that the journal is "refereed," which is its
name for peer-review.

Time. It's okay if you took a nap while reading our long section about the editing of peer-
reviewed sources. You can only imagine how many naps authors have to take when they are
living through the peer review and publication of their research. The publication process of
peer-reviewed research may take years. Why? Because academics want to make certain that
they know what they are talking about before they put it before a scholarly audience, who will
go over the work with the most fine-toothed comb you have ever seen. So after researchers
have spent at least a year developing and writing an article, it will go through the peer-review
process, which can easily add another year. As a rough estimate, it can take at least two years
to create a scholarly article. For a scholarly book, multiply that number a few times.
240  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

How about our dog article? If we look at the clues in this article, we can see that the authors
started conducting experiments in 2010, interviewed their subjects, read a lot of research on
the topic, and, finally, wrote the article. They published it in the online version of the journal
in 2015, and in the print version of the journal in 2016. (It is now common for journals to pub-
lish a digital version online first, and wait some time before printing a hard copy.) It seems
like it took these researchers five or six years, from start to finish, to publish this article. That's
longer than most of you will spend in college!

Ease of creation. Typically, peer-reviewed articles are on the difficult side of ease because of
the research, editing, and time that goes into creating them. In other words, as far as ease of
creation goes, peer-reviewed articles are about the exact opposite of tweets.

Based on our discussion above, the dog therapy article was probably pretty difficult to create.

Purpose. What is the purpose of the dog therapy article? First, it likely was written for other
researchers who study how children can better learn to read and enjoy reading. Second, the
article may be used by future teachers and school reading specialists who come across it
in their undergraduate or graduate research. Third, the reading method this study presents
could be used by teachers or parents to help kids learn to read. Finally, since professors are
evaluated on their research, publishing this study probably helped the authors keep their uni-
versity gigs and advance their careers.

Summary. Our dog article, similar to all peer-reviewed sources, involved a great deal of time,
research, review, and editing. This is what differentiates peer-reviewed sources from other
sources, such as tweets and daily news articles. The authors of the article went through the
grueling peer-review process geared to ensure that their final product would positively con-
tribute to the scholarly conversation and community.

The peer-review process is intended to assure the reader of the author's credibility. You prob-
ably have heard your professors extol the virtues of peer-reviewed sources. Some of them
maybe even made you write papers using nothing but peer-reviewed sources.

The peer review part of the peer review process is one reason why many professors hold
these sources in such high esteem. It's about quality control. Having at least two experts
review a piece of writing and judge whether or not it should be published, ensures, to a cer-
tain degree, the quality of the published research. Note, however, that this process is not fool-
proof. You must rely on your own judgement and subject knowledge to determine if a source
is credible.

cles, watch the following tutorial for more tips and information.

Accessing Research: The Big Business of Scholarly Publishing

Now that we know more about the value of research studies, let's discuss how to access them.
To do this, let's first understand how academic publishing works. Watch the following video
from North Carolina State University Libraries for a brief overview.
242  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

books.pub/becredible/?p=566

While this video discusses journal articles, journals, databases, and libraries, it says very little
about the money that this academic publication process generates. For example, how much
money does a journal's publisher pay a professor to publish her or his article in its journal?
The answer is nothing. Academic researchers get paid zero dollars for their published articles,
and very little for every sold copy of a book they publish. Peer reviewers do it for funsies, too:
they aren't paid for their labor either.

The biggest publishers of scholarly literature are Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, Wiley, and
Springer, including their subsidiaries such as Springer Nature. While these publishers do not
pay authors for their work, they turn around and charge individuals and libraries hefty sums
for access to the journals and books they sell.

These publishers also create their own databases that index their journals and journal arti-
cles. They then charge individuals and libraries for access to these databases. Because they
RESEARCH STUDIES  243

control multiple databases, these publishers also create database bundles, and sell those to
libraries. Think of bundling as a mystery box of databases that you may or may not need, but
definitely will pay for. Such bundles may or may not be cost effective for libraries to buy.

Libraries pay a lot of money to subscribe to databases that contain peer-reviewed scholarly
sources. In the 2017 fiscal year, the University of Kansas Libraries paid more than $1.1 million
for the year's subscription to databases from Elsevier and its subsidiaries, according to Angie
Rathmel, associate librarian and head of acquisitions and resource sharing. Additionally, KU
paid almost half a million dollars for Wiley database subscriptions. Some of KU's bargain data-
bases come from companies that only charge around $200,000 a year.

These access costs are rising, even though library budgets remain stagnant. As a result, many
libraries are canceling their subscriptions. In recent years, KU has hit the decline button for its
Springer bundle of databases. After ditching its $315,000 bundle, KU now only subscribes to
select Springer journals, which saves the libraries more than $100,000 annually.

If you get the sense that there is something odd about the scholarly publishing marketplace,
you aren't alone. Think of how many colleges and universities there are in the country and in
the world. Each is paying more or less than KU, which, as you can imagine, adds up. Elsevier
pulled in just under 2.5 billion British pounds in the 2017 fiscal year, according to its parent
company's annual report. This publisher's profit margin is higher than those of Google, Apple,
or Amazon, according to The Guardian.

Did we mention that none of the creators of the content are paid for their work? "In effect,
universities, and the public that supports them, are charged twice (and more) for research:
once to produce the research and again to access it," wrote KU's Marc Greenberg, professor
of Slavic Language and Literatures, and Ada Emmett, director of the Shulenburger Office of
Scholarly Communication & Copyright, in a scathing indictment of the system. In other words,
publishers like Elsevier aren't exactly known for their generosity of spirit.

Google and the paywall problem

Scholarly publishers' drive to make money is the reason why Googling usually doesn't work
when looking for peer-reviewed research studies. Take a look at the screenshot below. Does
it look familiar?
244  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

It's a paywall. While you may be able to use Google to discover that this article exists, you
won't be able to access the full article because it is hidden behind a wall that will come down
only if you pay for it to do so. Access to this one article costs $35.95.

Fortunately, as a university student, you have the privilege of accessing these materials with-
out having to pay $35.95 out of pocket. The answer to your problems are library databases, a
type of closed source of information.
RESEARCH STUDIES  245

Closed Sources

"Closed" is a term applied to information that is housed behind a commercial publisher's pay-
wall. Many of the sources hidden behind these paywalls are research studies housed in library
databases. Accessing these sources through your libraries' subscriptions is key to getting past
paywalls without coughing up your lunch (and dinner) money. Here we briefly discuss using
library databases and Google Scholar to access closed research studies.

Library databases

As a student, you have access to the databases and scholarly literature to which your uni-
versity's library subscribes. At KU, all databases are available through the libraries' website,
under "Find" and "Articles and Databases." You can then use the subject listing to target data-
bases related to your topic, or access specific databases from the alphabetical list.

Here are some tips for using the databases:

      Refresh your searching skills by reviewing Search More Effectively chapter. You can
         customize your searches by using the operators covered there (e.g., quotation marks,
         AND, OR, etc.).

      KU Libraries has several tutorial videos, that offer useful tips for searching databases.
      To make sure that you are searching scholarly or peer-reviewed publications, you can

         click "scholarly" or "peer-reviewed" on the left-hand side of your results screen. You
         can also look up the "about," "for authors," or "submissions" sections on any journal's
         or publisher's website, for descriptions of the publication process.
      Remember that citations are windows into an ongoing scholarly conversation. So If
         you find one good scholarly source on your topic, you have found found the mother
         load.

            Pay attention to in-text citations and skim the works cited or references pages to
               identify other scholarly sources on your topic.

            Look up citations using the libraries advanced search option under the "Quick
               Search" on the libraries' homepage.

                  Enter at least two search criteria to get your article: ex. "Title" AND "Journal
                     Name" or "Journal Name" AND "Author Name" or "Title" AND "Author Name."
                     Don't forget to put the names of the journal or article in quotes to save time.

      If off campus, remember to log in using your KU ID and password to get around our
246  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         firewall (which we are required to have by good folks, like those at Elsevier, to prevent
         anyone not affiliated with KU from freely accessing the information).

Google Scholar

Google Scholar is a Google search engine that indexes some research and returns in its
results of scholarly articles and books (and, if you want, patents and some legal cases). Many
of the items indexed by Google Scholar are hidden behind paywalls, though, and many more
not indexed by Google Scholar are hidden behind paywalls. This means that you likely will hit
a paywall while using Google Scholar or miss out on an important work not available through
Google Scholar.

If you want to use Google Scholar, that's fine. But be smart about it. Access Google Scholar
through the library's list of databases. Doing so will sync up your Google Scholar search with
materials available through the library. You may still hit a paywall if the library does not have
access to a particular article, but your searching will go a lot more smoothly.

The following video presents tips on effectively using Google Scholar.

Open Sources

Sources that are not hidden behind paywalls are commonly called "open" sources. Many open
sources are available as a result of the open access movement, which works toward making
information freely accessible, outside the scope of the profit-making commercial publishers.

Open access supporters are working to make scholarly information as freely available as this
textbook, so there is hope that one day we will be able to Google peer-reviewed articles and
read them for free. When searching material that is open, you will find a mix of stuff, and the
credibility of this stuff sometimes may be difficult to ascertain. This is why it is important to
use the process of evaluating a study's creation and purpose we introduced in this chapter.

Two open access tools include the Directory of Open Access Journals, which hosts peer-
248  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

reviewed sources, and KU ScholarWorks, a repository for research and other materials pro-
duced at KU.

Directory of Open Access Journals

Some peer-reviewed journals publish materials openly and for free, without the help of the
big, commercial publishers. These journals are of the same quality as those hidden behind
paywalls.

The Directory of Open Access Journals is a good tool for discovering these journals. The direc-
tory indexes the content of nearly 12,000 open access journals that do not put up paywalls.
Despite this large number of indexed journals, this should not be the only place you look
because, unfortunately, not all journals are open. The Directory of Open Access Journals data-
base is like other library databases, so use the same smart search strategies you use else-
where.

KU ScholarWorks

Until all journals are published openly, authors and proponents of the open movement have
developed institutional repositories to access peer-reviewed literature. An institutional repos-
itory is basically a website where scholars upload their stuff so that anyone with internet
access can read it.

KU ScholarWorks is KU's institutional repository. KU was one of the first universities in the
nation to establish a repository for research publications, making the information open and
freely available to anyone with internet access. KU's open access policy asks KU scholars to
deposit copies of their work in the repository, and it asks editors to open their journals. This
means that regardless of whether or not an article was published in a closed (paywalled) jour-
nal, we should be able to access it freely.

KU ScholarWorks contains publications by faculty, staff, and students. There are a number of
peer-reviewed sources, such as articles from open journals published at KU, and pre-prints
of journal articles. Additionally, there are conference presentations, theses, dissertations, and
more.

Searching KU ScholarWorks is pretty simple. Using the search box, just type in your keywords,
or the name of an author, and roll. Keep in mind that other universities have their own repos-
itories, so if you are looking for work by a specific author, look for a research repository at his
or her institution, and search for his or her research there.
RESEARCH STUDIES  249

How To Read Research Studies

Reading scholarly information can be difficult at first, but there are methods to make this task
easier. First, it is often best not to read a research study from beginning to end, like a novel.
Rather, it's easiest to read it out of order, in chunks, and at least twice, in order to fully under-
stand it.

This sounds like it will take forever to read an article, but these methods will actually save you
time. You will need to experiment with your reading preferences to figure out what works
best for you. Below are some reading tips to help you do that.

First, recognize the formula of the article. Many research articles are written in a formulaic
way. Sandwiched between an introduction and a conclusion is the meat or body of the paper,
which lays out the author's argument through a literature review, methods, results, and dis-
cussion.

Think back to a time when you wrote lab reports in a chemistry or a biology class. You
might remember that your reports contained these same sections. These sections usually are
clearly marked in science, medicine, and social science articles. Social science includes sub-
jects like psychology, sociology, political science, and communication. Humanists (i.e., people
who study subjects like literature, history, art, culture, gender), however, may not label the
sections of their works in this manner, and may only use the demarcations of introduction
and conclusion.

Scientific articles

Here's a visual representation of how a typical scientific, medical, or social scientific article is
organized, and the order in which to read such an article. Here's a step-by-step discussion of
this process:

      Start with the abstract. This italicized paragraph is like a miniature version of the arti-
         cle and will give you all the big highlights: the background or larger scholarly conversa-
         tion of which the author is a part, the author's argument, and their findings or
         conclusion.

      Most of these articles report the collection of some new data. From the abstract, try to
         figure out how the data was collected, and who or what were the study subjects.

            The most-used data collection methods are experiments, surveys (or question-
               naires), interviews, focus groups, observations, and content analyses. Your study
250  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

               used one or two of these.

            Most scientific and social scientific studies study people, but study subjects also
               can be inanimate objects, like laser beams or news articles.

            Articles that have the term "meta analysis" in the title or abstract are studies of
               other studies. They aim to establish what the research consensus is on a topic,
               that is, what most experts agree is true about a topic.

      After the abstract, look for hypotheses or research questions in the first couple of sec-
         tions of the article. Hypotheses and research questions summarize the researchers'
         goals in the study. They should give you a clear idea of the researchers' focus. Look for
         "This article argues" or "This study aims to."

      Read the beginning of the discussion section, which usually is the last major section in
         the article. This section again should summarize what the study tried to accomplish,
         what its results were, and what are the implications of these results. You can skip any
         subsections that list limitations or future research suggestions.

      If you want to plug into the larger conversation around the study's topic, look through
         the citations listed in the literature review, or in other sections at the beginning of the
         article. This is where researchers establish what conversations their research fits into.
         Look for these citations at the back of the article in the references or works cited sec-
         tion.

Humanities articles

To read an article or book in the humanities:

      First, read the abstract, if there is one. This italicized paragraph contains the same loot
         as one in a scientific article.

      Read the introduction and conclusion until you understand their main points.

      Pay attention to any sentence that begins with something like "This article argues."
         This is the author's thesis statement or argument. Keep this in mind while dissecting
         the rest of the article and evaluating whether or not the author proved his or her
         argument.

      If you see a portion of the paper where the author is describing previously published
         books or studies, this is the literature review. Skip this part for now.

      Move onto the body of the paper, where the author is actually making his or her argu-
         ment, not just stating it. Once you locate that, read this intensively until you have a
RESEARCH STUDIES  251

         good understanding of what the author is saying. Remember that this may not be
         labeled clearly as the discussion, so you may need to skim the article to figure it out.
      Next, read the literature review to gain an understanding of the larger conversation
         the author is engaged in, and to identify possible sources to use in your own research.
      Finally, you can read the whole thing from beginning to end. Having broken down the
         article beforehand, this should go pretty quickly. Keep an eye out for any parts of the
         argument that you have lingering questions about, and read these parts more closely.

How to Evaluate Research Studies

In conducting a credibility assessment of a research study, draw on the evaluation criteria and
methods we outlined and practiced in previous chapters: Evaluate Information Vigorously, Go
Lateral With Cues and Evidence, and Tap Into a Credibility Network. In addition, here are a
few credibility considerations that are unique to assessing research studies.

Creation process

At the beginning of this chapter, we wrote about evaluating the credibility of research by
thinking about how it's created. We used these considerations: how long it took to conduct
the research and publish it; how much research was conducted, and what was its quality; the
extent of the editing process; the length of the research report; and how easy or difficult it
was to create the piece.

In general, the longer the research takes, the more hoops a researcher has to jump through
to conduct the research, and the higher the barriers that the researcher has to clear to get
the research published, the more credible the research tends to be.

In this chapter, we compared these characteristics in a tweet and in a peer-reviewed pub-
lished study, and decided that the peer-reviewed study was more credible than the tweet. But
the correlation between these characteristics and the credibility of research isn't always as
direct. So it's important to consider other elements of each study.

Verify the author's credentials

Most peer-reviewed studies are written by college professors or graduate students who have
252  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

expertise in the field about which they are writing. You can verify their credentials by Googling
one of these variations:

      Google the author's name;
      Google their name and their place of employment;
      Google their name and use the "site" operator, limiting it to educational institutions

         (i.e., "Jane Doe" site:edu);
      Look up the author's name in his or her university's directory (usually located on a uni-

         versity's homepage).
Consider the author's degree, education focus, and experience. That is, an author with a doc-
toral degree has more education than an author with a bachelor's degree, and the amount of
education can affect credibility.

It also may be worthwhile to compare the field in which an author got his or her education,
and the research topic. The more overlap there is between a researcher's education field and
the topic of the research, the more credible the research may be.

Finally, the longer someone has been a researcher, and the more research he or she has pub-
lished, the more credible they may be.

Once you have found sufficient evidence, you may summarize it along these lines: "Jane Doe
obtained her PhD in public affairs and administration in 2007 from such-and-such university.
Since then, she has taught undergraduate and graduate classes on X. Additionally, she has
published several articles on X in Journal A, Journal B, and Journal C. Such credentials indicate
that she is a credible source of information on X subject."

Read and evaluate citations and works cited

If you notice that authors cite many of the same sources, there is a reason for this. Frequently
and commonly cited sources are called seminal works. Seminal works are ones in which a
major finding is presented or challenged. Authors cite seminal works to demonstrate their
credibility, that is, that they are well informed, and engaged with the major issues in their
research field.

In order to be an informed and credible researcher yourself, you should do the same. Use
Google Scholar or the library's main search function to locate commonly cited sources, and
read and include seminal works in your research.
RESEARCH STUDIES  253

Evaluate the argument and evidence

This is probably the most difficult thing to do when learning about a new topic. Have faith in
your own abilities to judge a source's credibility, though. Here are some tips:

    1. Question an author's evidence. Scholars must back up their opinions with facts. Make
         certain that they are fairly representing their research. For example, if the author is
         studying college students' attitudes about X, make certain that they interview or sur-
         vey college students to directly seek their opinions. If they only talk to parents of col-
         lege students, the author is misrepresenting their work.

    2. Compare arguments. If two of your sources make argument A and one makes argu-
         ment B, consider the evidence they use and decide which one seems most plausible
         to you. Just remember to backup your decision with evidence as well.

    3. Check the representativeness of their research.
    4. Double check their sources. If four of your five sources all cite and rave about a partic-

         ular publication in their literature review, that probably means that is an important
         work. If your fifth source doesn't cite this source, it could be an indication that the
         scholar is not the most knowledgeable authority on the subject.

Conclusion

Research studies are available through library subscription databases and freely on the web.
There are closed and open research studies, which refers to how people access the informa-
tion.

If the information is behind a paywall, it is closed, and best accessed through a library data-
base. If it is open, it is freely accessible through an open access journal site, the Directory of
Open Access Journals, or an institutional repository. Using Google or Google Scholar is pos-
sible, but you may hit a paywall, or not discover all of the information that's available. This is
why it is best to search a mix of multiple resources.

Research studies can be pretty dense, so it is important to take time to read, re-read, and
digest them. Don't read beginning to end, and focus on the key information of each.

Finally, if you have found one good scholarly article, you probably have found 10-20 more.
Scholars explicitly refer to each other's work throughout their publications and include a list
of citations at the end. Track down and use these cited sources in your own work.
254  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Activity 1: Search

Use one of the resources listed in this chapter to research for research on a topic in which
you are interested. Locate and read one scholarly source and write a one-page synopsis of
your findings.

      In the first paragraph, summarize the article, the author's argument, evidence and how
      it is used. In the second paragraph, detail why the information will be useful to your
      project, how it relates to other information you have found, and how it will support
      your argument. If you disagree with the author, explain why, and support your expla-
      nation with evidence.

Activity 2: Open pedagogy

      Create a tutorial for one of the tools for locating research studies listed in this chapter.
      Explore the tool's search functions, information, ease of use, limitations, and other
      positive and negative features.

      Using your findings, create a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the tool. Your audi-
      ence for the tutorial is one of your fellow classmates. You may use whatever technolog-
      ical tool you wish to create your tutorial, which should run approximately 2-3 minutes.

Data

KARNA YOUNGER AND CARMEN ORTH-ALFIE

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Define data, differentiating it from information.
         Identify open, privileged, and closed sources for data.
         Recognize and consider ethical implications of using data, such as privacy and other
            concerns.

Using Data to Tell a Story

Over the last decade, there have been 52,000 unsolved homicides across 50 major U.S. cities.
Even more disturbing, there are distinct patterns to where murders occur and arrests are or
are not made, according to The Washington Post. Surviving family members feel their loved
ones have been forgotten by apathetic police. Police feel disconnected from members of low-
income communities who are too frightened to speak out against violent gang members.
In its feature article on these murders, the Post brought to life multiple tragedies from Boston
to Kansas City to Los Angeles, using the words of law enforcement officials, surviving family
members, and community members. These witnesses attested to the multiple factors that
256  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

prevent community members from speaking out against crime and police from capturing the
culprits. Their tales twist throughout the article and evoke teary eyes in an embedded video.

These heart-wrenching stories, however, do not prove that these unsolved homicide matter.
They do not confirm The Post's credibility.

The numbers do.

The newspaper's transparent use of data was the key to connecting the dots between all of
these deaths, and establishing article's credibility. The Post made its data public and detailed
the methods its data reporters followed to collect, clean and crunch the data into interactive
maps that illustrated the story's argument.

Reporters collected data from police departments and filled in the departments' gaps with
public records, including death certificates, court records and medical examiner reports. As a
result, the Post's homicide report "is more precise than the national homicide data published
annually by the FBI," the newspaper explained. The Post faulted federal data for failing "to
distinguish whether a case was closed due to an arrest or other circumstances, such as the
death of the suspect, and does not have enough detail to allow for the mapping of unsolved
homicides."

What the Post accomplished is impressive and time consuming. Data journalism is a "frustrat-
ing" process, said Sarah Cohen, a New York Times data journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize
for her investigative work with the Post. Transcribing data from paper and digital formats and
making certain that it is "clean," or machine readable for a program such as Excel, takes about
90 percent of a journalist's time on time-consuming projects, Cohen said.

Data are vital to the storytelling of journalists and strategic communicators. As seen in the
Post's article, journalists' use of data allows readers to understand the bigger picture. By
crunching the numbers and creating easy-to-use maps of homicide and arrest rates, the Post
helped its readers see and understand that this is not just a matter of a few unsolved mur-
ders, but more of a national crisis. In other words, data enabled the Post to create convincing
visuals and tell more stories of victims, survivors, and police in a way that would not have
been otherwise possible.

Like journalists, strategic communicators need to use data to convey to key stakeholders
the needs and achievements of their clients. For instance, strategic communications teams
for The New York Times Company and other public businesses detail and synthesize data in
annual reports to sell their companies as successful investment opportunities. Other com-
DATA  257

munications professionals use data to conduct audience analyses, or to develop a company's
digital strategy to better market a product.

Don't worry. By the end of this chapter, you will not be expected to launch a national inves-
tigation about how the FBI tallies homicides, or to decide why Deadpool fans would love to
rock Crocs shoes. Instead, in this chapter, we will define data, identify some places to access
it, and briefly discuss some guidelines for using it in your own work. This will better prepare
you to enter a world that is increasingly producing and consuming data.

Defining Data

Our worlds are saturated in data, and have been for some time, even if we do not even know
it. Anytime you use a computer, buy something at a store or online, listen to music, or just live
your life, you are encountering and creating data. But what exactly is data?

Data are "little points of information that are often not relevant in a single instance, but mas-
sively important when viewed from the right angle," according to journalist Mirko Lorenz in
the Data Journalism Handbook. In other words, data enable communicators to piece together
numbers, pictures, words, and other forms of data into big, meaningful pictures for readers.

More precisely, data are "statistics and facts collected for analysis," according to Rob Stokes,
an e-marketing executive and textbook author. A trick to recognizing data when you see it is
to remember that data do not make any sense when you just look at them. This is because
data lacks context. Data with context are information.

For example, if you saw a list of words on it, including the word "river," you wouldn't really
know what it was about, because you do not have the context, or greater understanding of
what binds all that data together. But if you listened to Leon Bridges's "River," the greater con-
text of hearing Bridges sing that spreadsheet would help you understand the data to be lyrics,
or information.

Even if you don't use it in your own work now, data will be important to your future self. News-
rooms in New York and elsewhere are increasingly data-driven. Data is being implemented in
reporting to make reporting more transparent and credible to readers. In the business of the
news, data can be used to boost revenue by implementing such programs as personalizing
editorial content.

And don't think you will escape data in marketing. Data is part of marketing's future, too. So
258  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

be kind to your future self, and spend some time now learning about how to access and use
data.

Data Access Categories

When you are looking for data, it is helpful to think to yourself, "Who would create or collect
this data? Who is willing to pay for the data to be collected? Why did they do this? How can I
get access? Is the data open or closed?"

To help you answer these questions, we will define and walk you through categories of data,
based on your ability to access and use data: open, privileged, and closed. There are many,
many different types of data, and not everyone will define and categorize data they way we do
here. We will move through and provide examples of these different data access categories,
from those that are easiest to locate, to the ones most difficult to access.

Open data

When data is open, it typically does not cost any money to access it via the Internet. Open
data can also be available in print because they (1) existed before the internet, and (2) to be
available to people who do not have reliable access to the Internet. Below are some, but not
all, sources for open data, grouped by categories of data producers.

Government

All levels of government (federal, state, local) produce troves of data to enlighten government
officials' decisions and policies, to document oversight of entities and individuals, and to
inform the enforcement of regulations. Much open government data is aggregated, macro-
level (not identifying individuals), while other open government data is available at a micro-
level (identifying individuals) as records for public inspection.

The website Data.gov is a portal to hundreds of thousands of datasets created by various
government agencies across the country. Users can enter keywords into a search bar to find
datasets related to their topics, or browse datasets grouped into 14 broad categories. The
portal links users to datasets that reside on the websites of the various government agencies
DATA               259

that create them.

In addition to Data.gov, it can be useful to search the individual websites of these government
agencies. Here's a very select list of government data sources:

      Kansas Department of Revenue
         Check out financial statistics at the state, county, and city levels, place an open records
         request for such things as a driving record, and all things related to taxes (property,
         sales, liquor, life, and death).

      United States Census
260  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         Every ten years the US government surveys the US population to determine how
         many seats a state may have in the US House of Representatives. Census takers tell
         the government about who they are (race, ethnicity, sex, age), where they live and
         with whom, and whether they rent or own their abode. Questions for the census have
         changed over the years, but these are some of the basics that help you understand
         more about the population in a general sense.

      American Community Survey
         Conducted annually, this survey helps determine the distribution of state and federal
         funds. Learn about jobs, educational attainment, veterans, and housing in communi-
         ties.

      United States Economic Census
         Conducted every five years, this Census covers the small to big business in a variety of
         industries across the United States. It is helpful when you want to learn more about
         revenue streams for industries or the gross national product.

      Census of Agriculture
         Data on farms and ranches, farmers, crops, and livestock. The census is conducted
         every five years.

      National Center for Education Statistics
         They got it all from K-12 through college. Turn to this source to analyze college costs,
         school characteristics, drop-out rates, retention, and school and student performance
         by state.

      Bureau of Labor Statistics
         The BLS is known best for the national unemployment rate it releases every month.
         The Bureau's Occupational Outlook Handbook contains in-depth numbers about
         every occupation, including starting and median wages, and employment need projec-
         tions.

      Bureau of Justice Statistics
         Data about law enforcement, the justice system, crime, and criminals.

      U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
         Data on housing and housing costs, including government-supported housing.

Other organizations

Similar to open government data, other organizations collect data and make the data discov-
erable and accessible to the public. These organizations include non-governmental organiza-
DATA  261

tions (NGOs) such as non-profits (foundations, associations, societies, charities, etc.), as well
as for-profit corporations.

      Kansas OpenGov
         Data about government spending in Kansas, including the entire state employee pay-
         roll. Other categories include school district, city, and county data.

      Pew Research Center
         Pew is one of the most respected private research organizations in the United States.
         It is funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which was established initially by a wealthy
         oil family. The Center consists of several distinct units, including ones that research
         Politics & Policy, Journalism & Media, Social Trends, Internet & Technology, and Reli-
         gion & Public Life. Each of these units regularly releases research reports, and the
         datasets on which these reports are based.

      OpenCorporates
         Brought to us by information from the World Bank Institute, OpenCorporates contains
         data about global companies. You can browse and search for specific companies and
         judge how well countries are fairing in requiring companies to share their data.

      globalEDGE: Your source for Global Business Knowledge
         Draws on more than 5,000 open data sources to create a user-friendly tool to discover
         and compare history, demographic, economic and political data by state and by coun-
         try.

      Open Elections
         Aims to turn all US election results into useable data. Their process involves convert-
         ing handwritten county-level poll results into comma-separated value (CSV) files so
         that journalists may download election data to handy spreadsheets and crunch some
         numbers. Check out their GitHub site to see the raw and in-progress data.

      Open Secrets
         Allows you to look up who and which interest groups have made political donations,
         and to whom. Additionally, its staff provides timely and topical research reports on
         recent topics, such as the Women's March on Washington or how much money Face-
         book, Inc. has given to the lawmakers who interrogated Mark Zuckerberg after a data
         breach. Finally, it also contains educational articles so that you can learn the ins and
         outs of political donations.

      Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) Immigration Project
         Syracuse University houses this project that obtains US government information
         regarding immigration through Freedom of Information Act requests, fact checks the
         information, and then makes it available to the public through reports or easy to use
         tools. With their materials, you can drill down to the county level to understand big
262  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

         issues like deportation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and arrests,
         and immigration court activity.
      Google Trends
         Find out what topics and news stories Google users are searching for across many
         countries. Google also provides visualizations for these analytics, which are search-
         able by topic and date.
      Twitter Trends
         Many journalists and marketing professionals follow what's trending on Twitter to
         develop relevant stories and campaigns.
      YouTube Data Viewer
         Amnesty International created this tool to check who and when someone uploaded a
         video to YouTube. Such data can help you determine the credibility of a YouTube
         video.

Privileged Data

We use the term privileged data to describe data that is not freely accessible. This data are
available to you because you are in a privileged position. This privileged access might come
from being a student at the university, an employee of a corporation, or from another means
of privilege.

Let's consider your privilege as a student. The University of Kansas Libraries pays companies
for access to their resources. These resources may contain data that is privately owned by
marketing companies or other businesses. These resources also may present publicly avail-
able data in a new way, such as mapping U.S. Census data to provide data visualizations.

As a student, you have free access to all of these resources. That's your privilege. Once you
separate from the university, you will no longer have access to this information unless you
physically come to the library and use one of the public computers. Your future employer may
subscribe to some of these databases, but you should enjoy them while you have access to
them at the university.

The following databases are examples of what's available through the KU Libraries website.
Click "Articles and Databases" in the Find box, which is in the middle left side of your screen.

      Mintel
         Mintel is a company that compiles and analyzes data on consumer and industrial mar-
DATA  263

         kets. These reports are short, simple, visually appealing, and easy to digest. When
         using Mintel, make certain you pay close attention to the fine print on a piece of infor-
         mation. This is where Mintel will tell you where the company got the information. If
         possible, it is always good to track it down to the original source, such as the US Cen-
         sus or Pew Research Center. (This textbook includes a video on how to use Mintel.)
      eMarketer
         Research consumer trends and behaviors here. You can focus your search on a spe-
         cific topic, industry, audience, or country. Like Mintel, eMarketer produces short and
         digestible reports. Also, you can export their data to an Excel spreadsheet and down-
         load chart images.
      Social Explorer
         Social Explorer maps demographic data to give you and your audience a visual under-
         standing of your argument. You can easily download data and visuals from Social
         Explorer, which is why news giants like The New York Times uses it. Bonus: you can
         also annotate your maps with your scribbles, photos, and more.

Closed Data

Closed data is not open or easily accessible. Instead, it is privately held by companies, the
government, and individuals. While it can be frustrating as a researcher not to have access to
such data, it is important to consider the reasons why such data is not freely available.

Why some data is off limits

Money, money, money

According to OpenCorporates, the United States scores 31 out of 100 for open company data.
This is because people typically can only find basic information about private U.S. compa-
nies. Moreover, this information usually isn't downloadable, and it doesn't include some basic
information like shareholder names.

Searchable data is available only from publicly traded companies. If a company is publicly
traded, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires the company to make some
information available, such as its annual reports (also called 10-Ks). Privately held companies
are not required to participate in such show-and-tells, so they usually don't, and there virtually
is no private company data available for public use.
264  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Just because you cannot access a company's private data doesn't mean nobody can. Many
companies are willing to sell their data and their consumers' data for a price. Companies may
sell consumer data to some of the privileged sources we discussed above, or to other compa-
nies, such as those discussed in the chapter on Google.

The business of consumer data is very lucrative, and the average consumer often does not
realize that "when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product,"
according to Tim Cook, Apple CEO and vocal critic of Google and Facebook. Cook again criti-
cized these companies in 2018, during the unfolding of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scan-
dal, which revealed that Facebook users' data were appropriated to aid the Trump campaign.
This time, Cook promised that Apple could make a "ton of money" if it trafficked in its users'
data, but said that it refused to do so because he believes data privacy is a human right.

Privacy

When companies release their customers' data intentionally to researchers or other com-
panies, chaos and a whole lot of bad publicity can follow. For instance, back in 2006, AOL
released the search data of anonymized users as part of a new initiative to aid academic
research. Information scientists specializing in information retrieval downloaded the data in
hopes of improving information retrieval systems, or designing more effective and efficient
search engines.

Here comes the bad news. The data revealed people's habits, hobbies, interests, and other
seriously embarrassing stuff that marketing companies were dying to find out. And even
though the data was anonymized, it took The New York Times little time to identify a user and
run a big story about how easy it was. This was so not good, considering the data revealed
people and their searches for private issues that they were too embarrassed to ask another
human being. AOL pulled the data and apologized, before being sued for breach of pri-
vacy. The bad thing is, once such data is released, there is no stopping who has access to it.
Even though AOL took down the data, more than ten years later, some researchers who had
already downloaded it continue to hang on to it.

Using Data Responsibly

Through your work you may encounter a variety of the data listed above. You may also
encounter data when a source or your boss provides you with basic figures, such as the cost
of a new city initiative, or how much money your organization has fundraised. Whether you
are dealing with small or big data, you should use it responsibly.
DATA  265

Be data literate

The first step to using data responsibly is to become data literate. Data-literacy "is the ability
to consume for knowledge, produce coherently and think critically about data," wrote data
journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril in the Data Journalism Handbook. Becoming data literate isn't as
daunting as it may sound, though. To be a data expert, Kayser-Bril recommends asking three
questions.

    1. How was the data collected?
         Kayser-Bril cautions to always check the source of your data to make certain that it is
         credible. Additionally, if you come across numbers that sound too good to be true or
         just seem off, then they probably are. It's always good to verify numbers against other
         sources. In Washington Post's story about homicide rates we discussed earlier, for
         instance, reporters didn't just rely on the numbers. They contacted family and friends
         of victims, residents, and local police to verify that homicides were unsolved. In other
         words, it is important to think critically about the information, and question its accu-
         racy.

    2. What's in there to learn?
         Don't take everything at face value. Check the mean, median, and mode of a study's
         results to make certain you are not misleading people. For instance, 1 in 15 million
         Europeans may be illiterate, Kayser-Bril cautioned, but the same number of Euro-
         peans also are under the age of seven. Likewise, report data in terms of magnitude
         and not percentage, to convey how representative a study is. Write 1 in 100 instead of
         1 percent, the data journalist advised.

    3. How reliable is the information?
         First, Kayser-Bril believes the reliability of data can often depend upon the research
         study's sampling size, or the size and number of the subjects under study. For exam-
         ple, a survey may have a sample size of 1,000 people. When evaluating a study, keep
         an eye out for the margin of error, which ideally should be three percent or below. "It
         means that if you were to retake the survey with a totally different sample, 9 times out
         of 10, the answers you'll get will be within a 3% interval of the results you had the first
         time around," Kayser-Bril explained. Second, even if the sampling size and margin of
         error is reliable, you can always question if the researchers have successfully pin-
         pointed the true cause of their results. We'll discuss cause and causality more below.

Generally speaking, if you can't quite remember the difference between the median and the
mean, Kayser-Bril recommends that you complete the Poynter Institute's Math for Journalists
online course. It takes three hours max, and is free.
266  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Bias

It seems as though we just cannot get away from bias. If you use information from any gov-
ernment, it can carry a nationalistic bias. A for-profit company can produce data that makes
the company look good (corporate bias). A not-for-profit organization may have some bene-
factor it may want to make happy with its numbers.

Some data sources may oversimplify information so that it is easily digestable for their read-
ers, or only produce data that people will want to buy. In other words, all those privileged
data sources we mentioned above, like Mintel and eMarketer? Those companies' agendas are
to make money from the data they sell, and those agendas can influence the way these com-
panies produce and present these data.

We realize that we may make it sound like you just can't trust anyone or anything, right? Well,
the point is that you should be skeptical about what you read, but not to get so jaded that you
become a cynic, as veteran journalist Roy Peter Clark recommended. Being skeptical allows
you to recognize some biases or shortcomings of the data you are using, and to find alterna-
tive information to balance it out.

For instance, if you are reporting on high school dropout rates by race, you would want to
use numbers from the National Center for Education Statistics. But you would realize that this
source can only give you the number of people who did not return to school, but not the rea-
son why students left. This is because this source is limited by national reporting standards in
education. That is, schools and school districts are required to report numbers to the states,
and then to the NCES, but they are not required to report qualitative data that provide con-
text for these numbers. As a result, you would want to interview students, teachers, or prin-
cipals to get better insights into the causes for individual student dropouts. Drilling down to
the individual level would balance the national perspective.

To help you avoid the pitfalls of bias, you should always chase down the original source of
information, and research that source. The original source may be written as footnotes and
endnotes in teeny, tiny print on a Mintel infographic, for instance. Also, remain aware of your
own implicit and explicit biases, and try to keep those in check. Include and discuss material
that runs contrary to your thinking to reassure your reader that you are considering all possi-
ble angles. Finally, revisit our bias chapter for a quick refresher.

Correlation versus causation

Often when we are searching for an answer, we are not as skeptical as we should be because
DATA  267

we have a deadline and we're busy. If we are researching how to boost revenue generated by
arcades for a client, for instance, we may stumble upon the following graph:

This graph is one of hundreds of spurious correlation graphs presented on the website
TylerVigen.com. This graph shows that increases and decreases in arcade revenue closely
match the increases and decreases in the rates at which people get doctorate degrees in com-
puter science. The numbers don't lie, right?

Well, if we think about it, there really isn't a way we can prove that the graduation rates of
computer science Ph.D.s causes a rise in arcade revenues. While the two rates are correlated,
or rise and fall at similar rates and similar times, we do not know for certain that one is caus-
ing the other to happen.

Most correlations we deal with in real life aren't as ridiculous as this one. But too often, our
confirmation bias kicks in anyway, and we accept an interpretation of data because it seems
to make sense and agrees with our thinking.

If you aren't an expert in statistics, you are not alone. Don't be afraid to ask someone to fact-
check your findings. You may also watch this Khan Academy tutorial to learn more, or read
the Data Journalism Handbook.

Conclusion

What we have covered is only a tiny sampling of the world of data. Becoming data literate is
an ongoing process, and we encourage you to continue to explore different data resources
and tools through in-real-life situations and online communities, such as The Data Journalism
Den, or the data journalism Slack team, and the Data Journalism Handbook or Stokes's eMar-
keting textbook.

CHAPTER 18

Market Research

PETER BOBKOWSKI

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Understand what market research is
         View market research as a useful information source
         Know how to access and read market research reports
         Evaluate the credibility of market research

New Pet Store's News Release

Let's say that there is a new specialty pet store in town. The store bakes its own pet treats,
and sells other locally produced pet food and accessories. The owner asks you to write a news
release about the store. The news release will inform local news websites and TV stations
about the store and, hopefully, generate some news coverage about the store's opening and
unique merchandise.
Getting the basic facts for the news release is a piece of cake for you. Who is the owner of
the store? What is this business about? Where is it located? When is the grand opening? How
does this business distinguish itself from other pet stores in town? Why is this a good time to
MARKET RESEARCH  271

open a store like this? Your interviews with the store owner and her pet-parent friends con-
tain good background information and quotable soundbites. In no time, you have a solid draft
of a straightforward news release.

But you are not fully satisfied. You wonder if there is a larger context for the opening of this
business that you can mention in your release. Is this store part of a larger trend? Are there
other stores like it opening elsewhere? How are pet stores doing, in general? You wonder if
you can find a more authoritative source than the business owner about why a new specialty
pet store is opening in your town.

You could go down the nonprofit route. Are there nonprofits that represent pet store owners,
or the pet supplies industry? You search Google and Guidestar. All that come up are links to
humane societies and pet rescues. You wish there was some source that provided informa-
tion about the pet store industry, and about what pet owners are buying.

You're in luck! There are sources like this available to you, in the form of market research
companies. These companies generate reports about industry and consumer trends, and sell
these reports to other companies that use this information to plan and enact their business
strategies. These reports can be bought individually or by subscription. Large marketing and
advertising agencies, for example, tend to subscribe to these services for the benefit of the
diverse clients they serve. A prospective pet store owner might buy only the pet store indus-
try report to learn what her store should carry, and how she should market it.

As a student at the University of Kansas, you have access to market research sources licensed
by the KU Libraries. These include: IBISWorld, Mintel, Plunkett Research and Euromonitor's
Passport. Two of these, IBISWorld and Mintel, will be described as we continue the discuss
the pet food market.

IBISWorld's reports focus on individual industries, so you find "Pet Stores in the US" in its
directory, and immerse yourself in the 33-page report on this industry. You learn that this is a
growing industry, with revenues expected to increase steadily over the next five years. Rising
pet ownership, particularly among Millennials, and higher demand for premium and organic
pet food, and specialized pet services, have driven this growth. However, there is strong com-
petition in this space, with mass merchandisers (e.g., Walmart, Costco), grocery stores, and
the two largest pet store chains -- PetSmart and PETCO -- exerting considerable pressure on
smaller stores and the prices they are able to charge. You also learn from this report about
the nonprofit for this industry, American Pet Products Association, which could serve as a
source for your release, especially since it conducts an annual survey about pet supply trends.

The Mintel report titled "Pet Store Retailing - US" echoes IBISWorld's forecast for growing
272  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

sales, but also identifies further challenges for pet supply retailers. Pet owners tend not to
be loyal to specific pet stores, but to make purchases based on convenience and price. The
report suggests that specialty pet stores need to distinguish themselves by the exclusive
brands they carry and by the unique experiences they offer, to compete with pet store chains,
mass merchandise stores, and online shopping options.

Some of this information definitely can strengthen your news release. Using IBISWorld and
Mintel as your sources, you can frame the opening of the new store as a response to the fore-
cast for steady growth in the pet retail industry. The store's focus on home-baked treats and
other local products reflects the need articulated in the Mintel report, for independent pet
stores to distinguish their offerings from those of their large competitors.

Why Use Market Research

A wide range of communications professionals use market research reports every day to gain
insights on their clients and on their clients' competitors, and to contextualize news about
individual companies.

Let's say that a strategic communication professional is asked to devise a marketing strategy
for a soap company. The resulting document that contains this marketing plan likely will
include a section on the soap industry as a whole, and on the main companies that operate in
this industry. Before starting her planning, the strategic communication professional would
read market research on the overall trends in the soap industry, and learn which segments
of the industry are doing well and which ones are lagging. All this information would inform
her understanding of how her client needs to position itself to remain competitive, and what
marketing steps it needs to take to do so.

News journalists also regularly use market research reports as sources. Business journalists
draw information from these reports to include in news reports about companies, industries,
and consumers' shifting preferences. The reports help fill in the gaps when reporters cannot
access information such as a private company's revenue, or to better contextualize a com-
pany's happenings. Market reports aren't limited to manufacturing and retail businesses.
Trends in sports, education, and entertainment, for example, also are covered in market
research reports.

How To Access Market Research

Nielsen, IQVIA, and Westat are some of the largest American market research companies.

Each one provides specific research products by contract, subscription, or through individual
purchase. Access to the reports of two other market research companies, IBISWorld and
Mintel, is available through the University of Kansas Libraries.

How To Evaluate the Credibility of Market Research

Consider our standard credibility cues when evaluating the credibility of market research.
The publisher is an important credibility cue. In this case, the publisher is the market research
company that produced the research. If we are considering the credibility of an IBISWorld
report, we want to evaluate IBISWorld. If we are looking at Mintel, we want to evaluate Mintel.
Where can we find evidence about the credibility of a market research company? The com-
pany's (often) glitzy website may be one source of information, although we need to keep in
mind its self-serving bias.
Another way to gauge a market research firm's credibility may be to look at its reputation
MARKET RESEARCH  275

among organizations and businesses that use market research. For example, the American
Marketing Association publishes an annual ranking of the top U.S. market research firms.
Greenbook, itself a market research company, ranked the largest market research firms in
the world.

Searching for how often a company's market research is quoted in the news may be another
way to gauge its credibility. This can be accomplished by opening a news database (i.e., Access
World News, Google News, etc.), and searching for the name of the research firm. If the com-
pany's research has been quoted both recently and frequently, that may be an indication of
the trust that journalists put in the company's work. Few hits mentioning the company's work
could indicate that it's not a trusted source, or that its work is not accessible to journalists.

A credible research source will present its research methods, that is, it will explain how it con-
ducts its research. We can then evaluate the credibility of the research based on this infor-
mation. For instance, Mintel provides a general research methods report for its U.S. research,
and separate reports for the research it conducts in other regions.

The author may be another credibility cue to evaluate. Whether or not a single author or a
team of authors is identified, will depend on each research company's conventions. Some
companies do not identify by name the individuals who write or contribute to their research
reports. In cases like these, an entire company serves as the research report author.

Can market research be biased? Unlike nonprofit trade associations, market research firms
should not have built-in biases in favor of their clients. Market research firms aim to provide
their clients with accurate research, that is, research that business leaders can trust to make
profitable decisions for the companies they run. It usually is not in a market research com-
pany's interest to sugarcoat a negative business forecast or an unfavorable industry trend.
Market research companies generate repeat customers for their research reports by being
accurate and credible.

Still, market research companies can be biased in the way they conduct their research. To
assess this, examine a company's research methods, and identify sources of information that
may have been underrepresented in how the research was conducted. For example, if part
of a company's research comes from online surveys, it is possible that consumers without
reliable internet access are under-represented in this research. Such a company's research
results may be biased toward populations with reliable internet access.

In sum, when evaluating the credibility of market research, consider all of the regular credi-
bility cues. The report's publisher, author, and bias, may be especially important to assess.

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Define and identify public companies.
         Explain why public company filings are worth locating and reading.
         Evaluate the credibility of public company filings.

Toys Are No Longer Us

Businesses can be important sources of information about themselves, and about the indus-
tries and markets in which they operate. What a business does and says about itself affects
many people, from consumers and employees, to shareholders, and those who work for com-
panies that support it. Business news can be big news.
The March 2018 announcement that Toys "R" Us would close all of its U.S. stores is a good
example of this. The news generated journalistic writing focused on Toys "R" Us employ-
ees, empty big box store spaces, toy manufacturers, competition among toy retailers, and
independent toy stores. Behind the scenes, strategic communications practitioners probably
278  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

researched the toy chain's bankruptcy for lessons that would benefit their clients in the toy
and large retail sectors, or in customer and shareholder relations.

In doing their research, both journalists and strategic communicators had a lot of information
to work with. What led up to the Toys "R" Us demise was documented in many public docu-
ments that the company is legally required to publish about itself.

In the public records chapter, we discussed how to access public records about companies
that do business in a specific state. Every company, from a mom-and-pop shop to a conglom-
erate, must register with the state in which it's located. State filings are a good place to start
when establishing the ownership of a business. But these state records are limited, usually
containing little more than the owners' names and their addresses.

In this chapter we focus on the information disclosed by large, publicly traded companies in
their filings to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Throughout this chap-
ter, we refer to these documents as public company filings. We start our discussion with the
crucial distinction between public and private companies.

Public and Private Companies

A public company is one whose stock is traded on the stock exchange. This means, theoreti-
cally, that anyone can buy a piece of the company in the form of stock. A public company is
public because members of the public (like you and me) can invest in the company.

But investment is risky. Public companies, meanwhile, have an interest in motivating potential
investors to buy their stock. To protect the public (that is, us) from making misguided invest-
ment decisions, the federal government, through the SEC, requires public companies to dis-
close a considerable amount of information about themselves. This lessens public companies'
ability to misinform potential investors about the risks involved in buying their stock.

From our perspective as researchers, public companies are really great because there is a lot
of freely available information about them.

Private companies, on the other hand, are not very transparent because, unlike public com-
panies, they are not required to disclose much information about themselves. Private com-
panies are owned by private individuals, and shares in these companies are not available for
purchase by the public. These companies may have investors, but their stock is not traded
publicly on the stock exchange. For this reason, the public does not need to know as much
about private companies as we do about public companies.
PUBLIC COMPANIES  279

Many of the businesses we deal with on a day-to-day basis are private companies. Our
favorite local coffee shop, like La Prima Tazza? Private. Grocery store, like Checkers or HyVee?
Private. Favorite local restaurant, like The Burger Stand? Private. Corner gas station and con-
venience store, like Kwik Shop? Private. But this doesn't mean that all private companies are
small or local. Some of the largest companies around are private. For example, the largest
employer in Kansas, Koch Industries, is a private company.

On the other hand, we also frequently do business with public companies. Starbucks, Dillon's
(or Kroger), McDonald's, and Phillips 66 are all public companies.

So how do you tell the difference between a private company and a public company? Recall
that a public company's stock is traded on the stock exchange, whereas a private company
does not offer its stock for purchase. While most of us might not know much about invest-
ments, one visual cue we may associate with investments is the ticker symbol. Ticker symbols
are abbreviations of public company names that represent the companies' stock on the stock
exchange. Starbucks is SBUX, Kroger is KR, McDonald's is MCD, and ConocoPhillips is COP.
Ticker symbols and stock prices scroll at the bottom of cable business channels like CNBC and
Fox Business. Private companies do not have ticker symbols.

One way to figure out if a company is public or private, therefore, is to Google the company's
name and look for that company's ticker symbol. Google provides company summaries to the
right of its search results. Summaries of public companies include ticker symbols and their
stock prices.

In the screenshot below, the circled text in the sidebar of Google results for Starbucks is the
company's ticker symbol and stock price. A private company search results would not include
280                PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

this information.

Once we know that a company we are interested in is a public company, we can forge ahead
to unearth troves of public information about it.

Why Look for Public Company Filings

First, public company filings are relatively easy to research. The SEC is very specific about the
information that it requires public companies to disclose, in what order and format this infor-
mation needs to be presented, and how frequently it needs to be disclosed. This means that
researching this information can be fairly straightforward: we know what information to look
for, where to look for it, and when it will be updated next. This makes specific details about
public companies relatively easy to pinpoint.

Second, public company documents are primary sources of information about individual
companies. There is an industry of secondary sources, such as investment advisors and busi-
ness information aggregator websites, which make a profit from this freely available infor-
mation by repackaging it and presenting it in digestible chunks. Websites like Bloomberg,
Yahoo Finance, and D&B Hoovers, for instance, offer reports about individual public compa-
nies using information they cull from these companies' public disclosures. While these can
be good sources of background information, as information experts, we need to know where
PUBLIC COMPANIES  281

this information comes from and how to access it, so that we can verify this information for
ourselves and, maybe also, make a profit from it.

Third, smart, real people read these documents. For example, Steve Ballmer, former chief
executive of Microsoft and owner of the LA Clippers, said this in a New York Times article
about how he learns what companies are up to:

      "You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing,
      Amazon or Apple, I'd get their 10-K and read it. ... It's wonky, it's this, it's that, but it's
      the greatest depth you're going to get, and it's accurate."

A 10-K, as we will soon learn, is a public company's annual report.

In sum, public company disclosures are relatively easy to access and read, they constitute pri-
mary source information, and successful people read them all the time.

How Credible Are Public Company Filings

When assessing the credibility of public company filings, at least two elements contribute to
these documents' credibility: their regulated nature and their position as primary sources.
What can detract from the credibility of these documents is the self-enhancing and
euphemistic language that companies can use to avoid being brutally honest in describing
themselves.

Companies have strong incentives to provide accurate information in their disclosures. The
SEC requires that public company filings include specific sections, that each section discusses
particular business details, and that financial information follow precise accounting stan-
dards. The 10-K Annual Report, for example, is a document that every public company has to
file once a year. This list discusses the sections that every 10-K needs to contain, the order in
which these sections are to be presented, and what each section is supposed to cover.

The SEC oversees public company disclosures, and periodically evaluates and audits whether
or not companies are complying with their disclosure requirements. Failure to disclose can
result in various levels of reprimand, from a discussion with the auditors, to a formal investi-
gation, to litigation, and to the suspension of trading. A public company does not want to be
investigated, reprimanded, or suspended by the SEC because this generates negative news
and can result in investors selling the company's stock, thus devaluing the company.
282  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

For these reasons, there is a high likelihood that the information presented in public company
filings is accurate.

The other element that contributes to the credibility of public company filings is the primary
source nature of these filings. It's worth to reiterate a point we made earlier. There are many
secondary business news sources that rely on, in large part, public company filings to gener-
ate narratives about the financial wellbeing of these companies, and to articulate projections
for how these companies will be doing in the future. A quote from a primary document is
more credible than a quote from a secondary document that quotes the primary document.
The lessons we learned from playing telephone should help us appreciate the credibility of
public company filings over the credibility of reports about public company filings.

Can anything detract from the credibility of public company filings? Sometimes the text of the
filings, written by strategic communication practitioners who work in a company's investor
relations division, can lower the credibility of these filings. As much as the 10-K or another
document is regulated by the SEC, there is considerable room for this document to present a
somewhat biased version of reality. When reading a public company filing, it is useful to con-
sider how the information presented in the document matches other reporting on the issues
being discussed.

To illustrate how the language of a public company filing might undermine its own credibility,
let's consider how Chipotle's 2017 10-K Annual Report discussed the food safety issues with
which the company had been dealing. Here's what the company said about its recent food
safety incidents:

      During late October and early November 2015, illnesses caused by E. coli bacteria
      were connected to a number of our restaurants, initially in Washington and Oregon,
      and subsequently to small numbers of our restaurants in as many as 12 other states.
      During the week of December 7, 2015, an unrelated incident involving norovirus was
      reported at a Chipotle restaurant in Brighton, Massachusetts, which worsened the
      adverse financial and operating impacts we experienced from the E. coli incident. As a
      result of these incidents and related publicity, our sales and profitability were severely
      impacted throughout 2016. In July 2017, cases of norovirus associated with a Chipotle
      restaurant in Sterling, Virginia had a further adverse impact on our sales, particularly
      throughout the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. The significant amount of media
      coverage regarding these incidents, as well as the impact of social media (which was
      not in existence during many past food safety incidents involving other restaurant
      chains) in increasing the awareness of these incidents, may continue to negatively
      impact customer perceptions of our restaurants and brand, notwithstanding the high
PUBLIC COMPANIES  283

      volume of food-borne illness cases from other sources across the country every day.
      As a result our sales may not return to levels we were achieving prior to late 2015.

How many people got sick after eating Chipotle in 2015? Well, the annual report doesn't tell
us this. Was this a conscious omission by the annual report's writers? That's not clear. What
does seem clear in this report is that Chipotle is most concerned about its customers' percep-
tions of their food safety, and that it largely attributes these perceptions to negative media
and social media coverage. There is a subtle subtext in this narrative suggesting that the food-
borne illnesses attributed to Chipotle were not as big a deal as they were made out to be in
the media.

So, how many people got sick? Ten? Twenty? Fewer than 50?

According to the website Food Safety News, which compiled information from county and
state health departments, the two food safety outbreaks mentioned in Chipotle's annual
report accounted for nearly 200 people getting sick. But there also were three additional food
safety outbreaks in 2015 that health officials linked to Chipotle. These three outbreaks did not
receive wide media coverage and Chipotle did not even bother mentioning them in its annual
report. How many people got sick in these under-reported outbreaks? More than 300. That's
a total of about 500 people getting sick after eating Chipotle in the second half of 2015.

Does 500 people over six months getting sick after eating at one restaurant chain seem like
a large number? To me, it does, and if I was a potential investor and saw that number in the
company's annual report, it would give me pause. By avoiding specifics about the number and
scale of these outbreaks, the annual report writers do appear to minimize the perception of
the problem. While this narrative is not misleading, it does not present fully the scope of the
problem. What does this do to the overall credibility of the report?

One more quick, related example. In the paragraph that immediately follows the one cited
above, the writers continue the theme of identifying factors that can contribute to Chipotle
losing revenue from lapses in food safety. In the previous paragraph these factors included
consumer perceptions and social media. In the following paragraph, notice the clever way in
which the company's food safety problems are equated with its greatest selling point, that
is, its fresh ingredients and conventional cooking methods. (Also notice that this whole para-
graph is one long sentence, and never aspire to write like this.)

      Although we have followed industry standard food safety protocols in the past, and
      over the past two years have enhanced our food safety procedures to ensure that
      our food is as safe as it can possibly be, we may still be at a higher risk for food-
284  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

      borne illness occurrences than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh,
      unprocessed produce and meats, our reliance on employees cooking with traditional
      methods rather than automation, and our avoiding frozen ingredients.

The implication of this paragraph seems to be that the risk of contracting a food-borne illness
is higher when eating food prepared with fresh, unprocessed, unfrozen ingredients and with
conventional cooking methods, than when eating food from unfresh, processed, and frozen
ingredients, and automated cooking. Whether that's true or not can be debated. Framing a
liability in terms of the company's greatest asset is a masterful slight-of-hand. The message
seems to be, "Hey, the deck is stacked against Chipotle. That's what we get for trying to be
super-wholesome." How does such defensiveness relate to the report's credibility?

In sum, are public company filings credible? For the most part, probably. The information con-
tained in these filings tends to be accurate because companies do not want the SEC to come
after them and hurt their stock prices. Plus, it's primary source information, which is more
credible than secondary source information. But companies also can engage in self-enhance-
ment in these filings, which can detract from their overall credibility. Companies in these doc-
uments want to present themselves in the most positive light within the limits of what the SEC
requires them to disclose.

How To Find Public Company Filings

There are two places online where we can find public company filings. The first is a company's
website. Public companies designate sections of their websites to investor relations. Often-
times, these sections feel very different from these companies' main, public-facing web pages
or apps. This is because the goal in these sections is to come across as serious, transparent,
financially responsible companies worthy of investment.

To access this section on a public company's website, look for a link at the top or bottom of
the company's main page that says "Investor Relations." Alternately, you might need to look
for an "About Us" or "Company" link, and then look for an "Investor Relations" link on that
page. Once there, look for a link that says "Financial Information" or "SEC Filings."

The screenshot below shows the footer of the Starbucks website, with the Investor Relations
PUBLIC COMPANIES                         285

link circled, in the "About Us" column.

Most public companies will post on their websites the main documents they file with the SEC.
Company websites also might include other financial information that's not required by the
SEC. When doing research on a public company, it's good practice to read through these doc-
uments.

The second place where to find public company filings is EDGAR, the SEC's database. The fol-
lowing video walks you through how to find and use this database.

Three public company filings tend to be the most informative as we begin learning about a
company, the 10-K, the 10-Q, and the DEF 14A.
The following video will help you navigate through, and find the most important information
in the 10-K and DEF 14A documents:

If you are researching a public company that's owned by an international company, such
as Anheuser-Busch, these companies have different disclosure requirements than American
companies. The equivalent of the 10-K for such companies is called the 20-F. These compa-
nies do not file quarterly reports or a proxy statement.

Archives

CAITLIN DONNELLY KLEPPER

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Define archives, and distinguish them from libraries.
         Identify a variety of categories of archives.
         Integrate archival research into journalism and strategic communication projects.
         Plan and navigate archival research.
         Evaluate the credibility of archival sources.

Archives of Our Lives

"In an informal and possibly unselfconscious way, we maintain a personal archive, a treasure
chest of cherished artifacts and the memories they hold for us," David M. Levy, an information
expert at the University of Washington, observed.
Think about the contents of your bedroom at home, or your apartment or dorm room on
campus, or all the different files stored on your laptop. What kinds of records do you have?
What kinds of records do you generate on a daily basis? Think, too, about the kinds of records
you've had but had thrown away or deleted. Why do you save some things but not others?
ARCHIVES  289

They can be physical (paper) or electronic materials. They can be from the distant past (e.g.
your childhood), the more recent past (e.g. last year), or the present.

Do you have any of the following?

      Correspondence: letters, cards, postcards, emails, and text messages.
      Diaries or journals: physical volumes or blogs.
      School records: course notes, exams, papers, projects, report cards/transcripts, and

         copies of readings.
      Financial records: bank and credit card statements; receipts; and documentation per-

         taining to taxes, scholarships, tuition, and loans.
      Vital records: Social Security card, birth certificate, marriage license, passport, driver's

         license, and car title and registration.
      Published materials: yearbooks, magazines, clippings, and articles.
      Ephemera (i.e. materials created for a specific, limited purpose and generally designed

         to be discarded after use): concert programs, tickets, posters, bumper stickers, and
         buttons.
      Audiovisual materials: photographs and video.
      Social media posts.
      Historical records: family documents, photographs, and videos.
Just as you maintain a personal archive, so too have people in the distant and recent past kept
written documentation of their lives as individuals and as members of networks of relatives,
friends, neighbors, coworkers, and associates. Like your personal archive, these collections
capture a range of people's thoughts, feelings, experiences, and activities, from the mundane
and everyday to the extraordinary, from the joyful to the heartbreaking, and from the com-
mendable to the questionable.

What Are Archives?

You probably have encountered the word "archives" in conversation or writing. It's commonly
used to refer to any collection of data, information stored long-term, or old documents. How-
ever, among information professionals, the term "archives" has more specific definitions. Let's
examine and unpack two of these definitions.
290  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Definition 1: Archives are records and collections

Archives are collections of noncurrent records created or received by a person, family, or organiza-
tion, public or private, in the conduct of their affairs and preserved because of their enduring value.

Collections are groups of related documents. Each individual document derives some of its
significance and meaning from its relationships to other items in the archives. According to
archivist Peter Hirtle, "A true archives is a contextually based organic body of evidence, not a
collection of miscellaneous information."

Noncurrent materials are no longer used in the day-to-day activity of a person or organi-
zation. Clearly, this applies to historical materials like letters written in the 1800s. What may
be surprising is that materials created much more recently can also be considered noncur-
rent. This includes materials such as receipts for groceries you bought yesterday, a text mes-
sage conversation you had with a friend last week, an airline's record of a flight you took last
month, and notes and readings from classes you took and completed last semester. In short,
noncurrent doesn't necessarily mean old.

Records are documentary materials in any format. Records historically and generally refer to
textual paper documents, items, or materials such as letters and diaries. Audiovisual materi-
als like photographs, films, and videos are also considered records. Increasingly, archives are
also collecting electronic, born-digital records like emails, spreadsheets, and websites.

Archives include records created or received by someone. Think back to your personal
archives. It contains documents you have created, like journals. It also contains documents
that your friends, relatives, professors, and others have sent you, for example letters, post-
cards, and cards.

Archives contain the records of people, families, or organizations, public or private. The
records of a person or family are sometimes referred to as personal papers. It's important to
remember that, while archives document the lives of famous individuals and leaders in var-
ious fields, they also preserve information about the experiences of ordinary people. Orga-
nizations can be businesses and corporations; churches; community organizations; schools,
colleges, and universities; and local, state, and national governments.

Individuals and organizations create archival records in the conduct of their affairs. They
are a byproduct of the normal course of daily, planning, decision-making activities, and they
are generally not purposely created for long-term posterity or with other users (like future
scholars) in mind. For example, when you email a professor or text a friend, are you thinking
ARCHIVES  291

about creating a record, or are you creating a record as a tool to communicate and conduct
your daily business?

Archival records are preserved because of their enduring value. In other words, they are
kept and saved after they have served their original purpose because they are judged to have
value to others who were not the original users. Keep in mind that not all records can and
need to be saved permanently. This is especially true of the archives of organizations, as
information professionals have a systematic process for determining what is saved, what is
destroyed, and when.

For example, the National Archives and Records Administration - an independent agency of
the U.S. government and the keeper of the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and
Bill of Rights - keeps only about two to five percent of the federal records generated in any
given year. You, perhaps unknowingly, do the same thing with your personal archives. You
probably don't save every piece of paper, every email, and every photograph you've ever cre-
ated or received. You have various reasons for keeping some documents and throwing away
or deleting others after varying periods of time.

Definition 2: Archives are institutions and places

Archives are organizations that collect, preserve, store, and provide access to the records of indi-
viduals, families, or other organizations. The term "archives" also refers to the building (or portion
thereof) housing the organization.

Think again about your personal archive. You may have materials stored in a variety of places,
such as your laptop and desk drawers in your dorm room or apartment on campus. Addi-
tional parts of your personal archive might be in your room, or in your parents' attic, base-
ment, or garage. In this condition, your personal archives are potentially disorganized and at
risk from theft, fire, water, mold, bugs, and rodents. They also cannot be accessed by other
people like, for example, scholars researching the experiences of 21st-century Kansans or col-
lege students. For this reason, you might consider eventually giving your personal archive to
a professional archival organization like Kenneth Spencer Research Library.

Records make their way to archival institutions in three primary ways. First, materials can be
donated or gifted. This is often how the personal papers of individual and families make their
way to an archives. Second, materials can be purchased. This is often how archives acquire
the papers of prominent individuals and leaders. For example, the Harry Ransom Center at
The University of Texas at Austin purchased Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's Watergate
Papers in 2003 for $5 million. Third, archival materials can be transferred. Generally, the
292  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

records of a parent organization are systematically transferred to its archival repository. For
example, records generated by departments within the University of Kansas are transferred
on a regular basis to the KU University Archives.

Archives Versus Libraries

Broadly speaking, archives are different from libraries.

Library collections contain published items like books, scholarly journals, newspapers, and
maps. Archive collections contain unpublished materials like letters and diaries.

Materials in library collections are available elsewhere. Materials in archival collection are
unique, that is, there is only one copy in existence anywhere.

Library materials are organized individually by a predetermined subject classification system
that enables users to browse by subject in open stacks. Archival materials are organized by
provenance: records of different origins - the individual, family, or organization that created
or received the items in a collection - are kept separate from other collections in order to pre-
serve their context.

Items in libraries are independently significant. items in archives derive significance from rela-
tionships to other records in the collection.

These differences are not always so cut and dry in practice. Archives frequently exist within
a library and contain books, maps, and other published materials in addition to unpublished
collections of records. For example, KU's University Archives are housed at Kenneth Spencer
Research Library, which is also home to collections from across Kansas and around the world.
Within KU's University Archives, researchers can access university publications like Jayhawker
yearbooks, annual catalogs, alumni publications, and the University Daily Kansan, in addition
to records, photographs, and audiovisual materials.

Archive Categories

As shown in the list below, there are many different types of archival repositories. They range
widely in size, funding, and audience. Although we're focusing on U.S. archives in this chapter,
archival institutions exist around the world. For more information about each type of repos-
itory listed below, see the "Types of Archives" section of Using Archives: A Guide to Effective
Research by the Society of American Archivists.

What Are Digitized Archival Collections?

Archivists seek to promote and provide the widest possible accessibility of materials. They
have long used technology to provide access to users who may not be able to physically visit
an archives. In the past, this included efforts to compile collections of documents and publish
them as a book that could be purchased by libraries around the country. For example, the
papers and correspondence of a Founding Father, which might be scattered across multiple
institutions, would end up in book form to allow individuals unable to visit the archives in per-
son to access the materials.

Today, archival institutions are working to make substantial amounts of their physical hold-
ings available online. Institutions accomplish this through the process of digitization, which
is the conversion of analog text, pictures, or sound into a digital form that can be processed
by a computer. Archives continue to maintain collections of physical records that have been
digitized.

As a result of these efforts, you can discover and access a tremendous wealth of archival
materials online, along with digitized copies of rare print sources like books and maps. More-
over, once archival materials have been digitized, they are no longer organized simply by
provenance, which we defined above. Researchers can search digitized materials in a vari-
ety of ways, including browsing by subject and conducting keyword searches of the text. This
means that a user can quickly find all letters about a specific person, place, or thing without
reading an entire collection.

Countless digital collections are available freely on the open web. See KU Libraries' guide to
primary sources for U.S. history for a list of some examples.

Additional digital collections are available by a paid institutional subscription. See KU
ARCHIVES  295

Libraries' guide to primary sources for U.S. history (and click on the time period you're study-
ing) to see digital collections that are licensed to KU students, faculty, and staff.

Ancestry.com

The genealogy website Ancestry.com is an important for-profit digital collection of public
domain archival records (i.e. not protected by copyright) from institutions across the country
and world. Included are several billion historical records like federal and state censuses; birth,
marriage, and death records; immigration records; and military records. Ancestry is an impor-
tant resource for piecing together the details about the life of a person who lived in the past,
especially when paired with other sources like articles found in Newspapers.com or physical
records by, to, or about the individual.

Ancestry is available to paying subscribers. However, due to the popularity of genealogy,
many public libraries, including Lawrence Public Library, provide free on-site access. Addition-
ally, Kansas residents with a valid driver's license or state identification can access digitized
state records from the Kansas State Archives on Ancestry for free.

Despite the wealth of archival materials available online, remember that they represent only
a small fraction of the physical, analog archival collections that are held at physical reposito-
ries. This is true even of impressive digital collections, like Ancestry.com. Digitization is a time-
consuming and expensive process that involves retrieving documents, assessing the physical
conservation needs of the materials, and making any necessary repairs; scanning or pho-
tographing materials; creating and updating accurate and complete metadata; and continu-
ing to make the digital materials available as technologies change over time. As a result, the
vast majority of archival materials have not been digitized.

For example, KU's University Archives holds over one million photographic items that docu-
ment the development of the campus and its buildings, student life, faculty, commencement,
and athletic events. Almost 35,000 of those images have been digitized and made available
online. That is a substantial number, but it's only 3.5% of the entire collection.

Why Use Archives?

Archival records are a rich and important source of information for journalists.

First, they provide powerful connections with people who lived in the past. Archives capture
and preserve the humanity of people who may no longer be with us. Consider, for example,
296  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

this excerpt from a letter written by Lawrence resident Elisabeth Crittenden, a survivor of
Quantrill's Raid, to her mother a month after the 1863 attack.

      Dear Mother I am alive, but have had my nerves so unstrung by the late Massacre of
      our citizens that I have not written to let you know that I had escaped, unhurt, you
      have heard all about Quantrill's coming into Lawrence before this, but Mother, you
      cannot imagine the distress and suffering of our women and children by the sudden
      death of their Husbands and Fathers. 100 and 180 widows and over 200 orphans were
      made in one day, and in two hours time . . .

By putting individuals' stories together, archives strengthen collective memory and preserve
the histories of families, communities, states, regions, and nations. As we'll see later, however,
this has not and is not always equally true for all groups and individuals.

Archives, particularly government archives, also protect and preserve evidence of citizens'
rights, property, and identity, and they make transparent government possible. "The Impor-
tance of State Archives," created by the Council of State Archivists, provides some examples.
In documenting how individuals working in governments, companies, and organizations con-
duct their affairs on a daily basis, archives provide a paper trail that helps journalists and oth-
ers reveal to the public when these activities are questionable, misleading, or illegal.

Additionally, unpublished documents in archives capture individuals' private, unguarded, and
unfiltered thoughts, feelings, and words, which were recorded for themselves and perhaps a
small number of other readers. What someone says privately may differ from what s/he says
in public, published accounts. This discrepancy can be fertile ground for journalists to investi-
gate, especially when the individuals in question work in government, business, or an organi-
zation.

For example, reporting on the Democratic National Committee's leaked emails during the
2016 election, Aaron Blake of The Washington Post wrote that "many of the most damaging
emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders's presidential
campaign. Basically all of these examples came late in the primary -- after Hillary Clinton was
clearly headed for victory -- but they belie the national party committee's stated neutrality in
the race even at that late stage."

Moreover, archival records can be useful or significant for reasons other than that for which
they were originally created. This can be particularly true when records are analyzed in new
contexts and in conjunction with other sources. For example, in their October 2017 article
"How We Found Tom Price's Private Jets," Politico journalists Dan Diamond and Rachana Prad-
ARCHIVES  297

han described the role of non-current, unpublished records in their investigation into the use
of private jets for routine travel by Tom Price, then Health and Human Services Secretary. For
example, Diamond and Pradhan wrote:

      As we looked at our growing database [of information about Price's travel], we noticed
      some peculiarities about his trips. For instance, there was a Friday afternoon char-
      ter flight that took him to an island off the Georgia coast, even though he didn't have
      any formal events scheduled for nearly two days. We checked property records, HHS
      financial disclosures and fundraising records from Price's political career and realized
      the former Georgia congressman had long-standing ties to St. Simons Island: He and
      his wife regularly visited during the summers, both for fundraisers and to participate
      in the local medical association, and they owned undeveloped land worth more than
      $1 million there.

Note that property records are created and maintained to document who owns what land.
But, in this case, they are also evidence of wrongdoing.

Journalists, strategic communications professionals, and others use archival materials in myr-
iad ways.

      A news story or press release might highlight the activities at an archives, such as the
         acquisition of new collections, new or expanded services, discoveries made within the
         collections, or projects like exhibits and digitization.

      Archival records, especially photographs and other visual materials, can influence and
         provide inspiration for new products, advertising campaigns, and brand development.

      Archival records can be used to highlight, explore, and share the history and stories of
         the parent organization, for example institutional anniversaries, milestones, accom-
         plishments, significant events, important people, and painful aspects of the organiza-
         tion's past.

      Historical photographs from archives can be featured as part of social media efforts
         like Throwback Thursday, Flashback Friday, etc.

      Archival records can be used to explore local and institutional connections to national
         or international events and anniversaries.

      Archival records can provide historical background or context.

      Archival records can be used for fact checking, corroboration, and written proof of
         claims made in interviews.

One powerful example of the use of archival materials by a journalist is David Grann's work
298  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the F.B.I. Grann spoke about
the role of archives in his research process in a 2017 article in The Village Voice:

      It took David Grann nearly five years to write his latest bestselling nonfiction book,
      Killers of the Flower Moon, because of how much time he spent in archives. The book
      is about the Osage, a Native American tribe whose Oklahoma land, in the early 1900s,
      was discovered to be sitting on an oil reserve. The tribe members became per capita
      the wealthiest people in the world. Then they started getting murdered.

      Grann had known about the killings, but not their extent, until he came across a fab-
      ric-covered logbook in the National Archives in Fort Worth, Texas. It was a simple doc-
      ument. It was a list of the names of Osage "guardians" -- the white people assigned,
      on a deeply racist premise, to manage the Osage fortunes -- and next to them,
      the name of the Osage they were the guardian for. The only other thing written
      in the book was, underneath the names of certain of the Osage, the word dead.
      One guardian was assigned to five Osages, and all five of their names were fol-
      lowed by that word. "That defies any natural death rate," Grann said. "I thought that
      was strange, and I began to look at other individuals. Sometimes there would be a
      guardian who had a dozen Osage whose wealth they had been in charge of, they'd
      been guardians of, and there might have been 50 percent of them who had the word
      `dead' next to them. And on and on it went."

      "That document," he said, "which really just looked like a bureaucratic ledger -- it was
      very forensic, had no kind of emotion to it -- really contained the hints of a system-
      atic murder campaign." He said that that was the nature of archival work: a document
      that looked like nothing could turn out to be telling a powerful story -- but only if you
      had a sense of what you were looking at. "I was not looking for that book, I just came
      across it. And unless you were versed in what was going on, it might've just seemed
      innocuous. And yet this very innocuous document really showed the banality of evil."

      In the process of writing the book, Grann said, through all the archival work, there's "a
      kind of relationship with these documents that you begin to develop as you become
      more familiar with them, and as you hold them, and as you look at them." He likened
      it to the relationship you develop as you speak to someone, face to face, in an inter-
      view; it's more than you could ever get over email. "I thought the handwriting in that
      ledger was revealing," he said. "It was just a simple word. And I just kept thinking,
      `Who was that bureaucrat who kept writing this word dead?' And I just would look at
ARCHIVES  299

      the handwriting, and that's all they wrote, and in that word it contained volumes of
      hidden history, suffering, death, poisonings -- souls."

Keep in mind that, while archival records are used in many news stories, they may not
be identified as such. Other words like "records," "documents," and "sources" may be used
instead. Or, numbers may be provided that were compiled or calculated using unpublished,
noncurrent written sources. As you encounter news stories, watch and listen for these and
other words that hint at archival records being used.

Finding Archival Collections

Conventional search strategies

You can start your search for archival collections by checking books and articles, including
those on Wikipedia, that have already been written about your topic. Pay particular attend to
the reference lists or bibliographies of these books or articles. As you search and read, ask
yourself: What archival sources did the authors use, and where are they located?

You can continue your research with a Google search, utilizing the same search strategies
covered the Search and Re-Search and Search More Effectively chapters.

When searching online for archival materials about a topic, pair the name of the person, orga-
nization, or event you're researching with words like "archives," "collections," "records," "let-
ters," or "photographs." Including those additional words helps you find archival collections
about your topic, not biographies, articles, or news stories.

This search may turn up digitized archival sources about your topic. However, you may not
find much or any digitized content. Remember that the overwhelming percent of archival
materials have not been digitized. Additionally, as you will recall from our earlier chapter on
Google, the search engines cannot index or make discoverable much of what is on the web.
In particular, Google will generally not index primary sources housed behind the firewalls of
library archival databases. For this reason, we recommend you visit the library's list of data-
bases and follow the below steps.

Your online search may turn up links to online descriptions of archival collections called find-
ing aids. Finding aids are sometimes called indexes, guides, or inventories. One of the key
pieces of information in a finding aid is the location of the collection being described. A video
at the end of this chapter discusses finding aids in more depth.
300  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Searching for repositories

If your Google searches reveal neither digitized collections nor finding aids, you'll need other
strategies for locating archival materials, likely physical records housed at a repository. There
are several ways of going about this.

First, see if you can easily guess where records you need are located. For example, if you
do strategic communications for a unit within a college or university, information about the
history of that unit - in the form of records, photographs, and published materials - will be
found in the school's archives, even if you couldn't find a reference to these materials through
a Google search. Likewise, a business, organization, or church may maintain its own historical
records, possibly, but not necessarily, as an officially-designated archives program. Geogra-
phy can also guide you to relevant records. For example, if you're researching a local event,
person, or topic, an archives with records documenting local history might be a good place to
start.

Second, approach your topic differently by identifying other potential search terms and think-
ing more broadly. Conduct preliminary research about your topic using sources like Wikipedia
or books or articles written about it. For example, say you're researching an individual person.
Make a list of (1) the important people who were in this person's network, (2) the organi-
zations with which this person was affiliated, (3) where s/he went to school, (4) where s/
he worked, (5) where s/he volunteered or worked with nonprofits or community groups.
The names on this list become your new search terms, and again pair them with words like
"archives," "collections," "records," "letters," or "photographs." Doing this may not reveal spe-
cific archival records about the individual you're researching, but it may direct you to col-
lections of records by, to, or about related individuals or organizations, which in turn may
contain information about the person you're researching.

Third, you can reuse your original and expanded list of search terms to search tools like
ArchiveGrid (free online) and Archive Finder (licensed by KU Libraries). These tools search
descriptions of archival records held by libraries, archives, and other cultural institutions
across the United States and beyond.

Finally, think about the records themselves and ask yourself the following questions:

      What types of sources would I ideally like to find?

      What types of materials were - or might have been - created during the time period
         I'm studying?

      Where would those documents have been housed at the time they were created?
ARCHIVES  301

      Can I extrapolate from the above answer to determine where the documents are
         located now?

After all of this searching, you may still find yourself at a dead end. Perhaps the records you
would like to find were never created, or they were created but haven't survived to the pre-
sent day. Perhaps the records are still in someone's personal custody, meaning they have not
been donated to a publicly accessible archive. Or, perhaps an archives has the records, but
they are inaccessible because they're restricted or have never been processed, or made ready
for researchers. Or, an archives has the records and they're available for use, but the finding
aid exists only as a paper document.

If you hit a dead end, make an educated guess as to where the relevant records might be -
likely based at least partially on geographic proximity to the topic you're researching - and
contact an archivist at that institution for guidance. For example, in honor of the centen-
nial of World War I, Spencer Research Library used its blog to follow the experiences of one
American soldier - 19 year-old Forrest W. Bassett - at Fort Leavenworth from July 1917/2017
through May 1918/2018. Forrest's letters are held in Spencer's Kansas Collection. The final
entry of the series revealed what happened to Forrest after World War I. Google searches did
not turn up any photographs of him, but keeping in mind that he lived his entire life in Beloit,
Wisconsin, I reached out to the Beloit Historical Society. The staff there was able to find four
photographs of Forrest and his wife and children.

Using Archives

Despite the wealth of digitized archival materials available online, always remember that they
represent only a small fraction of the physical archival collections that are held at brick-and-
mortar archival repositories. Thus, even if you have been able to access records that are rele-
vant to your project online, you may also need to visit an archival institution and use physical
collections. Here are some things to keep in mind as you do this.

Archives are meant to be used by researchers

Archives are not warehouses for records, and they're more than places to simply store mate-
rials. Access and use are among the core values of the archival profession.

Archivists can be as invaluable to you as the sources

You can email, call, or talk to an archivist at any stage of your research. Don't think you're
302  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

bothering him or her. Remember, part of an archivist's job is to help researchers access and
use collections. It's also something that archivists enjoy. Don't hesitate to ask for help!

You may feel intimidated when working with archives, but archivists understand that working
with collections can be challenging, and they can help you navigate the process. Archivists
may also know additional information about collections, beyond what is available in finding
aids and other tools. That means archivists may be able to direct you to relevant collections
that you hadn't or wouldn't have otherwise discovered.

Research frequently requires the use of collections at multiple repositories

Think again about your personal archive. If you sent a postcard to your friend while on vaca-
tion, that postcard would be in your friend's personal archives, not yours. As a result, a future
scholar researching your life would need to consult your personal archives, plus the personal
archives of your friends, your relatives, and other people in your network. Electronic docu-
ments muddle these distinctions somewhat. While you likely don't have a copy of a paper let-
ter you wrote and sent, you probably do have copies of emails you've sent.

Archives operate differently than libraries, and each archive is unique

Earlier in this chapter we considered ways in which archives and libraries are different. These
differences mean that archives operate differently than the public and university libraries to
which you may be accustomed.

Unlike public and academic libraries, collections at archival institutions are stored in closed
book stacks, which are employee-only areas inaccessible to researchers. Closed book stacks
are secure spaces that protect materials from theft, damage, and disorganization. Archival
materials also don't circulate, meaning they cannot be checked out and taken home.
Researchers must work in dedicated spaces at the archives, generally called a Reading Room.
Reading Rooms are supervised by staff, who guard against theft and make sure materials are
handled properly.

Additionally, archives generally have more rules and procedures than public and academic
libraries. These guidelines may be surprising and unfamiliar to you at first. However, they
are in place because most archival materials are unique and irreplaceable, so they need to
be handled with extra care. When you use archival materials, you are helping to make sure
those items stay safe and in good condition for future researchers. An archives' rules will help
you do that. Consult Using Archives: A Guide to Effective Research by the Society of Ameri-
ARCHIVES  303

can Archivists to read about some typical usage guidelines found at archives and the reasons
behind them.

Archives may implement the above general guidelines in different ways, so specific rules
across institutions can vary. Be sure to familiarize yourself with an archives' rules before you
visit. Check the repository's website for information and contact the archivist for more details
if necessary.

Working in an archives is not a fast process, so allow enough time

It's difficult to conduct archival research at the last minute, with a deadline looming. Using
archives is kind of like being a detective: you're following clues and piecing them together
in order to answer a question. You might make unexpected discoveries, and frequently new
information leads to new questions. You might need to conduct additional research on a
name, organization, place, or event referenced in a record. While archivists and discovery
tools like finding aids are invaluable resources, you may still have to do quite a bit of digging
in boxes, folders, and records.

Remember, too, that many records from the past are handwritten in cursive. It can take time
to make sense of an individual's handwriting, especially if it's quirky and contains unfamiliar
abbreviations and inconsistent spelling. Sometimes it helps to transcribe (i.e. make a typed
copy) a document.

It's also important to record thorough citation information about the materials as you work.
You may later need to go back and refer to those materials again, or another researcher may
later need or want to track your sources.

Keep in mind, too, that many archives have more limited hours than public and academic
libraries. They may be closed on certain days (e.g. weekends), may not be open in the
evenings, and may be closed around lunchtime. Additionally, some archives require
researchers to make appointments.

Archivists are happy to assist researchers with their work. However, rchives generally don't
have enough manpower for archivists to conduct extensive research for users. If you have a
simple, focused question that can be answered in a short amount of time, an archivist may
be able to review materials on your behalf and relay the information to you. If you have a
broad research question that requires examining, reading, and interpreting a sizeable quan-
tity of documents, you should expect to visit the archives and conduct that research yourself.
If a visit to an archives is not possible, an archivist will still try to assist you. For example, an
304  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

archives may direct you to a list of proxy researchers, who are local researchers whom you
can hire to conduct research on your behalf.

Archives generally offer services for obtaining copies or scans of items

Regulations vary across archives, but most have some kind of process for providing
researchers with copies, scans, or reproductions. Sometimes researchers are allowed to
make their own copies, and more frequently archives staff provide them. You may need to
complete and submit paperwork to request copies, and you may have to pay a fee. Archives
likely also have a process for researchers who would like request permission to publish or
display an item from the archives. This would apply, for example, if you want to include a
photograph from an archives to accompany a piece you're writing. Again, you may need to
complete and submit paperwork and pay a fee. These processes generally take a bit of time;
anticipate that they cannot be done quickly.

Evaluating Archival Sources

In general, you can think about archival materials as primary sources, whether they're paper
documents, electronic records, or digitized surrogates. A primary source is a document
that contains firsthand accounts of events and that was created contemporaneous to those
events or later recalled by an eyewitness. Primary sources are characterized by "a lack of
intermediaries between the thing or events being studied and reports of those things or
events," according to a definition from the Society of American Archivists.

Importantly, this definition continues to say that, "newspaper articles contemporaneous with
the events described are traditionally considered primary sources, although the reporter may
have compiled the story from witnesses, rather than being an eyewitness."

For this reason, primary sources may be more reliable and accurate than secondary and ter-
tiary sources written later. Think about playing a game of telephone: the original informa-
tion becomes increasingly distorted each time it's repeated. Likewise, as archival records get
quoted, paraphrased, and summarized by multiple authors in various texts over time, the
original account or story can become twisted. Even basic facts can become untrue over time.
Once an erroneous piece of information enters the literature, it frequently gets repeated in
subsequent works.

This problem is compounded when claims about the past are invoked to make arguments
about the present, when present-day attitudes and events influence our view and interpreta-
ARCHIVES  305

tion of the past, when scholars reassess known information in new ways, when problematic
ideas about the past enter and persis in popular culture and collective consciousness, and
when communities of all sizes seek to ignore painful aspects of their history. The antidote to
this complexity? Go back to the original primary sources and the archival record.

Archival credibility cues

Despite their research value, archival materials must be read with skepticism. Take into
account the same considerations with which you would analyze any other source of infor-
mation or news, such as credibility assessments discussed in earlier chapters. When working
with archival records, though, there are layers of additional challenges.

First, just because an archival record was written at the time of an historical event doesn't
automatically mean that it is completely accurate. Records contain errors and are not always
straightforward, with their precise meaning sometimes unclear. For example, the federal pop-
ulation census has been conducted every ten years since 1790. If you trace a person's life
using the census, you'll notice that the information doesn't always match up. Most commonly,
people don't always age ten years within the ten years between censuses. This is true even
though census information was self-reported or provided by someone close to the individual.

When examining an archival record, it's important to assess the perspective and bias of the
author and think about his/her original audience. Keep in mind that, in important ways, peo-
ple in the past lived in a world that was radically different than what we know today. As
L. P. Hartley wrote in his novel The Go-Between (1953), "The past is a foreign country; they
do things differently there." As a result, people who lived in the past possessed different
worldviews and assumptions. And, just like today, not everyone who lived in the past shared
the exact same perspectives and beliefs. This is perhaps obvious when considering archival
records written in the distant past, but it's true of the more recent past, too.

For example, consider an opinion piece in Forbes in 2016. The article examined the formative
experiences of 70-year-old white men, who were born in 1946 and became adults in 1964.
Their interactions with women and people of color were influenced by the societal context
in which they lived. For example, "across roughly half of America, voters born in 1946 would
have been adults before they ever saw a black person eat in a restaurant dining room, stay in
their hotel, or enter a restroom with them. In the South, these voters spent all of their forma-
tive years drinking from the whites' only fountain." It can be easy to forget that the world was
significantly different even just a few decades ago, and to forget that broad, abstract histori-
cal contexts had real implications for the individuals who experienced them.
306  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

While interpreting an individual archival document can be challenging, considering that doc-
ument within a larger collection of records can raise additional uncertainties. Biases exist
across collections, not just in individual documents.

One document from the archives generally doesn't tell an entire story. Most documents are
incomplete by themselves but are invaluable pieces of a larger puzzle. These pieces rarely
fit together neatly or easily. This can be true even when the historical record seems rela-
tively complete. Consider the work of John Badger Bachelder, who sought to write a defini-
tive history of the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Despite his efforts --
which began within months after the July 1863 battle -- Bachelder was ultimately unable to
complete his project. Historian Thomas Desjardin described Bachelder's struggle in his book,
These Honored Dead:

      Few, if any, historians ever had more information, support, and funding for their work
      than Bachelder did in writing a history of the Battle of Gettysburg...Despite years of
      written and oral conversations with hundreds, if not thousands, of eyewitnesses, the
      final product of his endeavor was an eight-volume, 2,000 page summary of the bat-
      tle taken largely from the already published official reports of the battle...When it
      came time to put pen to paper and commit to one version of the truth over another,
      Bachelder came to the realization that...there is no "what really happened" at Get-
      tysburg; only a mountain of varying, often contradictory accounts that are seldom in
      accord, all tainted in some way or other by memory, bias, politics, ego, or a host of
      other factors.

Moreover, the historical record is full of holes, gaps, and silences that are not accidental.

Some records that modern researchers would love to use were never created. For example,
your personal archive does not contain any evidence of verbal conversations you've had
on the phone or in person, unless you have recorded conversations using WhatsApp or
Snapchat. Individuals' decisions to write down information frequently has been a result of his-
torical context as much, if more so, than about personal decision.

Think, for example, about enslaved African Americans. They were prohibited from learning to
read and write, meaning that there are very few first-person accounts written by the enslaved
documenting their experiences, thoughts, and feelings. The enslaved were also considered
property, an idea that is reflected in documents from the time. The 1860 population census
of "free inhabitants" records each person's name, age, gender, occupation, and birthplace. In
contrast, the 1860 "slave schedule" records only the age, gender, and color (black or mixed-
race) of each enslaved person. The effects of the institution of slavery were reflected and
ARCHIVES  307

preserved in the historical record, and those effects will permanently influence research con-
ducted by their descendants and scholars.

Some records that archivists would assess as having enduring value have not survived to
the present day. The earliest records of Lawrence, Kan., for example, were destroyed in
Quantrill's Raid in 1863. Collections of personal wartime letters frequently have only the let-
ters written by soldiers to their families. Many letters from families to soldiers no longer exist,
because soldiers probably were unable to carry and keep those documents on the front.
Additionally, the personal writings of some prominent individuals have been intentionally
destroyed in anticipation of others' interest in the documents. For example, poet Emily Dick-
inson asked her sister Lavinia to destroy her papers after her death; it was a promise Lavinia
kept.

Finally, documents are preserved in an archive as a result of the actions of past and current
generations of scholars and archivists. The historical record therefore reflects what docu-
ments - and what stories - they have considered and do consider to be important and worth
collecting and saving. These decisions have reflected the values and power structures of the
broader society in which scholars and archivists have operated. Thus, the voices of individuals
and organizations in historically marginalized communities - those, for example, of women,
LGBT individuals, indigenous peoples, working class and poor people, and African Americans
- have also been largely excluded from the historical record.

Conclusion

Working with archives can be challenging for a variety of reasons. But, working with these
materials - handling original documents, uncovering stories of people who lived in the past,
making discoveries, and piecing together stories - can also be very exciting. In conducting
archival research, remember that a wealth of digitized materials is available online and that
a tremendous of amount of additional physical collections are available at brick-and-mortar
repositories. Finally, remember that archivists are available and excited to help you with vari-
ous aspects of your research.

Interviews: Conversations with Risk

ERIC THOMAS

Learning Objectives

      After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
         Define what it means for interviews to be conversations with risk.
         Articulate risks that interviewers can take during an interview.
         Understand how to prepare questions for interviews that are conversations of risk.

Stepping It Up A Notch

The preceding chapter presents guidelines for beginning interviewers about how to prepare
for and conduct solid interviews.
This chapter picks up where the first chapter leaves off, and presents advanced interviewing
ideas for those who have some practice following basic interviewing strategies.

From Boring to Good Interviews

At the outset, let's agree on what is an interview, what makes an interview boring, and what
is a good interview.
INTERVIEWS: CONVERSATIONS WITH RISK                                                                  309

An interview is research. It is research in that it is the gathering of fact, the gathering of opin-
ion and the gathering of emotion from people and sources surrounding us.

But interviews that use only pre-scripted interview questions are boring and predictable.

Why are they boring and predictable? Because the people we are interviewing are going to
say interesting things. And if we have a list of 20 questions that are going to inspire our next
question, then we are never going to be responding to what the person says. If someone says
something interesting, and we simply move on to the next question, we are not reacting to
the interesting thing that they just said.

In contrast to boring, pre-scripted interviews, good interviews aim to gather new information,
of course, but more than that, they are conversations.

But what is a conversation, and what makes a good conversation?

This chapter answers these questions with five audio clips from different podcasts. These
audio clips demonstrate what makes a good conversation and, by extension, a good inter-
view.

Good Conversations

The first audio clip shows what good conversations are like.

It comes from Slate magazine's Culture GabFest podcast. Slate is an online magazine that, in
addition to articles, puts out a variety of podcasts. This podcast talks about culture. In this
episode, the hosts Stephen Metcalf, Dana Stevens and Julia Turner, discuss what makes a
good conversation.

Listen to this clip, note what Stevens, Turner, and Metcalf define as good conversations.

310  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

These hosts say that good conversations involve humor and a bit of unexpectedness.

Conversations entail people saying things that are unexpected, off the cuff, and not scripted.
In this, these hosts reinforce the idea that we shouldn't be having these pre-scripted interview
questions. Instead we, as interviewers, should be willing to take risks. This means being willing
to say things that might offend, that might make people laugh, or maybe even that might con-
fuse people.

Through all of this, we will enjoy and learn from our partners in the conversation.

Categories of Risk Interviewers Can Take

Here are five basic categories of risks that interviewers can take to turn an interview into a
good conversation.

Be nave. One of my favorites is to be nave when you are interviewing. This means to act as
though you don't know the answers to questions that you already know. Being nave in this
way gets the person you're interviewing, the expert, the person of authority, to give you their
take on the issue at hand. This approach gives these people an opportunity to explain a basic
concept in an unexpected way.

Be bold. The second risk that interviewers can take is to be very bold. This means saying
something that could be construed as impertinent, or maybe even on the edge of being dis-
respectful. To have a bold take can be really helpful in taking a risk in interviewing.

Have your own theory. The third risk an interviewer can take is having your own theory: To
present something as your own take. Normally, when we think about interviews, we think
about just having questions formulated. But what if you were to walk in with your own theory
of an issue or of how something happens, present that to your interviewee, and get this per-
son to respond to that theory?

Be funny. Being funny in an interview is an incredible risk. There is perhaps nothing more
intimidating than standing in front of people and trying to make them laugh. That's a lot of
pressure, but in taking that risk in an interview, that might be something that would elicit an
interesting reaction that you could include in your research.

Be personal. The fifth and most obvious risk you could take in an interview is to be personal.
This means not only being personal in the questions that you ask, but also in being personal
about your own experiences. What are the things you have gone through in relation to the
INTERVIEWS: CONVERSATIONS WITH RISK  311

topic of your interview that you could share with the interviewee? For example, say you are
talking to a student athlete about a particular win or loss that they have just experienced.
Being personal, and talking about your own past win or loss, might help your interviewee con-
nect with you as a peer with a shared experience.

One Conversation Filled With Risks

The second interview that we will listen to is from Terry Gross, the famous radio interviewer
who hosts NPR's daily program Fresh Air. In this podcast, Terry Gross is interviewing Uta
Hagen, an actress and a drama teacher.

As you will hear, Gross takes some particular risks in her interview with Hagen. As you listen,
keep this central question in mind: What type of risks does Gross take during this interview?

         An audio element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can listen to it online here:
         https://otn.pressbooks.pub/becredible/?p=820

Gross takes three main risks in this interview.

The first risk she takes may not seem very risky at all in terms of what we generally mean by
risks and that is the idea of being informed. Gross sat down with Hagen's books, she read the
books, and likely researched Hagen using other sources as well. Gross did all the preparation
that was needed, and that takes time.

Any occasion that you take time to research something is a risk because you could spend
time researching something that doesn't end up being relevant to your interview. But Gross
has taken the risk of being informed and taking the time to be informed. The result was that
Gross was able to ask informed questions and, as we will discuss, engage in a conversation
with Hagen as an informed person.

The second risk she takes is the risk of being quiet and of listening actively. Consider how
personal Hagen's criticism of Gross asking Hagen about acting technique could have seemed
312  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

to Gross. Hagen basically attacks everything Gross does for a living, but Gross just sits there
and takes it.

If you ever had to sit there and be lectured to, and not defend yourself, you understand that
it takes a huge amount of restraint from Gross to be submissive.

Remaining quiet and listening to Hagen's perspective granted Gross a keen insight into the
mind and opinion of a great acting coach, and time to use her prior knowledge of Hagen to
formulate her response to the thespian. This leads us to Gross's third risk.

The third risk that Gross takes is the risk of defending herself. Once she has listened to
Hagen, Gross defends her question and fights back in a way, and explains her opposing argu-
ment. That could have further inflamed this situation and made Hagen even more offended
by what Gross was asking and saying.

But, as you may notice, Gross is able to pull from her years of experience as an interviewer
and her research of Hagen to explain why she asked the question that offended Hagen. In
response, Hagen is convinced that Gross's question wasn't flippant but a thoughtful attempt
to improve her own and her listeners' understanding of the acting craft. In the end, Hagen
sounds apologetic and almost flattered, and the two return to a congenial conversation.

Terry Gross later explained her thinking during the interaction:

      "What I liked about [Uta Hagen] challenging me is that sometimes interviewing is like
      question, answer, question, answer, and that's fine. But other times there's this real
      whammy that's thrown at you, and I like it. First of all, it really forces me to think, and sec-
      ond of all, in her case, it was challenging the basic premise of the interview. In a situation
      like that, if somebody is either hostile or challenging, I like to examine the problem and
      talk that through -- I think that makes for provocative radio."

Studs Terkel on the Train

The next podcast is from The Studs Terkel Program. Studs Terkel was a famous radio producer
from Chicago. This clip is from Aug. 27, 1963, so you need to do a bit of time travel to under-
stand the risks that Terkel takes here.

This clip is called This Train. It is from interviews that Terkel conducted with individuals on the
way to a Civil Rights March in 1963.
INTERVIEWS: CONVERSATIONS WITH RISK  313

The question I would like for you to keep in mind while listening to this clip is: What type of
risks is Terkel taking? Again, focus on particular things that he says, and particular ways he
sets up the interview that might be risky.

         An audio element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can listen to it online here:
         https://otn.pressbooks.pub/becredible/?p=820

I see Terkel as taking one major risk in this interview.

The risk he takes is by simply being there, on location, in the train station, at the event. He
took the risk of leaving the newsroom. This is something that is incredibly easy to avoid.
You might be tempted to stay away from the personal interaction that might take place. He
could have just picked up the phone, even back in 1963, and attempted to do these interviews
over the phone.

However, the difference between being in-person and being over the phone is huge. Being
there is an incredibly helpful thing to do in regards to doing the interview. It allows you to see
and hear things first hand. You directly interpret things instead of asking for someone else's
spin.

I think we can all agree that in 1963, as people were marching on Washington to advocate
for Civil Rights, that this was not a topic that was seen as simple or easy to cover. This would
have been something of great controversy. To add to this, Terkel was a white man covering
an event that greatly impacted African Americans. By taking the risk of leaving the newsroom,
Terkel improved his ability to find sources, and to better obtain their trust to share their expe-
riences.

So Terkel went out of the newsroom, found people where they were, and asked them about
something that could be incredibly offensive to them, or incredibly controversial to them. All
of this involved risk.
314  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

Telling a Story

The fourth clip is from the podcast Radiolab. This episode is titled "Dark Side of the Earth." We
are going to listen to a short interview with astronaut Dave Wolf, conducted by hosts Robert
Krulwich and Jad Abumrad. The interview was posted Oct. 12, 2012.

This clip needs a little bit of a setup. What Dave Wolf, the astronaut, is going to explain here
is this: He is trapped outside of the International Space Station, hovering out in the solar sys-
tem, and the cooling unit of his space suit has failed. And so he is essentially slowly cooking
from the outside in. It is a situation that is very likely to kill him unless he finds a way to get
back into the space station.

He has already failed to get into one of the entrances of the space station. So he is going to
try another entrance into station.

He is getting so hot within the space suit that his perspiration and body heat is fogging up the
front shield of the space suit, which he uses to look out of. You'll hear him figure out a way to
look through that shield so that he can see what he's doing.

Again, what risks do interviewers Krulwich and Abumrad take in this interview?

         An audio element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can listen to it online here:
         https://otn.pressbooks.pub/becredible/?p=820

Of course, the interviewers are being quiet, in a way that we talked about previously, to allow
Wolf to tell a personal story.

But they take one key risk that we haven't discussed previously. This risk is allowing Wolf to
tell a story from beginning, to middle, to end. That is really, really tricky to do, to get someone
to tell an interesting narrative story. And they've taken that risk of asking him to tell his story,
and then giving him the space and time to do so.
INTERVIEWS: CONVERSATIONS WITH RISK  315

One thing I would encourage every interviewer to do is to have a "tell me a story" question at
the ready.

It is very easy for people to avoid telling us stories if we ask them questions like, "How was
your day?" "How was your presentation?" "How did the budget meeting go?" They can answer
very easily by saying, "Good," or "Okay," or "Not so great."

But if we say, "Tell me a story about the budget meeting," then they are very unlikely to just
respond quickly. They're going to be forced by social manners and also by our question to tell
us story, and we likely will get much more out of it by asking that question.

Back to Middle School

The next podcast is from the radio program This American Life. This episode, "Middle School,"
focuses on the embarrassment, the fun, and the awkwardness of being a middle-schooler.
This was produced by This American Life's co-producer Ira Glass, and it was first published on
Oct. 28, 2011.

You're going to hear a variety of interviewers here. The risks that these interviewers take are
very similar to the risks taken by the previous interviewers. So I'm going to ask you to keep a
different question in mind. While listening, ask yourself: What are the specific things that the
interviewers do and ask here that are particularly good?

         An audio element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can listen to it online here:
         https://otn.pressbooks.pub/becredible/?p=820

I think one of the most striking moments comes from the interviewer who asked, "Take me
through it minute by minute." That prompt, that follow-up question that she asked, allows the
boy in this case to explain exactly what happened, and to feel okay about indulging the inter-
viewer in this minute-by-minute of what life is like for him.
There are other risks that these This American Life interviewers took:
316  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

    1. They enter their sources' most comfortable space. They find them among their
         friends, at their school, they find them outside of their school in places that put the
         interviewees at ease.

    2. They don't have pre-written questions. Instead, they have impromptu, of-the-minute
         follow-up questions. They ask questions based on what the previous question to the
         answer was. It takes years of practice to get to this point, though. Below we will give
         you some tips on how to build up to this level of mastery.

    3. They also ask lots and lots of confirmation questions. They ask and re-ask the same
         questions, and in doing so they are asking their sources to dive deeper into their
         experiences, and say things in a more detailed way.

    4. This American Life producers take incredible risks with the actual questions they ask.
         These are adults who go into a middle school with a microphone and ask students
         about petting, dating, boys and girls at their school, and dances. In doing so, they ask
         some incredibly sensitive questions. In other words, the producers go out of their
         comfort zones to ensure that their interviewees feel comfortable enough to be their
         authentic selves.

Preparing for Conversations With Risk

So if we are trying to do all of this conversational interviewing do we just walk into an inter-
view unprepared?

I think we already know the answer to that: No. But we are going to prepare for a conversation
differently than we would for a pre-scripted interview.

The following process comes from Bill Tammeus, who is a former long-time journalist with
the Kansas City Star. He presents this as a step-by-step process for preparing for a conversa-
tional interview.

Focus. The first thing Tammeus says that we should know is the focus of our story. Make
sure that your focus is narrow enough for the time and space we are given, or that it is broad
enough to fill the time and space we are given. For instance, we shouldn't be trying to answer
a huge question about our culture with a 200-word brief. Similarly, we shouldn't try to answer
a very, very narrow question with a 10,000-word story we've been assigned. We should make
sure that our focus is appropriate.

Research the story. We should do as much factual research as we can on our topics, much in
the same way that Terry Gross researched acting and knew tons and tons about it. We should
do lots and lots of research on the story we are hoping to research.
INTERVIEWS: CONVERSATIONS WITH RISK  317

Research the interviewee. We should do as much factual research on the interviewee as we
did on the topic or story. Remember how Terry Gross read all of Uta Hagan's acting books?
You may not have to read books, but taking a glance at the interviewee's LinkedIn account or
another biographical source should be a good starting point.

We shouldn't need to ask the interviewee where they went to school or how many years they
have been in their careers, or how to spell their names. We should know all those things
heading into that interview. We shouldn't be surprised by any of their answers. We should be
asking more interesting and more conversational questions that will get our source to tell us
something interesting.

Prepare questions. This is going to seem absolutely counterintuitive, but you should write
down 20-25 questions to ask. Now, we just said that we would not ask our subject 20-25 ques-
tions in a pre-scripted way. That is still true. The point of writing down these questions is to
get our questions on paper and into our minds. Then, we will go through a mental exercise.

Group questions. We are going to group all of those questions into 5 or 6 subject areas that
will dominate our questions. So in the end, we are not going to ask those exact 20-25 ques-
tions, but rather we are going to talk about 5 to 6 the major subject areas.

Throw questions away. You now have all of those questions in your head. There is no reason
why you need to go into an interview with your written-down questions. If you do, you will
likely rely on them and likely ask questions that seem stilted, and not seem responsive to the
person you are sitting in front of. So instead, allow those 5 or 6 subject areas guide you.

Note sections. What do you do with those 5-6 subject areas? You go ahead and put them
in bullet point in the corner of each page of your note-writing materials. If you put them up
there, you will be able to ask those questions without needing to refer to those exact ques-
tions. It will allow you to work through each of those subject areas one by one, without having
to ask questions that are pre-formulated. And it will allow you to ask follow-up questions that
are more conversational.

Subject conversation. During the interview, have a conversation about those bullet-point
subject areas. Allow this conversation to be free-flowing, take the risks of being nave, being
bold, being funny, coming up with your own theory, and all the things that we talked about in
this chapter.

Finish up. How do you finish this? You finish this by asking the interviewee: What did I forget
to ask? This is often a really good question to finish with, because it flatters the interviewee a
318  PETER BOBKOWSKI AND KARNA YOUNGER

little bit. This question signals to them that that they probably know the topic better than you
do. Their answer to this question may help you to generate your next story idea.

Double-check preferences. Double-check how your source wants their name to appear in
your writing. I said before that we don't need to check the spelling of someone's name, but
someone might prefer to be Jen instead of Jenny of Jennifer, so it's always good to learn of
someone's preferred title and how they would like their name to appear. You may also ask
how they wish their professional title to appear, and if they have a pronoun preference (i.e.,
he/his, her/her, they/them/theirs).

Review

What are we seeking from interviews? We are seeking news. We are seeking something that
few people already know. We want something unexpected, and we want something that is
unknown. And we are much more likely to get this very unknown information if we ask ques-
tions using a conversational approach rather than pre-scripted Q & A. We are always looking
to have a conversation that hinges on risk.

A Practitioner's View

                                   Zak Beasley

                                      KU Journalism, B.S. 2007, M.S. 2014; KU Law, J.D. 2015
                                      U.S. Marine Corps Captain

                                   I'm a judge advocate in the Marine Corps, which is just another
                                   way of saying I'm a Marine lawyer.

                                   As part of my job, I have to interview people in order to under-
                                   stand their side of the story, as well as their recollection of events.
     It's not unusual to interview someone weeks or even months after an event has hap-
     pened, which makes the interviews that much more difficult.

     How to select individuals. If a person is likely to have relevant information to my case,
     I want to talk to them, period. If there were five witnesses to a crime, you better believe
     I'm trying to talk to everyone.

     How to conduct interviews. First, deciding the the proper tone of the interview. If I'm
INTERVIEWS: CONVERSATIONS WITH RISK  319

talking to a victim of sexual assault, my tone is going to be entirely different than if
I'm talking to an expert witness about how cocaine affects the body, or with a person
suspected of committing a violent crime. Establishing the proper tone creates an envi-
ronment where the interviewee feels comfortable and gives the impression that I am
a professional. Typically I always take time to thank the person for their time upfront
and tell them the importance of their interview.

Second, tell the truth. Without failure, I always stress the importance of telling the
truth. I don't care whether the facts I get from a person are good for my case or not, if
I don't have reliable information, then I can't do my job.

Sometimes people feel pressured that they have to give a certain answer, so I do my
best to make sure they know their only obligation is to tell the truth. This comes in
handy if the interviewee/witness is testifying, and the veracity of their prior statements
ever comes into question.

Third, don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. The importance of having a firm under-
standing of a person's recollection of events or expert opinion cannot be overstated. I
typically spend a good portion of my morning reviewing investigations, case law, and
prior witness statements in order to maximize my understanding of the case and the
relevant issues.

I like to outline topics and sub-topics I want to cover with the interviewee to make sure
we cover those areas. I like open-ended questions when conducting interviews so I can
let the person talk without having to interrupt them, and then ask more pointed ques-
tions on the back end.

Don't be afraid to ask the same question a couple of times. Never leave an interview
being unsure about what the person was trying to convey.

Fourth, don't be afraid to ask hard questions. Typically, those are the most important
ones to ask. I always like to preface those questions with a disclaimer and why it's
important for me to know. At the end of the day, I can't do my job if I don't have all the
facts.
