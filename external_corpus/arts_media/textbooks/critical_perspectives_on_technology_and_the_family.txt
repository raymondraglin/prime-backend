ABOUT THE BOOK

                                     "If you aren't in over your head, how do you know how tall you are?"

                                       T.S. Eliot

To be honest, this wasn't an easy book to write. I blame my students. (jk )

Let's face it. Technology and families is a really broad topic. Even when we refine "technology" to mean
information and communications technology (ICT), and accept that investigations into it are only two to
three decades old, the topic along with the technology itself is expansive and always evolving. This book was
written to accompany a course I designed in 2017 for the University of Minnesota; a course that filled a
knowledge and practice gap of future professionals. I created that course and now write its text with the
knowledge that learners are/would be a) individuals and citizens, b) in families and have meaningful
relationships, and c) practitioners (probably), researchers (possibly) and/or leaders in some type of human
service on graduation, so I felt it was important to cover topics that would inform each of these paths.

Layout of the chapters

The figure below illustrates relationships among the book's chapters. After Chapter 1, an overview of our use
of technology, we move to perspectives on the family (2) and family differences in technology use (3), then to
specific components of couples (4), children and youth (5), parents (6), parents and children (7), and family
connectivity (8), then to applications in families' everyday lives: work & family (9), and health and financial
interests (10). Also at the community level are the family professionals who provide services to families
through education, therapy, and more (11). At the widest level is policy (12), which intersects all levels.

Chapter contents

Each chapter offers:
   Content, with chapter Insights, or key takeaways.
   References for everything cited in the chapter.
   Learning activities that promote critical thinking.
   Blog prompts. The course this course was built around included critical thought blogging. In our
      digital worlds, it's important that professionals be able to write online thoughtfully and with technical
      precision; to have a point and be able to back it up. More about this is offered in the next section on
      Teaching the book.
   Additional reading and resources. More ways for readers to explore topics beyond the minimal
      treatment the book allows. There are readings, videos, news links and more.
4 | ABOUT THE BOOK

The back of the book features a non-exhaustive list of additional books, websites, bloggers, journals that
publish at the intersection of human development/family life and information and communications
technology, and other related content. I've also included the oft-cited 50 Classroom Assessment Techniques
from Angelo and Cross. These are fabulous tools on which to construct tailored activities for learning.

In addition to the content, then, I provide additional ways to understand it. Reading to learn isn't enough; we
need to experience topics in multiple ways, connect them to our interests and what motivates us, to make
them stick. (See "Teaching the book" section that follows ).

and social conditions (e.g., interest, inquisitiveness, Halpern, 1998; p. 58). 1.

Turning to the book's central focus, is Mike Ribble's (2015) reflective framework for teaching digital
citizenship:

 Awareness: Being aware of technology use and its appropriate use (critical and reflective
   thinking).Students are asked to reflect on their technology use at home and at school.

 Guided practice: Classroom active learning and out-of-class activities for exploration.
 Modeling and demonstrating: Instructor use of Creative Commons licensed material, competence

 Feedback and analysis: Deliberation and debrief, feedback on student writing, commenting on

Chapter content and flow:

 Text summarizing key content, research and practice. As noted in the About the Book section, the flow
   of content aligns with an ecological perspective of family life. It also reflects the delivery of content over
   an academic semester. Chapters 1-3 as introductory and foundational, chapters 4-10 as individual and
   family specific content, and chapters 11 and 12 and wider field and societal applications. While some
   content can be covered in a single week, longer chapters such as chapter 5 can take at least two weeks
   during a semester. Depth of coverage and complementary materials for reading are up to the instructor's
   discretion.

 Complete references are included so that university libraries' online catalog can be linked and readers
   can go to original sources if desired.

 Learning activities include those I created and used in the FSOS 3105 course and many others written
   expressly for this volume. They include individual, small group and whole class exercises, which can be
   used in higher education and other adult learning settings. Rather than take attendance, I used activity
   participation as a measure of engagement.

 Blog prompts encourage both critical writing for online presence and perspective on issues. Too often,
   IMHO, young adults offer stream of consciousness in online writing and leave the technical for
   academic papers that may never see the light of day. For some blogging is a way to not only share one's
   professional voice and perspective, but also as a career outlet. 2. The blog prompts also make for
   interesting conversation, and can be used to prompt podcast or YouTube channel discussions.

The additional readings at the end of each chapter are a mere path to the wide wide world of evolving

knowledge on these issues. Thought leaders, organizations like Commonsense Media, Pew research and the 5
Rights Foundation frequently have updated material. From semester to semester, new material was added
from posts I saw on social media.

In FSOS 3105, in addition to blog posts, activity participation, and exams for assessment, students
prepared an analysis of their technology use. They logged use for a 24 hour period, then provided a
summary of the data and a paper analyzing observations of their use, impacts on their relationships, and ways
the exercise inspired their future work as professionals. A copy of the assignment given to students is
available here .

Learning through community

In my 40 odd years of teaching and observing what "sticks," I've leaned in to Dr. James Comer's words that,

"No significant learning can occur without a significant relationship." It is a practice applied to the FSOS

3105 Families and Technology course with great success, based on student feedback, performance,

engagement and observation.

Through relationships and feeling part of a              I've learned to lean into Dr. James

sense of trust, they begin to open to the perspectives

of others; their own perspectives shift, and their understanding deepens. They gain empathy for others' view

points. They may want to take action -- for themselves, for others. And they deploy content knowledge that

otherwise can seem unrelated to their lives. There is good learning theory behind this (e.g., Lave & Wenger,

1991; Mezirow, 1990; Wenger, 1999) and clear connection to critical thinking.

As evidence somewhat of the importance of relationships for learning critical thinking skills related to
technology and the family, in spring 2022 the fabulous Samantha LeBoeuf (my Teaching Assistant at the
time) and I analyzed student responses to the end-of-course question: How did relationships, if at all,
influence your learning in this course? (Walker & LeBoeuf, 2022). Again validating the ecologies that inform
our lives, students offered three relationship types, each with unique influence:

 Family and friends: Discussion of topics in the course made the content more relatable. As one
   student said,"applying theories and technology to my life is how I learned better; if I can apply something to
   my life then I think I will be able to apply it to other families."

 Classroom peers: The shared experience of learning the same content, together and for a common
   purpose, bonded students in their discussions. One student shared, "[My group] has influenced my
8 | ABOUT TEACHING FOR CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON TECHNOLOGY AND THE FAMILY

      learning in this course. I believe that not only did our ideas for group discussion come from what we learned
      in class but also how we related to the topic. As a result, it was really fun to hear about all of our ideas and
      how [they] related to our personal lives, which made the course even more meaningful."
   Instructor and TA: These set the tone for community and for shared learning as a class. In so doing,
      they encouraged each student to feel valued and heard. "[The instructor] made everyone always feel
      included and that made me personally want to be there in class."

The graphic below reveals these relationships and summarizes processes that foster learning through
relationships.

There are MANY ways to accomplish these learning relationships to foster critical thinking. The flow of
content in this book, and the occasional questions and blog prompts and learning activities, all aim to do this.

diffusion, b) respecting and encouraging all voices, c)

attunement, and d) humor. In formal education there

is a clear power dynamic through the conferring of grades and the hierarchy of academia. Students begin to

see themselves valued only as numbers -- their student number, their GPA, their last score on an exam. This

depersonalization does not encourage them to "see themselves" in the material. So even before a course

begins, my messaging, my video greeting, and then my classroom climate are all aimed toward equity. Students

are called by their first names, we make eye contact, celebrate birthdays, and laugh. A lot. Often at me. I look
ABOUT TEACHING FOR CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON TECHNOLOGY AND THE FAMILY | 9

at posts like this one in Edutopia to find even more ways to build community. As I do as a parent, I also try to
attune myself with the class (some call it "reading the room") and pick up energies -- sometimes addressing
events, oftentimes tuning into student mental health (during the course of the first five years, the Parkland
shooting, George Floyd and Philando Castile murders in the area, January 6 insurgency and of course
COVID-19 occurred). That might mean spending more time discussing a particular topic or event, or
clarifying key points when I sense that students are not feeling prepared for an upcoming exam. I'm well
aware of my age; I use my geezer experiences in teaching, and encourage discussion by using the age difference
to ask what things are like for young adults. I'm also well aware of my position of power, and always default to
communication and compassion. And my personal "brand" is humor. I post funny videos, pictures of my

 dog, and ask students to tell stupid jokes.

with his slightly geeky, IT-forward nature, was an
inspiration to me by having lots of tech around the house
and nudging me into using it and loving it. My daughter,
Alice, honestly motivated my bridge from tech as a teacher,
to technology in parenting and family life education. When
I witnessed her capable use of multiple devices at age 14, I
imagined our profession with a generation of tech-savvy
parents who had expectations for what and how we taught.
This book, and my interest in this topic, would not have
existed without these two, my constants, who continually
fed my curiosity. And Audrey, my pug, has been my
velcroed companion for the last 16 years and has provided Susan and Audrey
emotional support during my adventures.

I also thank the most amazing Samantha Daddi, George Schorse, and Sahar Khanpoor, who assisted me
with finding resources for the book. As former 3105 students and young adult tech users, they also provided
tremendous insight. Thanks too to Samantha LeBoeuf, Seonghee Hong, and Becca Leaf, who served as
TAs for 3105; to Xiaoran Sun, who shadowed, supported, and strengthened my final semester in the
classroom and who is most capably taking 3105 forward; and to the incredible women and men who, as
graduate and undergraduate students, assisted me in years of research to help me better understand this topic
(with special shout out to Tatiana Jara Pacheco and Bosco Cheng).

Buckets of appreciation as well to Shane Nackerud and Emily McLoughlin with the UMN Libraries, and
to Sue Everson, who helped copy edit my many many words.

Applause to those who gave me opportunities to dig in to this topic over the last decade or so.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR (OR, THE PAYOFF FOR
PAYING ATTENTION)

Rather than post a CV 1 or biosketch, I share the journey that brought me to writing this book. It brings
truth to Mary Oliver's words:

"Pay attention. Be astonished. Tell about it!"

From post-college at 24 in 1979 through the early 1990s, I was a practitioner in service to families -- first
in the public health realm after completing a Masters in Nutrition (Penn State University), then much later in
the field of parenting and family life. I had the honor of working with a wide range of families -- most of
them living in poverty and on public assistance -- in a variety of government, non-profit, education, and
industry environments, and seeing how internal and external systems played out to affect family well-being.

EFNEP report authored by Susan in                        For the next 15 years or so, I capitalized on my doctoral training (PhD
1983 for Michigan State University                       in Child and Family Studies, UW-Madison), and in my academic
                                                         positions worked to create systems of change on behalf of
                                                         families. Through Cooperative Extension in Wisconsin and then in
                                                         Maryland, I developed community-based tools for assessing supports
                                                         for school readiness, community-peer leader training in parenting,
                                                         child care provider training systems, and policy tools for assessing
                                                         child care policy and equity during the era of welfare reform. A move
                                                         to Minnesota and the UMN in 2007 gifted me with immersion in
                                                         Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE), and with oversight of the
                                                         graduate program that prepared licensed parenting educators to work
                                                         in school districts delivering ECFE programs. With ECFE, I created
                                                         an evaluation tool that could assess parenting and child development
                                                         outcomes, and could mobilize advocacy for statewide program
                                                         support. While the goals of each effort were admirable, program

success only occurred through coordinated, committed action across the policy-practice and research
spectrum (meaning that I saw cracks in the system).

Along the way, I also found my passion as a teacher. With undergraduate instruction firmly a part of my
academic role in 2002 -- and continuing for the next 20 years -- I honed my teaching skills and, more
importantly, developed an understanding of contexts and methods that promote engagement and learning in
an ever-diversified body of students.

Meanwhile, technology crept into my professional and personal
world. When my dean at Maryland wanted courses to go online in
2005, I volunteered my own. It seemed a great way to make courses
more accessible, as our community college peers had been doing for
decades. This experience aligned well in my new role teaching
teaching in the UMN Parent and Family Ed program (teachers
license, Masters of Education) in 2007. Ours was the first online
masters program for my college at a time when university policy
hadn't quite grasped the online world. It also facilitated our global
outreach and a significant collaboration with the University of
Iceland.

 In 2007 I observed my own daughter, then 14, capably using multiple      the author in her Halloween
                                                                          sweater shared with online and in
devices and apps to connect with her friends. Like a bolt of              person classes
lightning my two worlds collided. It struck me that, in ten short years,
her generation would be parents coming to parenting education with

a whole new set of expectations for learning. I began researching parents' technology use, and the ways

ICT was used by educators who worked with parents. On the latter I discovered that while the big E

world of Education was having fun with all this new technology, our own field of parenting education was

not. I leaned heavily on groups like AERA and ISTE and on my learning tech colleagues at UMN to inform

our family educator world. Seeing colleagues join this new area of study, including my early collaborator Jodi

Dworkin and many of her PhD students, I re-constructed the Families and Technology Focus Group at the

National Council on Family Relations (NCFR) as a

place to share resources and ideas and a new professional

identity.

                                                           Loren Terveen, from Computer Science at the UMN,
                                                           connected with me in 2012 on creating technology for
                                                           ECFE, and with funding from the National Science
                                                           Foundation and cooperation with the St Paul School
District, Parentopia was born. ECFE families told us they didn't need another content-based platform for

information about parenting; they wanted a place to connect between meetings. The development, research,
and implementation of Parentopia became my passion for the next ten years. Through it I discovered the
power of collaborative technology for parents, and that innovation is less about creating it than helping
people access it and know how to use it. This is true not just for parents, but for the professionals who work
with them as well. When the United Nations invited me to write a background paper on digital technologies
the family, and parenting education in 2021, I had LOTS to say.

Enter FSOS 3105 and this book. As a member of the faculty I asserted (OK, shouted) the need for our
undergraduate students to be prepared for professional and personal life in a digital universe.
Naturally that meant I be the one to create such a course and teach it. And so, in 2017, we launched
Technology and the Family, FSOS 3105 to the first semester of plucky students. Five years and 10
semesters later, after teaching the course, and learning a ton from my students, I present the textbook. A
dynamic, online, accessible, free text; one that reflects the many many principles and realities about family life,
about teaching and learning, and about technology and global change that I've witnessed across my career and
continue to explore through the most amazing connections.

                  Thank you for joining me! I hope you're astonished!

   Chapter Insights

           Although our use of the internet is just 30 years old, and seemingly ubiquitous devices like
             smartphones have been around for less than 20 years, observations about digital media and
             "technology" offer us a foundation of basic "truths" with which to dig deeper.

           Although we may use the shorthand term "technology" to refer to information and
             communications technology (ICT), we must be cautious. "Technology" is a general term, and
             we have various, more specific ways to talk about ICT.

           The ICT devices and applications we use help fulfill a range of functions for us as individuals
             and as families.

           Because research on technology is relatively new, and technology innovations continue to
             develop, using research findings to craft clear guidelines on use is a challenge. Current
             research has significant limitations in scope, sampling, methodologies, and more. Technology
             innovations do, however, mean new ways to gather and analyze data.

           An ecological perspective enables us to see our ICT use not just in terms of individuals, but as
             having an impact on and being impacted by our contexts and social connections, and by
             wider forces such as institutional policies, research, and industry.

           To date, we can identify a great number of benefits to individuals, families, and societies in
             the US and internationally from ICT use. At the same time, we have learned that ICT presents
             significant challenges to our relationships, communication, development, learning, and work.

           Equitable access to the internet, to devices and to the development of skills for using ICT, is a
20 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

             significant factor influencing differences in how technology is used.
           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for

             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Introduction

When I went to college in the mid-1970s, the weekly call to my parents meant waiting in line to use the pay
phone in the dormitory hallway. It was a collect call, meaning I'd go through an operator who would ask the
person who picked up if they'd accept the charges. Or I could write a letter. Registering for courses meant
long lines and a half day in the gymnasium, going from table to table to get a form signed by the department
(IF there was room in the course; if not the search continued in another line). For classes, we sat in lecture
halls taking notes with pen and paper. Professors lectured at a podium, using a chalkboard and the occasional
overhead projector.

  Tests were ONLY taken in the classroom. Books were hard copies, purchased at the bookstore. Term papers
  were written by hand or on a manual typewriter. And doing research for those papers meant finding books
  using a card catalog, and articles in large, published volumes of the journals, hidden away in the "stacks.". The
  only way to communicate with professors was to wait outside their offices during weekly "office hours." Pizza
  was ordered over the phone (though delivery was possible), and when Saturday Night Live (SNL) was on,
  we'd jockey for floor space to view the TV in the dormitory common room.
  Consider your college experience today. Everything just described can feasibly be done on your smartphone
  and you'd never need to leave your bedroom. Remember Covid-19 1? (Of course you do). The internet 2and
  ICT enabled us to continue participating in life, even under quarantine. Today you can call, text,
  videoconference, or email your parents anytime (and they you). Textbooks (while often still available in hard
  copy) may be offered as e-versions, purchasing can be done online, and many can be rented. Class registration
  and course planning, ordering pizza, finding journals, and taking notes for the term paper? Online. Platforms
  like Google Docs make collaborative note taking or group work efficient (this book was written on Google
  Docs so I could share it with the folks helping me publish it). Missed SNL? You can stream it on demand.

creativity and productivity. The United Nations,

Division of Economic and Social Affairs identified

technological change as one of four megatrends affecting

families (along with urbanization, migration and climate

change). As we will explore throughout this book, while

we have gained much, there is so much more we need to know. We are still in the infancy of understanding

ICT's capabilities -- and its dangers. The rapid rise in technology development makes it difficult to turn

around usable research results. By the time all the necessary protocols are followed, data collected and

analyzed, and reports prepared for public, professional and policy consideration, the device or application

studied may be outmoded. Research has revealed a great deal about who uses which types of technologies for

which purposes under which conditions, we have an initial sense of impact (as you'll read in this book), and

scholars are learning both new questions and new methodologies. The Screenome Project, for example,

enables researchers to analyze the realities of smartphone use through thousands of screen captures (Brinberg,

et al., 2021). But while new technologies for information and communication are being developed, and our

consumption and use alone and together offer fodder for research, the many unanswered questions put us in

pioneer territory.

And undeniably, our use of devices like smartphones can raise a few eyebrows:

                                                  technology has shifted the ways in which we relate
                                                  as a society.

                                                  And questions of culpability arise when behaviors

                                                  once contained by place move to virtual spaces. In

                                                  the early 2000s, before university policies had

                                                  evolved to address virtual learning, I encountered an

                                                  issue while teaching online before . For weeks, a

                                                  student posted erratically in discussion forums,

                                                  creating havoc in student discourse and learning,

                                                  with behavior that stole focus from the content of

                                                  the course. In a traditional classroom, I could talk to

                                                  the student privately, even barring them from

                                                  returning to the classroom while they were being

                                                  disruptive. Yet back then, barring a student from

Used with permission                              the learning management system (LMS) used to

                                                  access to all course materials. After many hours of

discussions with university policy makers unfamiliar with how online learning operated, a timely yet equitable

workaround was reached. By then, the offending student understood their disruptions and class continued in

peace. The upside is that the event triggered the need to develop new policies for a new environment and new

mechanisms for student learning and instruction.

Similarly, in response to issues with e-commerce, security breaches, identity thefts, and children's exposure to
the internet, new policies and laws have been created. This book was written for the spaces of our use between
innovation, eager consumption, earnest research, and policy action and sound practice, spaces that call on us
to be both educated and intentional about our use of technology. Particularly for families who bear the
significant responsibility of caring for their members -- in many cases raising children to adulthood -- and
thriving as a unit, ICT offers tremendous value yet at a significant level of understanding.

To set the stage for our close examination of technology use and the family, we begin with a set of "truths"
about information and communications technology.

The internet

Within our broad sense of ICT is the "internet," Per

wikipedia, "the global system of interconnected

computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite  To stay current on the language and

(TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and             terms used to describe ICT, see this

services, most prominently the World Wide Web,

including social media, electronic mail, mobile

applications, multiplayer online games, internet

telephony, file sharing, and streaming media services. Most servers that provide these services are today hosted

in data centers, and content is often accessed through high-performance content delivery networks." The

internet is the virtual environment in which information (as data) is gathered, shared, and engaged with. Two

common aspects of the internet are the World Wide Web and, within that, social media.

The World Wide Web (WWW)

  Elements of a URL (uniform resource locator). Credit: RubenAyla.blogspot.com

  When we "go online" we generally mean that we're connecting to the World Wide Web4, or to a website
  which is a compilation of web pages. The web is "is an information system enabling documents and other
  web resources to be accessed over the Internet.... Documents and downloadable media are made available to
  the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and
  resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource
  locators (URLs), as shown above. The character string https://www.wikipedia.org is an example of a URL.
  Breaking down the web address, http:// or https:// refers to the communication protocol used for the

  information's transmission. The "s" indicates when secure information, such as passwords or identifiers, is
  being shared. The domain is the hostname (which includes the www, though it often isn't shown). Host
  server domain names are controlled by ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
  Numbers). *.com, *.net, *.edu, and country-level identifiers (e.g., *.en, *.us, *ie) refer to top-level domain
  names.

 Social media

  Social media, or social networking services (SNS), "is an online platform which people use to build social
  networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career content, interests,
  activities, backgrounds, or real-life connections.... Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, digital
  photos, videos, and posts, and inform others about online or real-world activities and events with people
  within their social network. While in-person social networking -- such as gathering in a village market to talk
  about events -- has existed since the earliest development of towns, the web enables people to connect with
  others who live in different locations across the globe (dependent on access to an internet connection to do
  so)."

  Social media scholars have leaned on the functionality of the internet application, such as for self-presentation
  to broad or narrow audiences (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2020, Fig, 2, below). By Carr and Hayes' (2015)
  definition, Facebook, LinkedIn, games like Farmville, and the dating app Tinder would be considered social
  media; collaborative platforms like Wikipedia5 and email, or a streaming platform like Netflix, would not be.
  Other scholars focus on identity as the central feature and purpose of social media -- the presentation of
  one's identity through social interaction and having an audience. Social media is also classified by the audience
  and functionality of its reach (Thelwall, 2009):

      socialization SNSs, used primarily for socializing with existing friends (e.g., Facebook, Instagram)
      online SNSs, decentralized and distributed computer networks where users communicate with each

        other through internet services
      networking SNSs, used primarily for non-social interpersonal communication (e.g., LinkedIn, a career-

        and employment-oriented site)
      social navigation SNSs, used primarily for helping users to find specific information or resources (e.g.,

        Goodreads for books, Reddit)

Classification of social media by social presence and self-presentation (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2020).

In his critical observation of the power of social media, Ian Bogost (2022) provides a useful history of its
evolution. Data on current use is also found in this report from Pew Research.

Applications

We also refer to the "apps" that we use on our devices -- downloading a new translation or mapping app
when we travel, or a new real estate app when we're looking for a new place to live. Or we upgrade current
apps or software on our laptops, such as word processing programs or the learning management system used
by our universities. "Apps," also called application programs or software applications, are "computer
program[s] designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer
itself, typically to be used by end-users.... The other principal classifications of software are system software,
relating to the operation of the computer, and utility software (`utilities'). Applications may be bundled with
the computer and its system software or published separately and may be coded as proprietary, open-source,
or projects." The software application on which you are reading this book is considered open-source -- it is
publicly accessible and its source code can be shared or modified.

As discussed in Truth #2, below, technology can also mean the range of devices we use to search and share
electronic information, and for communications. We commonly think of our smartphones, laptops, tablets,
and peripherals used along with their components (e.g, mice, monitors, speakers, microphones, headsets). But
there is a wide range of device possibilities and mobilities.
28 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

#2. Our use of technology means different devices to
accomplish different functions; or one device to
accomplish many functions.

Our use of the internet and smartphones may seem so

immediate that we can forget the purposes they serve for

us. Communication is an obvious function. Just as we         Try this exercise: take out your

entertainment. So while we might access multiple

applications on a single device like a laptop or

smartphone, that device might fulfill a wide range of functions for us.

In other cases, ICT can fill very specific functions. Photography purists may prefer a separate, handheld
camera to take pictures or video. A Virtual Reality headset, whether stand-alone or tethered to a personal
computer, allows the user to explore an alternative landscape. Even devices that have the capability to fulfill
multiple functions may be used for specific purposes. Ratliff (2014) reported that, although the smartphone
was the go-to device to fulfill a range of functions, multi-device users had a preference for devices depending
on function. The laptop was used to perform "work," the tablet for entertainment, and the smartphone
                                                                                                         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 29

largely for communication and social activity. (Personal note: the author was surprised to see a family member
interacting with their phone, with their laptop open, while watching a movie with other family members.
They reported the easy ability to multi-task and hold multiple foci, and agreed that each device held separate
functional values.)

Now consider the family, and the various devices and functions ICT provides. How might ICT help family
life? Let's translate the functions of technology into societal value, or standing in the way. What value would
technology provide to the family? What challenges might it present?

Some examples:

   Communication between parent and child through texting while away at college can maintain a
      relationship.

   Opening a phone while eating dinner might be an intrusion. For others, it might be a way of sharing
      valuable information.

   During COVID, parents used computers to continue their work, as children continued participation in
      school. Jointly, they used videoconferencing technology to maintain connections with extended family.

   A new parent may search for available, affordable, and quality child care for his infant twins.

Now think beyond the traditional family, or the family best known to you. Consider families you read about
in the news or relatives in distant countries. In the current conflict in Ukraine, for example, how might using
cell phones fulfill valuable functions for families in the country or who have immigrated? Would seeing
images of the destruction be useful or, for children using TikTok, create stress?

Understanding technology's range of functions, and our use of devices to fulfill those functions, can give us a
basic way of conceptualizing the processes that contribute to individual, family, and societal outcomes.

#3. Our use of technology has changed dramatically over
a short time.

Internet availability

At the beginning of the chapter, we discussed how technology and university life have changed in last 50
years. In fact, the efficiencies offered by ICT have really only existed since the web was introduced in 1991. As
the internet became available, the rates of people accessing it and using it increased rapidly. Pew reports that in
1994, 18% of people used the internet. In 2021, that percentage was 93%, ranging from 99% of those 18-29
years old to 75% of those 65 and older. As a different metric, the current population of persons using web
browsers is nearly 5 billion (4,878,428,571) -- 62% of the world's population. Web 2.0 technology moved us
30 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

from one-way communication in web pages and email to interactive, collaborative, social tools with blogs,
wikis, social networking, mobile/handheld devices, and more.

Shifts in behavior

As Lee and Cooper observe in Endgadget, since 2004

(the last 15-20 years), we've become able to:

 Hold the world in our hands via smartphones       The Endgadget article was produced

 Step into another world through Virtual Reality, and now Augmented Reality.

 See, listen, and play everything in seconds (through Netflix, Hulu and lots of other streaming services).

 Connect to everyone. Yes, social media like MySpace and Friendster existed before 2004, but it wasn't

until Facebook entered the marketplace in 2006 that things really took off.

 Create anything (as long as it is small and plastic) using 3D printers.

 Use an affordable, mobile option for computing and for reading, thanks to tablets and e-readers with

touchscreens.

 Speak, and have it done -- through voice-activated assistants and smart speakers, and also through smart

devices like doorbells, lights, and thermostats.

 Ask the world for patronage or support, with sites like Kickstarter making it easy to click a button and

collect/donate funds.

 Share everything, like cab rides through an app that finds a driver for you.

 Drive electric cars.

The rapid advancement of information and communications technology in the last 20 years has also
revolutionized our way of thinking and living. Beyond making life more efficient, the internet offers an
additional environment for interaction and engagement. We can operate IRL (in real life) and virtually. As
Alicia Blum-Ross describes it, the internet is like wallpaper; it always seems to be there. Our comfort with
access to information and people anytime, anywhere can leave us feeling bewildered (FOMO?) when we're
without service.
Visual Capitalist offers a slick graphic, below, of the history and rise in use of media. Early media, starting in
the 15th century and going through the end of the 20th century, includes telephones, newspaper, and
television. While these media can be used to spread information to the masses, they are also one-way, leaving
the power of the content in the hands of the creator. The second wave -- Connected Media -- spans from
2000 to 2020, with the inclusion of the smartphone. Media is now two-way, and engagement is everything.
Yet explosive use and easy access also means "fake news," censoring, and surveillance. The Data Media phase,
which we are now in, offers access to primary data sources for information and the ability to verify. However,
this can also mean "cherry picking" (selecting data to prove a point or to slant the narrative) and the
temptation to falsify data. Looking ahead, we will see more creative and constructive ways to use data, and
further de-centralization.
And there is much ahead. In 2021, reflecting on COVID-19, Brian Chen in the New York Times wrote
about augmented reality for our shopping experiences, which will allow us to try things on or see what things
look like in our homes before buying, and "hands-off" technology that will read our smartphones, making it
unnecessary to access payment apps. He joins the ranks of technology futurists who predict our lives in
decades, even just years to come.

                                                                 One aspect of information speed relates to news
events. The author was in Washington D.C. on September 11, 2001. We first heard about the planes crashing
into the towers, and then into the Pentagon, through radio and

television. For the rest of the day we were dependent on these sources -- and on constantly refreshed news
webpages -- to get updated information. The delivery of news was slow and controlled by others. We had less
personal involvement in it.

By 2013, the rapid spread of information from a news event -- a shooting at the Washington Navy Yard on
September 16 at 8:20 am-- prompted within 30 minutes a public response through Tweets, Reddit posts, live
video footage, "I'm fine" posts, crowdsourcing information to help with the investigation (quickly taken
down), and a Facebook memorial page. This isn't surprising to us today. Events are live-streamed; Philando
Castille's girlfriend, for example, posted a video on Facebook of his murder in 2016 as it happened. And when
events are anticipated -- like Hurricane Ida, which hit Louisiana in the fall of 2021, Facebook pages are set up
in advance so victims can indicate their status.

What does it mean to have the ability to engage and share information so quickly? Consider this from a
34 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

family perspective. What are the benefits? Might there be any consequences? When information spreads
quickly there can be mistakes, which can get in the way of professional reporting and can breed a certain
impatience. A colleague from Louisiana related that there was such an assumption that people would turn to
Facebook during the hurricane, that people ignored the likely scenario of internet service being unavailable
during the disaster.

Using social media data, new research is measuring the power of social connections on outcomes such as
economic success (Chetty et al., 2022). Researchers are employing social capital data from over 21 billion
Facebook "friendships" to determine social connectedness, social cohesion, and predictors of economic well-
being. An advantage to the rise and steady use of social media lies with the volumes of data that, as in this case,
can be used to infer social well-being. On the other hand, public sites like Facebook and Instagram are well-
known for leaking personal information and exposing users to security breaches. For this reason, numerous
sites provide recommendations on how to keep social media accounts safer (e.g., Kelly & Fowler, 2021).

#4. Our use of technology varies.

Although the numbers indicate that technology use is prolific, within that data individuals vary in their
access, use, skills, and attitudes. Consider the people you interact with regularly -- your family, friends; at
school, home, and work. It is very likely that you use social media apps differently than your parents, and that
your parents use technology for work differently than you use it for school and work. Your younger sibling
may be a "gamer," while you spend more time on your laptop writing papers for school. Your family home
may be outfitted with smart speakers; your apartment may be lucky to get a strong wifi signal. You may use a
multitude of devices, while your cousin in Ghana lives only on her smartphone.

It matters that we understand differences in use. As we'll

discuss in our next "truth," and more in Chapter 3,         Take a look at this interesting view of
because ICTs are used for communication, differences in     internet speeds around the world.
behavior can create disruptions in the flow of

communication, which can lead to conflict. Because

ICTs are used to find and share information, behavioral

differences can affect relationships if, for example, personal information about one person is shared by

another. And because people vary in their access to ICT, they vary in their ability to communicate, share and

find information, and benefit (or be negatively affected) from the functions ICT enables. We've observed

differences in technology use over time, and differences in which platforms are popular for social media use.

Demographics -- broad factors used to characterize individuals in a population -- are easy to access to
describe differences in technology use. The chart below, from the Pew Research Center, illustrates differences
in smartphone ownership and broadband use by age, race, education, income, and geography. Although
                                                                                                         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 35

overall numbers indicate that 85% of people have smartphones and 77% report broadband access at home,
there are differences by groups. Fewer older Americans, those with less education and income, and those
living in rural areas report both; more Whites than people of other races report broadband access.

And naturally, individuals don't exist by a single characteristic. Often there are correlations between
education and income; between education, income and geography; between race, education, income, and
geography. (APA, 2017) So if we read that Hispanic women are less likely to have internet access, is that
because they are Hispanic, or because they are likely to be in an income category that challenges their ability
to purchase internet? Or because they are likely they live in a rural area that doesn't provide high-speed
internet? Internet access isn't always tied to individual income; it is tied to economic infrastructures that
make internet service available.

It's also possible that lack of internet access is due to         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 37
preference. The Pew report observes that, while many of

Technology use also varies by preference, attitude, and comfort. We've observed that social media has become
more popular over the last decade among all age groups, though younger groups show the highest use, and
that platform preferences have shifted. YouTube and Instagram are frequented more than Pinterest and
Twitter. Consistent increases in social media use are also revealed across race, gender, education, income, and
geographic location (e.g., rural, suburban, urban). Use differs little by race and gender, but slightly more by
income and by education. Age differences may represent generational perspectives, which can reflect exposure
to trends and to events that shape attitudes. For example, this piece discusses differences in perspectives of
Millennials and Gen Z.

Within a group of "users," there are differences in behavior. Among Twitter account holders, there are clearly
high- and low-volume consumers (McClain, et al., 2021), and portion of the high-volume users account for
the majority of the content we read: "An analysis of tweets by this representative sample of U.S. adult Twitter
users from June 12 to Sept. 12, 2021, finds that the most active 25% of U.S. adults on Twitter by tweet
volume produced 97% of all tweets from these users." The report identifies differences in attitudes among
users by volume, with those posting often feeling their political views influenced and more likely to experience
harassment. Ironically, however, these users are less likely to view the atmosphere as a problem. We might
consider those high-volume Twitter posters as a "type," and we wouldn't be alone. A significant line of
research on internet and technology consumption analyzes the behavior and preferences of users (e.g., Blank,
& Groselj, 2014; Borg & Smith, 2018). Why would this be of interest?

#5. Variation in use and access can mean new sorts of
divides.

With the COVID-19 pandemic requiring children to stay home from school, significant divides in access to
technology had consequences on school attendance, participation, and learning. Even if schools loaned wifi
hubs, Chromebooks, or other devices that enabled children to attend school at a distance, their homes were
not necessarily equipped with internet access. Those families with devices may have had to share a single
screen. And if parents were working from home, priority may have gone to adult employment over children's
engagement in classes. In Chapter 3 we'll explore more about access differences in the U.S. and around the
world. As an example of global differences in technology access and children's learning, Ayllon et al (2021)
show high European Union country variation by households without access to a computer and households
without access to the internet during COVID-19.

Variations in access can also mean variations in "readiness." Those with less ability to use technology become
less skilled and comfortable and may develop attitudes that lean toward not using it, or not using particular
applications (think, for example, of a grandparent's interest in joining Instagram). In 2016 Pew identified a
"readiness gap: among internet users (Horrigan, 2016). As we can see in Figure 5, below, there are
                                                                                                         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 39

demographic differences in those who are "unprepared" and those who are "ready," with correlations once
again to income, education, and age.

Differences in access can also mean divides in who influences others' behavior. One example is political values
and voting behavior. This interactive chart reveals shifts in ideologically political values and partisanship from
1994 to 2017. We can correlate this shift with the growth in ICT availability and use of smartphones, which
made access to social media easier. And social media has the power to influence global politics, like the May
40 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

2022 presidential election in the Philippines. Politics isn't the only thing influencing those who actively use
social media; "Grandfluencers" on TikTok, for example, are attempting to shift our perceptions of aging.

#6. Our technology use
presents a paradox: as it offers
many benefits, it equally
poses challenges.

In 2005, Javenpaa and Lang's research on mobile
technology experiences identified eight paradoxes in use:

1. Empowerment / enslavement: our access to

information and others 24/7, yet exposure to those

we'd rather not see, and our access to functions,

which in turn encourages our availability.

2. Independence / dependence: use of our devices to

make life easier, yet creates a dependence on those

devices to make our lives easier.

3. Fulfills needs / creates needs: new technology          Used with permission @janashortal
    provides valuable functions, yet it creates costs and

needs for management.

4. Competence / incompetence: as people gain new skills in using technology, they also have another area

of life in which to feel competent / incompetent.

5. Planning / improvisation: devices make planning more efficient, yet some users put less effort into

planning, leaving it to an "app" and thus losing skills and leaning on improvisation.'

6. Engaging / disengaging: the ability to engage with others is enhanced, yet equal engagement across

exposure is impossible, which leaves some connections "disengaged" (see "phubbing").

7. Public / private: technology enables private communication, yet it increasingly enters the public

domain.

8. Illusion / disillusion: users believe that tech will make their lives easier, which is often true, yet they

also can experience disillusionment when it doesn't work as well as they'd hoped.

We'll see these paradoxes and others played out in the many examples and research findings offered in this
book. Future chapters will explore how technology can bring families together, while differences in use can
also threaten understanding and closeness, challenging feelings of connectedness. Technology can aid
children's creativity and learning, yet at the cost of introducing sedentary habits acquired through excessive
                                                                                                          1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 41

hours of screen time. It can offer adolescents opportunities to create important friendships, yet the public
nature of these conversations can have damaging effects. An episode of This Hidden Brain, for example,
features an interview with a young man who was accepted to a prestigious university. The university offered a
Facebook group for incoming freshmen to help them get acquainted and feel connected to others when
starting school. The group discussion included some rather "casual" language that encouraged users to be less
cautious with what was said. For the young man interviewed, this included some racial slurs. Because the
forum was moderated, admissions staff read and carefully considered the discussion, resulting in several of the
students being un-invited. Many have experienced harsh lessons like this -- though perhaps to lesser
consequence -- by taking advantage of the social media's connectivity benefits yet being reminded of the
public, shareable, and viewable nature of the words.

Here are just a few more benefits and complementary consequences of our lives online:

   Texting is an easy, mobile way to get and send information, YET the availability of our mobile phone
      numbers exposes us to "smishing" campaigns (AKA spam texts).

   Using smartphones is convenient, yet some phones can expose to unhealthy levels of radiation.
   Zoom is great for video conferencing with friends and family, for work, and for communication with

      professionals like doctors and therapists, yet over time, our energy gets drained from using this medium.
   Banking and shopping are incredibly convenient from the comfort of our couches, but essential

      information can be compromised, and we become a "data security" statistic.

#7. Our use of technology as individuals affects others;
others affect our technology use.

Our information and communications technology is often referred to as "personal" technology -- we use it as
individuals for individual purposes. Yet given that the internet is a system of networked servers that allow
users to easily share information, it is likely that our use can affect others, intentionally or unintentionally. We
might also think about the settings in which we use personal technology. If you've ever been annoyed by
someone having a loud conversation on their phone in a public place, you've been affected by another's
"personal" use. And if you stray from taking lecture notes on your laptop and start shopping on Amazon
during class, the students behind you may be distracted by your screen. If you find "spam" in your inbox, the
sender has influenced your technology experience.

In the next chapter, we'll look more closely at a model of human development that contextualizes the settings
and conditions in which human beings thrive as influences on their development. Urie Bronfenbrenner's
bioecological perspective of human development (1995) identifies development as the result of individual
biology in interaction with settings (including the people and events in them) over time. Those settings can be
42 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

both proximal and distal to us in location and interaction frequency. For example, those closest to us -- our
family and friends, people at our workplaces and our schools -- are those we interact with often. And it isn't
unusual for those settings to interact -- when our parents and teachers meet, or when we carry stress from the
workplace to our home-based relationships. And still wider or distal influences come from the institutions,
government policies, cultures, and societies we are part of. They have an indirect influence on us, often
through messages repeated by our nearby contacts. The model depicted below adapts Bronfenbrenner's
classic framework perspective to include subsystems of the family, including parents and children, and
contexts, including family service systems and government policies.

A neo-technological modification of this model by Navarro and Tudge (2022, discussed in Chapters 2 and 5)
proposes the internet as an environment for interaction parallel to real life. We can imagine how a teen's cyber
                                                                                                         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 43

harassment experiences might result in feelings of stress and anxiety that others offline (like her family or
friends at school) can see, respond to with support, or potentially exacerbate.

At a macro level, we appreciate the role that policies and regulations can have on our experiences with
technology. As previously noted, data from our time online is easily shared, and our privacy and security can
be compromised. One result is the creation of policies to protect users, particularly young ones. For example,
the 2020 California Children's Privacy Act provides more stringent protections than COPPA (Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act) related to notice and consent, children's rights, enforcement, and other items.
It is similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. On the other hand, whole
governments like China seize control of the internet to limit the extent to which individuals can post, and
what they can see. In other words, these government censor the internet.

#8. The effects of technology can seem out of our control.

China's censorship is a perfect example of how individuals can feel that the effects of technology are out of
their control. If we are limited in what we attempt to see and read, to post and participate in, we feel powerless
in our engagement and thus in the effects we experience. We learn how TikTok algorithms determine the
content we see. And news of the ways in which our data is not private when we interact with ICT can leave us
feeling powerless. Recent examples include data tracking from baby monitors, Facebook revealing data on
those seeking an abortion, and data pulled from a phone that led to a priest's resignation. Tufecki (2019)
warns that algorithms and analysis from network data provide inferences about many things that are never
disclosed, including individuals' sexual orientation and moods. She notes that apps as innocuous as those for
weather updates were found to sell users' location data, which was used to make inferences ("What were you
doing at a cancer clinic?").

Related to our list of paradoxes, above, although we can love using technology we can also feel addicted to it.
Every semester students in FSOS 3105 are asked if they feel addicted to their smartphones. Here are the results
from fall 2021 (which are quite similar to those from other semesters between 2017 and 2022).
44 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

Yet is our addiction the result of our own conscious behavior? As Tiku observes, ICT is programmed in ways
that keep us interested and glued to it, generating FOMO (the fear of missing out). These methods include
push notifications, pull-to-refresh, infinite scroll, autoplay, bright colors, streaks (or short-term goals), and
gamification using points, a leaderboard, and rewards. Atler (2017) also investigates how applications are
programmed to keep our attention, and observes that our attention span has decreased an average of 8
seconds since the introduction of iPhones. The website VirtualCapitalist.com identifies 33 ways that media
can be a problem for its users.
With these industry-created, subconscious methods of encouraging us to keep using technology, and our data
being used in ways we aren't aware of (despite the prevalence of pop-ups on websites asking us to "agree" on a
privacy policy or use of cookies), it can feel like we're powerless. In large part, awareness can help (see Truth
#10), as can action to keep our technology use limited and intentional. And we can advocate for stricter
protections from the very people we pay to make our lives easier, and from our governments.

#9a. We are in the very early stages of understanding
information technology's impacts on us as individuals and
as a society.

#9b. Continual innovation in ICT will challenge our ability
to do research that informs practice and policy.

During COVID-19, our initial months of quarantine were our best protection from the virus. We waited for
a vaccine to protect us from contracting the disease. This meant waiting for the testing and approvals through
the Food and Drug Administration. Even "fast-tracked," this process involves panels of experts reviewing
research that shows evidence of product development and testing, clinical trials, testing for side effects,
                                                                                                         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 45

effectiveness, and large-scale success. Part of that review is ensuring that the research was rigorous and
followed a strict protocol, with conditions controlled so as not to introduce any confounding variables that
would pose alternative explanations for the findings.

In the case of ICT, in most cases there isn't a treatment to eradicate a problem (though its applications can
facilitate treatment). Instead, there is a range of products, including the internet as a virtual environment for
information and communication interaction. Still, as with any product we use, we want to know that it is
both safe and effective. Product testing of devices such as smartphones for radiation exists. Yet when it comes
to the effects of using the products for communication, information gathering, sharing, and creating uses,
and to our questions about their effectiveness and impact on aspects of human development, learning, and
family life, we have moved to other realms of "knowing." There are many ways of "knowing." Jhangiani et al.,
in Research Methods in Psychology, identify these five:

   Intuition, or our "gut" response to an experience,
   Authority, or relying on the words of another, authoritative guide,
   Rationalism, or applying reason and logic to understanding a phenomenon,
   Empiricism, or making an observation from experience, and
   The Scientific Method, or "the process of systematically collecting and evaluating evidence to test ideas

      and answer questions."

Consider what you "know" about the safety and effectiveness of using a smartphone. Or what we "know"
about teenagers feeling depressed from scrolling Instagram. And how we know it. Is our knowledge based on
personal experience or observations, or from reading a compilation of research findings? Did the research
include users like YOU? Was the research on adolescents short-term, measuring depression at a single point in
time, or did it follow them to see if the symptoms changed?

The challenge with the relative novelty of information and communications technology is that we're still in
the early stages of using the devices and applications. And with major events like COVID-19, we're using
them under ever-changing circumstances. As Martha Pickerell observed in 2015, and which still rings true to
an extent,

      There is no reliable evidence yet of long-term risks from overexposure to screens. The current guidelines for kids' use
      of screen media are based on decades of research into kids' TV habits and the related outcomes: poorer performance
      in reading and language arts, lower attention span, and higher risk of obesity among kids who watched excessively.

We have more research on the effect of screen exposure -- both the quality of exposure and the quantity of
time -- on children at different ages in different sets of conditions, but it's not longitudinal, and doesn't have
the volume of the research on TV viewing, which had a good 40-50 years before the advent of personal
computers, tablets, and mobile devices.
46 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

Look at the two images below, of children viewing a television (left) and a computer (right). Can we apply
what we know about television viewing to our use of modern ICT? Think about the differences between
viewing a TV screen and interacting with a computer; one with internet access and that runs a range of
software. Would research on their impacts by the same? How would it be different? Changes in television --
in size, color display, and content offerings -- haven't been at the speed of changes in our mobile devices,
applications, algorithms, and internet capabilities. The research-to-publication pipeline moves relatively
slowly for all the points of rigor along the way. Yet in that time, what we use and how we use it can change
dramatically. Colleagues of the author gathered data on parents' interactions on discussion forums, which
became outmoded when social media took over.

#10. Our "intentional" use is a way for ICT to be both safe
and effective for us and in our responsibility to others.

While we may be the guinea pigs in using ICT, and subject to the ongoing findings of researchers, we accept
that our use brings certain benefits and that we will remain open to understanding the risks. Parents report
that it's harder to parent today than ever before, and technology is the reason cited by most (Auxier et al.,
2020). Yet they don't forbid their children, or themselves, from using it. They practice ways of knowing,
whether through observation and action, trusting an authority figure, or open conversation with their
children. danah boyd, ICT pioneer, philosopher, and parent (Tippet, 2017), remarked:

      I think that it's a tool. It's a vice for some. It's a way of connecting. There's all of these different layers to it. And
      we've had to think about how to be responsible in relationship to anything. If you think about it in terms of
      ancient religious texts, you think about gluttony, think about what is our relationship to food. We agree that
      food is a necessity, but what's the level in which it's acceptable? ... Like all of these other stimuli, though, we
                                                                                                         1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY | 47

      should step back and say, hey, what is the relationship I want to have with people, with food, with
      substances, with the internet, with my environment? And that's where I do think that there's a spiritual
      ask to all of this.

The idea of intentionality can seem very hard, particularly for Millennials and Generation Z'ers, who grew up
with the internet, mobile devices, and social media. Yet we are all becoming aware of our reliance on
smartphones -- and of their possible impact on our personal, in-person conversations, of the feelings of being
addicted to them, and of how we respond to the discomfort of feeling bored or impatient by giving in to the
impulse to check for messages or scroll for updates.

We can practice what Michelle Drouin calls "social economizing," making active decisions about how we
want to spend our time -- alone, with others, on technology or not -- and taking steps to realize our
intentions. And we can check our security settings on streaming devices to reduce tracking when we watch
Euphoria or the Bachelorette.

This is where family professionals come in. Not only are they researching technology's effects, but those on
the front lines as educators and service providers help families get the information they need to make
informed decisions -- the reason for this book) And information about technology is best consumed with a
critical eye -- another reason for this book. As mentioned earlier, while our use can seem personal, it can have
clear impacts on others. We can enjoy a new app, yet realize that it's sharing personal data in a way we find
objectionable. Our use must be ethical and responsible, and seeing the complexity of our technology use as
individuals, as family members, as professionals, and as a global society is key.

We can challenge technology innovators to be wise to the intended and unintended effects of their products.
In her On Tech column in the New York Times, Shira Ovide cautioned against building new tech like
augmented reality. While such technology can seem like a fun way to experience new places and adventures,
we must consider other uses and pre-consider the possible risks. She asked about AR (augmented reality):

      What do we want from the next generation of immersive internet for our kids? Do we want to drive while our
      headgear flings tweets into our fields of vision? Do we even want to erase the gap between digital life and real
      life?

When we think about the future -- and think beyond     For a recent discussion of how the
ourselves to our near and far communities -- our       Amish use ICT, take a look at this
technology use can become part of the common good.     article from Wired magazine.
Several years ago, Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired
magazine, described the Amish community's interest in
ICT. Well-known for their religious practices, which
48 | 1.1 TEN TRUTHS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

shun the use of electricity and other technologies, the Amish did not immediately dismiss the notion of cell
phones. Rather, they deployed several of their younger members to use the phones for several weeks to test
their purpose and the value they'd bring to the group. Their interest was to identify any potential value for the
community.

Our awareness of technology's impact and use by families begins with our careful reflection on the ways in
which we use technology in our own lives, how it affects our relationships and communication, how it
enhances and detracts, and what it might mean in the future. This is a big ask -- and I appreciate your joining
me on this journey.

1.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     A day (or more) without technology

     Challenge yourself to put aside your phone, shut off your laptop, and ignore TikTok, Instagram, and
     Netflix. Zero technology for a full 24-hour period. If you need to, let your friends and family know
     you'll be off the grid. Go about your day and observe how you manage the various functions for
     which you use technology: navigation (e.g., maps), communication (e.g., texting), entertainment.
     How does it feel? Check your reactions periodically. Does it seem to get easier? Does your
     experience with life change? Do you feel in a bit of a panic at times? Use the experience to
     understand the role technology plays in your life and, at the end of it, whether you'd make any
     changes.

     Debate: Technology and the college learning experience

     The use of laptops, tablets, and smartphones in college classrooms has become the norm. Classes
     are increasingly being delivered via video conferencing, especially during the COVID pandemic. The
     use of technology has many benefits to learning, yet there are also potential drawbacks. There are
     faculty who strongly oppose laptops in the classroom.
     Assume your university is proposing a ban on using laptops in a classroom. Divide into groups: YES
     (those agreeing with the ban) and NO (those opposing), and prepare points supporting your
                                                                                                                      1.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 53

stance. After sharing the main points on both sides, discuss what you've learned. Using the graphic
below, with one side PRO and the other side CON, reflect on the use of laptops

      as individuals (pro/con).
      as groups (pro/con) -- our use of technology is not inherently personal.
      as member of society -- our use of technology is controlled and influenced by forces beyond

        us, including our households, our communities, our universities and employers, the larger
        society.
      What is the answer with regard to personal responsibility for our community's technology
        use?
      With regard to technology in general, what recommendations do you have as a class for its
        safe and effective use?
54 | 1.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Measuring technology use

     With a group of at least four people, discuss how you individually use technology. Identify the
     types of devices you own/use, the applications you use, the functions they serve for you, the
     people you connect with, and the ways in which you use ICT during a week.

         1. Create a list of functions ICT provides to you. Match up the devices and applications that
             fulfill these functions.

         2. Observe the ways that you as individuals vary in your use -- the number and type of
             devices, frequency of use, comfort with use, functions or purposes, and so on.

         3. As a group, design an instrument that would assess differences in technology use. What
             would you measure? How would you measure it?

     The power of social media

     This video is from the January 6 House Committee testimony of Stephen Ayres, given on July 12,
     2022. Ayres protested at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, believing that the election had been stolen:
     https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/07/12/us/jan-6-hearing-today-trump/29866d4b-
     e590-5573-b39a-535cf7f75f7c?smid=url-share
     As you watch, you can see how Mr Ayres' was influenced by what he read on social media, only
     later deciding to "do his own research" to understand the realities of the 2020 presidential election.
     What is your reaction to watching this video? How might you convince someone like Stephen
     Ayres to expand his sources of information beyond what he reads on social media?

Your relationship with technology

Each of us spends many hours each day with our phones, laptops, the internet, streaming services,
social media, and more. You might say that we spend more time with technology each day than we
do with any human being. And even if we don't interact with technology, the fact that we carry our
phones with us means that technology is "always with us." Reflect on your use of technology over
the day, and on your connection, interaction, and even intimacy with it. We are, in effect, in a
relationship with our technology.

Reflect on that relationship as though it was with a person. Is it a relationship that makes you
happy? It is one that you feel dependent on? One that might be jealous if you also spend time with
humans in real life, with nature, with a book? Is it a relationship that you feel you might be losing
some control with? Or is it clearly a consensual, co-dependent, cooperative relationship?

Maybe write a letter to technology, expressing how you feel about it.

Being Good Ancestors

Jonas Salk, pioneer of the polio vaccine, stated that the most important thing we can do is to be
good ancestors. He refers to intentional actions that are forward thinking, and to preparing a world
for future generations. One element that surrounds us is `smart cities.' Thinking about the
inevitability of technology innovation, if we want to be good ancestors, what do you think
information and communications technology should do? Or not do? How can it be safe? For
individuals and for society? Develop a list of recommendations for ICT innovators that look ahead to
future families and individuals.

     Listen to Lindy West's This American Life podcast segment on trolls ("If you don't have anything
     nice to say..."). What is it about posting online that allows individuals to feel comfortable with being
     rude and hurtful to others? Jimmy Kimmel has a popular segment on his late night show featuring
     celebrities reading the "mean tweets" they receive. Reflect on your own experience with social
     media.What is your reaction to Lindy West's story about the pain she felt when an anonymous
     person trashed her father's memory through online comments? Most of us don't have the
     opportunity to interact one-on-one with online trolls to the point that they come to understand
     their actions and apologize. What should we do when we receive negative comments from those
     who don't know us and use a fictitious identity? Do we turn away from social media altogether? Do
     we ignore it? Do we respond in some way?

     During emergencies and other events (like weather), information travels quickly through social
     media. Consider the impact of this on us, pro and con. For perspective, consider events that
     happened before rapid social technology was available -- 9/11, election news, natural disasters (like
     hurricanes), or threats of nuclear disaster (such as during the Cold War). What value is there to the
     speed of this information being shared? What are the consequences?

     Kevin Kelly is a cofounder of Wired magazine and a philosopher about technology. Listen to his
     podcast interview on On Being, "The universe is a question," and reflect on his thoughts about how
     we view our ability to shape the character of technology.

In 2014, Pew Research published Digital Life in 2025. Scan through the report to read the hopeful
and less hopeful predictions by experts. Reflect on our collective experiences during COVID-19
(obviously an event not known to these experts). Consider that 2025 is not that far in the future.
How would you assess the predictions? Will they happen? Are they happening? What will or could
they mean to family life? To society?

Listen to the podcast episode of Hidden Brain on the social media scandal at Harvard discussed in
the chapter.What is your reaction to the response and to the ultimate decision related to a
student's admission decision? Was it fair, given our current social media climate? Consider our class
discussion about our individual use of technology and it's additional impacts on others, and how
our use is heavily influenced by others' expectations of us.

Reflect on the ways in which your ICT use shifted (if at all) during COVID-19. For most of us, the
time of quarantine between March 2020 and June 2021 had significant influence on our lives and
our use of technology. What was good about this time, relative to your technology behavior? What
are you not as happy with? From the perspective of the time in which you're reading this, did your
shifts in technology use during COVID-19 continue?Here's an example. In May 2020, the author saw
family educators post questions about integrating technology on Facebook. She offered to hold a
Zoom session for people to gather and share ideas. The meetings were such a success that they
have continued for well over two years, becoming a regular weekly meeting open to any family
educator wanting to talk about practice. This is a simple change brought about by COVID-19 that
has remained.

During COVID-19, many in-person classes shifted to videoconferencing (usually Zoom). Consider a
traditional class, whether a lecture, a mixture of lecture and discussion, active learning, or
laboratory work. Is videoconferencing a good substitute? Consider the effectiveness of
58 | 1.4 BLOG PROMPTS

     videoconferencing for learning, compared with in-person learning. What does videoconferencing
     instead of coming to class mean to you as a student? How does it affect your own use of
     technology, in classrooms and elsewhere, to support your learning? When is it efficient? When
     might it be costly due to its power to distract or to other negative impacts?

   Chapter Insights

           "Family" can be defined in various ways; there are generally accepted roles and functions
             families fulfill for their members and to society.

           As the family operates as a system, there are characteristics, processes, and influences on its
             functioning.

           Extant theories of the family -- including family development, symbolic interaction, feminist
             and social construction -- are useful in understanding dynamics of technology use and family
             access.

           While theories of media use help us understand how people vary in their use in relationships,
             they might be insufficient to apply to family research without some adaptation.

           This chapter presents Lanigan's Family Sociotechnological Framework, along with Hertlein
             and Blumer's Couple and Family Technology and Life Course. Consider how these
             frameworks characterize the role of technology in family dynamics and functioning.

           With evolving research and theory, our consideration of families' integration of technology
             and its impact on family life might drive new ways of understanding families altogether.

           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.
64 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

As family scholars, when we address questions of the impacts of technology use on family life, we begin with
the foundation of how the family is understood, its processes, the dynamics of relationships between family
members, and how the family is situated within the wider social ecology. On this foundation we can more
clearly see ICT is used by families for communication and family life management. ICT enables a variety of
processes between individuals in the family, and on behalf of the family, helping achieve the functions of the
family. This chapter reviews key family theories and perspectives, and presents newer theories specific to
technology use. The chapter ends with a discussion of two relevant models that blend traditional family
constructs with the reality and potential of family internet, device, and application use.

Consider these questions about your own family:

   How do you define "family"? What influences how you view and define "family?" What is a "happy
      family?

   What are the functions or purposes of a/your "family"? Who are its members? What roles do they play?
   Is your family "successful" as a family? Effective? Healthy/functioning?
   What influences your family's well-being -- positively and negatively, internally and externally?
   How has your family changed over time?

Defining Family

The definition of family depends on the perspective of the person doing the defining. Some consider a family
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 65

to consist of members who are legally and biologically related. Governments define the construct of a family
when distributing goods or services, or when allocating rights and privileges. The U.S. Census Bureau, for
example, defines family as "a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth,
marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are
considered as members of one family." [NOTE: "householder" by virtue of a name being on a title or lease
agreement]. This definition is broader than the same agency's definition of a family group and family
household, which can include nonbiological others and ascribes leadership. Family is sometimes defined by its
structure and membership. While some may restrict this to a traditional notion of "immediate family
members," including the parent or parents and children, others consider anyone living with and related to the
immediate family., including grandparents and other extended family members. And for others, "family" is a
concept borne of connectedness, similarity, and shared values: two or more people who are committed to each
other and share intimacy, resources, decision-making responsibilities, and values.

For the purposes of our discussion of technology use,     "family" is a concept borne of

are part of families, even if they've changed in

composition or meaning over the years. The family is such an expected, natural unit of society that to

question its function can seem jarring, yet the question allows us to better understand the processes and

structures that help the family to be successful -- processes and structures that are facilitated or affected by

ICT.

of beliefs that are passed through generations, maintaining members' emotional, social, physical, and spiritual
well-being.

Readers are encouraged to explore the rich cultural and ethnic dynamics through which families are guided in
their norms, traditions, roles, and expectations (e.g., Gardiner, 2017). It is through these caregiving functions
and the passing along of traditions that family well-being becomes of interest as an economic value.

As noted by the World Youth Alliance:

The family facilitates the transfer of culture from the older generation to the younger generation, passing on
values and the importance of hard work, discipline, and solidarity. The strong examples set by parents,
grandparents, and extended family members foster the work ethic and moral character of individuals entering
into the workforce, which positively impacts the quality of the workforce and reduces youth unemployment.
Thus the important role of healthy family structures in the economic growth of society must be recognized and
promoted.

Family Systems and Ecological Influences on the
Family

Viewing families as open systems, and families as part of a wider social ecology, are key principles in our basic
understanding of family life. A Family Systems perspective builds from classic Systems Theory, which views
the organism as an ongoing system of interconnected members. In an open system, members influence each
other, and each member is influenced by external factors. The family systems perspective focuses on the
family as an ongoing system of interconnected members. Extensions of family systems theory include
Bowen's theory of the family and systemic change over generations of interactions and emotional
development.

In the systems perspective, the whole is viewed as greater than the collective of individual parts. The family as
a distinct unit has its own characteristics, structure, strengths, and weaknesses. The system is dynamic and
transactional, sharing information (in the family via communication), and through that sharing affecting the
other members, as family subsystems (e.g., a parent and child) or the family as a whole.

Olson's Circumplex Model (2003) features family operations through processes of communication,
cohesion, and adaptability or flexibility. Communication takes many forms -- verbal, nonverbal,
symbolic, literal (e.g., text, written or spoken language), and figurative. And as with any communication from
sender to receiver, articulation and interpretation may vary. Families also demonstrate aspects of cohesion.
The cohesion of a system reflects its strength and degree of connectedness as a whole, and across its individual
links (e.g., a parent-child subsystem). Connectedness reflects a balance of separateness (or autonomy of its
members for growth) and togetherness for comfort, safety, and stimulation for growth. It is excessive neither
in member separateness (indicating disengagement) nor member togetherness (reflecting enmeshment).
Instead, it values demonstrations of commitment and closeness while respecting member individuality.
Cohesion also reflects the strength and resilience of the family, particularly in the face of stress. As an example
of technology research framed from a systems perspective, Ferguson and colleagues (2016) examined the
influence of employee mobile technology use during time with the family. Enhanced mobile use contributed
to work-family conflict and reduced work attention. For the spouse, increased mobile use by the employee
(family member) contributed to spousal conflict and decreased commitment to the employee's organization.

As an open system, the family is able to take in new

experiences, grow, and change. A closed system avoids

change and maintains the status quo. All families and

individuals in families face conflict, so another hallmark

of healthy family functioning is flexibility -- the ability

to work through change and conflict and remain stable,

albeit transformed. The strength of the unit is in how

well it withstands, processes, and recovers from the stress

or conflict. For example, if a family member comes out as

A closed family system rejects a non-traditional (to them)

idea of the family member's sexual orientation. This rigidity is experienced through a lack of change in

acceptance, a lack of communication, and a lack of openness to re-identify as a family.

Flexibility can be also viewed as the necessary, day-to-day adjustments made when dealing with external
influences small and large. Whether the conflict comes from a parent and child negotiating how much time
the teen spends on their phone, or a family recovering from their home being hit by a hurricane, families need
to possess the characteristic of flexibility. Flexibility may be seen in compassion, understanding, and
communication between members. It may require shifts in structures and responsibilities, in the allocation of
resources, and in the focus of time and attention.

2004). While different, these models each reveal

characteristics that help families through conflict and

crisis. Hill's (1958) ABC-X model of family stress and coping, for instance, conceptualizes the family

encountering the antecedents (A) of stress, responding based on their perception of resources (B), and

experiencing the consequences (C). "X refers to the endogenous variable (X) of the ABC-X model as the

degree to which the stressor precipitates a crisis to the extent that a family can no longer remain functioning"

(Rossino, 2016, p. 1). The double ABC-X model refers to the family's post-crisis response and adaptation or

dysfunction. Individual family differences dictate the perception, response to the stressor, and response to the

consequences. As Patterson (2004) notes, family resilience can be viewed as an outcome and measure of

family adjustment to stress. It can also be assessed as a process in terms of the meaning families ascribe to stress

and the actions with which they respond. Family strengths reflect positive abilities and attitudes toward life

and each other.

Families are also greatly influenced by the wider systems they are part of. As they are changed by that
influence, they influence others within the family through their interactions. As the family is changed, its
internal workings return it to a steady state, or homeostasis (much like the human body when subjected to
abnormal conditions that produce stress, like running fast or metabolizing a high amount of sodium).
Returning to Bronfenbrenner's ecological perspective introduced in the previous chapter, we are reminded of
the individual as influenced by proximal (nearby, frequently interacting) influences and those more distal,
70 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

infrequent, and remote. Human development is influenced by the unique composition of the individual
through interaction with people, in contexts, through processes over time. The family is a proximal influence
on individual development, carrying the unique composition and characteristics of its members, history, and
culture, and is influenced by the proximal and distal systems within which it interacts.
That unit can experience the same contextual influences as others, yet respond differently. These influences
can include physical settings, time, events, political conditions, climate, and resources made available by
location. Settings can influence the resources available to families, and threats to family well-being.

Used with permission.

Take, for instance, a family living in a suburb of a major metropolitan city and another living in a remote rural
town. On one hand, all families living in a particular place are exposed to the same availability of resources.
This is where jurisdiction matters. On the other hand, within that setting, family use of available resources
will vary. Navarro and Tudge's (2022) "technologization" of Bronfenbrenner's framework identifies the
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 71

virtual environment as a setting complementary to yet separate from the physical world. The virtual
environment offers a location for interaction and exposes the individual to resources. The authors adapt the
notion of cultural influences in more distal settings, reflecting the virtual environment. As discussed in more
detail in Chapter 5, which focuses on technology influences on human development, they observe that "the
rapid adoption of digital technology likely differentially impacts the development of [individuals] depending
upon the values and beliefs, resources, and social structure of their society." (Navarro & Tudge, 2022, p. 8).
Events are another influence on the family as a system. As we've experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic,
events can create worldwide impacts that have ramifications long after. The family is negatively impacted
when subjected to influences of poverty, discrimination, and racism, which can reduce access to resources.

A perspective related to systems theory is activity theory, which articulates how social action is mediated
through social objects and social organization, affecting thinking and behavior. Activity theory stems from
the work of social cognition theorists like Vygotsky, helping explain the individual's mental capabilities
resulting from interaction with the community, culture, and technology surrounding it. The theory's
application to information and communications technology is apparent, yet it also considers others with
whom the individual interacts within the system. Activity theory addresses the objective of the system,
internalization of the actors, tools used by the actors, division of labor, rules, and conventions. One example
72 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

of activity theory as applied to technology and human interaction systems examines the use of online
communities for professional development (Baran & Cagiltay, 2010).

Additional Perspectives on the Family

Family Development

Among the major natural and inevitable influences on the family are the individual development of its
members, and the development of the family as a whole (Carter & McGoldrick, 1988). The family system is
intended to foster the development of its members. There is certain predictability with the continual
development and change of individuals in the family (e.g., children developing physically, cognitively, socially,
and emotionally from birth through adolescence), though this still requires flexibility by the family. When the
development of a member is impeded, that sense of predictability and order is thrown off.

As we consider development of the family and within the family, think about how family members deal with
various roles and developmental tasks as they move through life stages: the initiation of couple relationships,
commitment, and formation of the family; transitions to parenting; raising young, tween, and teenaged
children; launching those children; and mid-life, retirement, and possible caregiving for elders. Within the
family, one member's efficiency in completing the tasks of development directly impacts the development and
activity of other family members. For example, a ten-year-old who is emotionally and cognitively mature may
be given responsibility for caregiving to their younger siblings, making it easier for the parents to spend more
time at work earning money that provides for the family as a whole. Viewing family development as a
response to the developmental trajectory of its members encourages attention to the family process,
acknowledges the family as a dynamic system, and focuses on individual and contextual change over time.

                                   This graphic from the American Association of Retired Persons
                                   (AARP) nicely demonstrates the developmental shifts that
                                   happen to whole families over time. As it shows, roles change
                                   over time. The full family unit of parents and child conveys the
                                   responsibilities of parenting and child-rearing. Thirty years later,
                                   the full family unit conveys the shift to older parents requiring
                                   some level of care by the adult child, even if that means emotional
                                   support rather than practical or financial assistance.

                                   Given the multiple influences on individuals within the family,
                                   and the stages in which the family itself shifts, viewing change in

                                   culture as carried out by the family, and as society reacts to those
                                   identities within the family.

                                   Symbolic Interaction

Symbols offer shared meanings that are expressed through verbal and nonverbal communication. The
Symbolic Interaction framework helps explain how we learn about and through roles by communicating with
each other about various roles in our society. In families, repeated patterns and behaviors express roles and
meaning to members and to wider social systems. While a role in a family includes expected behavior in a
given social category (Olson et al., 2014), role making includes interacting with others in ways that help teach
the role or change its expression. Women's caretaking, for example, may be learned from watching women in
the family and extended family; these caretaking roles are reinforced by others in the family and wider society.

Emotional bonds are created from activities conveyed by one's role. Roles also symbolize the importance and
power of a family member in fulfilling functions. The power results from an implicit negotiation between
individuals in the family. Within an individual family, a woman's extreme caregiving may convey her power in
that family (e.g., the matriarch).

Consider how roles may play out in family member technology use. A son whose role is in sibling oversight
and monitoring, for example, may be given a mobile phone early to help him communicate with other family
members.
74 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

Feminist Family Theory

Within the perspective of internal family roles in which members carry out functions that fulfill internal and
external family goals, feminist theory challenges the patriarchal paradigm that proscribes certain roles to
women (Allen, 2016). Traditionally women are viewed as caregivers, holding roles through marriage that serve
the husband, bear children, provide the dominant role in parenting, complete domestic (household)
management, and oversee care for elders. In the feminist framework, roles are equal and women maintain
responsibility for financial matters and as decision makers for the family, including holding down
employment. This doesn't mean taking on traditionally female and financial roles, but equal division of labor.
Because this perspective challenges the traditional model, it also accepts a degree of conflict in households as a
natural course of role negotiation. In this book, discussion of access to technology greatly concern views of
women in global societies. There is significant misalignment in access to mobile devices and to the internet by
gender, particularly in less developed countries in which fewer people hold access. For example, although in
North America where 95% of the population has internet access, there is a 1% difference between men (95%)
and women (94%), in South Asia, the difference is much wider with 37% men and 18% women. Feminist
theory questions these access rate differentials.

Patterns of Family Communication

As discussed, family communication is a process by which family outcomes of connectedness and cohesion
occur. Interactions, and transactive communication, and the conveying of information through verbal and
nonverbal actions -- these are part of families' daily lives. Families also communicate care and affection
through rituals and traditions. These may be unique to a given family (e.g., birthday, graduation) or may be a
family celebration of a wider cultural tradition. Given the uniqueness of the family in society, and the
uniqueness of each family, it makes sense that families vary based on their patterns of communication.

A social cognitive perspective on family communication is Keorner and Fitzpatrick's (2002) identification of
patterns, which adapts relational cognition and interpersonal behavior. Their model of patterns identifies two
dimensions that represent the family's shared reality: conversation and conformity. Conversation is
communication about topics; conformity is expression of values, behaviors, norms, and beliefs. Families
exhibiting low communication interact infrequently, and topics may be limited. Those who are low in
conformity represent diverse perspectives and interdependence in interests. Information and influence from
external sources are welcome in families who experience low conformity.

Koerner and Fitzpatrick's work describes climates created by families based on the two dimensions. Those
high in conformity yet low in conversation may be protective; when both conformity and conversation are
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 75

low, the family is laissez-faire. Those high in conversation and low in conformity experience a pluralistic
climate, and when both conversation and conformity are high, family patterns are said to be consensual.

Social Construction

Social construction is the development of a belief, construct, or concept based on repeated interaction with
the society around an idea. This interaction reinforces certain beliefs and understandings, developing
identities over time and through life experiences. Consider how the family might be a social construction -- a
building up of certain beliefs about something -- and the forces that influence those beliefs. Day-to-day
interactions with others in our neighborhoods, workplaces, and schools convey information about families.
At a wider level is how the family is represented in the media, in books and literature and stories, and now as
passed along by the internet and by social media.

Let's consider how the family has been presented in

various television shows over time. Each link below

describes a television show popular in its decade:

In each of these depictions, the family reflects a

dominant belief system at the time -- in the 1950s, the

view of the family as patriarchal, white, and middle class;

in the 1970s, the family as blended and heterosexual; in

the 1980s, the Black upper-middle-class family of the

Cosbys; in the 2000s, family systems made richly diverse (in some ways) through inclusion of age, ethnicity,

sexual orientation, marriage, remarriage, and gay marriage. Certainly, real-life families vary greatly from these

depictions, yet media representations convey the ways in which the larger society defines a family. Our critical

lens must explore the voices and faces and experiences missing in these shared constructions. Often, the

perspectives of women, immigrants, non-traditional families, families with members who have disabilities,

and those with non-dominant gender orientation or cultural and religious traditions are silenced,

marginalized, or -- possibly worse -- presented in a stereotyped way.

                                                     Social construction as it relates to technology can be

                                                     viewed as a response to technological determinism.

                                                     Mauthner and Kazimierczak (2018) observe that

                                                     technological determinism would argue that the changes

                                                     brought about by technology create material constraints

changes brought about by technology. The authors cite Sismondo's (2010) illustration of the watch as an
example of SCOT (the social construction of technology). The watch is crafted to be functional in its ability
to tell time, to have esthetic value, to be profitable, to make a statement about the person who wears it, and
other perspectives. Even the action of telling time can be perceived as fulfilling different functions -
measuring a length of time, maintaining time, acting as a stop watch. In short, the perspective of the watch is
socially constructed by those using it. In social constructivist notions of the family, the family is understood
within the particular social contexts that define their nature and effects, technology too can be understood
within social negotiations and logic. Mauthner and Kazimierczak provide an example of research that
integrates social constructivism to technology use and family work balance through Wajcman's work on
gender (p. 23). As will be discussed in chapter 9, technology integration in the balance of boundaries and role
demands across work and family spheres is less determined by the mobile capabilities of devices and use of the
internet, but through constructed action by users and the social contexts in which they operate.

Social Networks of Families

                                             Social network theory stems from the sociological study

                                             of human relationships and the flow of capital across

                                             social ties. Social networks are created by relationships,

                                             not defined by the boundaries and contents of an

                                             established institution. They are characterized by dyadic

                                             links and network dimensions (e.g., size, shape, density of

                                             interconnectedness), by relational transmissions across

                                             connections, and by time and space. They have power

                                             through their social and societal influence on individual

                                             behavior and the collective behavior of the group.

                                             latent social capital, social support). Influence can occur

on a small scale (e.g., from person to person, from small group to individual); it can also happen across many

interconnected network connections, creating an aggregate influence more potent than the individual

connections within whole networks.

The perspective of Moncrieff Cochran (Cochran, 1990a, 1990b; Cochran & Niego, 2002; Cochran &
Walker, 2005) on the social networks of parenting applies network theory to one role in the family, yet its
principles make it relevant to other dimensions of family roles and influences through relationships. It
suggests ways that the larger ecological, structural, and relational dynamics of a family member's life (in this
case the parent) may impact child well-being, working through the parent or operating directly on the child.
78 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

Echoing the tenets of social network theory, Cochran and Brassard (1978) observed that it is through the
structure of those connections and relational processes that networks have the capacity to convey information
and models of behavior from the larger society through the parent, and thus to impact parenting behavior.

Network membership is greatly constrained, even              "3D Social Networking" by ccPixs.com is licensed

factors as culturalvalues and beliefs, income and
education, and geographic location. Christakis and
Fowler call this "situational inequality"(2009, p. 31). The
other significant influence on network realities is the
range of factors that motivate an individual's
recruitment, selection, and engagement of network
members. Identifying the forces that influence network
formation and engagement illuminates avenues that
public policy and programs can follow to affect network
membership and involvement.

The social processes conveyed through network interaction -- either directly involving the parent, or
happening indirectly, as with hyperdyadic spread or broader network effects -- contribute to observed
parenting behavior. In general, social support through offers of practical assistance, information, and
emotional or psychological aid has been studied as a process through which network influences parenting.
Buffering, modeling, teaching, direct assistance, and providing opportunities for interaction are dimensions
believed to affect parental behavior.

Internet and social media applications of Cochran's network
perspective

Cochran's model is a useful conceptual guide for research on parents' social networks and on outcomes of
parenting resulting from online and offline experiences. The framework challenges researchers to regard
process and structure as keys to social relationship dynamics and meaning. Family researchers may look to

Before moving ahead, consider some questions that apply technology to the family theories
discussed in this section:

 How might the use of cell phones or smartphones figure into family system functioning?
 What might the introduction of smartphones to the family mean to family functioning

   regarding family member roles?
 How might "rules" related to technology play a part in the enactment of the roles?
 How does the sense of family member development relative to technology use, attitudes, or

   comfort figure into the family functioning for cohesion? Communication?
 To maintain the family functioning, how might family members need to demonstrate

   flexibility in technology use or attitudes?
 How is the family conveyed through social media in ways that point to it as a social

   construction?
80 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

Theoretical Perspectives on Media and
Communication

Are family theories sufficient to answer our questions about technology use by families? What limits to
exploring technology's impacts might be found in these traditional theories of family life? As will be discussed
in the next section, specific perspectives on ICT present ways of understanding innovation in human life that
are not adequately addressed in existing theories. While communications theories represent a field of study
beyond the scope of this book, selected theories will be briefly introduced here as indicative of perspectives
offered on ICT aspects and use, and on the impact of computer-mediated communication (CMC) on human
behavior and collective society. Additional authors, such as Dworkin et al. (2018), have discussed these
theories relative to their insight on families.

Media Richness Theory

Media richness theory proposes that media use or selection depends on the ability desired to convey messages,
particularly those of an emotional or relational nature. As the figure below conveys, richness deepens with
formats that approximate the experience of being face-to-face or physical presence. In Simpson's (2013)
research on media richness, media selection is determined by considerations of tool or format experience,
perception of tool capabilities, and social circumstances.

Media Multiplexity

Haythornthwaite's (2005) media multiplexity theory conveys the meaning of intimate relationships through
the use of devices by number and variation. According to the theory, relationships are stronger when
conveyed through the use of multiple devices and connections. Being friends with your sister on TikTok,
texting her, IM-ing her through her Instagram account, and using FaceTime for weekly chats demonstrate the
platforms used to maintain your relationship. Balayar and Langlais' research nicely represents media
multiplexity in family relationships. They add the dimension of family perspective -- individualistic or
collectivistic -- as this is an essential factor determining expectations for closeness. From a survey of college
students, the authors revealed that those from collectivistic cultures appreciated face-to-face contact with
parents, as it correlated with closeness and love. This did not hold for other family member relationships.

Technology Acceptance Model

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) proposes that perceptions of technology as both
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 81

useful and easy to use have a direct and positive influence on technology attitudes, intention to use
technology, and eventual use. (see Figure below)

                        Technology Acceptance Model - CC BY-NC 4.0

The TAM is derived from Ajzen's theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980) which proposes that
attitude toward a behavior is determined by the beliefs about the consequences of the behavior and by an
individual's effective evaluation of the consequences. Among Family and Consumer Science teacher
candidates (Ma & Pendergast, 2008), perceived ease of use was the most significant influence on intention to
use technology. Limitations of the TAM, as Davis (1989) describes, are the inclusion but lack of specificity
about external variables that influence attitudes directly, and the influence of external variables as mediated by
attitude components, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness.
A Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT, Venkatesh et al., 2003) identifies
attitudinal and contextual constructs that motivate use, including the perception of success (e.g., the
technology is useful to the purpose), effort (e.g., the technology is easy to use), influence from the social
context (e.g., encouragement of others), and facilitating conditions (e.g., the availability of training). Personal
factors that may condition use include age and previous experience with technology.
The author's repeated study with parenting and family education professionals employs Teo et al.'s (2008)
model of context variables that influence the TAM (e.g., Walker, et al, 2021), discussed later in Chapter 11:
subjective norms and facilitating conditions. Translated to the workplace, external TAM constructs are
"workplace expectations" and "workplace infrastructure" -- technology use by family professionals would be
influenced by their acceptance attitudes about technology, whether those attitudes were shaped by workplace
conditions of being encouraged to use technology, and being given the resources that help technology be easy
to use and seen as useful. Ertmer's (1999) perspective on technology use also supports extrinsic factors such as
training, access to devices, and organizational climate, yet sees them operate as "first order" influences, and
views attitudes as second-order influences on use.
82 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

Frameworks on Families and Technology

Early in the millennium, advances in ICT use by families had family scholars calling for theoretical models
that could shape evolving research and help depict and perhaps predict how new media impacted individuals
within families and families as a dynamic, changing unit (Aponte, 2009; Blinn-Pike, 2009; Watt & White,
2000). Research using family theory as a basis for the study of technology integration certainly helps (e.g.,
Sharaievska & Stokolska, 2015). Recently, a variety of models have been proposed that integrate family
dynamics with technological affordances and societal change (Dworkin et al., 2019; Mauthner, &
Kazimierczak, 2018). This chapter focuses on two models that characterize family processes within traditional
frameworks and that highlight aspects of the technologies themselves that inform selection, use, and impact.

Both models come from family systems and ecological perspectives; they regard ICT as tools external to the
family unit that facilitate family processes (e.g., communication, knowledge acquisition) and structures that
play out continuously in virtual and "real" worlds. The use of ICT by families is a recursive process in that
changes in the technologies themselves can occur (witnessed by the growth in the availability of social and
mobile media in response to popular use), resulting in differences in use due to the affordances provided. The
recursive nature of ICT use is also seen in changes to family systems and processes as a result of the family
interacting with and because of technology.

The figure below depicts changes in rules as a family experiences a member's technology use. The daughter
wants a phone and is offered one with an implicit understanding that she will text her parents when she is
away. When this doesn't happen, the discussion that ensues between the daughter and the parents results in a
negotiation and a change in the rules to maintain family connectivity and balance.
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 83

   Example of technology use interactions recursively affecting family rules.

Both models also reflect variation in use by individual or family factors and technology characteristics.
Lanigan's (2009) socio-technological model offers a comprehensive view of technology use and family life
impacts; Hertlein's (2012, 2018) is more specific to potential impacts on the structure and processes of couple
and family relationships.

Family Sociotechnological perspective

Lanigan's socio-technological family model (2009) (see figure below): "acknowledges the effect of
multifunctional ICT's on families and the influence of familial, extrafamilial and individual characteristics on
how those technologies are assimilated within the family context." (p. 595). The model highlights factors of
the technology that influence its selection and use, including access, scope, adaptability, and malleability of
the technology; obtrusiveness; resource demand (e.g., cost); and gratification potential. Family members are
motivated to use technology based on their goals and intentions, attitudes, processing styles, personality (e.g.,
extroversion, social anxiety), and demographics (e.g., age, gender orientation, education). Family factors are
largely represented as demographics, location, stage of development (e.g., transition to parenthood,
launching), use by individual members, and family processes. Lanigan roots family processes of cohesion,
adaptability, and communication in the model from the familiar Circumplex model of the family.
Technological, individual, and family factors are encompassed in the extrafamilial context (Bronfenbrenner's
exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem, 1995).
84 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

The socio-technological model can help us better understand "successful" ICT integration in family life.
Lanigan observed from her research that "Successful families used the information capability of the
technology to enhance family time by learning about community activities and planning vacations and time
together.... Less successful families experienced conflict related to the computer. The conflicts resulted from
difficulties establishing rules, perceptions that computer use was distancing a family member, and a reduction
of family time, communication and emotional bonding..." (p. 604).

                          Family Sociotechnological Perspective (adapted from Lanigan,
                          2009).

Life Course Theory Applied to Family Technology Use

In their 2018 review of the literature on social media and the family, Dworkin et al. observed that frameworks
interpreting technology's impacts on families are limited by not recognizing the impacts of time and context
(including social network effects) and in technology itself. They propose the adoption of Elder's (1998) life
course theory to our understanding of the family and technology. The theory emphasizes the role of history
on development through time and place, and of life transitions and their developmental impact, with the
social networks in which we are embedded conveying the effects of wider macroeconomic and social forces.
The individual constructs their path through the life course using personal agency and the opportunities and
resources afforded to them. While lifecourse is similar to family development theory in its perspective on lives
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 85

across time, Aldous (1990) observes that lifecourse focuses more on individual's interaction with others/
groups as they facilitate family event sequences.

Dworkin and co-authors observe life course theory as allowing us to conceptualize change in technology itself
as a contextual impact on use by the individual and in turn the family, as well as on the wider social networks
afforded by our online and offline interactions -- social networks that offer both bonded connections (strong
ties) and dispersed, bridging connections to the flow of information and resources. And it allows us to see the
individual change in context (including the family context), over time, as introduction to new technologies
(whether used or not, and regardless of what degree or by whom) affects internal interactions. Families in the
urban U.S. with easy access to high-speed internet, for instance, will be affected quite differently than those in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the internet infrastructure doesn't allow for multiple devices or rapid connection.
A life course perspective also aligns well with our recent experiences with COVID-19, as we consider our lives
before and after COVID, and workers' increased desires to work from home and have more flexibility in
managing multiple family roles.

Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework and and approach to social networks and family technology,
highlighted earlier in this chapter, lend support to the use of life course theory, and echo the need to see
families in a chronological, contextual manner and to visualize the transactional interactions that influence
development. As indicated, Chapter 5 will explore Navarro and Tudge's (2022) adaptation of the ecological
model that helps to explicate the person-process-context-time dimensions to explain ICT's influence in
human development.

The chapter ends with a final model that also adapts extant family theory using observations from the virtual
world of human communication and interaction -- appreciating specific mechanisms of new media and our
lives online that exist differently from the real world -- and addresses impacts on family structure and
processes.

Couple and Family Technology Framework

Hertlein (2012) (see also Hertlein, 2018; Hertlein & Blumer, 2013) offers a multi-theoretical model "to
describe how technology influences the way couples and families establish rules, roles, and boundaries and
interact with each other and the outside world." (p.375). The model organizes research literature into
elements that integrate perspectives from family ecology (how technology as an environment influence affects
the family), structural-functionalist theory (how technology affects rules, boundaries, and roles in families),
and interaction-constructionist theory (how technology changes intimacy, relationship initiation, and
relationship maintenance).
86 | 2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY

 Couple and Family Technology Framework from Katherine M. Hertlein, Markie L. C. Blumer. The Couple
 and Family Technology Framework: Intimate Relationships in a Digital Age

Hertlein's framework sheds particular light on the characteristics of new media that differentiate them from
other forms of communication and relationship interaction, most often assumed to occur in in-person, face-
to-face contexts. She calls these characteristics "vulnerabilities" (p. 376), and highlights characteristics of
digital media that can shift the perception of communication, the relationship, individuals in the relationship,
and intent. The "Seven As" in Hertlein's model include anonymity (presence online can be masked),
accessibility (easier, 24/7 access to the individual), affordability (the lower cost for means of interaction and
entertainment), approximation (social presence, or the feel and representation of face-to-face interaction
through text and sensory elements), acceptability (e.g., of using technology as the format for relationship
communication), accommodation (enabling the individual to behave like their real vs. their ought self), and
ambiguity (problematic behavior resulting from time spent online). The structures of the couple and family
relationships are influenced through a redefinition of boundaries, roles, and relational rules. Processes of
couple and family relationships are impacted through redefinitions of intimacy, and through alterations in
how relationships are formed, initiated, and maintained. As Hertlein (2018, p. 90) observes, "the framework
                                                                          2.1 WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING FAMILIES AND TECHNOLOGY | 87

considers the context in which the individual is embedded as well as future decisions to use technology and
the manner in which technology is integrated into the family."

Examples of how ICT can contribute to a change in family structure include the power shift as children show
parents how to work a new iPhone (roles), a couple renegotiation of what they share about their relationship
on social media (rules) and a parent's distraction by incoming work messages while helping a child with
schoolwork at home (boundaries). Accessibility to potential dates through a dating app can change process by
helping initiate relationships. Approximation, or the social presence that videoconferencing can convey, can
help extended family retain intimacy (thereby maintaining structure) during periods of separation such as
COVID or during transnational living. Additional discussion of this framework will occur in Chapter 4 on
couple relationships and ICT.

With these family, media, and blended models as a foundation for our critical perspectives on technology as
influencing and influenced by families, we now move to a broader scope on family technology use in Chapter
3: differences in use within and across families.

    Social constructions of the family

     In the chapter we discussed ways that families have been represented in television shows over the
     decades. These representations contribute to and reflect a social construction of family. Let's take a
     more current view. Take a few minutes to look at the social media accounts, online news,
     information feeds, and other applications you visit most frequently. Considering the role of media in
     shaping our sense or construction of the family, what messages and images of families seem most
     prevalent?What about parenting? Or intimate (romantic couple) relationships? What social
     constructions of families are presented in our online worlds? Of parenting? Of intimate
     relationships?Consider your use of these accounts as a child and preteen. What collective messages
     might you have formed about families from your technology use?

    Moving from family theory to theoretical applications to families and
    technology

     When framing questions in new areas, researchers often begin with a well-known concept.
     Consider each of the following points that summarize some well-known arguments, stemming
     from theory, about families. For each one, add a question that a researcher might ask when framing
     the argument in relation to family technology use.

           The family serves functions to its members, itself, and society, and our interest is in aiding
                                                                                                                      2.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 93

        the successful completion of those functions. EXAMPLE RESPONSE: Family cohesion
        provides an emotional sense of connectedness through which each family member feels
        cared for and valued. What is the role of social media in fulfilling siblings' sense of
        connectedness?
      The family serves as an open system -- its members influence each other, and each
        member is influenced by external factors. It is dynamic and transactional, and thrives when it
        is flexible and yet demonstrates cohesion.
      Family members are all developing humans. The family itself is a developing unit. Those
        individual and collective changes also influence family functioning.
      Living in shifting contexts, families are particularly influenced by their settings, time,
        events, political conditions, and so on.
      The family -- and its members -- are social constructions. How they view themselves and
        how society views the family changes over time.

Theoretical base of family research on technology (1)

The article below is an excellent example of using Family Systems Theory as the basis for research
on technology and the family (in this case, boundaries and social media):
Sharaievska, I., & Stodolska, M. (2015). Redefining boundaries in families through social networking
leisure. Leisure Sciences, 37(5), 431-446.
After reviewing this article, see if you can find another piece of research that uses an extant family
theory as the basis for its investigation. How might using research examples like this help us better
understand technology's role in family dynamics? How might they help us better understand the
theory as it applies to families?
94 | 2.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

    Theoretical base of family research on technology (2)

     Identify at least three pieces of research on a similar theme related to families and technology. For
     example, families' use of texting for communication, or parent-teen conflict over parental
     monitoring of screen time. Select research studies published within the last ten years. Examine the
     theoretical base for the research. Which family, parenting, or other theory is used? How do the
     studies compare with regard to theoretical base? Are any atheoretical, or do not state a theory? As
     a result of their efforts, do the authors propose any changes to existing family theory to address
     what technology offers to family life?

2.4 BLOG PROMPTS

Existing family theory is useful for conceptualizing, describing, and studying family interactions,
contexts, and well-being, but is it sufficient for considerations of information communications
technology (ICT)? On one hand, we can argue that it is not, given the affordances of technology as
they demonstrate various dynamics on roles and relationships. On the other, these theories have
withstood the test of time for decades and have been applied to other phenomena facing families.
Can it be argued that these theories and frameworks -- or at least some of them -- could be used?

Identify a sample research article that studies family technology use applied to a fairly traditional
family framework (e.g., systems). Using your school library site or Google Scholar, use keywords on
family, technology (or insert the name of a specific technology like texting or social media), and the
name of the theory (e.g., social construction, family systems, symbolic interaction). Comment on the
degree to which the perspective fits the study. Knowing what you do about family theory and
dynamics, and about facets of technology function and use, would you recommend any different
framework be considered for this study?

The chapter focuses on two primary frameworks for looking at families and technology
implications. Applying frameworks to real-life examples is a way to demonstrate and challenge our
understanding. Select one of the two frameworks: Lanigan's socio-technological framework or
Hertlein and Blumer's framework. In the post, provide a brief summary (like a paragraph) of the
framework, then describe a real-life example, such as couple relationships and the use of
technology, or parent supervision of a child's technology use. The application may be something
personal that will be relevant to you and help you apply these frameworks. Consider what research
questions the use of this framework or model might suggest.

   Chapter Insights

           Differences lie within individuals in families, and in families as a whole. These differences,
             more than anything, illustrate the complexity in characterizing technology use within and
             across families. They also reveal issues of underlying equity and social justice, and of families
             and technology.

           "Use" is a widely variable term. It can be operationalized to represent which device and
             application, for what purpose, for how long, in which way, with whom, and where. To
             compare "use" effectively is to identify the standard for the definition and measure first.

           Functional differences in technology use may be seen by individuals within the family and by
             subsets of family members. How siblings use applications together may be far different than
             how a child uses the application with a parent. These functional differences may represent
             differences in family dynamics, structure, and roles.

           Family member and whole family variation in technology use depends on their attitudes
             toward technology and on comfort, skill, and access. Access can vary by geography,
             economics, education, language, and ability. Situations putting strain on families, such as
             COVID-19, immigration, or other separations, can reveal access needs that present serious
             gaps. Attitude, comfort and skill, and digital readiness are directly related to access.
102 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

           Ensuring access to technology -- specifically, internet service, cellphone service, and
             accommodations for ease in using technology -- is a question that has policy and political
             implications. Whose responsibility is it to ensure internet access?

           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Introduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, headlines brought attention to disparities in children's academic
achievements due to differences in their ability to keep up with school online (Dorn et al., 2021). With
remote learning, which depended on children having access to computers and internet in the home, children
across the globe who lacked internet access or had limited and shared access to technology struggled to keep
up. More recently, the news has highlighted the challenges faced by families fleeing Ukraine during the
Russian conflict. For them, having a smartphone with data meant staying connected and accessing resources;
in other words, it was truly a lifeline (Cantrill, 2022). It's difficult to imagine navigating the challenges faced
by refugees without being able to call or access the internet.

These modern-day examples highlight differences         All families vary by their

identifies household differences by light, moderate,
and high internet use based on current use of one,
two, three, or four devices at a time.

Families also vary within their membership, as individuals demonstrate functional behavioral, attitudinal, and
skill differences in the daily use of ICT. If you read that "smartphones are owned by 85% of families in the
U.S.," what would you want to know? Which U.S. families? The majority of all families? The majority of

white, middle-class families? Even a sample indicating "representativeness in the U.S." would need
clarification. You might want to know if a family is defined by biological and immediate family, contains
extended families, or includes those not directly related. And you might question this statistic based on
families' habits or access to technology.

For family professionals, awareness of these differences can be key to understanding family conflict,
communication, and flexibility. It may also direct attention to technology access as an issue for families, when
attention might be on school performance or employment. This chapter examines technology use in the
family to see how it may differ within families (e.g., in ways that might have an impact on relationships and
systemic family functioning), and across families (e.g., how family variation might indicate differences in
family well-being by virtue of use or access).

       Before we begin exploring family differences in technology use, think of your own family --
       who is in it, and what are their ages and relationships and roles in the family. Consider how the
       members of your family would be similar or different in terms of their technology use, comfort,
       and access. Now think of another family that you know fairly well. How are they similar or
       different in their use compared to your own family?

Family Differences

No two families are alike, and no two families use technology in the same ways. As discussed in the last
chapter, families can be defined by structure, composition, or membership -- varying by number, member
age, member roles and responsibilities (e.g., two parents, one parent, a grandparent), number of children, and
subsystems (e.g., parent + oldest child, father and father). As discussed throughout this book, these
differences will reflect the ways in which technology is used by individuals and with family members as well.
Families with several children in the preteen and teenage years may have multiple phones; a single parent with
an infant would not. As the family is an open system, each is differently influenced by social, belief, and
extended family systems (Olson, et al, 2014). These systems may influence their practices, knowledge, value,
and needs for using technology.

Families with close connections to extended members (e.g., cousins and grandparents across the country or
the world) may include videoconferencing through apps like FaceTime as a nightly practice or regularly text
through WhatsApp. Smaller families with all members living in the same household would not. And families
vary by demographics, education, household income, language, and geographic location. As a student, you
may have experienced how your level or exposure to formal education can influence interactions with settings
that integrate technology in learning. Over time, this might influence your skill and comfort. Geographic
location can affect access to the internet and to social and practical resources that encourage use.
          3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 105

A note of caution as we proceed. As we examine family

technology use, we need to distinguish research that uses

data from families from research that uses data on

"households." While households often include families,

this isn't always the case. For example, a U.S. government

report on internet broadband access and smartphone

ownership may say it describes U.S. "families." Closer

inspection, however, reveals that the data was taken from

U.S. households. The U.S. Census Bureau defines a

household as all people who occupy a single housing         "Kosovo Refugees" by United Nations Photo is
unit, regardless of their relationship to one another       licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.

(Population Reference Bureau, 2020). Can we say that

this represents "families"? Households may include biological or legal families, but may also contain a group

of adults living together or several families. And as you cross continents, a demographer's definition of

"family" or "household" might vary depending on government or bureaucratic definitions. Similarly, research

claiming to explore "family" technology practice or impacts requires careful attention to the true population

of interest. A single-parent family is different from a family with one child under the age of 18, which is

different from a blended family of two homosexual parents of six children ranging from birth through age 18,

which is different from an Asian-American family comprised of first-, second-, and third-generation

members.

As we discuss technologies used by families , it's important that we have a clear understanding of what is
meant by family, technology, and technology use. With these standards understood, we can explore why
differences within and across families matter.

Measurement of Technology Use

Variation in "use" definitions.

Consider your own family once again. If you were asked to observe ICT use by its members over a typical day,
what would you look for? Which type of tech your family members use? Which applications they are on, for
how long? How your parents' use for work seems focused on their laptops while your little brother's time

researchers measure it differently.                    screen technology. Some studies assess use very
                                                       broadly. In Hamilton's study on children's use in

                                                       Jamaica (2010), use or consumption is a single item:

"Frequency of individual use of the Internet in the last 12 months (from any location)" along with many

indicators of technology possession. Reflect on your own "use" in the last few hours. What are the many ways

in which a researcher might categorize your practice?

A few examples:

 Device ownership: which, how many, how many per person/per family, which model, how many
   different devices?

 Functions: what is the device or app used for? The function may be refined more specifically, say to
   indicate parenting behavior: communication with children, number of times reassuring texts are sent to
   a child, and so on.

 How is technology used to accomplish a purpose? Which purpose? For what benefit or consequence?
 Use behavior: device or application frequency (minutes per day, hours per day, days, interaction events,

   times the screen is touched, times the phone is picked up
 Use by an individual (to benefit the individual)? Use as shared?
 Where is the device or application used?
 Device application "problem" (e.g., addiction, being a tech Luddite?) or identity affiliation (e.g.,

   feminist expression, Goh, 2013)

Another common oversight is when researchers report "use," but are really measuring device ownership or
application membership. Just because your dad has an Apple iPod Nano he bought in 2005 doesn't mean
that he uses it. Or you were "gifted" with a device (thus ownership), but you rarely pick it up. A related
concept is "membership." Social media applications abound. People download them, and create accounts.
But use is not equivalent to membership or having an account. In the graphic below, Twitter users make posts
in varying frequencies (McClain et al., 2021). Just under half (49%) post fewer than five tweets a month, while
just over half (52%) report posting daily (https://backlinko.com/twitter-users#twitter-users), and the majority
of Twitter content is contributed by only 25% of users. Yet Twitter can boast that it has 400 million accounts.
Clearly, there are differences between those holding accounts and those who are active users. Preferences and
behavior vary. Determining what the researcher means by "use" is as critically important as determining your
                                                            3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 107

definition and interest in family. Without doing so, it will be difficult to aggregate research findings for a clear
assessment of "use."

Keep an eye out for advanced methodologies and definitions of "use" as research into the impact of
technology on the family continues. Innovative projects such as the Human Screenome Project, for instance,
collect rich data from screen captures from individuals' phones, revealing possibilities for interpreting the
interplay between technology-integrated interest and interaction (Reeves, et al., 2019). The implications from
this data in better understanding family system and subsystem dynamics are endless.

Definitions of devices, applications, and power

Depending on the individual, the generic term "technology," or even "information and communications
technology" can mean a particular device, or an application or software on the device. A good place to begin
with specificity on use is to define precisely what is meant by "technology" devices, applications, or even the
internet, when they are included in measurement.

According to Wikipedia, digital media is

      any communication media that operate with the use of any of various encoded machine-readable data formats.
      Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, modified, listened to, and preserved on a digital electronics
      device. Digital can be defined as any data represented by a series of digits, while media refers to methods of
      broadcasting or communicating this information. Together, digital media refers to mediums of digitized
      information broadcast to us through a screen and/or a speaker.

This also includes text, audio, video, and graphics that are transmitted over the internet for viewing or
listening to on the internet. Digital media platforms, such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Twitch, accounted for
viewership rates of 27.9 billion hours in 2020.

Social media, on the other hand, is a more specific term. It refers to "interactive technologies and digital
channels that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression
through virtual communities and networks. It has some common features:

 1. Social media are interactive, Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.
 2. User-generated content -- such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated

      through all online interactions -- is the lifeblood of social media.
 3. Users create service-specific profiles for the website or apps that are designed and maintained by the

      social media organization.
 4. Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those

      of other individuals or groups.
108 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

As of January 2022 (Statista), the top three social media services, based on having more than 200 million users
each, were Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.

Powering use

Just as "electricity" can be considered the power that enables us to watch television, or "gasoline" the thing
that currently powers our cars, the internet can be seen as what "powers" our ability to use applications and
devices. Wikipedia describes the Internet (or internet) as

      the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to
      communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public,
      academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic,
      wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and
      services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW),
      electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

Unless we are using an application "off line" or have "downloaded" a file, much of our use of social media,
search sites like Google or DuckDuckGo, videoconferencing on FaceTime, and learning management systems
like Blackboard is dependent on our device's connection to the internet.

A cellular or mobile network (for texting and calls) is "a communication network where the link to and from
end nodes is wireless. The network is distributed over land areas called `cells,' each served by at least one fixed-
location transceiver (typically three cell sites or base transceiver stations). These base stations provide the cell
with network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content.... When
joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area" (Wikipedia).

A peripheral is "an auxiliary device used to put information into and get information out of a computer.The
term peripheral device refers to all hardware components that are attached to a computer and are controlled by
the computer system, but they are not the core components of the computer, such as the CPU or power
supply unit" (Wikipedia). Input devices include mice, keyboards, graphic scanners, and microphones. Output
devices include monitors, printers, headphones, and speakers. Input/output devices also include external
hard drives.
         3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 109

Devices

Portable devices used to perform "information" and "communications"
functions include small, handheld machines like cellular (mobile)
phones and smartphones -- portable devices that combine mobile
telephone and computing functions into one unit. Look at your
smartphone. What are all the functions that it performs? At the very
least you can use it as a calculator, and to make calls, take pictures and
videos, and send emails and text messages. Later in the chapter, we'll
discuss differences in access to the internet and to devices like cell
phones. Many of these differences fall along demographic lines.

Applications, or Software

During the day we often check our Instagram accounts, or open a file        "Selfie" by d_t_vos is licensed
on a document production program like Word. Though we are "on our           under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.
phone" or "on the laptop," we're technically using a specific application
or piece of software on that device. According to Wikipedia,

an application program (application or app for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific
task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself, typically to be used by end-users. Word
processors, media players, and accounting software are examples, and the collective noun refers to all
applications collectively. The other principal classifications of software are system software, relating to the
operation of the computer, and utility software (`utilities). Applications may be bundled with the computer
and its system software or published separately and may be coded as proprietary, open-source, or projects. The
term "app" often refers to applications for mobile devices such as phones.

In technical papers (including reports for a course), we refer to our reliance on particular applications.
Because these are intellectual properties, often with trademarks and copyrights, it is important to remember
to capitalize them (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok). This is particularly important as some applications
like Canvas (learning management software) are also nouns in the English language that would not be caught
in spell checking programs.
110 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

Functional Differences in Use

Now that we have some basic terminology for
technology, we can consider the various functions
technology performs as they may relate to an individual's
or family's purpose.

   Communication: between couples, parent and
      child, parents and co-parents, extended family
      (grandparents). Who, how, with what frequency,
      and which device for which family member.

   Connectivity: How is this different? What is social
      networking? What is the value of social networking CC 2.0 by Denise Krebs
      in family life?

   Information gathering (informal learning): for parenting, decision-making, problem-solving. By
      whom (e.g., parents, adult children)? On what topics? Using what means? On the internet (info
      searches)? From others (discussion boards, social media)?

   Entertainment: couple and family time together via gaming, co-viewing media. Most parents monitor
      the content of the videogames that children play.

   Utilities: banking, health care, travel and transportation, taxes, housing, food, navigation.
   Use of tech outside the family that affects the family: work, school (formal learning by young children,

      older children), use of technology devices in the family system (parents as learning heroes).

These functions apply to most anyone using technology; they are not unique to the family. Families who play
online and videogames together, for example, find it a great way to spend time together. Parents report
playing videogames with their children because it's fun, it's a good opportunity to socialize with their child,
their child asks them to, they can monitor what children are playing and thus exposed to, and they enjoy it
(ESRB, 2022). Ninety-four percent of parents pay attention to the videogames played by their children, 71%
say videogames have a positive influence on their child's life, 67% play videogames with their children at least
once weekly.

Yet when we view these activities in terms of of fulfilling family roles and the development of individuals
within a family, their use can be distinguished from individual, group, or societal use distinct from the family.
A function unique to the family is the fulfillment of family roles -- parenting, caregiving (direct action and
indirect fulfillment), and relationship initiation, maintenance, or possible dissolution. This final function
distinguishes technology used by families from others, in so far as use has direct or indirect benefits to family
members or the family as a whole.
                                                             3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 111

For example, while Facebook use as a means for social networking has long been a focus for research (e.g.,
Zhuravskaya, et al., 2020), a study on the transition to parenthood finds its role valuable in creating new
network members and resources for social support (Bartholomew, et al,. 2012). As illustrated below, those
fulfilling caregiving roles in families demonstrate different information search behaviors than non-caregivers
(Fox & Duggan, 2013). The same report indicates that one in three caregivers are likely to use health
"trackers" through technology to monitor the health of the person they are caring for.

                Pew Research Center.

Yet, naturally, caregiving in families is most considered parenting or childrearing, and chapters 5, 6, and 7
explore the role technology plays in these family roles as distinct from adult-only technology use.
As an example of distinguishing adult technology use from use that holds specific value to the family, in our
early work (around 2008) studying parents' technology use -- as parents in the parenting role -- it was
essential to add specific functions of the parenting role to identify how ICT was used (e.g., Walker, et al.,
2011; Walker & Rudi, 2014). It was impossible to extrapolate from information about "adults" in extant
research. as not all adults are parents, and adult roles and functions can include tasks that don't include
112 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

childrearing. Our study needed to add items specific to the parenting role (e.g., "monitor who my child
interacts with" or "validate my observations as a parent.")

Further analysis of family use of technology to fulfill

family functions might consider different configurations    Thinking of your own family, identify
of which family members are using technology with           examples of family members' use of
others. Differences might exist, for example, between       technology might fulfill family

and children, siblings, family and grandparents,

grandchild and grandparent, foster parent and foster

child. Such configurations are limited only by the

variations of family membership and structure. Thinking of your own family, identify examples of family

members' use of technology might fulfill family functions.

Here are examples from my family. There are three of us, my husband, my 28-year-old daughter (who lives in
another state), and myself.

 I text my daughter good morning (parental nurturance; relationship maintenance).
 She Venmos a request for repayment of my plane ticket (practical assistance between family members).
 I may use FaceTime to talk with her during a weekend day as she works on her taxes (family

   communication, parental assistance in problem-solving, parental guidance to an emerging adult on
   learning a life skill of adulthood).
 I search Google Flights to find available, low-cost airfares for the wedding of an extended family member
   (family connectedness).

In each way I use technology, I fulfill my role in the family as parent and family member. Each action could be
measured for use by any adult -- searching for a flight, talking to others through FaceTime, requesting
money. Yet each action can be defined as it relates to a family role and to relationships and family outcomes.

Factors influencing use

Technology attitudes, comfort and skills.

To further understand differences in use is to be aware of external factors that influence use: comfort and skills
in using technology (conditioned by a number of factors) and access. Davis' Technology Acceptance Model
(1989), discussed in the previous chapter, identifies use as conditioned by attitudes of acceptance, which are
influenced by the perception that a technology is easy to use and is useful. Context research supports the idea
                                                             3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 113

that external conditions, including resources and encouragement, can make a difference in the motivation to
use technology and acquire skills. Technology use varies as well by the individual's attitude, skill, and comfort.

Consider the people in your life. Are some "techy" and     "Geek Squad camp provides hands-on
capable of picking up any kind of device or system, while  technology skills" by Fort George G. Meade is
others need assistance when something new is suggested?    licensed under CC BY 2.0.
Do some love using technology and feel a bit addicted to
applications, like gaming, while others are suspicious of
tech's influence and use it sparingly or only out of
necessity? Now consider how these differences in skill
and attitude might affect use. The friend who feels very
comfortable with technology will probably use it more,
while the one whose skill level is low and/or who worries
about its negative effects will use it far less.

In some studies, attitudes toward technology use are a proxy for actual behavior. In behavioral intention
models in psychology, feelings about an activity and an intention to do the activity are demonstrated to relate
to the actual behavior. Technology acceptance measures attitudes that are favorable or open to the value of
technology in one's life or work. These may be measured through statements like the following, with each
rated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) (adapted from Teo et al., 2017):

 Technology makes work more interesting
 Working with technology is fun
 I like using technology
 I look forward to those aspects of my job that require me to use technology

While these items don't indicate how a technology is used, as a cluster of items or construct they can indicate
favorability toward use, and serve as a point to which factors of influence can compare, such as whether the
individual perceives technology to be easy to use ("I find it easy to get technology to do what I want it to do")
and/or if the individual perceives value in using a particular technology ("Using technology will increase my
productivity" or "I find technology is a useful tool in my work"). In research with family educators and family
professionals, we determined that ease of use and value had a direct bearing on attitudes of technology
acceptance (Walker et al., 2021). Other factors related to skill and comfort lie with exposure to external
resources and supports, such as technical training and being surrounded by others who value technology.

In 2021, Pew Internet determined that about one-third of adults in the U.S. can be characterized as having
114 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

                                       applications, such as email or calling by phone, rather

than videoconferencing or text messaging. And readiness has indirect effects. During the pandemic, 47% of

parents with less digital readiness reported difficulty in helping their children with remote learning, compared

with 24% of higher readiness parents.

These results mirror earlier research by Pew revealing digital readiness characteristics that correlated with
other demographic indicators (2015):
                                                             3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 115

Access

While internet access seems ubiquitous in our modern society, it is not guaranteed. Global data indicate that,
on average, at least 77% of the world's population has at least some access to the internet (Schumacher &
Kent, 2020) (figure x below). Countries and regions with more advanced economies report higher rates of use
(close to 87%): Australia, Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, Europe, the Americas, and the
116 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (ITU, 2019; Schumacher & Kent, 2020). Countries with
emerging economies report lower use (47% on average), and those in the least-developed countries --
primarily in Africa -- report an average of 19%. Across Africa, averages range from 4.7% in Western Sahara to
87.2% in Kenya (Internet World Stats, 2020). The range in Latin America is similarly wide, with saturation
high in countries like Argentina (92.2%) and Costa Rica (85.5%), and low in countries such as Nicaragua
(30.2%) and Honduras (28.7%). Since 2015, overall access to the internet exceeds household computer
ownership, with the ITU reporting that it is no longer necessary to have a computer at home to access the
internet (2019, p. 7).

As illustrated by the map below, use of high-speed broadband is significantly lower in some areas of the U.S.
                                                             3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 117

compared to others. Similarly, cell phone ownership is higher in countries with developed economies (e.g.,
over 90% in European countries). Demographic factors such as younger age, higher household income, and
education level are related to greater access and higher rates of internet and cell phone use.

integration into new locations (e.g., finding employment, housing, services), using geolocation services,
transferring money, and more (McAuliffe, 2021). Lack of access and and the lack of accommodation to the
needs of immigrant family (e.g., translation of applications) affects comfort in using technology and
acquisition of basic computer skills. Inequities lead to "knowledge gaps," particularly in children, and to
differences in the acquisition of technology skills needed for employment, settlement, and possible
resettlement. For any family, but particularly for those who are vulnerable (such as during transnational living
or immigration), gaps in access exacerbate challenges brought about by disparities in income, education,
employment, housing and sanitary living conditions, and health care.

Scholars assert that equity will remain a prevalent issue for families in the future (Anderson, et al., 2021).
While equity and internet access as human rights are macro-level policy issues, small-scale efforts get
technology into the hands of families and children in need. Schools, for example, may distribute devices,
routers, and wifi hubs; provide additional technology coaching; and train teachers to be sensitive to equity
and access needs when integrating technology in coursework. In California, nearly one-third of school-age
children lack access to broadband networks, and lack of access is nearly double for children of color compared
to their White counterparts. In addition to the "quick fixes" of providing wifi hubs and internet access in
public buildings, the "Broadband for California" bill, Senate Bill 1130, would make "funds for broadband
accessible to all communities in the state and ensure that projects built with these funds are future-proof and
have more open-access to our communities" (Gonzalez & Steyer, 2020). As this story from Arkansas
illustrates, providing reliable broadband in remote communities is a significant challenge politically and
practically (Carr, 2021), yet it is worth the effort. Faster connections can mean greater participation in school,
family connectivity, employment, and the tasks of daily life for families. Those interested in progress in
Minnesota may want to follow the Broadband Task Force of the Office of Broadband Development
(https://mn.gov/deed/programs-services/broadband/task-force/).

countries (e.g., 1-2%), but in developing and least-developed countries (LDCs), men's access exceeds
women's by 10-12% (ITU, 2019). And the gap, as measured between 2013 and 2019, is growing -- 7% in
developing countries, and 15.9% in least-developing countries (ITU, 2019). Gender differences in mobile
phone ownership also exist, mimicking those in internet access.

                                                       Questions of access must also consider ability: persons

                                                       software. And we can consider language: how many

(e.g., installing software). While lack of access and

skills is referred to as the "digital divide," others characterize the space by the deficits created: the "access gap"

or the "knowledge gap" (Wei & Hindman, 2011). Geographic location can make a difference. Those living in

more rural areas not only may lack access, but they may be unable to gain the digital skills necessary for work

in the 21st century. Wood (2018) reports that large tech-based companies such as Amazon are moving toward

exclusively operating in larger, urban cities, creating a further divide between urban and rural regions in

technology training and skills. Blum-Ross and others (2018) suggest that varying levels of skills, literacy, and

confidence with technology are a new way to understand family diversity.
120 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

As observed, the "digital readiness" spectrum runs from those who are unprepared to those who are digitally
ready. Approximately half are unprepared, traditional learners, and/or reluctant. They tend to be older and in
households with lower income and education. The other half are those more prepared, labeled the the
"cautious clickers" and the "digitally ready." These groups are younger and have higher incomes. Consider
why these demographics of age, income, and education may relate to these attitudinal and skill differences.
One possibility is that feelings of confidence and skill relate to access, as limited income can mean less
exposure to technology (or efficient technology).

As we understand divides in internet access, and see how local and regional efforts are being made to ensure
equity, the question of responsibility remains. The graphic below, from Commonsense Media, reveals the
digital and academic achievement gaps in K-12 education, and proposes policy action.
                                                             3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 121

In 2021, Pew Research asked a representative sample of U.S. individuals if the government is responsible for
122 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

ensuring internet access (McClain et al, 2021). The majority (62%) said no. Seventy percent don't believe it's
the government's responsibility to ensure that all Americans have cell phone access. Differences in this
opinion fall along political views, with Democrats twice as likely to support the government's role than
Republicans. Those with lower incomes are more likely to favor government assistance. What do you believe?
Whose responsibility is it to ensure internet access, and what do we mean by "ensure"?

Within Family Differences

Families, particularly those with children still in school, may represent a fairly stable picture of race, ethnicity,
education, income, and geography. Yet within the family there will be differences in technology use due to
differences in individuals and individual relationships and roles. In the figure below, using data from 2012, we
see that parents reported using email and social media more often with extended family, while they were more
likely to text their children and the other parent.

       Consider the members of your family. Write down each family member's name and draw a
       circle around it How would you characterize each members' use? Consider the functions that
       technology serves for them, what their use might look like in terms of device ownership, and
       the frequency with which they use particular applications for school, work, entertainment, and
       hobbies. Consider their comfort, skill, and attitude with regard to using technology. Then step

back and consider the differences within your family. Are you on social media less than your
younger sister? But more than your father? Is your brother more likely to be a gamer than other
members of the family? Is your younger sister addicted to social media, while you can look at it
or ignore it but don't feel hooked? How do you and your sister talk to each other through ICT
differently than you would with your parents? How might they connect with each other, or use
technology together (say, for family financial matters) differently than you do for school or for
work? What influences those differences? Consider our discussion about comfort and skill,
functional interests, role fulfillment, and access. How might models such as the Technology
Acceptance Model help explain differences in, say, your use as a family member compared to
your mother's?

In our early study of 1653 parents, we clustered them

based on their technology use, identifying differences by  As noted earlier, there are some user

variety of functions, and had positive attitudes. In the

green areas there were a number of parents we called the

"omnivores," those who possessed more devices,

participated in a wide variety of activities, and had very positive attitudes about technology. Also in the green

zone where those who used technology frequently and used a limited number of devices, along with those

who had many devices, used them frequently, and weren't happy about it. Minimal users seemed happy with

their limited use or were indifferent or almost seem to experiment using various technologies. Again, we see

wide variation by device ownership, frequency of use, and attitudes. It isn't unusual for parents as adults in

the same household to hold positions at different sections of this attitude-device-action spectrum.

Sophistication mapping of differences in technology use within families can be used to predict potential
attitudinal differences and relational interactions. Readers are encouraged to use Hertlein and Blumer's
(2015) family technology-focused genogram to explore family technology dynamics.
124 | 3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE

Across family differences

Now that you've considered the differences in your

own family, think about two other families you

know well. Perhaps they are families of your friends

or your partner, people on your street, or relative's

families. How would you describe their technology

use as a family? Consider their roles and

relationships, family configurations, and conditions

regarding access and skill for each family member (as

well as you can). Does the family have a lot of

devices? Are they avid gamers? Do they hold jobs or

attend school in ways that dictate member use? See,

for example, the picture to the right, with the        "staying connected" CC by US Army
deployed father connecting with his family back

home. Or perhaps families that are immigrating to a

new country (such as those currently fleeing from the Ukraine or from Serbia). Regardless of the reason for

transnational status, families depend heavily on the internet and digital devices to stay connected to each

other and to valuable information that help families thrive. Considering your own family and these other two,

how similar or different would you say they are in their technology use?

Access

Earlier, we focused on family differences in access to the internet and to cell phone services. As these factors
influence individuals within families in terms of their comfort, skill, and outcomes related to technology
integration in their lives, they also mean whole family differences. As Karraker (2015) notes, disparities in
technology access, and resultant inequalities between groups of families, exacerbate economic inequality,
representations of the idea of family, and representations of gender. They diminish family members' voices in
the virtual environment, to the degree that we ask whose norms and values are being transmitted. During
COVID, limits on access meant differences in educational achievement that favored higher-income families.
And as we consider the economic value to families of having internet access, with the functional ability to
help families communicate, purchase goods, find transportation, and make connections for their children's
education and their family's health, we begin to see the critical importance of an equitable Global Society that
ensures access to the internet for all.

We've observed the political divisions and differences in opinion about the U.S. federal government ensuring
internet access for families. The United Nations Bill of Human Rights identifies access to the internet as a
                                                            3.1 DIFFERENCES WITHIN AND ACROSS FAMILIES' TECHNOLOGY USE | 125

basic human right. From a family science perspective, the question of access holds different meaning. As
Karraker (2015) noted, "meeting global families where they live regarding digital communication will force
family scholars to continue to examine our very suppositions of what it means to be a family" (p. 70). As we
work to understand how family members and families as a whole differ in their use of technology (in terms of
functions and desired activities; attitudes, comfort, and skill; and access and exposure), we should ask what
this work means to the research we conduct with families, and to the design and delivery of family services.
Further, as we discuss in chapter 12, we must attend to public and social policy that attends to access to the
internet as a basic human right.

Conclusion

As we are cautious to define family, so too are we cautious in assuming how families use technology. Families
are as likely to vary in their use as family members are to vary from one another. The internal dynamics of use
differences are critical to our understanding of communication and relationship dynamics, and to the role
demands that may be fulfilled through the use of ICT. Across families, we see large differences in attitudes
and preferences, and also in factors that policy can address -- most importantly, access, comfort, and skill in
using technology. It is in these differences that knowledge, digital, and information divides occur, divides that
exacerbate inequities in our global society.

In Chapters 4 through 10 we explore specific ways in which family members and subsystems of the family, use
technology and the impacts on their individual and collective well-being.

3.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

    Mapping App to Function

        Look at your phone (smartphone). Examine the range of apps on the device, perhaps writing
        down each one. What do you do with each application? What function does it serve? Consider
        your relationships with friends, partners, and family members. How do you use each application,
        if at all?

    Considering Behavior

     What is your behavior with your smartphone? How would you document it? Provide a list of ways
     that you might observe or track your use. Why might your use matter? In other words, what is the
     impact of your checking your phone frequently during the day? How much time do you spend on
     particular apps?
                         3.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 135

Considering Your Family

Identify each member of your immediate family. List them by name and their role in the family.
Considering devices, applications, attitudes, knowledge and skills, and behaviors, identify use for
each family member. Looking across your family, how are individual members similar or different in
their technology use?

What do those differences mean to:

      Family communication?
      Family connectedness?
      Family conflicts?
      Family strengths?

Access Resources

In this video, a single mother talks about her using the library to access the computers for herself
and her children. After viewing the video, consider options for families like this who don't have
home access to the internet. Identify resources in your town or neighborhood for adults to work/
attend school, for children to complete homework and school projects, and for families to make
connections with others.

    Considering Cross-Family Dynamics

        With another person, have a discussion about your families. How might your families be similar and
        different with regard to technology use, access, and comfort? Are there challenges faced in one
        family but not another? Are their strengths exhibited by one family and not the other?

3.4 BLOG PROMPTS

In the chapter you were asked to consider your own family's use of technology -- variations in each
member's selection and use of devices and application, their attitudes toward technology, their
comfort in using it, and their exposure to it. In comparison with one or two other people, or
thinking of family depictions on television, identify similarities and differences in your own family.
What did you learn? How might understanding your own family be useful (or not useful) to a wider
understanding of the nuances of family technology use?

Karraker (Chapter 3, in Breuss, 2015) talks about the families we don't see when we consider family
technology use. Who are those families? Are they homeless? Migrant families? Mothers fleeing
domestic violence? What might their unseen technology needs or uses be? How can we, as family
professionals and advocates, better identify and understand their uses and needs?

Walker et al. (2011) identified 9 types of parent technology use based on device ownership,
frequency of use of applications, and attitudes toward technology. This was adopted from similar
research done with a general population of adults by John Horrigan and associates at the Pew
Internet and American Life Project.

    1. Why is it useful (or not useful) to see parents as a range of user "types"? What does it mean
        for family professionals who are employing or designing technology applications for work
        with families?

   2. Why was it necessary to look at adult parents when work with adults had already been
        done? How are parents different from the general adult population with regard to their roles
        and technology use?

   Chapter Insights

           ICT can facilitate communication, connection and intimacy in couples, yet it can also bring out
             tensions.

           Couples' use of technology can vary depending on aspects of the couple by member age, age
             or longevity of the relationships, and stage of the relationship. These couple differences play
             out in use of specific technology devices, applications, or functions (e.g., sexting, texting,
             dating apps, gaming).

           Couples differ in their perspectives about the impact of technology on the quality of their
             relationship.

           Cybersex is a part of couple intimacy, yet can feel for some or members of couples
             inappropriate.

           Dating apps and online sites are popular ways that couples initiate relationships, whether for
             a flirtatious hook-up or to seek a long-term partner. There are advantages and
             disadvantages toward finding a committed partner. There are potential negative impacts to
             individual well-being, to wider society.

           Accepted guidelines for healthy couple relationship dynamics (e.g., Gottman) can extend to
             ICT use.
144 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

           It's natural for couples to experience conflict related to technology. More important is how
             they resolve or prevent conflict as a demonstration of flexibility. Guidelines can be co-
             constructed for couples to remain cohesive in the face of technology-related conflict.

           Not surprisingly, technology is a tool for perpetrators of intimate partner violence. There are
             multiple ways that victims can be harassed with ICT. Professionals need to integrated
             technology into prevention and treatment strategies.

           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Introduction

The developmental exploration of ICT in the family begins with the beginning of families, or when couples
first meet (Eichenberg, et al., 2017). It's not hard to see the many ways in which technology is used in couple
initiation -- meeting through dating apps; getting to know each other better through social media profiles
and messaging, texting, and video conferencing. Whether a family consists only of the two people in the
couple, or includes children or other subsystems, couples use ICT in significant ways that maintain the
relationship and fulfill family functions. And they use multiple media in their connections, particularly social
media and mobile technology.

The growth of research on couple technology use has led to new theories, and to theoretical adaptations of

relationship dynamic models that capitalize on the specific affordances of communication through digital

media. Use of ICT is now so prevalent in couple communication that the term POPC, for "permanently

online, permanently connected" (Vorderer & Kohring, 2013) has been coined. These theories address not

only new means for communication, but the wide

variations in couples.                                   Use of ICT is now so prevalent in

This chapter will explore ways in which the ages of      couple communication that the

Equally important is our examination of technology as a source of conflict in couple communication. To offer
a personal example, when my partner goes to a store and texts me to see if we need anything, there's a good

chance I won't the text in time because my notifications are turned off. This results in his feeling frustrated.
Obviously this won't prompt our heading to divorce court, but our shared use of texting for communication
along with our different perceptions of how to use it together present a complexity we didn't experience
before the advent of mobile phones. Conflict can be much more serious, particularly when technology is used
to perpetuate intimate partner violence (IPV).

Background on Couple Relationships

Coupling can mean many things, and doesn't always refer to a serious relationship or commitment. For some,
connecting might be a hook-up for sex, serial dating, or casual dating. For others it's part of seeking a
relationship that leads to commitment and a bond that may be legal, cultural, and involve children or shared
property.

In the U.S., the rate of marriage has declined from 10.0 individuals per 1,000 in 1986 to an all-time low of 5.1
in 2020. Americans are waiting until later in life to get married, if they marry at all, and "nontraditional"
living arrangements are increasingly common. Seen most among Millennials, these changes are due to a
variety of factors, including concerns about the economy, women's education (with women's advanced
education and earning power, they are less dependent on a spouse), and seeing high rates of divorce among
their parents' generation. In terms of finding a partner (for marriage or not), couples cite challenges with
increased mobility, migration, dispersal of social networks, longer commutes, and the demands of work and
school life.

Healthy Couple Relationships

While there are myriad theories and perspectives on couple/marital relationships1, for efficiency we'll focus on
principles from two perspectives.

John Gottman's research2 on sound couple relationships uses the analogy of a house, with trust and
commitment as the "weight-bearing walls." At the foundation, the building of "love maps" is a process of
getting to know each other, ideally better than others do. On the second "floor," partners share admiration
and fondness for each other, each telling the other what they like about them. On Floor 3 they turn toward
one another, not away. This includes knowing each other's cues for response and attending to them. On
Floor 4, working on positive perspectives of each other and themselves in the relationship, partners offer
compassion and understanding rather than criticism. Floor 5 involves managing conflict when it arises --
accepting the partner's motives, discussing programs, and practicing self-soothing. On Floor 6 they make
dreams come true for themselves, the other person, and the couple as a unit. And at the top, Floor 7 finds
couples creating shared meanings through rituals, ceremonies, pet names, memories, and so on -- things that
identify the two people as a defined unit.

Gottman's principles easily relate to the discussion of

family processes in Chapter 2. Communication aids in

relationship processes, fulfillment of roles, and

reinforcement of relationship structures, and over time,

communication and connectivity aid in relational

cohesion. Because the couple, like the family, is an open

system, external influences (like the availability of a

smartphone during face-to-face conversation) can

facilitate conflict, so it is important for partners to show  "TEDxVeniceBeach, John Gottman" by tedxvb is

other's needs and keep focus on the relationship.

Gottman's own institute offers online resources for couples, including a relationship "check-up."

Another perspective blends research, including Gottman's, to characterize couple relationship skills that are
predictive of satisfaction and well-being. A review of the research identified skill areas (Futris et al., 2013)

1. Students may pull from resources in their courses on intimate relationships, family theory, couple and family therapy, contemporary families and
  couples, gender studies, and family sociology to apply to this chapter.

which were later were developed into an inventory of relationship quality: the Couple Skills Relationship

 Manage: attitudes and skills for managing stress

 Connect: attitudes and efforts to embed the couple relationship in support networks (Adler-Baedler, et

al, 2022 p. 282)

Jointly, these areas reflect a conceptual framework built on the foundation of a variety of social, ecological,
and learning theories applied to couples, predictive of positive relationship quality (e.g., positive feelings,
satisfaction, family harmony). Going forward, we'll explore how ICT is used to convey couple relational
dynamics and influence relationship well-being.

As we explore research findings on this topic, a caveat. While significant research on couples and ICT has
been completed by the time this book was written (2022), it remains limited. Not all forms of ICT have been
studied nor studied to the same degree. Great focus, for example, has been given to dating apps and to texting
as a process of communication, and less to videoconferencing, videogames, or virtual reality. Research samples
struggle to reveal couple demographic or global diversity, though there is a certain presence of queer couples
in published literature. Research on age and couple longevity tends to focus more on younger couples and
those in the early throes of a relationship, look at those at the dissolution stage, and explore how ICT can help
couples communicate and coordinate around the needs of their children. Couple research is thus ripe for
more investigation, particularly as devices and platforms for engagement evolve (including virtual reality
dating) and as we further understand potential security pitfalls and privacy threats from individual error (e.g.,
sharing information about a partner online they intended to keep quiet) and data mining. For the most recent
research, readers are encouraged to do Google Scholar/EBSCO or other searches for specific topics, platforms,
couple types, and processes of couple relationships.
148 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

Advancing Relational Theory with Regard to Digital
Technologies

In Chapter 2, we noted that extant theories of family life can help us frame family processes that contribute to
well-being, and examine internal and external influences on those processes in our current age of technology
use. To be sure, the focus should be less on the descriptive use of ICT by families and more on what these
tools and interactions mean to family dynamics and outcomes. Newer theories are being developed to adapt
extant frameworks of the family to new technologies.

The Couple and Family Technological Framework
(revisited)

Hertlein's research on the ways in which couples used technology identified benefits to relationship initiation
and management, along with challenges such as distancing and ambiguity (Hertlein & Ancheta, 2014). This
informed the family technological framework (Hertlein & Blumer, 2013) discussed in Chapter 2.
Relationship communication via the "mediated affordances" of ICT (e.g., anonymity, access) can affect
perception and understanding of relationships; couple conveyance of rules, roles, and boundaries; and couple
relationships as a shifting structure (e.g., from initiation to maintenance). Hertlein's model has been used to
examine a range of couple and family situations, including parenting, videogame playing by couples, and
sexual infidelity. A cogent explanation of the 7As applied to sexual dysfunction is presented in Hertlein et al.,
2017.

Relational Maintenance

Theories focused on interpersonal relationship dynamics abound in the literature on computer-mediated
communication (CMC); many are discussed by Walther and Parks (2002). Some theories explore relationship
components and ICT use, including relationship development, perception, and contexts for interaction.
Mason and Carr (2022) present an excellent overview of the work to adapt relational theory to the realities of
digital technology, and suggest elements to consider in using online technologies to maintain off-line
relationships. As with Hertlein and Blumer's model, they evoke the characteristics and "mediated
affordances" of ICT as actors in relational dynamics. With a foundation of social penetration theory (Altman
& Taylor, 1973), which posits that the reciprocal exchange of information, processed by relational partners
over time, helps progress closeness, Mason and Carr describe six dimensions of digital communications
that influence relationship maintenance:
                                                                                   4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 149

 1. Lightweight interactions: Instant messaging and social network communication offer brief but
      frequent exchanges. Yet as the authors observe, given the social exposure and potential for
      miscommunication, they may come with a cost: "lightweight interactions may be capable of sustaining
      less developed relationships but understanding its role in more developed relationships might prove
      more complicated" (p. 250). And while those in close relationships may use multiple media (e.g., media
      multiplexity), there is evidence that the topic and quality of information across these devices is
      replicated.

 2. Nature of disclosures: Methods of sharing online can be ephemeral (as in Instagram stories), and what
      is intimate seems up for interpretation. The overly social atmosphere of online spaces has led to the need
      to determine what information is personal and what is interpersonal.

 3. Mass personal spaces: Conveying personal messages in wide social spaces can seem less intimate, given
      that they are on a platform shared by many, even when messaging is "private."

 4. Social presence: the sense of being with another person even though they are not nearby. ICT
      modalities allow for sensory and text-based mechanisms for partners to feel the presence of the other.

 5. Ambient awareness occurs when individuals receive messages broadcast by others. In a relationship,
      this allows for the passive observation of information about the other person. Viewing a partner interact
      frequently with another, for example, can lead to feelings of rejection.

 6. Algorithmic proximation: As Mason and Carr (p. 257) succinctly observe, considering online
      interactions, "individuals in a particular relationship are not the only actors who may influence
      relational outcomes. Online information distribution and display are now substantively controlled by
      sophisticated algorithms."

These elements are observed in richer detail as some of the research on how ICT operates in couple
relationships is discussed throughout the chapter.

                                                     couples cite efficiency, ease of use, and mobility

                                                     (Nylander, et al., 2012). Calls and texts enable couples to

device are predictors of positive and continued use. Social media is a mechanism for some couples to

communicate about their relationship (Anderson & Vogels, 2020) and to learn more about potential

partners. Videoconferencing, virtual reality, and augmented reality offer sensory mechanisms for greater

presence. During COVID-19, the news ran a story about an elderly couple who kept in touch using

FaceTime, as one resided in assisted living. Other uses of more sensory mechanisms of mediated

communication include cybersex, or sex-related interactive behavior that includes viewing pornography,

sexting, and web-cam sex.

In a qualitative analysis of college students, with about half in long-term relationships and others in casual
relationships, Hertein and Ancheta (2014) identified themes in technology use by relationship initiation,
management, and enhancement. Relationship management included technology for seeking information,
managing conflict, reducing anxiety, and demonstrating commitment. Relationships were enhanced by using
technology to spice up sexual relationships and stay connected when separated by distance.

If a researcher asked you if technology impacted your relationship, what would you say? Might you want the

researcher to define what they mean by "impact"? In

2014 research by Pew (Lenhart & Duggan), couples     Technology's "impact" on couple

technology use had any impact, and that impact was

positive, with many citing increased connectedness.

Higher rates were found in younger age groups, with 21% of those age 18-29 reporting that technology had a

major impact. A more recent study from Pew (Vogels & Anderson, 2020) also found little impact from

couples viewing others' posting about their relationships on social media. Although 81% reported seeing what
others post about their relationships, within that group most (81%) said it didn't make a difference in their
own relationships, and another 9% said they felt better about their relationships.

There are downsides to using technology in couple relationships, of course. Misunderstandings and
differences in use are common. Couples sometimes experience an imbalance, with one partner using a device
or application in ways that don't include the other or to a greater extent than the other. Videogaming,
viewing pornography, even "phubbing" -- ignoring the partner while with them by focusing on a phone --
can create conflict. Technology is sometimes also used to assert an imbalance of power -- to a lesser degree, by
choosing to hold difficult conversations (or even break up) online rather than in person, and in extreme cases
when stalking, harassing, and withholding a partner's access to technology, as seen with intimate partner
violence. The sections below will offer a closer view of couple use, misuse, and impacts.

Differences in couples

                                             Like families, couples have a developmental trajectory

                                             and develop over time and in stages. Couple relationships

                                             can be defined by time (or length of the relationship) and

                                             by stage. Are the partners just meeting? Making a formal

                                             commitment? Transitioning to childrearing or another

                                             adult life stage, such as home shared ownership? They

                                             might be at the end of the relationship and experiencing

                                             formal separation or divorce. And couples vary by the age

                                             of the individuals. They might be teenagers, young

                                             couples can be viewed by ethnicity, race, religion or

culture, geolocation, age, gender, health status, education and income, and other demographics. These

factors, along with the myriad other factors that influence individual use discussed we've so far, can influence

how technology is used, how it is viewed as a tool in the relationship, and its impact on the well-being of the

relationship.

when the partner is otherwise visible (Commonsense
Media, 2015). They acknowledge that their use of
technology in the relationship can breed possible
miscommunication and discomfort from feelings of
surveillance by the partner, feelings of jealousy, and the
potential for boundaries to be blurred.

Though only just over a quarter (28%) of adults who use social media use it to share about their relationships,
frequencies vary greatly by age. Nearly half (48%) of adults 18-29 years indicate that it is important to show
how much they care about their partner, compared to 10% of those 50 and older. Younger social media users
say it is a way to publicly demonstrate affection for their partner, and be aware of their partner's life
(Anderson & Vogels, 2020). Interestingly, non-white couples and LGBT couples are more likely than white
and straight couples, respectively, to use social media in this way. Those who are younger are also more likely
to see others' post about their relationships on social media. Compared with 91% of adults age 18-29, 75% of
those 50-64 indicate seeing others post about relationships.

Younger adults using social media are also much more likely to check up on exes. While 53% of adults on
average report using social media this way, the frequency reaches 70% among those age 18-29. Not
surprisingly, a greater proportion of younger adults also report feeling jealous and unsure about their
relationship due to their use of social media (34% vs approximately 16% of adults over 50).

By length of the relationship

couples may also be more sensitive to miscommunication prompted by online formats. Relationship length

can moderate negative couple outcomes associated with frequency of Facebook use and Facebook-related

conflict (Clayton et al., 2013). And longer-term couples may use technology together -- sharing email or

Facebook accounts -- since they were together at the advent of the Internet and social media. Couples who

have been together for less time reported feeling closer to the partner due to online or text messaging

of email accounts, for instance, 70% of those who are

Divorced and separated couples (with children)

Beyond the use of technology to file for divorce (Eichenberg, et al., 2017), or apps to help newly solo parents
manage practical challenges after the divorce, technology and communication between separated and
divorced couples is a dominant focus for family professionals. Research examines differences in what is used,
how, and by whom, e.g., texting, email, and social media (Dworkin, et al., 2016; Russell, et al., 2021, Smyth,
et al., 2020). Russell et al. (2021) identified a typology of mediated communication in post-divorce couples
with minor children: those extensively using multiple media, those who mixed face-to-face communication
with phone calls or texting, minimal communicators relying largely on texting, and very limited
communicators using occasional texting. The selection of type of media, frequency, and use relative to desired
intent varies. Couples may, for example choose email for more lengthy communication, to share documents,
and in cases of conflict (Ganong, et al., 2012), and choose asynchronous forms of communication. Divorced
parents may also be more likely to use technology to communicate with and through their children rather
than directly communicating with the co-parent (Dworkin, et al., 2016).
154 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

In Russell et al.'s (2021) research, divorced couples who

use multiple methods of communication were more

likely to rateas cooperative partners, while those using

more limited methods, and who had limited contact,

rated higher as "dissolved duos" or "angry associates."

This reinforces Ganong et al.'s (2012) early conclusion

that use and quality of communication in couples post-

divorce is dependent on relationship quality (amicable or   "Broken Love and Trust" by Jangra Works is

differences in technology selection, with more adversarial

couples choosing to be less present through digital media.

In tracking high-conflict Australian couples post-divorce over a five year period, however, Smyth et al. (2020)

found shifts in technology use, including the use of multiple media, synchronous and asynchronous methods

with ex-spouses, and shifts in frequency and intimacy. They questioned whether technology selection in

divorced and separated couples may be less static than previously understood.

communication. Some states, such as Texas, require divorced couples to use particular apps to pay child

custody or communicate with the partner and children, but non-compliance appears to be an issue.

Video Watching, Gaming, and Cybersex

In addition to texting and the use of social media, technology is used by couples (or by one member of the
couple, influencing the other) in additional ways that have an impact on the relationship. This includes
watching videos, videogaming, and participating in some version of cybersex, which can include sexting,
viewing pornography, or webcam or AR/VR sex. Interestingly, most of these activities are ones couples report
doing in their bedrooms -- a location with sociocultural importance to intimacy and privacy (Salmela et al.,
2019). As with more generic uses of technology for communication in couples, these applications bring both

Video watching

Just as when families co-view media together (Padilla-Walker et al., 2012), couples can feel a greater sense of
connectedness and cohesion when they watch TV, movies, and videos together. (NOTE: This isn't to be
confused with "Netflix and chill." Today the phrase is more of an analogy for having sex.) Recently, viewing
videos on TikTok has become a shared activity for couples. Co-viewing media can involve watching together
in person, co-viewing separately but at the same time, and viewing common media and texting about it or
posting to a social media account the other person follows closely.

This piece in the popular press cites a psychologist's take on making a long distance relationship work as a
"TikTok" couple. While research isn't cited, the conclusions are reasonable given research on couple
emotional contagion, social connectedness, and cohesion (Zilich, 2020). Sharing the platform may put couple
members in a good mood and/or lower stress levels, give them a cooperative task that allows them to problem
solve and create a joint project (such as doing a "Flipped the Switch" dance video), share an emotional
experience (and talk about it), and take a break from their usual routine. This might be especially valuable
during long periods of time under restriction, such as COVID-19 or bad weather.
156 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

Gaming

                                                          Gaming can be a source of connection, allowing

                                                          partners to share an interest and a source of

                                                          intimacy. According to the Entertainment Software

                                                          Association (ESA), in 2021, 42% of videogame

                                                          players played with a spouse or partner; another

                                                          23% reported meeting their spouse or partner

(57%) use a smartphone or a gaming device (46%), those using a smartphone are more likely to play casual

games like Tetris, whereas those on devices will play action games. As we'll discuss in Chapter 9, videogames

are also popular with families, and as a way for parents to monitor their children's online time and to model

safe use.

For most couples, game playing has a neutral effect on the relationship (Coyne et al., 2012). Challenges are
possible when one partner's time playing upsets the other's expectations for time spent together. Some
couples experience conflict over the time spent by one member, particularly if it means exposure to others
who present a threat to the relationship. In some cases, partners identify aggression brought out by gaming as
a source of conflict in the relationship.

Smith (2012), in research on attachment behaviors in committed couples based on perceptions of partners'
videogame use, reports that the male's violent videogame use and the female's nonviolent videogame use
predicted the perception and that videogames were a problem in the relationship, and this perception
predicted less attachment behaviors, which was a fully mediated relationship for both. The female's view that
videogames were a problem negatively predicted both her and her partner's attachment behaviors, while the
male's view only predicted his attachment behaviors.

Cybersex: Sexting/Cybersex and Pornography

Online sexual activity can influence the couple relationship. When conducted together, online sexual
interactions -- whether exchanging sexts or viewing online pornography together -- enables couples,
sometimes geographically separated, to experience greater intimacy in their relationship. Necessary distancing
during COVID-19, and concerns about the transmission of disease including sexually transmitted disease, led
                                                                                    4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 157

the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (2020) to state, "The new `really safe' sex in
many cases may require `e-sex.'"

Definitions of cybersex vary widely. Beyond sexting, the exchange of sex-related materials, and viewing
pornography alone and as a couple, it can also mean use of augmented reality or VR, and of sex-robotics,
anticipated to be a future trend (Dring 2017). A review of TMSI (technology-mediated sexual interaction)
by Courtice and Shauggnessey (2017) indicates that research in this area tends toward the negative (e.g.,
cybersex addiction) rather than taking a more neutral approach to studying the behavior. A small portion of
individuals develop cybersex addiction (Giordano & Cashwell, 2017, suggest 10%), yet Eichenberg et al.
(2017) observe that much of the research is self-reported and that many using the internet for sex don't see
their use as a problem, so accuracy in prevalence is hard to gauge. And critical consensus of the research finds
it lacking (Banerjee & Rao, 2021; Courtice & Saughnessey, 2017). Banerjee and Rao (2021, p. 7) observe:

      Besides cross-cultural and cross-country, research should focus on cultural effects on virtual sexuality and
      effects of cybersex on psychosexual health. Longitudinal mixed-method studies and exploring lived experiences
      related to partnered and solo sex are essential to formulate policies and guidelines that can be rooted within the
      participant perceptions.

      Because if we are moving toward more than increasing our understanding of family life through research, to
      practice and policy, including requirements around consent between couples, it is essential that the work be
      both rigorous and representative of the phenomenon as facilitated by cyber-technology.

Sexting

While sexting -- sending sexually provocative texting or

images via digital technology -- is not an activity that the

majority of couples participate, it represents normative

couple behavior and intimacy and is present in a

significant minority. Research with 615 demographically

representative couples in the U.S. and Canada revealed

that most (71%) didn't sext, 14.5% were "word" sexters,

and 14% were frequent or hypersexters (Galovin, et al.,

2018). In that study, sexters were more likely to be

younger (though older than adolescents) and                   "Pro Juventute Aufklrungskampagne ,Sexting'
homosexual, and to use media and view pornography.            Themenbild_09" by Pro Juventute is licensed

age groups. Those between 18-24 were most likely (44%

of the subsample) to receive sexts, whereas those 25-34 were most likely (22% of the subsample) to send sexts.

That said, occasional reports in the media single out individuals such as Anthony Weiner, a former New York
158 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

congressperson who was given 21 months in jail for sending sexts to a 15-year-old, or cases of a school teacher
or coach. Sexting is also related to couple duration and stage. Those more likely to receive sexts are those who
are single, those not in a relationship or those whose relationship is 10 years or less.

A meta-analysis of sexting research (Kosenko et al., 2017) found a positive relationship between sexting and
sexual activity, having unprotected sex, and number of sexual partners. Galovin et al. (2018) determined that
relationship satisfaction among sexters wasn't significantly different from non-sexters, though they were more
likely to express sexual satisfaction in the relationship. Other relationship variables for sexters were less
positive, in measurements of commitment, ambivalence, and conflict.

Still, partner context appears to matter greatly. Those in trusting, safe relationships (whether gay or straight)
may have a different sexting experience than others. And Courtice and Shaughnessey (2017) indicate that
relationship impact research is so variable that it's difficult to offer firm conclusions.

One aspect of sexting that is not variable is the existence of state pornography laws. Each state has laws around
sexting, particularly around sending or receiving messages to a minor or a person under the age of 18. These
laws can catch individuals unaware; for example, an 18-year-old sending a picture of a 16-year-old is
considered pornography. Non-exclusive factors that determine if "a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a
`lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area'" under 18 US Code 2255(2) (E),4 the definitions section
of the statutory scheme (Id. at 830)," include:

       1. whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area;

       2. whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive (i.e., in a place or pose generally

            associated with sexual activity);

       3. whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the

            child;

       4. whether the child is fully or partially clothed or nude;

       5. whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; and

       6. whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer (Id. at 832).

            (Strassberger, et al, 2019).

It is essential that teenagers and those who may be in relationships with teenagers are acutely aware of state
laws regarding the sending of sexts to underage minors. Sexting and adolescents is discussed further in chapter
5.

Viewing pornography

Pornography viewing is another mechanism for potential couple satisfaction, particularly as it might enhance
foreplay. The internet makes it easy to find just about any type of porn, while also ensuring certain anonymity.
It's reported that 25% of all internet searches relate to pornography, as do 35% of all internet downloads. Yet
viewing pornography may also lead to conflict, particularly when one partner views it in the absence of the
other (Gingrich, 2017).

Men are more likely to view porn than women. A study from the Wheatley Institute examined heterosexual
individuals and paired couples in committed relationships, (defined as seriously dating, cohabiting, or
married; Willoughby et al., 2021). There were clear gender differences about viewing hard-core pornography
(defined as featuring depictions of actual sex acts that display full nudity), with men either married or never
married reporting nearly double the frequency as women. Married (51%) and dating (36%) women reported
never viewing pornography at higher rates than men. Younger men (under 30) were also more likely to view
pornography. Other research supports these gender differences in pornography viewing in couples.
Unmarried men and women in couples report viewing porn at about the same frequency. It's interesting that
men and women aren't very good at estimating what the other does. Whether it's viewing hard-core or soft-
core porn, women underestimate the percentage of men who view it, and men overestimate rates of women as
viewers.

Across all gender and couple status groups, attitudes toward viewing pornography were positive in the
Wheatley study for the majority (about 80%), particularly when asked about viewing as adults (whether
married or unmarried). Far fewer individuals were positive about teenagers viewing porn. More men than
women also saw viewing porn as helping foreplay (50-60%, depending on couple status, compared to
40-50%).

Does viewing pornography introduce conflict to the couple? Or might it positively contribute to couple
intimacy, particularly since sexual satisfaction is a component of a happy relationship? Reviews of the research
show mixed results (Webster, 2022). There is evidence that supports that viewing pornography together
positively contributes to couple satisfaction. In the Wheatley study, couples who did not view pornography
had high ratings on measures of stability, commitment and relationship satisfaction. Ratings were positive yet
lower in couples who did view pornography, and lowest for those who did not view it together and when
porn viewing by a partner was frequent. Sexual satisfaction was rated similarly whether or not couples viewed
porn.

In the Wheatley study, about 20% of couples said viewing pornography contributed to conflict. Men may

conflict. On the data that correlates viewing with

marital dissatisfaction, Webster (2022) and Gingrich (2017) observe research limits identifying the direction

of the relationship: do those who have poor relationships turn to porn, or does viewing porn contribute to

poor relationships? Considering homosexual and heterosexual couples, couple impact of partner viewing of

pornography (the man in a heterosexual relationship) depends on context (Gingrich, 2017). Viewing porn

can affect men's feelings of intimacy, sexual satisfaction, and perception of sexual freedom with partners when

men have a positive level of partner disclosure. Attachment level also appears to matter. Men with insecure

attachment may turn to viewing pornography as a way to disengage and avoid perceived challenges with

partners.

Technology-Related Conflict and Resolution

While ICT can enhance communication efficiency and personal connectedness, it's clear that it can also
produce conflict for couples. Consider a possible conflict that might arise between a couple. How might
technology relate to that conflict, and how does it influence the couple's relationship? Whether it's looking at
a partner's phone, checking on exes through social media, or feeling jealous or underconfident in the
relationship based on the partner's social media use, younger adults are more likely than those in other age
groups to report these challenges, as are those who are not married but in relationships. Hertlein and Ancheta
(2014) identified themes in couple interference and technology that will be used to structure this section. The
themes are validated by the work of other researchers exploring couples' technology use (e.g., Vaterlaus and
Tulane's study of married couples, 2019).

Issues observed

Distancing

Messaging by text or by sext can seem impersonal to some, removing the individual's self and interest in the
communication. Phubbing in couples (also labeled PPhubbing, or Partner Phubbing), a type of
technoference (McDaniel & Coyne, 2016) has been widely studied. As indicated below, even among married
                                                                                    4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 161

and committed couples, over half indicate that their partner is distracted by their phone. Nearly as many
report feeling bothered by the amount of time spent on the phone.

                              https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/05/08/

Negative effects of phubbing in couples include perceived effects on intimacy, reduced relationship
satisfaction, reduced sexual satisfaction, diminished sense of quality time, and effects on partner mental
health. Wang et al. (2019) examined married couples in China and found that phubbing related to depression
and negatively related to relationship satisfaction. There was also an indirect relationship to depression based
on the impact on satisfaction, meaning that as a partner's satisfaction in the relationship decreased due to
phubbing, they felt depressed.
Another study with married couples in China (Chen et al., 2022) looked at the transmissive effects of
162 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

phubbing, or one partner ignoring the other after they have been ignored. It is fairly common for couples to
pick up each other's behavior due to their interdependence and time together. The Wang et al. study found
that men were likely to start phubbing when their wives did it, but women were not. The authors observed
that this could be an effect of gender role socialization. This study also validated the connection between
phubbing and relationship satisfaction, but demonstrated that lower satisfaction was an influence on
phubbing.
Women in the U.S. are more bothered than men by being ignored. While percentages are rather low overall
(16% being the highest of all groups), for all media -- phones, social media, and videogames -- women are
more likely to report feeling dissatisfied when their partners are on these devices.

                 https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/05/08/
                 dating-and-relationships-in-the-digital-age/

Long-term German couples, ranging in age from 29-72 and averaging 22 years together, were studied for
personal (attachment anxiety), gender, and relationship influences on phubbing (Brning & Wartberg, 2022).
The behavior was more likely in younger couples. Authors interpreted this as the long-term couples being
                                                                                   4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 163

stable in their relationships, communication, and coping and conflict resolution patterns. Attachment
orientation was highly correlated with phubbing perceptions. In other words, long-term couples that have
developed an increased sensitivity toward each other due to an insecure attachment orientation may perceive
phubbing as more damaging to the quality of the relationship.

Couples can also avoid issues by focusing on their phones, or address challenging topics by asynchronous text
rather than having a face-to-face conversation. Even having a phone out while spending time together can feel
like a distraction and interfere with the feelings of intimacy (Turkel, 2015).

Impaired trust/Breaking boundaries

Couples indicate that it's easy for their partners to hide texts or sexts to others, and to hide online activity,
including social media (e.g., following an "ex"). This can create concerns over infidelity, also called "digital
jealousy" (Eichenberg, et al., 2017). It should be noted, however, that definitions of infidelity using the
internet are somewhat "messy," to use Vossler's (2016) term. Some common factors include attempts toward
privacy, using access and anonymity features of the internet, and abrupt discovery. Vossler's review suggests
that couple impacts of cyber-infidelity are similar to those from infidelity offline: partner distrust, relationship
conflict, and potential dissolution.

Couples, especially younger ones, may use social media to gather information about their partner's activities.
And as social media is a popular way to check up on exes, knowing this can lead existing partners to feel
jealous or suspicious.
164 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

Looking at a partner's phone or social media account can break boundaries, and doing so without permission
is a sure way to damage trust. Regardless of age, commitment status, or other demographics, nearly  of
couples (71%) agree that it is not appropriate for a partner to look through another partner's phone without
their knowledge. Still, one-third (34%) of couples admit to doing so (Anderson & Vogels, 2020).
                 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 165

Lack of clarity

The final area of challenge for couples is lack of clarity. As we've discussed, users vary widely in their access,
attitudes, comfort, and skill related to technology. One partner, for example, may spend more time on their
phone and frequent social media, while the other tries to avoid social media all together. Differences in texting
patterns, especially, can contribute to miscommunication. When a message isn't returned, or is returned late
or with an ambiguous wording, a partner can question the motivation or misinterpret the message (Vaterlaus
& Tulane, 2019). Ambiguity in text messages is a common issue, as is the use of emojis (Miller et al., 2017).
When couples get into significant issues through texting (e.g., confrontations, apologies), one or more
members can feel uncomfortable (Novak et al., 2016).

Talking about it

Most couples don't discuss social media use as a possible relationship issue, though individual
partners may have implicit rules that need to be discussed. Digital jealousy appears not to be
medium-specific, and is dependent on individual couple perception of cheating (Eichenberg, et
al., 2017). Interview research with committed couples regarding technology use as integrated
into daily life offered a process model of how boundaries and rules are negotiated (the
definition of "committed" was left up to the couples; no time length or status marker was
supplied by the researchers; Pickens & Whiting, 2019; Cravens & Whiting, 2015). The authors
suggested that professionals, understanding this process, can offer suggestions to help couples
with conflict resolution.

     Step one: identify the online issue, including past issues or inappropriate behaviors
     Step two: appraise the online issue, implicit rules, explicit rules, and rule consensus
     Step three: discuss the online issue, providing evidence, justifying the behavior, or

        explaining the perspective
      Step four: achieve resolution for monitoring and successful communication, or explore

        consequences that might lead to breaking up

Couples might want to ask:

      Are there any websites that you believe would be inappropriate for me to visit?
      When I use a social media site, are there groups of users or specific people with whom

        you would be uncomfortable with me interacting?
166 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

             Is there any information you feel should or should not be posted online about me you or
                our relationship?

             Do you consider pornography to be a violation of our relationship?

       Couples therapist Veronica Marin (2017) offered the following relationship tips:

            1. Make your partner feel more important than your phone, spending at least 20 minutes a
                day of screen-free time together.

           2. Check in before posting anything about the relationship.
           3. Set expectations for texting.
           4. Comment online as though in real life.
           5. Don't snoop on a partner's behavior; give your partner the benefit of the doubt when, for

                example, they're friending an ex.
           6. Address discomfort quickly. If a a partner is snooping or microcheating, discuss reasons

                rationally.

Serious conflict: Intimate Partner Violence and technology

Cyberstalking, psychological abuse, technology restriction, and technology-facilitated sexual violence are

forms of intimate partner violence with technology, or tIPV (Duerkson et al., 2019). Cyberstalking can

include sending threatening messages, selling or

purchasing items online in the victim's name,           Cyberstalking can include

stalker contact is challenging for victims.

tIPV is prevalent among victims of intimate partner violence. A review of records from survivors of IPV
between 2012 and 2016 revealed that 60-63% indicated technology-related abuse (Messing et al., 2020). Yet
tIPV is also not clearly or consistently defined, and domestic abuse agencies may not yet recognize the power
or potential of technology to produce consequences to the victims similar to those that take occur IRL.
Assessing technology-based abuse, Messing et al. asked: "Has your partner used technology or social media to
monitor your interactions with other people?" and "Has your partner used technology or social media to
monitor your whereabouts?" and in a separate sampling, "Has your abusive partner used technology to
harass, stalk, impersonate, watch over or threaten you?" While their quantitative analysis offered statistics,
their qualitative analysis illustrated the subjective nature of online behavior that can muddy the ability to
assess it. For example, some may refer to monitoring as stalking, while others relate it to a neutral or loving
motivation (e.g., ensuring safety after a drive in dangerous conditions).

In a survey of Canadian college students, Duerksen et al. (2021) looked at predictors of tIPV. Social media
was more prevalent as a medium for perpetrating violence, as it offered more ways to harass a victim, although
it is also riskier in that it's more public. The researchers also found that in-person harassment and
technological disinhibition were predictors of tIPV. The authors suggested that rather than technology
creating more aggressors, it gives those with the propensity to stalk and harass additional means, particularly
those comfortable with using technology.

The prevalence and likely increase in the use of technology for IPV requires that agencies and professionals
working in this area integrate ICT in their strategies for prevention and treatment. The Canadian government
includes technology-facilitated violence in its list of types of IPV. Others also offer guidance. As Woodlock
(2017, p. 399) observes, "If women are to use mobile technologies safely, technology-facilitated stalking needs
to be treated as a serious offense, and effective practice, policy, and legal responses must be developed to
address the use of technology as a tactic for abuse."

ads.

Early research indicated that online technologies facilitated couple connections through shared interests (such
as through virtual gaming; these are naturally forming connections), networked friends (networked
relationships), intentionally sought relationships (targeted relationships), and digitally assisted relationship
initiation, such as meeting in person then continuing online/through text (Sprecher, 2009). With the advent
of the internet and social media, sites such as eHarmony and match.com and matchmaking services like It's
Just Lunch offered efficient and somewhat tailored connections to others. And Grindr, an app for gay men,
streamlined mate selection among the early dating apps developed around 2009 (Schwartz & Pelotta, 2018).

  Eichenberg et al. (2017) identify different formats for finding dates online (p. 250):
         (1) single exchanges where flirt contacts dominate,
         (2) partner exchanges which correspond most closely to the traditional contact advertisement,
         (3) erotic dating/casual dating portals that aim to provide non-binding sex contacts,
         (4) niche providers, i.e., specialized platforms with the objective of connecting people with specific
         interests and preferences, and
         (5) social dating (e.g. Tinder), usually operated via smartphone, and including the special feature of
         users having the opportunity to display contacts in their immediate proximity.

  As evident in this chart from Pew Research3 (Anderson et al., 2020), 30% of U.S. adults, and 52% of those
  who have never been married, report ever using a dating app or site. There is greater use by those who are
  younger, correlating to exposure to dating apps and culture of use among peers. The median age of those
  using a dating site was 38; compared to 29 among those using a dating app. And as indicated below, LGBT
  adults were nearly twice as likely to report ever using a dating app or site.

There are other ways of finding dating partners online, of course, including using social media to get
information about someone or to ask someone for a date. Not surprisingly, social media is more popular with
teens, who say they show interest by "friending" or "liking" a post or by sharing, though this is now likely to
occur through more popular platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
With the growing frustration with dating in the 21st century (at least according to this report), do these apps
help? They've seemed to enter the public perception as an option for finding dates, with reactions widely
varied as to whether they have a positive or negative effect (Anderson et al., 2020). Perceptions of their safety
vary as well, though those who voice more concern have never used a dating app.
                 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 171

Reasons for use

The major reasons that people use online dating include meeting those who share similar interests or hobbies,
meeting people who share beliefs and values, finding someone for a longterm relationship or marriage, having
a schedule that makes it hard to meet interesting people in other ways, or meeting people who just want to
have fun without being in a serious relationship (Eichenberg, et al., 2017). COVID-19 and its imposed
isolation made finding dates a particular challenge.

Online platforms can help users overcome barriers in relationship initiation. These may be physical barriers
such as geographic proximity, or psychosocial barriers such as shyness. Asynchronous conversation can give
individuals time to prepare a response, and can accommodate those with different schedules. Online
initiation also enables a presentation of self in ways that minimize "gating features" (McKenna et al., 2002)
such as physical appearance or voice quality that affect initial impressions. Although dating sites and
applications include features that approximate reality through photos, videos, and videoconferencing, at each
step of the relationship formation process, individuals have agency over the degree of personal information
they divulge.

Online sites may be more effective for those seeking others in "thin markets," or niche markets (Scwartz &
Pelotta, 2018), or seeking those harder to find in real life. For example, if someone lives in a rural area and is
looking for an LGBTQ partner, it may be easier to find that person through an online site. Online sites may
also be more effective from a safety standpoint. In the above example, online sites are often safer, especially in
rural communities, as in-person encounters may be met with a hate crime.

Though dating apps can be efficient and offer control, there is a heavy need for self-branding and self
commodification (Hobbs et al., 2017). Indeed, Bauman (2013) argues that the security of relationships has
been compromised by technological change, specifically in the way that our use of the internet and digital
technologies has created a game of commodification -- or the selling and packaging of the self. For some, this
type of exposure can ultimately be harmful to that self. Dating apps can also introduce possible
miscommunication, misrepresentations, and damage to new relationships or to an individual. 4

  "The Tinder Swindler."

similar to those ocurring offline: two people meet each

other through a conveyance that offers filtering --

through friends, at a known neighborhood bar,

activities, through an online service that provides information. In nearly all classes, students offered evidence

of marriages resulting from the use of dating apps (including students' mothers or fathers in second

marriages), and satisfaction with the outcome depending on intention.

In Pew's 2019 research, the majority (61-71%) of those using dating apps reported positively that the apps
help in finding someone who is physically attractive, has shared interests, that they wanted to meet in person,
and who shared their ideas for a relationship (Anderson, et al., 2020). Within these numbers there were
differences by gender (e.g., men finding it harder to find someone who shared their interests), and education
(e.g., those with less education reported less success). Two-thirds (66%) of online daters have gone on a date
with someone they met on sites, and 23% of online daters have entered into marriages or long-term
relationships with someone they met. Older research following couples who met online indicates that their
marriages or committed status relationships were as stable and happy as others. In one study, online couples
married sooner after their first meeting, compared with others (Baker, 2004), and were positive about their
futures together. In another, couples who met through social media, using networked connections, did not
have a higher risk of divorce or separation than those who met offline (Hall, 2014). And in a third study from
                                                                                    4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS | 173

a national survey in the U.S., couples who met online dated more and had a lower rate of separation than
those meeting offline (Aditi, 2014).

In Hobbs et al.'s research (2017), daters said that while apps may be superficial, they're pleased when they are
selected by another person. The majority said that apps gave them a feeling of control in finding partners, and
87% said it gave them more opportunity for finding partners by expanding the size and scope of their social
network. Just over half (55%) reported that it helped them find a date or, for 25%, a sexual partner.
Nevertheless, participants indicated that they would prefer face-to-face searching. Qualitative investigation
within this study revealed that, for some, using the dating app had a therapeutic benefit. After experiencing a
personal setback, the representation of the self they wanted to be offered validation and encouragement.

Satisfaction also appears to be related to understanding how apps work (i.e., how matches are made) and an
awareness of digital data sharing. In Pew's 2019 research, just over half (58%) of those who used dating apps
indicated knowing the realities of "match-making." (Turner & Anderson, 2020). The majority (69%) of those
reporting positive experiences understood the matching process. They were more likely to report that using
the apps had a mostly positive impact on their dating and relationships, which may or may not include
believing in the effectiveness of the algorithm. Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist and academic who worked as a
consultant on a dating app's creation (Scwartz & Pellotta, 2018), observes that "the majority of these sites
offer no hard evidence to show that their algorithms can actually procure better dates, partners, marriages, sex
lives, etc. than human judgment alone." (p. 62). Perhaps positive perception leans toward efficiencies in
finding people and filtering a vast (or, in some cases, expanding a limited) pool.

How dating apps work

How companies' algorithms create matches is uncertain. Heilwell's reporting on the topic points to the
artificial intelligence (AI) that uses data provided by the user, "likes" by the user, and "likes" about the user, in
addition to data from add-on services (which helps make the apps free). Tinder incorporates data about use of
the platform (location, activity), and platforms like Hinge track likelihood of exchanging phone numbers and
satisfaction after dates. Heilwell also notes that data from other users of the app can inform who is matched
with a singular user in something called "collaborative filtering."

Understanding how apps work may also involve seeing the gamification elements that keep them interesting.
Bumble, for instance, makes matches disappear after 24 hours if they aren't contacted. Other game-like
features include continuous scrolling, delivering prospects at a certain time, and, of course, the thrill of
"matching." While making dating apps fun to use, these elements can also make them quite time-consuming.
The amount of time that people spend on dating apps leads to questions of their actual time-saving nature.

Challenges

For all of their efficiencies and effectiveness (perceived and real), dating apps can create challenging
experiences. Early critics were concerned that the open nature of dating online, as with social media in
general, would lead to less civil behavior, and some users -- particularly women and LGBTQ users -- do feel
harassed and unsafe There are concerns as well about data sharing and privacy. And even just using the apps
can lead many (45% in Pew's study, Anderson et al., 2020) to feel fatigued and frustrated. The "paradox of
choice" can stymie the ability to choose from such a vast array of matches. Eisenberg et al. (2017) observes
that finding people online sets up an unrealistic expectation of the "optimal partner," making relationships
seem superficial and non-binding.

Safety and civility

Interestingly, most users of dating apps (70%) feel that it's common for people to lie about themselves to seem
more desirable (Anderson et al., 2020). Fifty-four percent of online daters say that someone else has seriously
misrepresented themselves on their profile, and 28% have been contacted in a way that made them feel
harassed or uncomfortable. A breakdown of those reporting negative interactions is shown below. Across the
four questions asked in Pew's research, LGBT daters were significantly more likely to report having
experienced harassment. While these behaviors can also occur in offline encounters, networked, efficient
internet can make the fall-out from use of dating apps a greater possibility.

Another issue of safety lies with the internet's efficiency and speed in finding information (or people) that
align with specific search interests. Eichenberg et al. (2017) write about "barebacking" (a metaphor for having
unprotected sex), and those who search online to heighten the risk of infecting themselves with HIV or other
sexually transmitted disease).

Data sharing and privacy

Like other interactive applications, dating apps collect user data, including age, gender identification, gender
preferences, religion, political affiliation, and location (Heilwell, 2020). And users share videos, photos, and
potentially their activity on social media. While visiting an app, data from other sites visited is fed to the app
and used for marketing purposes and sales to third-party companies. Those concerned about privacy and data
176 | 4.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS

sharing report less positive experiences with dating apps. In the Pew study, 58% of users reported concern
about data sharing. In nearly the same frequency as those reporting knowledge of how the apps work
(approximately 67%), those concerned over privacy and data sharing reported having negative experiences and
viewed the apps as having a negative impact on their relationships. Slightly greater concern was expressed by
older users (30 and up).

With this overview of ICT use by couples within the family and in couples on the way to building family, we
now move to children's use of ICT across the complex trajectory of their development from birth through
young adulthood. With a systems perspective of families, as you read, consider how other members of the
family are affected and affect the impacts of ICT and children.

4.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

Couple Conflict and Technology

Using this table, think of the range of ways in which technology is used by individuals and by
couples for communication, entertainment, information gathering and sharing, tasks of daily life
and work, and so on, and the range of types of technologies, devices, and applications. Consider the
potential conflicts that might arise. Describe them, using words from the frameworks that indicate
the effects and influences of technology.

Couple Differences #1

The chapter addressed couple differences by member age, relationship stage, and relationship
longevity. Select at least three couples that vary in these ways - couples who are older (like your
parents or grandparents) and younger; couples who are early in their relationship and those
together for ten years or more; couples who are at the initiation phase and those who are
committed. Interview them about their technology use -- how it's used for communication, how
the relationship demonstrates levels of trust (e.g., sharing passwords and accounts), where there
might be sources of conflict or misunderstanding.
184 | 4.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Couple Differences #2

     A theme throughout this book is global diversity and differences in access. Identify research on
     couple technology use representative of non-White, non-U.S. couples. Use another characteristic of
     couples discussed in the chapter: couple status, age, socioeconomic status, presence of children, a
     purpose for using technology (e.g., couple initiation and use of dating apps, post-divorce, sexting,
     gaming). Reflect on how easy or challenging it was to find research on this topic, the volume of
     research available, who is doing this research, and what the findings tell you about couple
     technology use compared with what we've covered in this chapter (that predominantly focuses on
     couples in the U.S.).

     Dating Apps #1: Effectiveness of Dating Apps

     People meet through dating apps like Tinder and Grinder more than ever before. Yet are these apps
     effective for finding a long-term partner? Effectiveness can include feeling comfortable in the
     process of meeting others, and apps expose possible challenges to privacy and identity switching
     (e.g., catfishing). Debate the pros and cons of using dating apps for a) casual connections/mutual
     interests and for b) finding a potential partner for a committed relationship.
     How do they compare to more IRL (in real life) ways of finding people?

     Dating Apps #2: The paradox of choice?
                                                                                                                    4.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 185

This short video from CBS Mornings (2019, November 11) focuses on the impact of having too many
choices in dating apps and the potential for de-individualization. View the video. Based on your
own experience, or those of friends or group members, do you agree with this? Disagree?

Dating Apps #3: Serious threats to LGBTQIA+

This article speaks to the choices faced by many in the queer community when using dating apps:
finding ways to connect while avoiding technology that exposes individuals to harassment and
worse (particularly in countries with policies that do not support gender fluid lifestyles and sexual
practices).
Consider the benefits and potential consequences raised in the article. Speak to friends who are
queer, or reflect on your own experiences. What are avenues you'd suggest for safety and well-
being when finding ways to connect?

Technology and Intimate Partner Violence: Bringing the CDC into the 21st Century

This page from the Centers for Disease Control offers helpful information, resources, and guidance
regarding intimate partner violence. But while it was last reviewed in late 2021 (as of this
textbook's writing), there is no mention of technology -- not in the definition, the prevalence data,
or the discussion of consequences. The bottom of the page offers guidelines in six areas. Given
186 | 4.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     what you've read in this chapter and what you know from your own experience and from using
     technology, how might you adapt those guidelines?

4.4 BLOG PROMPTS

In this chapter we examine the use of technology in couple communication and look at differences
within and across couples. The Pew Report reading reported that, in 2014, the majority of
committed couples said that technology did not have an impact on their relationship. They reported
using technology in multiple ways, with use varying by age, but didn't see this use having an
impact. What might couples be considering when they hear the word "impact" in a survey
question? And how might they interpret impact related to a) the strength and quality of their
relationships and b) the use of technology? Consider Hertlein and Blumer's conceptual framework
as a resource to help identify "impacts" as we might view them from the perspective of family
science.

A key consideration about our presence in the online world is the meaning we begin to ascribe to
others. Anthony Weiner, a former legislator in New York who was denounced for his "sexting" with
others (not his wife), said that the exchange felt like a game, that it was superficial. What might the
use of dating apps and technology, which so easily allow us to swipe left and dismiss people, do to
our views of others? Does this use have a lasting effect on our expectations of others or the value
we place on them? Or are we looking at things far too seriously?

Increasingly, couples are bringing technology concerns to therapists' offices as an element of
conflict for resolution. As family professionals, we want to prevent challenges in couple
relationships. Given Gottman's or other professionals' considerations of what a healthy couple
relationship is and can be, if you were leading a workshop on campus, what might you recommend
188 | 4.4 BLOG PROMPTS

     to protect, strengthen, and preserve couple relationships in terms of their individual and shared
     technology use? What topics would you cover? What skills would you want participants to gain
     from attending?

     Throughout the book we cover the many advantages and efficiencies of ICT, most of which are
     enabled on our smartphones. For individuals attempting to flee an aggressive, potentially violent
     partner, phones can be a lifeline to resources. Yet they can also be the way for intimate partner
     violence (IPV) to be perpetrated, in ways not possible in the past. In your blog post, weigh the pros
     and cons of ICT in situations of IPV and take a stand for ways that ICT can be used safely and
     effectively.

Introduction

Interest in children's use of technology and its effect on their well-being and development has captured our
collective interest perhaps more than any other topic on technology and the family. According to UNICEF
(2017), children and adolescents under the age of 18 make up about one-third of internet users worldwide.
Yet, as we've discussed, use is not a uniform concept, nor is technology a stable phenomenon. As a relatively
new phenomenon, interests vary. Populations born in the 1990s and later are growing up with ICT; they
know no other life and are digital natives. Older millennials and earlier generations (including the author's
baby boomer generation), in contrast, saw the internet and personal and mobile digital media come into our
lives; we are, as Marc Prensky put it, digital immigrants. Technology is a marvel and a mystery we view within
an ever-shrinking sense of the "before times," our lives before the internet. We know how we went to school,
met our partners, navigated our way in a new city, and looked up the definition of a word without personal
computers and the internet. We see the ease at which younger millennials and genZ-ers adopt (and depend
on?) devices, use the internet, succumb to the pleasures and trappings of social media, and are advantaged in
their learning by new educational technologies (for those so privileged). And we wonder...

boundless world of information, a universe complementary to a place-based world for interaction and

the benefits be greater? Or smaller? And what conditions encourage those effects?

The chapter addresses ICT use and developmental impacts for children from birth through 18, the age
defined by the UN Convention of Rights of the Child (UNICEF, nd), and through emerging adulthood
(19-25 years).1 Including young adulthood not only contributes a unique period of development to the
discussion (Arnett, 2007), but represents continuity in the parenting experience for many families.

The chapter focuses on the breadth of human development in multiple domains2, technology use by age, and
impacts on the child's developmental well-being. In most cases, use and impacts derive from research and
reports on the specific age group (e.g., middle childhood, adolescence), though they may pull from cross-age
data (e.g., the EU Kids Online study includes ages 9-16). Following the ecological focus of this book, the
chapter applies this approach to human development, and to implications for families, practitioners who
work with children and families, and the wider community, society, and institutions.

As scholars have observed, this digital ecology in which children use and are impacted by technology is not
linear; interactions have transactional and dynamic effects. Conceptual frameworks that lay out the ecological,
transactional nature of technology's use and impact on children encourage readers to formulate questions
about influences on use and on outcomes that the text may in fact answer. If they don't, these are likely

1. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide an exhaustive look at existing research on technology's effects on children, adolescents, and young
  adults. Reports from UNICEF (2017), the ICT Coalition for Children Online (Blum-Ross et al., 2018), WHO (2019), the European
  Commission (Chaudron, et al., 2017), OECD (Gottschalk, 2019), Pew Research, Commonsense Media, the TEC Center at the Erikson Institute,
  Ernest et al. (2014), and more produced every year, offer summaries from U.S., international and global studies.

  provided. Readers are also encouraged to refer to open-source textbooks on human development, such as https://open.maricopa.edu/devpsych/.

excellent research questions that individual readers may want to pursue through discussion, a literature
search, or a project.

The family-perspective focus of this book encourages us to emphasize the benefits and challenges that reflect
parenting interests (Auxier, et al., 2020; Livingstone & Blum-Ross, 2020) and parenting influence
(CommonsenseMedia, 2016; Coyne, et al. 2017; Livingstone & Blum-Ross, 2020; Wartella, et al., 2013). This
includes the wider ecology of children's lives and the internet as part of those lives -- and of their families --
as a critical component of focus. As Sonia Livingstone and co-authors observed (2015)

      As the internet has become a routine part of children's lives, embedded into their lifeworld in a host of
      increasingly taken-for-granted ways, research is called to examine children's engagement with the world not
      only on but more importantly through the internet. Arguably, the question is no longer just that of children's
      relationship with the internet as a medium, but also with their relationship with the world as mediated by the
      internet in particular and changing ways. (p. 9)

Perspectives on Human Development

To set the stage for the chapter, and for our understanding of human development in context and the
influence of technology at multiple levels, we review Bronfenbrenner's bioecological perspective of human
development with an updated perspective specific to children's technological realities. This review both
contemporizes standing theory and lends itself to identifying frameworks for research, policy, and industry
action.

General overview of human development

Individual perspectives on human development refer to the domains of cognition and learning, physical
change, socio-emotional growth, and psychological functioning. Each domain operates as a whole, and
trajectories of growth in each follow universal dimensions (i.e., those normative aspects expected of all human
beings) expressed in unique ways depending on the DNA of the individual and the contexts that facilitate
that expression. During puberty, for example, the expression of secondary sexual characteristics such as breasts
and body hair due to increasing levels of gonadal steroids is normative in individuals who were assigned to be
female at birth (AFAB). Yet the the timing of when breasts and body hair develop, and the expression of
breast size and hair thickness, are unique to the genetic material of the individual. So while we regard
202 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

developmental expectations across ages of children that are somewhat predictable, we also respect that there is
variation and great individual difference.

An ecological focus

Studies of individual development through interaction with technology can focus on a physiological level and
one quite unique to the developing organism. For example, a researcher might study eye gaze, visual scanning,
and face recognition on video images in very young infants (e.g., 6 months, Smith et al., 2021). Or sleep
quality and duration might be examined in children related to blue screen exposure and the suppression of
melatonin (Hale et al., 2019). Because children do not grow up in a laboratory under constant conditions,
research on human development also tries to control for and understand the influence of context (e.g.,
nurture vs. nature). The child's context encourages questions about conditions that influence these
outcomes. In the case of blue screens and sleep, might the timing or the content of the media (as influenced by
actors in the child's setting) play a role? Individual difference theories propose that sleep disturbances may
drive technology use: isn't it possible that children with poor sleep (due to context influences such as stress)
turn to their computers, which exacerbates sleep challenges?

When talking about interpreting quantitative data on the impact of educational technologies and children's
learning, Scott McLeod (2022) stated in a discussion forum of ISTE (International Society for Technology in
Education):

      One of the challenges of education is that everything is always so contextual. Kids vary, families vary,
      institutional climate and history vary, our educators vary... everything varies -- quite significantly -- across
      schools, culture, geography, time, and context. In other words, what works for one school may not for another,
      simply because of context or timing (and vice versa). Teasing this out is incredibly challenging but "why did it
      work (or not)?" is a much more important question than "did it work (or not)?"

With clear respect to the ongoing research on technology's impact on the biological and physiological
processes of the developing organism, our focus on developmental outcomes places focus on contextual
influences.

Neo-ecological perspective: "Technologizing Bronfenbrenner"

A critical contribution to the study of human development and the role of technology was offered in 2022 by
Navarro and Tudge. By "technologizing Bronfenbrenner," the authors make two important enhancements to
the traditional model that nests systems of interactions as processes that occur over time. As noted in previous
chapters, Bronfenbrenner's model features contexts of interactions, most proximal to the developing
individual (microsystem), including the mesosystem (two or more microsystem interactions), exosystem
                                           5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 203

(interactions that influence development yet one of which does not directly contain the individual), and
microsystem (wider forces such as culture or public policies) that have an indirect yet potent influence on
development. For their first adaptation, Navarro and Tudge identify two parallel and interacting
microsystems.

 Used with permission.

The internet is added as an environment for personal interaction alongside the physical. Their
proposed virtual setting is defined as

      A virtual microsystem is a pattern of activities, social roles, and interpersonal relations experienced by the
      developing person on a given digital platform with particular relational and symbolic features that invite,
      permit, or inhibit, engagement in proximal processes within that environment. (p. 4)

Unique characteristics of the virtual microsystem include synchronous and asynchronous interactions, which
  204 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

  affect the individual's availability and presence; interactions that operate publicly and are persistent due to the
  ability of platforms to store data that can be retrieved; and interactions that occur with limited interpersonal
  cues. They observe that the individual can exist in virtual and physical microsystems at the same time, and
  that interactions in which the individual engages define the opening and closing of virtual microsystems.

  Then, after accepting Bronfenbrenner's definitions of the mesosystem and ecosystem as inclusive of the
  digital world, they adapt the macrosystem with an integration of Tudge's (2008) definition of culture:

        A group of people who share a set of values, beliefs, and practices; who have access to the same institutions,
        resources, and technologies; who have a sense of identity of themselves as constituting a group; and who
        attempt to communicate those values, beliefs, and practices to the following generation. (pp. 3-4)

  The adapted macrosystem effects indicate how "the rapid adoption of digital technology likely differentially
  impacts the development of adolescents depending upon the values and beliefs, resources, and social structure
  of their society" (Navarro & Tudge, 2022, p. 8). They offer the example of lower-income teens from Ghana
  using the internet for health information -- a finding contrary to most research supporting the behavior in
  higher-income children -- as a response to a more sexually repressive culture. Ghanian teens seek out the
  internet for information that is not otherwise available to them. Government censorship of the internet, as in
  China, is another culturally specific influence from the macrosystem. And certainly a key marcrosystem force
  is the digital divides created by differentials in access to the internet and to devices.

  The second contribution from Navarro and Tudge's technologic adaptation of Bronfenbrenner's framework
  focuses on the person-process-context-time construct Bronfenbrenner used to explain how development
  occurs across influences from proximal and distal systems. In so doing, they integrate examples of personal
  characteristics that influence systems interactions, and also serve as outcomes, sub-labeled as force, resource,
  and demand. Time characteristics include micro time, meso time, and macro time, and then proximal
  processes, or "the conduit for synergistic interrelations between the characteristics of the person and their
  environments across time" (p. 11). They assert that proximal processes can take three forms: symbolic,
  relational, and complex, and observe that

        development is the result of the multidirectional interrelations, or synergy, between these constituent elements.
        Person characteristics, context, and time are interdependent; all three forces synergistically shape "the form,
        power, content, and direction of the proximal process" (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006, p. 798), which in
        turn influence elements of the person, context, and time. As such, operationalizing neo-ecological theory
        requires scholars to embrace longitudinal designs and to gather data not only about people and their
        environments but also about the interactions and activities going on within them. (p. 13).3

3. Readers are encouraged to review Navarro and Tudge's original article and consider how their own research questions on technology's influence
  situate in this neo-ecological framework.

EU Kids Online Framework

The research framework adopted by a set of researchers in the European Union conveys a related notion of
contextual influence on children's technology use as an interaction across multiple settings. The framework
model is provided in the figure below.

  Revised research framework model (p. 10). Developing a framework for researching children's online
  risks and opportunities in Europe. Livingstone et al., 2015: eukidsonline.net.

A primary interest of the EU Kids online study is children's well-being related to the risks they encounter
through online interactions. Risks can be aggressive, sexual, value-related, and commercial, and with each the
child can be a receiver, a participant, and an actor. In their framework, children's online practices, skills,
opportunities, and risks can be viewed as virtual microsystem interactions. Those interactions may include
one or more in their social setting (e.g, parent, peer), and may be both virtual and physical, which would
identify them as mesosystem interactions in Navarro and Tudge's framework. Interactions by others in the
exosystem can influence the child's online practices and skills -- through, for example, actions taken in the
child's community to make computers available at a public library, thus enhancing children's digital ecology.
The country level in the EU Kids framework offers multiple macrosystem actors: technology provision and
206 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

regulation, culture, media and values, and societal inclusion. With the direction of influence from settings as
synergistic, the researchers promote the interdependent nature of the settings, processes, and individuals.
With these ecological, dynamic, and technologically focused frameworks establishing the multi-context
influences on children's development, and with the child's own behavior as a focus, we explore each age and
stage of development and the current knowledge of technology use, influences on use, and impacts on child
well-being.

The period of development from birth4 through age 5 is

one of the most dynamic of a human's life. The rate of

the body's physical development body is rapid, and early

development of large and fine motor skills occurs,

size. Children's environment is critical to the

development of these neural pathways, as environmental

stimuli encourage initial and deeper connections.

Children's neural connections develop paths for future

learning during a critical time period of plasticity

(Gottschalk, 2019). With brain development, young children gain abilities with executive functioning (sense

of organization of information, retrieval, memory), language and literacy, and a sense of self. These are aided

by their abilities to move about and use their hands, mouth, and ears to explore and gather information.

Yet comfort with and attachment to their caregiver are key to children's natural exploration for learning.
Through social interaction early in life that conveys a sense of consistency and trust, children develop a
connectedness that encourages their confidence. As they explore and have opportunities to interact with
others, children gain an interest in being social and move from "parallel" play (playing alongside) to
"cooperative" play (playing with others), and to understanding social rules. Through this exploration, the
brain continues to develop, and develop stronger neural connections. These early years also prompt an early
sense of oneself. A child's identity begins to form and they roughly understand themselves as unique
individuals in the world, and apart from their caregivers. Positive interactions with others in their world
reinforce the sense of belonging and self-worth, encouraging exploration and growth.

4. Naturally, development begins before birth. This review will not consider influences from technology during the prenatal period on children's
  development, though the idea is fascinating, isn't it?

Young children's technology use

Country government agencies recommend no screen

exposure for children under 2 (see table below). Guidelines

for very young children center more on limiting exposure

rather than recommending use, up to 60 minutes for

children 3-4 years, providing that there is adult interaction

during use. (Gottschalk, 2019; WHO, 2019). Nevertheless,

young children's time with screens is reported to be just

under one hour for children to age 2 (.47), and 2 hours 39

minutes for children 3-5 years, with the majority of time on

TV (Commonsense Media, 2017). Young children's

exposure to digital technologies may begin months after

birth (WHO, 2019). Auxier et al. (2020) report that nearly

half (48%) of children under 5 have used a tablet and 55%

have used a smartphone. Of parents who stated that their

child 12 years or younger has used a smartphone, 6 in 10

reported the child began engagement with a smartphone

before the age of 5, and roughly 1 in 3 reporting their child

began before age 2 (Auxier et al., 2020). YouTube is popular

with very young children, with up to 80% having watched it,    "Online Investing?" by Monkey Mash Button
and 25% watching it several times a day. Black and Hispanic    is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.

parents reported higher rates of YouTube viewing several

times a day. These parents are also more likely to report concerns that their young children are exposed to

potentially negative images and messages, such as sex, violence and drug use, and gender and racial

stereotypes. (Commonsense Media 2017). U.S. parents also report that approximately 5% of children under 5

use social media (especially TikTok and Snapchat), and 29% say their young child interacts with a voice

assistant (e.g. Alexa, Siri), primarily to play music (reported by 79%). Throughout this chapter and in later

chapters (e.g., cCapter 7 on parent-child relationships and technology), we explore parent and family contexts

that influence young children's technology consumption.

Technology use in early childhood education and child care settings

While much of the research on young children's technology use is gathered from parents, many children
210 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

                                    attend child care and/or early childhood education

many children attend child care     and are exposed to digital devices and the internet by
and/or early childhood education    teachers directly or indirectly (e.g., from teachers'
and are exposed to digital devices  personal use around children). According to the
and the internet by teachers        National Center for Educational Statistics, in 2019
directly or indirectly (e.g., from  parents reported that 59% of children 5 years or
teachers' personal use around       younger and not enrolled in kindergarten were in
children).                          some type of nonparental care. Of these, the majority
                                    (62%, or 37% of the total) were attending a day are

                                    center, preschool, or prekindergarten (center-based

care). Smaller numbers were cared for by a relative (38% of those in care) or in a private home by someone not

related to them (20%).

A recent review of the literature by Undheim (2022) categorized technology in early childhood center
settings as screen-based, not screen-based (e.g., 3D printers), Internet of Toys (IoT), and exploratory
technology (e.g., digital telescopes). The studies focused on either the children's perspective or the
teachers', and were primarily concerned with the pedagogical value or use of the technologies. They also
observed discussion of access differentials between home and school, and teachers' knowledge, skills, and
beliefs. Both areas are considered disconnects in children's valuable use of digital technology (e.g., teachers
who have open attitudes and skills are more likely to provide meaningful interactions and sustained learning).
The author observes that the majority of the studies lean toward a more positive view of children's learning
and play with technology, and rarely lend a critical eye to use. Some of the effects of children's technology use
in early childhood settings identified from research are discussed in the next section. 6Discussion of teacher
competence and skill with technology is discussed in Chapter 11.

Interests in young children's development related to
technology

For preschool-age children (2  to 5 years), there is

some demonstrated benefit of well-constructed media    Brain development and its related
in acquiring alphabet recognition and learning         functions of language and
sounds, and in greater emotion recognition, empathy,   problem solving, exposure to
and self-efficacy. Young children are creators with    content that may be challenging
technology, producing stories with rich narratives,    for children to understand, the
characters, and representations of their social        quality of sleep ,and body weight
understanding (Undheim, 2022). A key to these          are all key interests in research on
benefits is the interaction and presence of an adult.  technology use by children from

Research also indicates that excessive TV watching birth to age 5.

reduces language, cognition, and socioemotional

development, largely due to reduced parent-child interaction. There is concern that early behavior with TV

watching will establish a habit in children. The quality and content of TV is another consideration,

particularly when children are exposed to content that is not prosocial. Children who form a habit of passive

TV or screen viewing also are at risk of early obesity. Not only is passive viewing a sedentary activity, but it

exposes children to commercial content that promotes lack of exercise and high-calorie eating. And sleep

issues have been observed in young children who have media in their rooms. Diminished sleep is observed

when infants are exposed to blue light from screens, which suppresses endogenous melatonin. The content of

what is viewed can also create an elevated heart rate, making it hard for young children to sleep. A focus on

screens can negatively affect babies' need for reciprocal interaction for learning language, a sense of self, and

executive functioning (Ernest et al., 2014; Gottschalk, 2019).

Recommendations to date

The table below lists guidelines for young children (and older groups) as stated by professional agencies in the
U.S., Canada, and selected countries. No screen time is recommended for infants and toddlers (under the age
of 18 months), except for occasional video chat (per the AAP). As noted, any programming should be
intentionally selected for quality, and interactivity with an adult is key. If we consider the multiple advantages
of a caregiver reading a book with a child, the value of using technology with a young child is evident. When
reading with a caregiver, children better understand language and the context of language and literacy, they
can be scaffolded to apply content from existing text and their questions can be answered, and the emotional
connection when reading and responding with another reinforces neural pathways. With screens, having a
peer or parent is especially important to help cognition. Research indicates that it's not the medium (video
212 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

screens) that is a barrier to learning, but the lack of a partner to help children make sense of what they are
seeing and interacting with (Lytle et al., 2018).

knowledge, skills, and values are shaped by forces
around them (social, cultural, and political), by how
they are represented in the media, and by their
online interactions.

The Erikson Center for Technology and Early Childhood offers guidelines for media literacy in young
children. These may serve as goals or indicators of success:

Erikson Center Media Literacy Guidelines for Young Children7

 Children will learn to intentionally access, select, and manipulate media.
 Children will learn to engage and explore with media in a way that is supportive of their overall

   development and learning.
 Children will learn to comprehend media messages and practices.
 Children will learn to critically inquire about media and their use of media.
 Children will learn to evaluate the content and impact of media in a developmentally appropriate way.
 Children will learn to create and express ideas using media.

To encourage these skills in children's worlds, Erikson CML also provides recommendations for caregivers
and practitioners. These are general reflections on understanding oneself as a learner and teacher, and

underscore the AAP's recommendations. Additional information for both of these groups is provided in
Chapters 6 and 7 (for parents) and 11 (for practitioners).

With regard to research priorities, the EU Kids online framework (2015) includes the following areas:

 1. Factors relating to children's identity and resources, beyond demographic variables.
 2. New modes of access to the internet, as this becomes more mobile, personalized, and pervasive.
 3. A multidimensional analysis of digital skills and literacies and their significance for well-being.
 4. A rethinking of the "ladder of opportunities" to identify whether and when children undertake more

      ambitious creative or civic online activities.
 5. New kinds of online risks, including risks to personal data, privacy issues, and online reputation

      management.
 6. The interplay between children's digital practices and proprietary policies and mechanisms.
 7. Children's desire to experiment and transgress boundaries, to grasp children's agency online.
 8. Extending the analysis of how parents mediate their children's internet use to the potential importance

      of other socializing agents.
 9. Extending research on use of digital media from 9-to 16-year-olds to much younger children.
10. Research on socio-technological innovations in smart/wearable/ubiquitous everyday devices.
11. The implications of digital engagement as it may reconfigure (undermine or enhance, alter or diversify)

      children's well-being in the long term.
12. Connecting the research agenda on children's online access, risks, and opportunities to the broader

      agenda of children's rights -- provision, participation, and protection -- in the digital age.

 Development overview

  Middle childhood8, ages 6-12, has been called a "latency" period of human development. Compared with the
  dynamic rate of growth in the early years, and the rapid changes that occur during early, middle, and late
  adolescence, skeletal and muscular growth and dexterity happen at a slower rate. Cognitively, learning moves
  to the operational stage, with abilities to organize and use logic to solve problems. Many children at this age
  enjoy playing games with rules, collecting, and developing a type of expertise. They are also often eager to
  explore and learn new things. Socially, exposure to peers is significant during middle childhood, as the
  majority of children begin formal schooling. They also have opportunities for afterschool programs, clubs,
  sports, and other activities with peers. As children are learning to cooperate with others, they may be subject
  to bullying and other expressions of power. Psychologically, children in middle childhood are continuing to
  develop an identity of themselves, as a part of the family, yet also as unique individuals.

             Psychological: Strengthening a sense of gender identity, self as separate from family.

Technology use

Interest in activities, stronger peer relationships and time spent in school/on school subjects encourage
children 6-12 years old to use a variety of devices and explore a range of applications. School-age children are
prevalent media users, with 80% using a tablet and 63% using a smartphone (Auxier et al., 2020). Even so,
only 22% of parents feel it's OK for children under 12 to own a smartphone. They are more tolerant of
children having a tablet, with 65% reporting that a tablet is acceptable for children under 12. As indicated in
the chart below, over half of school-age children age 5-8 and 9-11 have used all five types of devices listed.
Larger use differences between school-age and younger children exist for computers and gaming devices.

A 2021 report from Commonsense Media indicates that average screen time use by tweens (ages 8-12)
increased 17% from 2015 to 2021, from 4  hours to 5 hours 33 minutes. As observed with teens (and
discussed later in the chapter) screen time is greater among boys, children who are Latino, and those in
families with less income. YouTube is popular with children, with 89% of parents reporting that their
5-11-year-old watches videos on YouTube (Pew). Just over half (53%) report that their child watches
YouTube at least once a day. Commonsense Media reports that "tweens watch an hour of online videos per
day."
218 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

Social media is popular with children ages 9-11, with parents reporting 30% on TikTok, 22% on Snapchat,
and 11% on Instagram. Commonsense Media (2021) reports that 11% of 8-12-year-olds are on Snapchat and
10% on Instagram (their data was drawn from children, not adults). That said, small portions of children 5-8
years (i.e., 3-11%) are also reported to visit these sites, despite age warnings on the applications (Schaeffer,
2021). Parental acceptance of screens also changes during this age: 67% are tolerant of children under 12
having a tablet, though the majority of parents (73%) believe that 12 or older is the age at which it is
acceptable for children to have their own phone (Auxier et al., 2020). And with regard to voice-activated
devices, just over one-third (36%) of parents with a child 11 or younger reported that their child had engaged
with a voice-activated assistant such as Siri or Alexa. Functions of these devices for children include playing
music (82%), providing information (66%), and hearing a joke or playing games (47%).

Because of the relationships and opportunities afforded through both children's interests that integrate
technology (one in music, the other in video production), the family's experiences enable the children to
"connect" their learning across multiple spheres -- including application in traditional schooling. Readers
interested in learning more about connected learning may want to visit the Connected Learning Alliance.
The boom in learning technologies used in the classroom -- and teacher competencies to ensure pedagogical
value -- speak to the promise of digital engagement throughout the school years. Technologies used for
learning in elementary and secondary schools are discussed later in this section.

Online and videogames are very popular with children in middle childhood. Jessica Navarro, the technology
and human development researcher mentioned previously, writes of her son's experience with playing the
online game Fortnite (2021). She admits feeling leery about his play when the hype pointed to the exposure to
first-person shooter activity and violence. Yet observing him play with friends, including new friends met
online, showed her the value of the game for developing collaboration skills (social) and problem-solving
(cognitive), checking two of the developmental domain boxes. An interest in games with rules, and the
development of eye-hand coordination during this age, can make participation in online interactive games a
positive experience. And very recent research by the National Institutes for Drug Abuse (NIDA) identified a
relationship between playing videogames for 3 hours by 9 and 10 year olds and benefits to cognitive tasks

involving impulse control and working memory (NIDA, 2022). That said, and as Navarro observes, the
online chat features of these games can also expose vulnerable children to bullying and contact with adults
(McInroy & Mishna, 2017) and to violence, which can influence the acceptance of oppression and lack of
empathy (Ernest et al., 2014). Parental controls can help moderate what children are exposed to, and by
monitoring children's play and, especially, their response to the play, parents can be aware of the value or
possible consequences these games afford.

Impacts -- Exposure to screens

A primary developmental concern at this age is an over-reliance on screens that leaves children exposed to
threats they may not have the cognitive abilities to reason through or social maturity to handle (Gottschalk,
2019). Long hours on computers also contribute to physical health concerns about childhood obesity, blue
screen exposure and sleep deprivation, and weak posture. DeMoor et al. (2008) lists three primary areas of
concern in internet exposure as content, contact, and commercial. Passive viewing and exposure to influencers
on social media (contact) are linked with childhood depression, stress, and anxiety. Concerns have been
lodged about children's lack of privacy and the potential for commercial applications and, as discussed in the
next section, even school software to track children's use, user patterns, and user preferences.

With regard to content, a 2021 report from Commonsense Media looked at representation in the media that
children consume, important given that the majority (70%) of parents surveyed wanted their children to be
exposed to more diverse images (with higher percentages among parents of color). Parents also wanted media
content to expand and be inclusive of other kinds of diversity (individuals with physical, neurological, or
learning disabilities, those with diverse body types, and those from different socioeconomic levels). Parents'
media concerns stemmed from the way they felt people were represented in programming to their children.
Many parents perceived White people as more likely to be portrayed in a positive light compared to the
portrayal of Black, Hispanic/Latino, and LGBTQIA+ individuals.

Learning and Technology

https://medium.com/literate-schools/technology-in-the-classroom-7e23904da6d7

Schools have long integrated multimedia and interactive media to encourage collaboration, creativity, and
exploration, and to connect with students at a distance. Greater attention to educational technology has
occurred in the last 30 years as computers and the internet, then laptops, then Chromebooks, and now
tablets, SMART boards, and smartphones are used in the classroom, and as teaching through virtual
environments complements and sometimes replaces face-to-face instruction. Reviews of the research indicate
that, when used appropriately, instructional technology can enhance feedback and communication with
students, and motivate peer collaboration, individual creativity, and self-expression (Hamilton & Hattie,
2021). UNICEF's 2022 What Makes Me? report identifies learning technology as a successful modality for
children's active and multisensory work that promotes core capacities. Students are likely to continue
interactions outside of school, and parents can feel more engaged and involved.

Research also indicates that devices and applications     "From the plethora of media

these applications is key to effective learning.          conducted over the past 60

focus on instruction. How well teachers implement

instructional technology is greatly dependent on their

ability, training, and resources (discussed further in Chapter 11, and in Hamilton & Hattie, 2021).

The wider infrastructure of schools can create a culture that integrates technology as a pedagogical tool and
embraces teaching strategies with technology. Associations like ISTE (International Society of Technology in
Education, iste.org) offer tremendous resources, learning opportunities, and community forums for teachers
to identify materials and strategies for effective instruction. Standards for teaching training and licensing and
for school integration provide guidance for the entire field of formal pre-K-12 education in the U.S. and
globally.

Possible pitfalls of educational technology

As with most issues, however, learning technologies in education are not always the ideal solution. A
significant challenge is that of access. Individual households, schools, and school districts vary by geography
and income in their ability to ensure children's access to devices and the internet (Hamilton & Hattie, 2021).
The ability of parents and educators to support children's learning with new technology also varies greatly.
An example of this is the software ProdigyTM, with English and math games for children. While it provides a
fun and immersive experience, families and schools may be unable to upgrade children's free accounts to a
premium (cost) version, marketed to users. Using a premium version entitles children to exclusive rewards,
leaving those unable to upgrade to feel like they are missing out. Groups like Commonsense Media
recommend that schools jointly create community strategies with families to make decisions that benefit
children while being balanced with cost considerations.
224 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

Privacy and data sharing are other issues with learning technologies used by schools (Lieberman, 2020).
When selecting software for children's learning, schools vet quality, cost, usability, and security. They are
obligated to let parents know how student data is being used, regardless of where teaching occurs. Laws such
as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
(COPPA) offer guidance when selecting software. Yet the rush to putting lessons online during COVID-19
and as schools provide more distance learning options on tight budgets can mean using free programs that are
less transparent in their practices. In 2020, Education Week reported that "Most U.S. states earned a `C' or
lower grade from a 2019 survey of student data privacy protections by Kiesecker's organization and the
Network for Public Education." As discussed in Chapter 12, school districts take children's privacy and data
use from education software seriously and offer policies on their websites, in school community handbooks,
and in teacher training. It is essential that education technology companies be consistent and clear in their
policies, and adhere with legal tenets of privacy laws.

Access to learning technologies

Issues of children's access and the digital (or knowledge) gap are of worldwide concern. Inequities in device
and internet access challenge children's learning and achievement (Katz, 2017; Katz et al., 2018; Perez, 2021;
Resta, 2020; Resta et al., 2018; Zhang & Livingstone, 2019). Differences in access affect children's
participation in learning and at school, the creation of valuable social connections, and the forging of a
unique identity. Lack of access also adds a disadvantage to children with special needs, who already struggle to
find technologies with necessary accommodations. Schools may distribute devices, routers, and wifi hubs,
provide additional technology coaching, and train teachers to be sensitive to equity and access needs when
integrating technology in coursework (Perez, 2021). And a new bill (Emergency Broadband Benefit) from the
U.S. Congress offers short-term assistance to pay for internet access for families and students (US FCC, 2021).
On the public awareness side, children's media scholars Livingstone and Blum-Ross (2020) advocate that a
step toward equity is to move our collective concern away from screen time quantity and more strongly
embrace quality dimensions of technology use for active learning, socialization, and development. This can
shift attention to the need for all children to have access to beneficial technology.

Children with Special Needs

Technologies can aid reading for children with vision challenges, and vocabulary and problem-solving skills
for children with developmental delays (Livingstone & Blum-Ross, 2020). Adding Wii games for children on
the Autism spectrum benefits physical development, learning social cues, and developing social skills (Ernest
et al., 2014). Commonsense Media reports that videogames can be tailored to specific needs, and games
produced for general populations can aid children in acquiring communication skills, providing them ways to
challenge themselves and learn how to ask for help.

Beyens et al. (2018) summarized a review of four decades of research on technology's impact on attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to indicate only a marginal relationship, calling it more "theoretically
than empirically grounded" (p. 9878). They called for continued research into individual differences that
affect susceptibility (e.g., sex, temperament, age) and especially into context and condition variables that may
play a role in technology selection, content exposure, and use, including parent variables. "Research has
shown that parents factors, such as parental ADHD, parental temperament, parenting stress, family conflict,
unresponsive parenting, and chaotic parenting are negatively linked to ADHD behaviors, and responsive
parenting can suppress ADHD-related behaviors" (p. 9879).

Recommendations for middle childhood and adolescence

The American Academy of Pediatrics offers these recommendations for parents of children and adolescents
(which includes children in middle childhood):

             Monitor access to devices and use, on balance with physically healthy practices for brain
                and body.

             Treat media as other environments: set limits, monitor for safety and well-being.
             Be a good role model.
             Promote the value of face-to-face communication.
             Provide warnings for safety (privacy, predators); keep lines of communication open if

                children/teens experience concerns.
             Focus on appropriateness and quality of engagement.
             Make and communicate media plans with all family members.
             Understand limits and potential harms. Do your homework on apps and games children

                and teens use.

During this age period, many children will seek and/or acquire a smartphone. Is there an appropriate age for
children to have a smartphone? Or is a determination based on knowing the risks and rewards and on a child's
display of the ability to responsibly handle one? Children's smartphone ownership is discussed later in the
chapter. And parent engagement through consistent and attuned communication with children in middle
childhood and late, is key to their healthy use. As noted, children ages 6-12 will be exposed to messages and
images and information that they don't understand. It is essential that they have at least one adult they feel
safe to go to for questions and conversation about technology.

  Development overview

   The developmental changes that occur during adolescence are so dynamic and pronounced that development
   scholars divide the period into approximate age ranges: early adolescence (11-14), middle adolescence
   (14-17), and late adolescence (17-20).10 The significant activity of puberty can affect the expression of
   primary and secondary sex characteristics, hormonal expression leading to an interest in having sex, body
   changes, skeletal growth, and continuation of brain development (though it's not complete until later into
   early adulthood; see figure below).

Adolescents' contexts are, primarily, in middle and secondary school, exercising their cognitive abilities and
continuing peer associations. Expression of identity is key and can encourage the joining of "cliques" and
crowds as a way to fit in and understand oneself. The growing sense of confidence in oneself can also unleash
under-confidence, expressed as power through bullying others.

       Overview of developmental achievements in adolescence
             Physical: Brain development continues (still not complete), body changes in puberty
                affects hormonal reactions, and interest in sex; opportunities for high-risk behaviors;

             Cognitive: Thinking becomes more reasoned and abstract; hormonal response can
                generate high-risk behavior.
             Socio-emotional: Peer associations, romantic associations; looking ahead; taking on
                added responsibility in jobs;, anticipating life post-secondary school (military, college,
                employment, etc).
             Psychological: Identity development (as separate from family); hormonal responses
                affecting mood; awareness of mental health challenges.

Technology use

Phones and computers are nearly ubiquitous in the lives of teens, who use them extensively for connections
228 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

to friends and family, for schoolwork and jobs, and for daily life tasks. Most (95%) have smartphones, and 80%

have a gaming console. A 2022 report from Pew indicates that these percentages have increased since 2015

(Vogels et al., 2022). As noted in Chapter 3, these

two years than in previous years.                       2021.

Teens use a range of social media, with a preference
for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat (Vogels et al., 2022). In just seven years, teen interest in
Facebook dropped from 71% to 32% according to the 2022 study from Pew. Boys report more interest in
Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube; girls prefer Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. While 62% reporting using
social media daily, daily entertainment is also sought through streaming videos (77%) and watching television
(49%) (Commonsense Media, 2021). Yet even though teens report spending nearly an hour and a half each
day on social media, a minority indicate that they like doing so "a lot" (34%). Listening to podcasts as a
regular activity is reported by about one-fifth of teens. And gaming is popular with 59% of teens, with active
players spending three hours a day on average, and teens in general reporting 1 hour, 46 minutes. The Pew
study reports that a majority of teens say their social media use is about right (55%); 36% say it's too much.

Global data on teen technology use is available from the EU Kids Online study and the Global Kids Online
study, which track children's use in Europe, South America, countries in Africa, and the Philippines. The EU
Kids study follows 9- to 16-year-olds (approximately the middle of the two age groups surveyed by
Commonsense Media), and the 2016 report from the Global Kids study featured data from 9-17-year-old
children from the Philippines, Serbia, and South Africa, and internet-using children age 13-17 from
Argentina. These data offer a more universal understanding of technology use by children and teens, with
differences to what is observed in the U.S. based on socioeconomic, cultural, and governmental factors.

For example, in a study of Nigerian teens age 13-18 years old in rural and urban areas, most reported access to
                                           5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 229

a shared or personal mobile phone, which was the dominant form of internet access (Uzuegbunam, 2019). A
minority purchased their own phones (23%); the remainder reported purchases by their families. However,
the researcher determined that use was fairly gendered. Technology for personal development and for self-
learning was mainly by privileged male youth in urban cities. The teens also reported the use of social media as
positive yet, as with other teens, indicated technology's power to distract, expose them to bad messages, and
encourage cheating on tests. While some parents do monitor teens' technology use, the research indicated that
many parents and teachers lack the skills and literacy to support children's evolving digital practices.

                                                     Texting and using social media for peer communication

                                                     South Africa indicated that 8.4% forward a sext without

                                                     personal images of individuals who are minors. Fines and

laws can be harsh for those who send sexually explicit or nude photos electronically, whether though text,

email, or social media. Some states have specific laws regarding sexting between minors, which are less harsh

than those -- like Minnesota -- whose laws around sexting and minors are related to child pornography. This

page provides more information about the statute in Minnesota laws. Writing for Pediatrics (from the

American Academy of Pediatrics), Strasberger et al. (2019) cite the data and implications of sexting in teens,

and argue for the differentiation of behavior between consenting adolescents and behavior that is clearly in

the realm of child pornography and abuse.

                                            observed with teens and technology, as ICT has become

                                            adolescents and young adults worldwide, proficiency

with technology also means preparation for jobs of the future that will rely on automation (Anderson et al.,

2022; Blum-Ross. et al., 2018).

Teens' use of social media is a good example of research findings that are "variable" in being positive, yet
qualified. James et al.'s 2017 review of the research identified positive impacts on well-being through self-
confidence, self-esteem, being outgoing, feeling less shy, and reporting less depression. This is often due to
social media's ability to help teens maintain friendships and meet new potential friends with shared interests.
With regard to empathy and narcissism, in general teens display more emotionally empathic communication
online than adults, yet they are also more likely to think of their activities online from a self-focused
perspective. And during COVID-19, teens who found support online, despite the number of hours they used
screens, reported positive mental health, based on a study of 700 11-17 year olds in Peru (Magiss-Weinberg et
al., 2021).

As with children in middle childhood, concerns for teens's technology use rest with psychological effects due
to social comparison, anxiety, low self-esteem, and being the subject of bullying (UNICEF, 2017). These
effects also are more prevalent for teens who are vulnerable. Variability occurs depending on the content of

and left out. Recently, a young teen's suicide was

attributed by a London coroner to her consumption

of self-harm-related social media. Problematic behavior with technology (e.g., feeling addicted to one's

phone) can have negative consequences with relationships. And devices such as mobile phones, with the

ability to text and access social media at will, can inhibit intimacy and present challenges through the

perception of 24/7 connectedness.

Analyses of literature on videogame violence supports a relationship with players' longitudinal demonstration
of violent behavior, even after controlling for previous demonstration of aggression (Prescott et al., 2018).
And researchers found a racial component: a strong relationship for White children, a weak relationship for
Asian children, and an unpredictable relationship for Latino children. They echo other scholars calling for
continued research on factors or individual differences that relate to the results.

                                                         reports how teens are faring in the "digital age" by

                                                         offering a broader view than data linked specifically to

phone use. She reports on broad indicators like high school graduation rates and academic achievement, and

on downward trends in pregnancy, violence, alcohol abuse, and smoking. As noted in Chapter 1, it's crucial to

consider how technology fits into children's and families' lives as a whole. Odgers addresses the debate around

benefits and consequences of technology use by teens, and returns to a biological truth: developing organisms

will respond in unique ways to their environments, and measured impacts in one ecological domain are likely

influenced by influences from another. Indeed, and as noted above, some teens will demonstrate negative

impacts from exposure to social media, videogames, time online, and use of their smartphones. Yet Odgers'

read of the data is that this reflects "a new kind of digital divide, in which differences in online experiences are

amplifying risks among already-vulnerable adolescents." Her recommendations are that we fret less about
232 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

technology use and teens as the issue, and focus more on the wider societal influences on their lives that
encourage the mental health and academic and behavioral conditions they bring to their online experiences.
Aiding this viewpoint, a recent study with 4,000 teens age 13-18 and their parents (Moreno et al., 2022)
identified two "classes" of risk for teen technology use and impact. Family-engaged adolescents reported better
well-being, sleep, and physical activity. For these teens there was a tighter family connection in ownership and
family communication, and parent technology use (specifically social media) was low. "At-risk" adolescents
were those reporting higher levels of depression, anxiety, and poor body image; they were more independent
in their technology access and parents' social media use was high. As decades of research on families has
observed, sociocontextual stress from living with poverty, unemployment, discrimination, and more creates
conditions that pull parents away from their ability to fully attend to children's needs.

Reports such as this help focus on the characteristics of teens for whom technology may be an added
vulnerability, while the research into specific effects (for whom, which type of technology, under which
conditions) continues.

Expanding our understanding of effects of technology and
adolescent development

Groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics in the U.S. bundle recommendations for healthy adolescent
                                           5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 233

technology use with those for children. These recommendations lean heavily on responsible use, use that is
developmentally appropriate, and strong and constructive influence from educators and caregivers. An AAP
article specific to medical connectivity with teens recommends applications that are user-centered in their
design, address disparities in internet and device access, and are created with an awareness of challenges to data
ownership, confidentiality, and data privacy. Their comments close by saying "Pediatricians should neither
shun new technologies nor accept them wholeheartedly without review but always advocate for and consider
the best interests of adolescents by carefully balancing the risks and benefits of using and recommending these
technologies to optimize health outcomes, including physical, emotional, and social well-being, in this
vulnerable population."

The findings of the SMAHRT and Center for Scholars and Storytellers study described above underscore the
heavy contributions by family in shaping teen's technology use and outcomes. It recommends that devices are
family-owned rather than individually owned, that households maintain patterns of communication about
technology use, that parents are aware of their own use as they serve as models of behavior, and that a family
focus on technology begins early in a child's life.

       James et al. (2017) and Hamilton et al. (2021) make the following research recommendations to
       better understand use of technology in general and applications like social media specifically:

                                              independently, fulfilling the expectations that they can
                                              accomplish the responsibilities and decision-making of
                                              adulthood and gain financial independence. The Urban
                                              Dictionary might boil this down to "adulting." For many,
                                              this means post-secondary education for job training or a

                                              challenge individual plans. Consider the draft to military

this process, the individual understands and forges
236 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

relationships (especially with parents) that respect the sense of separateness, yet maintain the sense of
belonging and connections.

Technology use

To a large extent, young adults age 18-29 continue technology use patterns established in their earlier years
(Mollborn et al., 2021). So given teens' interest in social media, gaming, and communication, it's not
surprising that young adults are more likely than their older adult counterparts to be active and comfortable
with use in daily life, including schooling and for work (Vaterlaus et al., 2019). The majority of young adults
(71%) use Instagram, which is significantly more popular than with older age groups. YouTube is popular
with nearly all (95%) young adults, though high percentages of nearly all adult age groups appear to view
YouTube (Pew, 2021; Schaeffer, 2021).

Among young adults, technology use varies when used for academic and non-academic purposes (Swanson &
Walker, 2015). And variation occurs depending on who the young adult is talking to. A recent study by Lee
and Dworkin (2022) identified four communication group types among digital media users connecting with
mothers, fathers, and friends. Those with the friend-oriented pattern were associated with psychological well-
being, and the multimedia group associated with stronger social well-being. Chapter 7 further discusses
technologically facilitated relational dynamics in families with young adult members.

Young adults are a well-studied population when it comes to their technology use, given that many
technology scholars are in higher education and have easy access to 18-24-year-olds who attend college and
can be research participants. In part, this challenges our full understanding of the age group, as it skews
towards a portion of young adults. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 40% of those
age 18-24 enroll in college (NCES, 2022). From a family perspective, studying young adults in college is
beneficial to understand the role technology plays in family connectedness during a time of formation of a
separate identity (e.g., Lee et al.'s 2009's discussion of the "electronic umbilical cord"). Going to college
represents a normative shift in context and in responsibilities that may encourage changes in technology use.

Mollborn et al. (2021) argue for a lifecourse perspective when exploring technology use in this age group,
beyond assuming the continuation of behavioral patterns from adolescence. They determined that prior
patterns of parenting had a significant influence on young adults' technology use. Rather than having a
discrete influence on frequency of technology use at a particular age (e.g., parent presence encouraging young
adults to use technology more frequently for parent-child communication), parents' greater impact came
through from the ways their prior parenting messaging helped shape young adults' emotional response to the
use of technology. Indeed, the researchers found that context and demographic factors were quite malleable
when examining predictors of use in young adulthood.
         5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 237

Impacts

Research generally supports technology's role in aiding the relationship between young adults and their
parents, grandparents, and siblings, and that multiple types of devices may be used in maintaining
relationships (validating media multiplexity theory) (Hessel & Dworkin, 2018). Young adults appear to
support their individuation by the strategic use of applications and devices that are both more and less
familiar to parents to maintain family and other connections, respectively. Male and female college students
with problematic mobile phone use show weaker relationships with their parents and their peers (Lepp et al.,
2016). Still, Molvin et al. (2021) observe that methodologies used to understand technology's actual impacts
in this age group may need to be modified to allow for more individualized perspectives. They note, "As
traditional role-based markers of adulthood have become more variable and difficult to attain, [methods may
need to capture] self-focused understandings to achieve an internal sense of becoming adult."

Challenges with cyber-victimization continue into young adulthood. Holmgren et al. (2020) examined
experiences with cyber-victimization (i.e., being the recipient or victim of hurtful or mean online messages) in
a sample of college and non-college young adults. One-fifth reported experiences with cyber-victimization,
and within that group, significant relationships between cyber-victimization and lower levels of social and
emotional wellbeing, and higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behavior. This suggests that when
these experiences occur through online behavior, they can disrupt the young adult's ability to form social
capital.

recommendations for young adults usually focus on
college/post-secondary education (e.g., Educause, 2018).

In the undergraduate course that inspired this text, young adults (students in the course) offered a list of
recommendations on healthy technology use for their age group. While they are in college, they also represent
a wide range of life experiences, cultures, expectations for their futures, and socioeconomic backgrounds. In
their recommendations, they encouraged young adults to consider:
238 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

   the life challenges and benchmarks of adulthood that they seek (e.g., financial independence,
      employment after college),

   the relationships they want to sustain (e.g., family) or acquire (e.g., a committed partner), and
   the general meaning of technology in their personal lives and the ways it operates to support physical,

      cognitive, psychological, and socioemotional growth (or not).

As you can see from this summary of group contributions, it can be hard to condense recommendations for
self (personal), self (social),and self (professional/student) into a cohesive list.

Special considerations for children and teen
technology use

The COVID-19 Pandemic

In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools and universities worldwide, requiring that
children and teens, like many of their parents, continue work and "do school: online and usually from home.
Pandemic conditions continued through the 2020-2021 school year, easing up to some extent with a slow
return to "normal" face-to-face or hybridized operations during the 2021-2022 school year.

What the pandemic conditions meant to children's

development and learning during the quarantine and           Those reading this book will be quite
long after is a question that researchers will be exploring  familiar with the experience of life
for decades to come. Specifically, those interested in       during COVID-19 (and are encouraged

participation and learning, effects on development across

all domains, impacts on social relationships (including

family relationships), and much more. Already there is

evidence based on access to technology and on economic differences.

Technology use during COVID-19

Parents reported that children's screen time increased during COVID-19, and some reported that their
monitoring and moderating of that time decreased (McClain et al., 2021). Among parents with children in
kindergarten through 12th grade, 72% reported their children spending more time on screens during the
pandemic. Outside of the time children spent with technology for schools, when parents considered the other
                                           5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 239

time their children were online, 39% said that their enacting rules decreased. For the majority of the sample
(43%), the rules didn't change.

Only about one in five adults ages 18-29 say they feel closer to friends they know well compared with before
the pandemic. This share is twice as high as that among adults 50 and older. Adults under 30 are also more
likely than any other age group to say social media sites have helped a lot in staying connected with family and
friends (30% say so), and about four in ten of those ages 18-29 say this about video calls. Screen time affected
some negatively, however. About six in ten adults under 30 (57%) who ever made video calls during the
pandemic say they at least sometimes feel worn out or fatigued from spending time on these calls, and about
half (49%) of young adults say they have tried to cut back on time spent on the internet or their smartphone.

School participation and learning technology

Undoubtedly, participation in school during
COVID-19 was more challenging for children in
households with less income. This chart from Pew
Research (McClain et al., 2021) reveals the
technological challenges faced by children based on
family income. Adequate wifi and devices were
issues for children. A sizable portion of parents also
reported being unable to help their children with
homework.

More evocatively, Hillman (2020) asserts that
families' experiences and children's learning from
school involvement during COVID-19 can help us
reimagine education and move away from
traditional classroom and teacher-led systems to the
kind of connected learning (or learning webs) that
address individual needs and interests:

      Ultimately, we must re-position the role of school as
      a place that not only makes but also lets learning
      happen. We need to re-think children's learning
      goals and expectations. We need to reimagine the
      kind of curriculum that they need, to not only the
      current circumstances but also unimagined futures
      shaped by new norms of socializing, working and learning that we have yet to design and get used to.
240 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

Commonsense Media offers guidelines to families to support children's learning and the overall amount of
screen time when their school is partly or fully online.

Mental health impacts

Reports of children and teens' mental health during COVID-19 indicated that, for many, quarantine
conditions exacerbated depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation and loneliness, and more. Not surprisingly,
many turned to social media for social connectivity and entertainment, which may have only exacerbated
issues, particularly when users were exposed to hate speech and bullying. A report by Commonsense Media,
Hopelab, and the California Health Care Foundation investigated this issue, finding a higher prevalence of
depression among LGBTQ+ youth, and reporting that those with mental health challenges were more likely
to use social media (Rideout et al., 2021). Yet they also reported the constructive ways in which teens used the
internet and social media to find information to support their mental health, to use telehealth options, and as
an outlet for personal expression.

Getting a smartphone

A decision facing many households is when to get a child a smartphone. Most parents (73%) believe that it's
acceptable for children 12 and older to have a phone (Auxier et al., 2020). Nearly the same number (71%)
perceive that widespread use of smartphones could cause more harm than benefit for children (Auxier et al.,
2020). Yet the prevalence of children with phones at earlier ages is high. Families who get phones for children
before age 13 do so largely so that they can get in touch with their child, and their child can easily get in touch
with them (Auxier et al., 2020). Most parents also want to track the whereabouts of their child for safety. In
families where parents are separated, phones can be ways to coordinate with children between households.
About 25% do it for the child's entertainment (Auxier et al., 2020), and a very small minority (6%) give into
peer pressure from other families giving their children phones or from peers who encourage a child to have a
phone.

children's interaction online (e.g, COPPA), in movie ratings, for when teens can drive, vote, and purchase
alcohol, and in any number of policies and laws for their and society's well-being. Children under 12
primarily use phones to text, and about half download apps, play pre-installed games, access websites on the
internet, and do live video calling (Neilson, 2017). Yet there are warnings about children being exposed to
sexting and pornography at early ages (Chen, 2016), and about exposure to screens in ways that interrupt
sleep (Commonsense Media 2020). If we are to believe Twenge's research, exposure to smartphones will
encourage children's depression, weaken academic performance, and delay interest in normative tasks of
adolescence like learning to drive. Unlike family technologies like televisions and computers that can be
located in common areas, smartphones are mobile and can be used anytime, anywhere.
Yet as reported earlier, Odgers (2018) questions whether negative effects reported for teens' use of technology
are not actually indicative of exacerbated consequences of teens' wider social and societal experiences. And
studies that observe family or cultural factors in establishing screen use by children and teens call to question
not only the level of impact (on the individual), but the source of influence (e.g., individual behavior, family,
school). A number of experts assert that a specific age is not a primary factor in considering when to give child
smartphone, but rather how parents and families use technology, set boundaries and rules, and tailor to the
242 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

unique needs and interests of the child (Anderson & Jiang, 2018; Chen, 2016; McInerny, 2017). Or might it
be that smartphone ownership can be similar to setting a policy "sliding scale" based on child age for staying
home alone. For example, a Dakota county (MN) law concerns the ages at which children can be left alone as
a gradation of time (e.g., children 7 and younger not alone for any period; children 10-13 alone for fewer than
12 hours).

       The recommendations listed below are paraphrased from a post by the Harvard School of
       Education Usable Knowledge site (When to Give Your Child a Smartphone ). They have been
       arranged to address sensitivity to the individual child, the family context, and wider social
       influences.

             Cater the rules to each child, and allow the rules to evolve as your children age.
                Each child is unique in their developmental abilities and interests. Some are interested in
                connecting with others using a smartphone; others are not. Some may be demonstrate
                responsibility for the care of an item like a smartphone, including what it exposes the
                child to, and others may not. Knowing your individual child will be an excellent guide to
                their ability, interests, and need for a phone.

             Talk about technology with children. Build awareness and help children learn how to
                regulate their relationships with devices. Smart phones are only one device; there are
                many available to children. The conversation about how children see technology being
                used in their school, home, and friend environments can start early. Introducing
                responsible and ethical device use is also an opportunity for education. This will give
                them a voice in setting rules and being accountable.

             Start young. As conversations about other dimensions of safety and responsibility start
                early and develop with the child, so too can the safe and responsible use of technology.
                This helps put children in the mindset of wanting to learn more and to share their
                knowledge with others.

     Family level

             Family values. Phone use in and out of the house by all members, and child phone
                ownership, should reflect the family's values. Family members can jointly establish rules
                that reflect the interests of all.

             Understand options. Knowledge of different types of technologies available to children
                and families can aid parents in knowing how to control access and keep children safe.
                                  5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 243

        Having options available during the conversation about phone use enables parents and
        children to find more tailored solutions. Commonsense Media offers a guide to setting up
        the child's phone.
      Modeling behaviors. Children learn through observation and parental modeling of
        phone use, so parents should model appropriate technology usage. This includes digital
        ethics, use of devices at home, and use while in the presence of others. Samual (2017)
        observes that parallel to the data linking phone introduction to negative consequences
        among children is data showing the uptake in phone use by parents. They ask if the
        negative consequences seen in children may relate to their parents being distracted.
      Texting your child. Parent behavior around texting can do more than model patterns to
        emulate; it also can directly impact the child's space and be a distraction or impinge on
        their sense of agency if it exceeds what children are comfortable with. Relatedly, divorced
        and separated parents can be conscientious about phone use by the child as being
        private, and not as a tool for indirect communication to the other parent.

Community level

      Understand child's needs in school and the community. Smartphones are used for
        many functions by children and teens besides texting and social media alone. Computers,
        applications, and other media devices also figure into children's learning and social
        ecology. Having an awareness of the range of ways that technology is used in the child's
        evolving life is essential for families to have open discussions about shared use, use in the
        household, and ownership.

      Participate in policy and advocacy on smartphone practices. An added
        recommendation is for parents and children to be involved in the settings that affect their
        use, and the impacts of that use. This can mean school, institution, or organization
        policies, and addressing governmental and industrial actions that establish and maintain
        laws regarding technology safety for children.

Cyberbullying

According to the Cyberbullying Research Center,

cyberbullying is the "willful and repeated harm inflicted

through the use of computers, cell phones, and other

electronic devices" (from Bullying Beyond the

Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to

Cyberbullying). Elements of cyberbullying include the

following:

 Willful: The behavior has to be deliberate, not          "Cyberbullying, would you do it?" by kid-josh is
                                                           licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.

accidental.

 Repeated: Bullying reflects a pattern of behavior, not just one isolated incident.

 Harm: The target must perceive that harm was inflicted.

 Use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices: This, of course, is what differentiates

cyberbullying from traditional bullying.

And a child may be a victim of cyberbullying if they:

 unexpectedly stop using the computer,
 appear nervous or jumpy when an instant message, text message, or email appears,
 appear uneasy about going to school or outside in general,
 appear to be angry, depressed, or frustrated after using the computer,
 avoid discussions about what they are doing on the computer, or
 become abnormally withdrawn from usual friends and family members.

                                                       A review of research over the period of 2015 to 2019

A review of research over the                          identified an increase in the prevalence of
period of 2015 to 2019 identified                      cyberbullying victimization (Zhu et al., 2021). The
an increase in the prevalence of                       researchers examined studies representing countries
cyberbullying victimization (Zhu                       and regions including the U.S., Europe, and East Asia.
et al., 2021).                                         Victimization reports ranged from 14 to 58%, with
                                                       verbal violence as the most common type of

                                                       cyberbullying. Other types of violence included group

bullying, impersonation, account theft, and visual bullying (sharing images of others). Lynott (2020) reported

that, during COVID-19, two-thirds of teens in Ireland were bullied through private chat apps like

WhatsApp. Risk factors related to cyberbullying victimization or perpetration included demographic
                                           5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 245

characteristics such as age (older adolescents as bullies), gender (girls are more likely to be victim and bully),
and past experience (those who were bullied are more likely to bully). Other factors offer mixed results. While
some studies, for example, report that non-white students are less likely to engage in cyberbullying, others
don't find this trend. Other risk or protective factors studied include geographic location (e.g., living in urban
environments), technology behavior (e.g., time online) and mental health status. Parenting and the parent-
child relationship appears key to both behavior and risk, with children who have strong communication with
parents and a secure parent-child relationship less likely to bully and experience consequences of being a
victim.

The researchers caution about the correlational nature of the existing research and the need for more causal
mechanisms to be determined. They also identify systemic approaches to address cyberbullying. Individual
action starts with addressing adolescent emotional management capabilities, and with parents, schools and
institutions support the development tools tailored to the digital environment and digital capabilities.
Organizations such as Commonsense Media and the Cyberbullying Research Center offer guidance for the
prevention of cyberbullying and constructive practices to address it.

At a macro or policy level, violence that occurs in virtual environments has encouraged new understanding of
and reframing old laws. This lawsuit against a school district, brought by the parents of a young woman who
committed suicide after being cyberbullied, is indicative of situations calling for attention to cyberviolence.
This map of the U.S. provided by the Cyberbullying Research Center (updated in 2017) indicates laws
related to criminal sanction (e.g., assault statutes), school sanction (e.g., allowing the school to discipline),
school policy (e.g., allowing the school to have bullying policies), and off-campus activities (allows the school
to intervene in cases of bullying off campus that contribute to classroom disruption). Yet as indicated by this
article about Chicago schools' attempt to protect students from violence by monitoring social media,
question of privacy, the internet, and children's safety are topics of debate.

Privacy (including `sexting')

Privacy and online safety are major issues facing everyone who uses the internet. Use of online technologies
enables telecommunication companies' access to personal data -- data that can be collected, tracked, shared,
and sold to market products to individuals, leave users open to security threats, and create a digital footprint
that individuals have little control over. These issues are particularly critical for children, whose level of
development and ability to reason through online threats and seek out protections can leave them vulnerable.
They also impact parents and educators who are responsible for children's safety online and who must
authorize consent, either directly or indirectly (giving children permission). Commonsense Media reports
that online safety is relevant not only to children's use of personal devices and apps, but in schools and from
school-issued devices as cybersecurity breaches also occur (2021). The market for children's digital advertising
246 | 5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS

was $1.2 billion in 2019. The majority (60%) of connected devices don't provide necessary information about
how they collect or use personal information. And nearly the same percentage of early teens ages 12-15
believe it's easy to delete their information online.
Although there has been incremental improvement, Commonsense Media reports that " the state of kids'
privacy is far below parents' expectations, and products used by children are not nearly as privacy-protecting
as they should be" (p. 2). This is largely due to weak privacy-protecting practices by many companies, despite
legal requirements. Companies' practices as a whole are inconsistent, unclear, don't define safeguards talent to
protect children, or lack a privacy policy. This can lead to distrust by educators, parents ,and school districts.
Commonsense Media offers a privacy/safety rating on software, and their report anticipates that ratings will
shift depending on companies' compliance with policy changes. They conclude their 2021 report by saying

      Unfortunately, there is still far too little attention paid to the privacy and security practices of technology
      platforms that affect tens of millions of children on a daily basis. It is vital that educators, parents, and
      policymakers engage in an open dialogue with companies to build solutions that strengthen our children's
      privacy and security protections. (p. 4)

Public policies concerning childhood privacy

                           "GDPR & ePrivacy Regulations" by dennis convert is licensed
                           under CC BY 2.0.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA, US] and the General Data Protection Regulation
[EU] dictate that social networking sites be accessed only by children 13 and older (Blum-Ross et al., 2018).
In January 2020, the California Children's Privacy Act went into effect. This provides more stringent
protections than COPPA related to notice and consent, children's rights, enforcement, and other items,
                                           5.1 TECHNOLOGY USE AND IMPACTS IN CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS | 247

making it closer to the protections offered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Recently
developed, the 5 Rights Foundation advances protections for children's well-being, particularly as article 25 of
the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child extends children's rights to online environments. Privacy
principles for children recommend that children not be tracked or profiled online, nor subject to ads based on
their online activity; that children be able to easily modify the personal information they choose to share; that
families educate themselves on privacy options and agree not to share children's information without their
consent (Commonsense Media, 2021).

Internet Gaming Disorder

Legitimate concerns have been raised about videogames fostering addiction, seen in approximately 1-3% of
those who play videogames. Signs of internet gaming addiction (Petry et al., 2015) may begin to surface in
those children vulnerable particularly to the gamification and competitions embedded in the software.

As listed in the DSM-V, the proposed symptoms of internet gaming disorder include:

   Preoccupation with gaming
   Withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away or not possible (sadness, anxiety, irritability)
   Tolerance, the need to spend more time gaming to satisfy the urge
   Inability to reduce playing, unsuccessful attempts to quit gaming
   Giving up other activities, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities due to gaming
   Continuing to game despite problems
   Deceiving family members or others about the amount of time spent on gaming
   The use of gaming to relive negative moods, such as guilt or hopelessness
   Risk, having jeopardized or lost a job or relationship due to gaming

Under the proposed criteria, a diagnosis of internet gaming disorder would require experiencing five or more
of these symptoms within a year.

With this significant overview of child and youth development related to ICT use, we now explore the ways in
which technology is used by parents and in support of their parenting.

5.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

Developmental observations

This chapter highlights four domains of human development across four stages of childhood. To
observe children's technology use with an eye to developmental impact, having a shorthand table
can help. Many summaries of human development in children exist online. You can also create one
using this table. Go to the Google doc and create a copy:

It can be helpful to use an observation guide to compare and contrast technology use and possible
impacts across age groups. A guide (such as the one below) enables you to observe use, within the
context of the child. Doing this will help identify some of the traditional factors that motivate
children's use (e.g., using it with peers, using it in school). Go to the Google doc and create a copy:

     Readiness to possess a smartphone

     Debate the question: Children should not be allowed to possess* a smartphone below the
     age of 12.
     *possess= have complete independent use of, beyond the cost of purchase. Possession may or may
     not involve covering or contributing to the cost of maintenance (e.g., data plans).
     Identifying the pros and cons of this prompt should create a sense of the developmental and
     practical and social reasons children "possess" phones. A key is to understand children's readiness
     and ability to handle what they may be exposed to through 24/7 access to the internet, social
     media, and apps. They also need to be responsible for maintaining and keeping safe a piece of
     technology.
     Some resources (see chapter text for more references; also the Additional Resources and Materials
     for Chapter 5):

Smartphones in the classroom: Policy discovery

Begin by reading this news item: https://www.edsurge.com/news/2022-06-06-the-case-for-
making-classrooms-phone-free?mc_key=00Qi000001X2OYEEA3
Scenario: You teach English at an urban public high school of about 2,000 students. Of the five
classes you teach each day, each has an average of 28 students. Two classes are for junior and
senior IB/AP students; two classes are for sophomores (a very mixed class), and one for freshman
(first-year students, most of whom are from immigrant families where English is not spoken at
home).
You attend a Parent-Student-Teacher Association (PTSA) meeting and hear a demand from some
teachers for students NOT to have phones available during classes. Currently, the policy by the
school and the school district is vague; it primarily encourages "responsible use" and "individual
preference by instructors." Many of the parents agree with the ban, as do a few of the students
present. But not all of the students agree. And several teachers of upper-grade students advocate
that phones be available for learning purposes. The principal has asked you to lead a work group to
identify policies on phones from high schools. The aim will be to present policy options to the PTSA
and the student body for creation of a policy, which will then be brought to the school district for
adoption.

    1. Identify examples of policy that can be presented to the school.
   2. Given parents' concerns for their children's exposure to the internet and social media, and the

        potential value of them having a smartphone, provide a list of recommendations for families
        in determining children's safe and effective use of a smartphone. Consult with parents if you
        like. Write the list as a handout that might be shared by parenting educators.

     Technology use by young children in early care and education

     Early childhood teachers and child care providers often grapple with whether to teach young
     children using technology, and with the degree to which iPads, media, YouTube channels, and apps
     should figure into the day of learning. This list of reflection questions is great for honing in on the
     intentions behind teaching young children and the use of technology:

     Book review

     Amazon and other booksellers are full of books about children using technology. Here are a few:
           The wired child: Reclaiming childhood in a digital age. (2015). Richard Freed.
           Glow kids: How screen addiction is hijacking our kids -- and how to break the trance.
             Nicholas Kardaras.

          Screenwise (2016). Devorah Heitner.

           The big disconnect: Protecting childhood and family relationships in the digital age (2013).
             Catherine Steinger-Adair.

           How to stay safe on social media: Social media do's and don'ts: What kids and parents should
             know. (2021). Effie Manolas.

     Choose one of these titles and read it carefully. If you were to write a review of the book for a)
     family professionals and b) parents, what would write? Strive for a critical eye; remember that
                                                                                                                    5.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 261

reviews often lead readers to consume or ignore a source, and that few publications are perfect just
as they are. What should readers attend to? What would readers find most meaningful?

Recommendations for healthy technology use by emerging adults

The aims of young adult development are characterized by
      healthy body and mind
      exploration and identity
      Individuation
      family connectedness and separateness
      feeling stable, less ambivalent
      taking on "full responsibilities of adulthood"

Considering these aims, and your own experiences of and goals for your growing sense of yourself
as an adult, what are guidelines you'd recommend for healthy technology use for your age group?
Join with a group of peers and create a list of recommendations. Engage in a dialogue about the
challenges you face in your technology use and in taking on the "full responsibilities of adulthood"
to prepare a realistic and constructive list.
262 | 5.4 BLOG PROMPTS

5.4 BLOG PROMPTS

    The American Academy of Pediatrics released a tool, called The Family Media Plan, to
    help families create a plan for their children's use of media. This tool can be a real help as
    families negotiate the amount of time children spend with technology and screens. Yet is
    it realistic to expect that families would be able to follow through on this plan? Why? Or
    why not?

     This textbook provides an overview of developmental differences, technology uses, and potential
     concerns and benefits across age groups. Yet research is growing on specific aspects of technology/
     device/application and child age and impact. Identify an area that you are most interested in, and
     present what the research and policy literature says about it. Even if you find just a few studies or
     reports from reputable sources, try your hand at summarizing recent findings. For example, Fortnite
     is popular with children, prompting questions about gaming effects on children's socialization. Your
     post would examine research on children in middle childhood (6-12 years) who play interactive
     games, and what impacts have been found. What are the recommendations for parents and
     practitioners? Have industry standards been recommended or other policy action? Provide your
     perspective -- what draws your interest to this (for instance, are you a gamer? do you work with
     school-age children?) and what you take from the research.

     Particularly sensitive issues like depression and suicide, cyberbullying, child privacy, sex trafficking,
     children's exposure to influencers on guns, and videogame addiction can be sensationalized in the
     press and in conversation among parents and educators. Select a hot-button issue and argue for a
     rational understanding of technology's role. Doing so brings up the pros and cons of the internet,
     and of users, influencers, and our wider and global society's involvement.

   Chapter Insights

      Although research on adult technology use exists, an interest in parent use requires specific study.
      This chapter identifies three main ways that parents use technology to serve their parenting roles:

        using technology to parent, using technology with children, using technology to support oneself in
        the parenting role.
      Parents vary in their technology use. These differences are important to keep in mind when exploring
        parents' impact on children's development in terms of technology use and oversight.
      Five domains of parenting practice integrate ways in which technology is used by parents, and can be
        used to measure successful parenting.
      Generational differences play out in a parents' use of technology.
      Parents are not necessarily "equal" when it comes to using technology on their own, and in fulfilling
        their parenting role.
      "Sharenting" can be useful to reinforce the childrearing experience, yet can also bridge ethical
        challenges to children's privacy.
      After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for you, and
        the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.
274 | 6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS

Introduction

Every day, and for many all day, adults use ICT in many
different ways. But consider what they use in their roles
as parents, how technology relates to or facilitates those
roles, who it's used with, and what parenting goal results.
How do your parents or other caregivers you know use
technology to fulfill their roles in parenting?

In the previous chapter we examined technology use by

children from birth through young adulthood, exploring

potential impacts on their development and well-being.

We discussed the benefits and potential consequences of

technology use across ages and developmental domains,

all of which are the focus of ongoing research. Embedded     "Whistler's Mommy-Blogger" by Mike Licht,
and implied in the discussion were parents' roles; their     NotionsCapital.com is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

concerns around the amount of time children are on

screen, their responsibilities for healthy engagement, and family decision making about children's responsible

smartphone use. Lim (2016) calls this the practice of "transcendent parenting," which goes beyond

traditional, physical concepts of parenting to incorporate virtual and online parenting.

Recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatric about technology use by young children, older
children, and teens (Pathway Pediatrics, 2021) are written almost exclusively to parents -- underscoring how
our society confers on parents childrearing responsibilities that include technology management skills and the
knowledge of technology's impacts.

Parents integrate technology into their parenting -- using phone calls, texts, social media interactions, and
other experiences as ways to convey guidance and nurturance to children. Consider how your parent(s)
communicate with you. What parenting messages or roles are conveyed through these methods? Parents also
use technology in ways that support them as parents and only indirectly impact children.

Chapter 7 will explore relationship dynamics between parents and children when parents assert their
parenting role around children's safe and healthy technology use, and children assert agency in use. This
includes parents' mediating, moderating, and monitoring children's use (parenting about technology), and
impacts on the parent-child relationships. Chapter 7 will also include the ways in which parents use
technology with their children to convey words and actions. In this chapter, the focus is on parents alone --
how parents themselves use information and communications technology, and the value and purpose it serves
in parenting and to the parent him or herself.

Here are a couple things to keep in mind as we go through this chapter:

   Data reporting "adult" technology use is not sufficient to capture the role of parenting by
      adults. It is important to distinguish research focused on parents from that focused on the childrearing
      role fulfilled by parents. As an example, Duggan et al. (2015) focused on social media and internet use
      among parents and non-parents, though the study included a representative sample of U.S. adults. They
      showed that parents are more likely to use the internet than non-parenting adults and that they use types
      of social media differently (participating in most social media applications, except for Instagram, in
      greater numbers). Some research on adults may report the data as coming from parents, under the
      supposition that those who are parents are adults, yet discrimination is necessary for accuracy.
276 | 6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS

      Fortunately, as parenting researchers became more comfortable doing studies that involved technology
      and internet use, the availability of studies collecting and reporting results from parents is more available.

   Parents are not monolithic. They vary by age, maturity, gender, family configuration, number of
      children, culture, race, global location, and much more. In Chapter 3 we discussed how these variables
      can influence differences in family technology use. Like other technology users, parents vary widely in
      their access, use, function, and attitude about devices. More than a decade ago, the author's research on
      parents and technology use identified how caregivers vary by their attitudes toward technology mixed
      with device ownership and activity (Walker et al., 2015). Over 1,600 parents of children under the age of
      18 were surveyed online. We asked questions with regard to the frequency of their doing four different
      activities with technology such as communication and information searching, the number of devices
      owned in the household, and their attitudes regarding technology. As you can see in the chart below, we
      identified nine different groups. "Omnivores," or those in families with many devices doing all kinds of
      activities, held a very positive attitude about technology. The majority were in the moderate category,
      where they may have used technology for very specific purposes, had an average number of devices ,and
      may have had very positive or not-so-positive attitudes with regard to technology.

                                                                          A smaller group (likely even smaller now)
      were indifferent/had a few devices/had fairly negative attitudes about technology and used them for few
      activities. Certainly, over time and with new devices and applications and ICT functionality, even more
      differences among parents can be seen. The essential issue is that we don't hold a belief that parents use
      technology in the same ways.

Many caregivers are employed, and the conditions of their workplaces and jobs vary widely. These contexts
affect technology use, access, and comfort in ways that affect parents as employees and their parenting and
presence as parents. Being available for calls or meetings in the home space and during nontraditional hours
can distract parents from being attentive to children. In other cases, parents who appreciate the flexibility
                                                                                                            6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS | 277

provided by mobile technology and home internet may juggle responsibilities and be more available to
children.

Jointly, these demographic characteristics influence parents' needs on what to know about technology and
what they may do with it, and they play a role in their comfort with ICT. Too often, discussions generalize
"parents' social media use" or "parents" monitoring of their children's use, when in fact wide variation exists
among parents. Pew's study of parent social media use, for example, shows vast differences between mothers
and fathers in types of social media, purposes for use, and frequency of behavior (Duggan et al., 2015). Yet a
global statement referring to "parents" lacks discrimination by gendered role.

Before diving into specifics of parents' technology use, we begin with an overview of the parenting role and
influences on it. This framework provides a foundation for understanding technology use as expression of the
parenting role.

About Parenting

family structures leaving many parents alone in childrearing, and with a lack of public services in the U.S. for

hierarchically to mean keeping children protected,
healthy, and surviving (most basic function); nurturing,
and guiding their development (where most of our
traditional notions of parenting lie); and, when needed
advocating on their behalf. 1

  For most parents, the first level -- providing basic needs and protecting from harm -- is a given, yet for many
  families it's truly an economic struggle. Our social welfare system is in place to assist families with meeting
  basic needs, especially around housing, health care, nutrition and finding employment. The second level,
  guiding development, is a process that doesn't stop when children are 18 or out of the house. Throughout a
  child's life, they will seek and be guided by their parents. Actions that parents take in guiding children, as
  described in a booklet by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, include responding in an
  appropriate manner, monitoring to preventing risky behavior or problems before they arise, mentoring to
  support and encourage desired behaviors, and modeling their own behavior to provide a consistent positive
  example for the child. The third level, advocacy, is expressed in big and small ways, also throughout a child's
  life. It may be individualized, such as when a parent meets with a teacher on behalf of one child, or globalized,
  as when a parent advocates for an issue that affects many children, such as lobbying for children's technology
  privacy and safety. Think about your own life, and how your parent or parents have fulfilled these roles for
  you.

1. This is just one of several parenting pyramids characterizing parenting roles and processes. See, for example, the Parenting Pyramid from the
  Arbinger Institute, which embeds guidance within the relationship: https://content.byui.edu/file/91e7c911-20c5-4b9f-b8fc-9e4b1b37b6fc/1/

Parenting is often thought of in a directional way, with parenting action "causing" child outcomes (For
example, the news reports of teenager committing crime and someone remarks about `bad' parenting.).
Perhaps this is because of the authority conferred on the responsibility of parenting, across the child's early to
later adolescent years and beyond, and the enactment of these responsibilities to help children flourish.
Dynamics of family roles, certain experiences in families, and the way parents are often represented in the
media can suggest that parenting actions directly impact the child. 2

Impacts on child development are, however,

mulitfactorial. And parenting is a bi-directional and a

transactional process. A parent attends to the needs of

the individual child and tailors their responses to that

child's individuality. They reflect on their resources, gain

understanding from the interaction and observation with

the child and in the context, and learn. This is

attunement. Once again, consider your brothers and

sisters if you have them: did your parents parent them the

same way as they parented you? Probably not. Your

brothers and sisters are different than you, they are         "Siblings" by Andrew Nourse is licensed under

different personalities and temperaments, and your

parent was a different age when each sibling arrived. Your oldest brother/sister may have been born when your

parents were in their twenties, and by the time you came along your parents were ten years older. You can

imagine how much experience they had gained in those ten years. So as parents understand and react and

respond and guide their children, they too grow and develop through their experiences as human beings, and

they attune and transactionally gear their childrearing based on information they glean through interaction

with the child.

Although there are many frameworks of parenting, ones that incorporate individual differences of parents
and myriad contextual factors as influential on parenting and parent-child relationships are useful to apply
cross-culturally and when viewing parenting in the novel area of technology. Most social systems perspectives
of parenting emanate from a bioecological paradigm (Bronfenbrenner, 1995), discussed in Chapters 2 and 5.

2. How ironic then that it wasn't too long ago (1998) that a book in the popular press by an independent researcher stirred up conversation whether

                                     "zone of proximal development" (within their

developmental reach based on existing capacities). Adequate contextual supports can help adults acquire a

greater repertoire of cognitive, behavioral, and relational skills, and reinforce identification in the role. The

social context can, however, interfere with growth, or may assert needs that are beyond the individual's
capacity (e.g., living in poverty). A competency model proposed by Johnson et al. (2014).3 adds to the

rudimentary model above by adding to functional competences (e.g., provision of basic needs, behavioral

guidance), with foundational competencies (e.g., psychological health) and contexts (child age, development,

parental social network).

With consideration to the focus on technology, children's technology use and individual differences of the
child can be seen as context factors, as can influences from school and peers and wider institutions on that
use. These intersect with foundational elements of the parent's own psychological and cognitive abilities and
attitudes to influence apparent parenting behaviors related to technology use (their own, the child's, and the
family's). This model also reveals child use or parenting response not as a linear action, but as interactive and
recursive in response to other elements. Parenting behavioral guidance will change with the child's age, and a
parents' mental health may improve with feelings of self-efficacy as a result of interactions with their child
around technology use.

Influences on Parenting

Belsky's (1984) model articulates determinants of parenting as including three primary spheres: the
individual parent, his or her social system, and the child. Parenting is influenced by individual characteristics

3. A word on the word "competency:" it refers here to the skills applied to caregiving, rather than a qualitative assessment. There are volumes of
  research on this concept, and readers are encouraged to see how scholarship defines and measures "competent" parenting.
                                                                                                            6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS | 281

of the parent, including developmental history (e.g., how s/he was parented) and personal traits (e.g.,
personality, mental health, maturational level of development). The child influences parenting and requires
"fit" to the child's needs through factors including developmental stage, health, temperament, and gender.
Interaction with the social context provides the parent with information, influences, norms and expectations,
resources, emotional, and practical supports that may shape, reinforce, and possibly thwart parenting. For
example, social support in the form of practical assistance from family helps alleviate everyday stress, resulting
in more positive maternal mental health.

            Determinants of parenting (a modified model adapted from Belsky, (1984).

Determinants work interactively to influence the practice, attitudes, and relational qualities of parenting,
which have direct or indirect impacts on child outcomes. For example, a social cognitive perspective of parent
development (Azar) holds that a parent's understanding of the relational role evolves through the
development of cognitive capacities that are shaped through interaction with the environment.
As parenting is, in part, a social construction, and the environment provides opportunities that scaffold
learning and develop knowledge and identity (Marienau & Segal, 2006) to deeper, more complex levels. As
the parent matures and grows in understanding of self relative to others (the needs of the child), and is
surrounded and influenced by expectations of the social context, their perceptions and responses will change.
The table below describes the "stages" of parenting that align with childrearing across a child's development
(Galinsky, 1987). These stages need more in-depth study to reflect other conditions of a parent's life, such as
having multiple children, gaining stepchildren, and child loss. They have also not been adequately applied
across cultural frameworks. Nevertheless, they indicate change within the parent as an adult as related to child
development.

Belsky's model also includes influences from the marital (partner/co-parent) or partner relationship and from
work -- both affecting the parents' ability to parent and the parents' own parenting behaviors. Chapter 9 will
focus on work-family balance and technology and explore how the workplace can influence technological
considerations in parenting.

A potential research question integrating these factors with relationship to technology might examine
parents' monitoring of a child's use of social media. This parenting behavior might vary with parent age and
understanding of technology (parent characteristics) and with the child's age (child characteristics). We might
then measure the time spent on schoolwork as an outcome, with our hypothesis being that parents who are
comfortable with technology and children who are normatively developing may interact more constructively
with technology for homework, leading to the child spending more time on school work. We might also
incorporate social media, hypothesizing that parents' discussion with friends about social media's effects
might influence a mother's motivation to monitor her child's time and exposure online while the child is
using technology for homework.

A third model that respects individual variation is Super and Harkness' developmental niche (1986),
conceptualizing child-rearing practices as the outgrowth of caregiver beliefs intersecting with setting demands
and cultural perspectives. With regard to their technology use with and for their children's wellbeing,
                                                                                                            6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS | 283

parenting practices are motivated by (or in response to) a specific setting for which parents are preparing their
children to live. As parents acknowledge shifts in the world compared to their own childhoods, and the ways
in which successfully operating in life is now dependent on comfort and skill with a multifaceted range of
devices, applications, and settings that call for technology integration, their actions will reflect the worlds they
know and the worlds they anticipate for their children.

                                            Readers will note that these models offer perspectives on

                                            parents and parenting in a gender-neutral way. Certainly,

                                            there are models specific to "mothering" and "fathering"

284 | 6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS

survey research on parents and technology, this sample unfortunately was predominantly white and well-
educated, and therefore we cannot generalize the results to all parents. However, this was early work to
indicate the range of ways in which parents use technology that fulfill all domains of the parenting role.
Recent work by Livingstone et al. (2018) revealed similar data on the range of ways parents use technology for
parenting.

Information and communication activities included the frequency of doing an activity for parenting.
Respondents were asked to indicate whether the action and use of technology was done in general as an adult
or whether it was done for parenting. For example, when they responded that email and texting were used for
personal communication, they would be asked the degree to which this was done for parenting. Frequency of
actions were measured as weekly or more often, so a certain level of activity was required for the action to
count. The five domains of parenting were taken from the Parent Education Core Curriculum Framework
(PECCFI) by the Minnesota Association of Family and Early Education (mnafee.org), which assists licensed
parenting educators in Minnesota with the creation of curriculum for parents. The five domains are:

   Parent development: promote parent confidence, secure the parents' philosophy of parenting, and
      explore perspectives related to parenting.

   Parent-child relationship: strengthen reciprocity, trust, and expressions of affection; ensure the child's
      health and safety.

   Child development: understand children's development and have reasonable expectations; promote all
      aspects of child development -- physical, cognitive, social, and psychological.

   Family development: promote family time together, and manage family resources.
   Culture and community: build and maintain relationships with friends and professionals, seek

      support.

             Parent use of ICT aligned with the five domains of parenting/parent education (PECCFI,
                                     MNAFEE.org). Adapted from Walker & Rudi, 2015.

Parenting functions as listed on the survey were coded to align with one of the five domains in the parent
education framework. We then observed, by type of technology, how parents used technology to fulfill that
particular function. With regard to parent development, approximately 40-55% of the parents identified
using technology to resolve conflicting information, explore perspectives, confirm their beliefs, express
themselves, and provide advice to others. Smaller portions indicated that they use technology to
communicate with the child or to keep up with the child's friends (note: the average age of children in the
sample was 6). The highest numbers, at more than 50%, were indicated for fulfilling child development
through seeking information, identifying problems, and normalizing parents' observation of children's
behavior. Percentages were high as well for the family development and the culture and community domains.
In family development, 92% of parents reported using technology for communication with non-residential
family members. Technology was also used by more than half to review products and to have fun with the
family. With regard to culture and community, more than half reported using technology to communicate
with friends, make professional connections, and receive support.

The types of technologies used to fulfill each of these parenting actions varied. For parent development,
discussion boards, blogs, and creative activities were most frequently mentioned. Discussion boards and
information sources were also identified when seeking information about child's development. For the
parent-child relationship, communication devices were obviously used (e.g., texting, calling, instant
messaging). For family development, communication devices were used for connecting with non-residential
family members, and for shared entertainment and games. Utility functions such as navigation tools or
websites were used for purchasing goods for the family. And finally, communication devices, discussion
boards, and social media were mentioned for building community and maintaining a family culture.

Through this simple research, we can see that the same technology that promotes the parents' own
development can be used to strengthen knowledge about child development, while also building a stronger
social network of support. No one device or application fulfills all functions, yet a single function (like
learning more about child development or building parent confidence) can be facilitated by a variety of tech.
These applications reflect technology popular a decade ago; a more contemporary investigation would likely
address specific types of social media, videoconferencing, and use of smart devices like Alexa.

Individualized use

Research indicates that parent technology use varies, a finding that validates our understanding of individual

differences. Use is complementary to that of available resources, devices, or applications; it also supplements

                                                   what is not available elsewhere. Parents also draw on

                                                   expanding the size of social networks. A parent may

have networks of friends at work and in the neighborhood to whom she turns to for advice and information

on parenting. A Facebook group for parents of young children can exist for her as a complementary source of

information and support to her offline resources.

Finally, parents' use of technology can supplement what is missing in offline lives. Early research on parents'
internet use identified that parents most likely to use discussion forums were those whose children had special
needs (e.g., Scharer, 2005). Parents went online to find a community and information not available to them in
their face-to-face world. They found great relief communicating and connecting with others who had
experience raising a child who had the same condition or diagnosis, a community in which they felt no
judgment and could share their own experiences.

Steinmetz's Time article (2015), "Help, my parents are millennials," describes variations in attitudes,
opinions, and behaviors between those who are Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), Gen Xers (born
between 1965 and 1980), and Baby Boomers (born between 1945 and 1965). Millennials, for example, are
more likely to purchase gender-neutral toys for their children and to report feeling judged by other parents.
Consider how these attitudes might play out differently in ICT interactive behavior. Now that young adults
represent a new generation (Gen Z, born after 1996) what attitudinal or perspective shifts might be revealed
in their parenting, and how might their parenting interests be reflected differently in their technology use?

encourage dialogue and often to seek

emotional support and validation for their parenting.

These relationships between parent technology use and their parenting and interactions with children are not
always clean, nor directional. As demonstrated by McDaniel and Radesky (2018), a bidirectional relationship
can occur between parent and child and technology. Their study revealed that child behavior can relate to
stress in the parent, who turns to technology for distraction, in turn exacerbating the children's behavior that
is causing the stress.

                                      Parent Technology Use as
Direct and Indirect Influence on the Child

Given the actions of parenting as revealed through behaviors, attitudes, skills, and knowledge directly with or
on behalf of their children, and the internal, historical, social and environmental influences on parenting,
there are three dimensions of technology use by parents:

1. Parenting ABOUT technology
2. Parenting WITH technology
3. Technology use AIDING the parent and parenting

After a brief introduction here, the first two actions will discussed in more depth in Chapter 7. More
attention in this chapter will be paid to the third way that parents use technology: on behalf of themselves as
parents.
290 | 6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS

Parenting about (the child's use of) technology and
parenting the child with technology

                                                     Adding to parents' scope of practice is their child's

                                                     well-being in the use of information and

                                                     communications technology. Therefore, among

                                                     many other topics, parents parent about the content

                                                     topic of children's technology. Parental monitoring,

                                                     asserting controls, and mediating screen time have

                                                     been the centerpiece of research and action for

                                                     childrearing support for at least the last decade

                                                     (Auxier et al., 2020; Blum-Ross et al., 2018; Coyne

                                                     et al., 2017; Livingstone & Blum-Ross, 2020;

"Eaglebrook-School-Country-Fair-2014-Classes201410   Livingstone et al., 2018; Nathanson, 2018; Wartella
167718" by EaglebrookSchool is licensed under CC BY  et al., 2013). On this, parents vary widely,
2.0.                                                 influenced by their perspectives and understanding

of technology's effects. For example, parents' attitudes along with their own media use influence young

children's use of technology in general, and specifically related to math and science. Parenting confidence and

parent media patterns also influence their actions towards children's media use. Parents with greater

confidence around technology are more likely to monitor and interact with children around media use

(Commonsense Media, 2016). And parents vary in terms of their own behavior around media consumption.

Households that are more media-centric have more screens that are on for more hours of the day, and

attitudes toward children's technology ownership and use are more lax, compared with those of parents who

are more media-moderate or media-light (Wartella et al., 2013).

These influences aren't reserved for families of younger children and teens. During the pandemic, parents'
attitudes toward using technology for distance learning in universities showed variation. Those less concerned
about financial impacts, and who saw benefits held more favorable views of distance learning technology
(Mahasneh et al., 2021), which factored into their encouragement of their children. Chapter 7 explores this
topic in more depth.

As illustrated by this graphic of parents' technology use relative to that of teens, parental monitoring and
talking about media with children is balanced with their own sizeable consumption of screen time and with
modeling media behavior to children (Lauricella et al., 2016).

Technology is also a vehicle through which parents' parent. They        "Red Bull moms take care of business"

Time interacting together with technology, such as through
gaming, co-viewing movies, or engaging in a "maker space" (a
facility for creating with materials and developing critical thinking
skills; see www.makerspaces.com), can strengthen parent-child
cohesion (Coyne et al., 2017; Commonsense Media, 2016; Ito et al.,
2020). Yet parents using technology to parent can produce conflict
in the parent-child relationship as children feel their agency
threatened through un-agreed upon monitoring (Blackwell et al.,
2016; Coyne et al., 2017; Commonsense Media, 2016; Livingstone
et al., 2018). Personal use can also create a distraction and diminish
attention to caregiving, which affects the quality of the relationship
(Beamish et al., 2019).

Technology use AIDING the parent
and parenting

A third way in which parents use technology is as support for their parenting. In this way, technology plays a
more indirect role, connecting parents to information, social and emotional support, validation, and skills
development. Reading helpful tips on infant sleep on a parenting blog, for example, may boost confidence in
ways that show in childrearing. There is, of course, also the possibility of negative influences on the parent,
perhaps through negative messages or challenges to their perspectives and identity. As an example, parent
confidence may be affected when other parents post about their "perfect" children on Facebook. To examine
parents' use of technology to support themselves in the role is to see the parent as a developing adult, and the
use of technology as fulfilling personal and adult roles as well as parent roles.

Gathering information

Gathering information about child development and health is a major way that parents use technology to
support their parenting competence and comfort (Baker et al., 2017; Livingstone et al., 2018; Myers-Walls &
Dworkin, 2015; Zero to Three, 2016). Recent data suggests that 40% of U.S. parents with children up to age
17, and 65% of Australian parents of children ages 2-12, get information from the web (Auxier et al., 2020;
Baker et al., 2017). Parents who are of higher socioeconomic status and those with children with special needs
are more likely to use online help (Zhang & Livingstone, 2019). Online sources are used to complement
                                                                                                            6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS | 293

parents' other, more personal, and proximal sources, including friends and family, teachers, pediatricians, and
other professionals (Myers-Walls & Dworkin, 2015; Zero to Three, 2016).

While this can be useful for problem-solving and resolving parents' answers about childrearing and child
development, there is the potential for misinformation. In a Wired magazine article in early 2022
(Jankowicz), the author examined pregnancy-related apps for new mothers. She notes that the majority of
apps are run by "lifestyle" companies powered by advertising revenue. The aim is less about supplying
accurate information about the stages of pregnancy and transition to parenthood, and more about
connecting the user to other platforms and using user data. Worse, the sites can promote potentially harmful
misinformation about pregnancy and childbirth.

And while research suggests that a minority of parents participate in parenting education online (at least, pre-
COVID; Walker & Rudi, 2014; Zero to Three, 2016), delivery of parenting education programs wholesale or
as a complement to face-to-face efforts is increasingly available (McLean et al., 2017; Walker, 2020).
Demographic variation reveals that parents in lower socioeconomic groups, particularly those with less formal
education and who live in higher-stress environments, are more open to getting information from websites
than to participating in seminars or individually tailored programs (e.g., evidence-based programs adapted for
online delivery). This suggests that outreach methods need to appeal to a wide range of parents to reduce
equity gaps in participation. Given the conversion to online-only parenting education programming during
COVID-19, it will be interesting to see if attitudes change with a return to face-to-face opportunities.
Chapter 11 will explore technology applications in the delivery of parenting education.

Exchanging social support

                                             Informal exchanges with peers through social

                                             media, seeking out information on childrearing on a

                                             website, pursuing creative ways to express oneself by

                                             blogging or interest board (e.g., Pinterest) and

                                             videoconferencing with other parents all contribute

                                             to parents' mental health, sense of identity, and

                                             feelings of connectedness (Walker & Rudi, 2014).

                                             Meaningful support for the parenting role comes

                                             through parents' use of social media and other

                                             family, and friends. In the U.S., 29% of parents

                                             report getting information from social media, and

19% from message boards. Participation in discussion forums and social media offers parents emotional

validation, normalization of concerns, and tailored information for problem-solving and decision-making
294 | 6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS

(Drentea & Moren-Cross, 2005; Walker & Rudi, 2014). Indeed, some of the earliest research on parents'
technology use was in the health care community, as nurses observed parents with special needs children using
discussion forums to exchange information and ideas (Scharer, 2005). More recent research has identified
social media and blogging as a form of expression and support that is valuable for parents of children with
special needs/health challenges (Blum-Ross & Livingstone, 2017; Nagelhout et al., 2018) and for other
marginalized groups of parents, including LGBTQ (Blackwell et al., 2016). And using social media during
transition points in parenting can be validating and bridge identity shifts to new roles (Bartholomew et al.,
2012). Younger parents and mothers are especially likely to use social media to share information about their
children, compared with fathers and older parents (Auxier et al., 2020; Steinmetz, 2015). Blum-Ross and
Livingstone (2017) write that "sharenting" helps manage the juggling of identities as parent, problem solver,
and information seeker. Still, fathers and grandparents, foster parents and other caregivers are a significant
presence among bloggers. Blogging, and interacting on social media, enables parents and caregivers to
transmit images and pictures of the parent's child and of themselves in ways that deepen the sense of
themselves as caregivers and perhaps anticipate themselves into the future.

For some parents, however sharing their parenting experiences and children's lives online brings up feelings of
guilt and ethical dilemmas. And as noted, such use can also override children's privacy and opinions on the
use of their personal information. In preparation for a radio discussion on children's privacy online, the
author ran across a Buzzfeed news item on "pumpkin butt." Parents submitted pictures of their baby's
bottom painted with a pumpkin for a voter competition. While to many this may be cute, and it may provide
some parents a sense of connection and even pride if their baby is voted for, it can also be seen as an invasion
of the child's privacy and contributing to the commodification of children's bodies.

There is particular value in virtual exchanges that

strengthen parents' social capital and its personal and   "Sharenting" online can offer
parenting benefits (McLean et al., 2017). Definitions     parents ways to express
of social capital vary by structural (e.g., network ties  themselves in the caregiving

produce familiarity and feelings of trust,

strengthening bonding social capital. Parents'

interactions through social networking can also form bridging social capital, or connections to new networks

which offer new, more novel connections, and the opportunity to learn new information about parenting.

Cochran's perspective on parents' personal social networks (Cochran & Walker, 2005), supported by research

and later applied to parents' use of the internet (Walker & Greenhow, 2010), indicates that heterogeneous
                                                                                                            6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS | 295

connections are positive for parents through the diversity of perspectives and acquisition of novel
information.
There is evidence of the valuable impact of social network membership and processes for parents' actions and
attitudes in parenting and, as a result, positive albeit indirect impacts on child outcomes. Given what we
know about relational processes that promote learning by adults (e.g., McShane et al., 2014; Brookfield,
2020), the author has asserted the value of these online social connections as providing social learning
outcomes in complement with social support and social capital (Walker, 2015). Jointly, these social products
inform and support the parent's assets brought to parenting. The figure below demonstrates the complexity
of factors involved in parent technology use intersecting with social network membership, engagement, and
eventual outcomes. It demonstrates on the right, the social structures and processes that provide resources to
parents, which contribute to the parent's well-being, the relationship with the child, and potential outcomes.
These social elements also take place in virtual worlds and through the use of digital media (left). Access to the
internet and digital media, and skills and comfort in using them, further vary parents' access to and use of
their social supports as assets in their parenting.

When interacting online, particularly using social media, some parents proceed with caution. Online
296 | 6.1 TECHNOLOGY USE BY PARENTS

interactions for parents can be challenging for some. Fear of judgment, self-comparison, and diminished
confidence in childrearing can result (Steinmetz, 2015). Additional researchers have shown that discussions
can also promote particular perspectives. For example, Madge and O'Connor (2006) note that while mothers'
exchanges on parenting through discussion forums were viewed as helpful at the time, those taking to the
internet reinforced a more traditional stereotype of mothering. In the search for validation and content -- an
issue that affects all parents (Cavalcante, 2015; Fraser & Llewellen, 2015) -- individuals in caregiving roles
may need to find the best "fit" between content and their values for the experience to be most meaningful.

With this background on parenting revealing intentions and goals of those who hold this role in families, we
begin to see the ways that ICT can help to fulfill those goals and how differences in access, comfort, skill using
technology, and parent profiles reveal variation in this population. In this chapter we offer an essential though
often under-discussed dimension of parenting: parent self-development and self-care. Indeed, social media,
applications, internet searches, and exchanges of information present an array of opportunities for parents to
find support for the parenting role.

6.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

Parents and technology use

Interview at least three different parents about their technology use. Compare and contrast what
you hear from them in terms of the ways in which they use technology to support their parenting.
Do they follow blogs or post on discussion forums? Do they use social media for connections with
friends about parenting? Or might some of the parents not use technology at all for assistance in
parenting Perhaps they search for information, but nothing more. Do they parent about technology
(as in monitoring their children's use)? Compare and contrast what you learn from the parents. In
what ways do they differ in their use of technology to support themselves as parents?

       Parents and "sharenting"

       Livingstone and Blum-Ross write about "sharenting" (2017)1 when parents blog and microblog
       (such as in social media feeds). They challenge the value of blogging as a way of strengthening
       parent identity through self-expression, arguing instead that it compromises details of the child's or
       family's life. Select at least five blogs by parents, preferably all mothers or all fathers, and review at
       least 5-10 posts in each. Get a sense of the content of each post and of the overall themes
       presented by the blog. Compare the blogs. What is your take on the degree to which parents
       overshare and potentially compromise their children's identity and agency? What is your take on

     the value to parents' own confidence, validation of their choices as parents, and development?

     Pregnancy and childbirth apps

     Inspect a random selection of apps related to pregnancy and childbirth. (You may want to create a
     junk email account to gain access to more internal features.) In your review, determine the real
     purpose of the apps, who is distributing them, and what they get in return for your free use.
     Examine the information provided. Is it scientifically and medically sound? How would you know?
     Which of the apps (if any) would you recommend to someone who is pregnant?

6.4 BLOG PROMPTS

For more than 20 years, Blogher has provided internet space and tools for women to write blogs.
Many of these blogs are from mothers who express themselves and their thoughts and concerns
about being a mother in today's society. Some offer parenting tips, or blend parenting with other
personal activity interests (e.g., cooking, party planning, travel). Tens of thousands of women blog
through Blogher, many with devoted followers. Consider the potential benefits and costs of this
blogging.

      What does writing a parenting blog mean in terms of time cost and personal energy?
      What does it mean in terms of the commodification of a mother's image? Might she feel the

        need to "be" a certain kind of mother, or to share certain stories or images to capture readers
        in the busy marketplace of the internet?
      What might her sharing stories and images of her children and family mean to their sense of
        personal privacy? We might argue that personal blogging can be an extension and
        expression of the identity of motherhood that is positive for the woman's confidence, but
        what costs might it run to herself and her family?
      Considering the landscape of "mommy blogs," are there mothers' voices that are NOT
        represented?
      What about fathers? Other types of parents (e.g., grandparents, foster parents). Would their
        blogging be any different than mothers'? Why might their voices not be as represented as
        mothers?

Consider that your own technology use is, in part, a product of your generation, your exposure to
technology, and the demand for use in your personal, school, and work life. And consider that
parents who are part of your generation are influenced by what they are exposed to through
technology, and that their behavior (shown by the amount of technology they consume) can model
media habits to their children, and can shape their beliefs about themselves as role models and
304 | 6.4 BLOG PROMPTS

     about the influence of technology on their children. What are your thoughts & feelings about your
     future roles as parents or as caregivers and what your technology use might mean?

     There are many parenting websites, discussion communities, Facebook groups, and other social
     groups and blogs. When you consider that we want parents to use these sites in ways that provide
     emotional support and accurate information, and that promote positive parenting, do they? Are
     engaging, readable, accurate? Are they gossipy, exclusionary, or downright hostile? For your post,
     construct criteria for web tools for parents, and then identify five tools to compare using your
     criteria. Based on your review, what can you gather about tools for parents? For mother? For
     fathers?

                                           Well, an element of conflict in any discussion's a very good thing.
                                                     It means everybody is taking part and nobody is left out.

   Chapter Insights

           Two concepts that underlie parent-child relationships: the emotional context of parenting
             style as the balance (or imbalance) of demandingness and warmth; and relationship
             dynamics as the coordination of agency/communion perspectives by parent and by child.

           Parental mediation can be active, restrictive, and indirect. Active mediation involves parent-
             child communication, parent engagement in media content exposure, and coordinated
             activity to negotiate rules.

           A variety of factors related to the parents (e.g., mediacentrism), the child (e.g., age) and the
             context (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) can affect parent behavior on regulating children's use.

           Reverse mediation, or when children's knowledge of technology exceeds parents' and
             enacted to aid the parent's use, can be a potential conflict in the relationship.

           Conflict in the parent-child relationship might occur in several ways related to technology
             (e.g., through parental attempts to control technology use, negotiations on content).

           Differences exist in perceived conflict in families by child age (e.g., fewer parents report
             conflict with children under 8 years), and changes in parent control with age. Influences on
             parental control can relate to the child's advancing development (e.g., confidence, knowledge
310 | 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

             of child's actual use, ability to stick with plans).
           Potential conflict to the parent-child relationship, to parenting, and to the child's well-being

             can occur through the parent's own technology use while with the child. Distractedness (or
             "technoference") has been related to a variety of parenting consequences.
           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Image by GSCSNJ, CC BY-NC 2.0                    between parent and child is a reciprocal, emotional
                                                 context through which information is

                                                 communicated that guides the child's

understanding of themselves and the world; through which the parent expresses their knowledge, experience,

goals, and dreams for their child; and through which the parent develops (Azar, 2006; Harach & Kuczynski,

2005). And as parenting is a social role, one conferred with certain responsibility and expectation by the

society and culture in which the family lives, the relationship with the child may be viewed differently. Some

may view the role with more authoritarian rights; others may view the child's agency as a vehicle for

expression that calls for a more democratic, authoritative approach (Bornstein, 2012). And some may be so

overwhelmed by society's demands and challenges that they view the role with near resignation and give

authority to the child to determine their path.

And each parent-child experience is different. As we viewed Belsky's multiple determinant model in Chapter
6, we saw how parents' perspectives change with experience, age, gender, socialization, and developmental
history. Their interactions also depend on unique characteristics of the child. And the social context factors
heavily on the parent-child dynamic, particularly as support is available to buffer stressors. In short, each
relationship between a parent and child is like no other. It is forever in the life of the child, and it changes over
time and with changes that occur in the lives of the parent and of the child. This transactional,
                                                               7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS | 311

developmental, contextual consideration of the parent-child relationship over time has led scholars to call for
using a life-course perspective when characterizing the enduring nature of the unique human experience as
facilitated by technology (Dworkin et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2021).

In previous chapters we've gleaned the systemic, ecological, and biological forces on individuals in families
and on family member subsets, and understood technology as an external force that influences the family
through facilitating communication, aiding family life, and at times introducing conflict through differences
in the ways that family members use technology. In Chapter 5 we understood the many ways technology can
impact all domains of children's development -- cognitive, social, psychological, and physical -- and
differences in use and impacts as children age from infants through young adults. In Chapter 6 we reviewed
basic functions of parenting that emphasize the physical health and well-being of the child (keeping the child
safe and thriving); guiding the many social, emotional, cognitive, and physical aspects of the child's
development; and at times being an advocate for the child. We saw that technology could support the parent's
role in childrearing -- primarily as it supports the parent as a vehicle to social and informational support, and
as an expression of the parent's identity. We also introduced other ways that parents use technology in the
parenting role -- with their children, and with technology as the focus of their parenting.

In this chapter we take a closer look at these dynamic elements of technology in the parent-child relationship,

including how parents enact their role in childrearing through parenting about technology. Parents mediate,

                                 monitor, and moderate children's use, and in keeping

Parents mediate, monitor, and    their children safe and their technology use effective,
moderate children's use, and in  parents also model ways to use technology through
keeping their children safe and  their own behavior. Yet there are certain "paradoxes"
their technology use effective,  that affect technology's application to the parent-child
parents also model ways to use   relationship (Hessel & Dworkin, 2018; Jarvenpaa &
technology through their own     Lang, 2005). For example, we see that generational
behavior.                        differences in exposure to technology, comfort and
                                 skill in use, and motivations for use can create a shift

                                 in a relationship's power dynamic. This may result in

friction between parent and child. This chapter will explore those possibilities and recommendations for

peaceful negotiation.

This chapter will also look at technology use as it positively facilitates and influences the quality of parent-
child relationship. Applications like FaceTime, texting, and social media are used to maintain communication
and feelings of connectedness between parent and child, and can promote feelings of cohesion. This can be
seen by the time college students spend texting or making video or voice calls to their parents while away
(Vaterlaus et al., 2019), and in the heavy use of videoconferencing between parents and children, and
grandparents and children, during COVID (Hamilton, et al, 2021). Indeed many parents and children are
312 | 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

quite positive about having mobile devices as a means for continued family contact. Media multiplexity
theory posits that when a "repertoire" of technologies are used, the relationship is closer (McCurdy et al.,
2022).

Yet relational use can also mean the nonverbal

communication that comes when a parent or child

ignores the other, distracted by technology. Sadly

this is an all too real scenario that can disrupt

quality in the relationship. Studies suggest that

parental distraction by technology can compromise

secure attachment and, consequently, child

development (Kildare & Middlemiss, 2019;

McDaniel, 2019). Parents can also overshare online,

much to the embarrassment of the child (Blum-        Montreux #8 by ClearFrost CC BY-SA 2.0
Ross & Livingstone, 2017). These elements of

technology and the parent-child relationship are explored in this chapter.

Finally, analysts of the existing literature identify both assets and challenges of current technology and the
ways in which they are used to facilitate the parent-child relationship (e.g., Shin et al., 2021). The chapter
closes with their observations and questions to move us forward in this important family topic.

Parenting Frameworks

To set the stage for a deeper understanding of the parent-child relationship dynamic, we'll explore two
parenting frameworks. One is a frequently used construct of the parent's style of communicating which offers
an emotional context for the relationship. The other is less well known, yet presents the balanced perspective
of both actors in the relationship and the balance required for connection.

Parenting style

Parenting style is frequently studied as the emotional context through which parents assert authority or invite
children's input while guiding children's behavior (Darling & Steinberg, 1993, 2017; Smetana, 2017).
Because of this, parenting style has been conceptually and empirically related to measurable elements of
childrearing, such as demonstration of support, relational depth, and parent-child conflict (Aloia & Warren,
2019), which in turn contribute to myriad child outcomes (Smetana, 2017).

Baumrind's (1971) parenting style construct uses demonstrations at the intersection of warmth and
                                                                 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS | 313

  demandingness as indication of authoritative (balanced), authoritarian (high demandingness, low warmth),
  permissive (low demandingness, high warmth), and neglectful (low demandingness, low warmth)
  childrearing. Contemporary perspectives on Baumrind's construct encourage adaptations through a cultural
  and contextual lens, and consideration of factors such as parenting beliefs that moderate demonstrations of
  style (Smetana, 2017). More domain-specific applications have been suggested which are sensitive to the
  interplay between parent's goals, child's needs, and parenting processes.1

                  Baumrind's parenting styles. https://pressbooks.nscc.ca/lumenlife/chapter/
                  emotional-and-social-development-in-early-childhood/

  Examples of parenting style and parental mediation have found, in general, that those who are more
  permissive (higher in warmth over control) are less likely to restrict children's screen time, while those who are
  more authoritarian are more likely to do so. In a 2009 study, Bumpass and Werner explored types of parental
  technology regulation. They studied 113 children in 3rd to 6th grades and 109 mothers, identifying four
  clusters based on rules, enforcement strategies, consequences, and child adjustment. Traditional mothers
  reported rules related to time, permission, and co-viewing. Technology-specific mothers used blocking
  software, filtering, and removal of privileges. Passive mothers voiced rules that required only minimal parental
  supervision, and they were more watchful of the child's interest. And the children of parents with few rules
  (e.g., neglectful) reported slightly higher levels of internalizing problems such as depression and anxiety, and
  demonstrated slightly lower levels of prosocial behavior.

1. The volume of research on parenting styles should motivate readers interested in this concept and in parent-child relationships and technology to
  seek out specific, current, and cross-cultural/cultural literature.
314 | 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

Wartella et al. (2013) found a parallel between parenting style and family media practices. Looking at families
with children between birth to 8 years, those in mediacentric households (reporting approximately 11 hours
or more per day) were more permissive than those who were media moderate or "media light." Children in
mediacentric homes are also more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms.

As demonstration of the complexity of applying the parenting style construct to the parent-child relationship
with technology, a study of 504 parent-teen (12-17 year old) pairs proposed a model linking parenting style,
online relational behaviors, and relational quality (Aloia & Warren, 2019). The researchers hypothesized that
parental behaviors such as sending comforting messages and sharing material would mediate (i.e., be a
conveyor for) parenting style and parent-child relationship quality including parent-child conflict and
relational depth. In fact, although they validated previous research linking parenting style to relationship
quality (e.g., enhanced parent-child conflict with authoritarian or permissive parenting), they found no
relationship between parenting style, online relational behaviors by the parents, and relationship quality.
Authoritarian parenting showed no relationship to any of the online strategies (comforting messages, material
sharing, planning behaviors), and authoritative parenting showed positive and significant relationships to all
three, yet permissive parenting also related significantly to two of the actions (comforting messages and
material sharing). Planning behaviors and positive messages online were positively related to parental comfort,
yet planning behaviors and material sharing were also related to perceived conflict. The authors observed
methodological limitations (e.g., data from self-report) as a cause for the unexpected result, but also suggested
that, with regard to mediated communication channels, parents and children may develop unique norms (p.
53). As Dworkin, et al. (2019) observe,

      "The insurgence of technology has completely changed the family landscape, challenging what we know and
      requiring a reassessment of how we understand family relationships during adolescence, a time when
      technology acquires new meaning for developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships. (p. 514)."

Agency and Communion

                                  dimensions of both coordinates. Conflict arises when

both are seeking agency (or power) more than communion. As related to parent-child relationships, conflicts

occur with both child noncompliance and resistance to parents requests (high agency/low communion) and

with parent resistance to children's requests (high agency/low communion) (Eisenberg, 1992).

               Agency and communion dimensions held by each actor in an interpersonal
               relationship (adapted from Wiggins, 1991).

For example, if my partner and I are deciding on a vacation location, and I want to go to the mountains and
they want to go to the beach, as we both assert our agency (power) in our desires, we compromise the value of
communion (joint happiness). We are at a standstill and our relationship suffers. If, however, through
discussion, we listen to each other about the interests of the other with a true value for the relationship and
316 | 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

we come to compromise, we are more balanced in our individual agency and communion. Within the parent-
child relationship, the parent's actions are tempered by understanding the developmental age and ability of
the child, and changes in that development over time (Heck & Pincus, 2001). Agency by the parent is, in part,
a personal expression of fulfilling the responsibilities of childrearing. The joint balance of agency and
communion between parent and child in negotiation and understanding is within this structure of safety and
growth.

The ecological context is a consideration for both parent-child relationship models when applied to new
media and digital technology. As observed in previous chapters, interactions and dynamics of the relationship
are influenced by ecological contexts of the microsystem of the family, and by exosystems, macrosystems, and
chronosystems. These systems create influences on the development of both the child and the parent, and on
the conditions in which the family lives. Technology access and use and qualities of the devices and
applications are external and inherent influences in each of the systems that can both facilitate and challenge
relational dynamics (Navarro & Tudge, 2022; Lanigan, 2009).

Parental Mediation and the Parent-Child
Relationship

                                             Fully 98% of parents in a recent U.S. study believe it is the

                                             parent's responsibility to protect children from online

                                             content (Auxier et al., 2020), compared to 65% expecting

                                             the government or technology (78%) companies to bear

                                             responsibility. While most parents (71%) are aware of and

                                             concerned about the amount of time children 11 and

                                             younger are spending with screens (Auxier et al., 2020),

                                             more (84%) report feeling confident that they know how

                                             much screen time is too much. Most (71%) believe that

                                             sexually explicit content (60%), and violent content

(59%). While bullying is a general concern of many parents, the majority (96% of parents of children 5-11)

report that their child has not been bullied online (Auxier et al., 2020).

As parents assert their responsibilities to keep children safe online and guide their development, potential
areas of conflict include:
                                                               7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS | 317

 1. Parental attempts to regulate use.
 2. Parental concern over potentially negative consequences of internet use that can lead to over-restrictions

      on use.
 3. An imbalance of power as expertise in technology use varies between parent and child.
 4. Counter modeling of technology by parents' own use (e.g., do as I say, not as I do)
 5. Parent invasion of children's online social space.

The majority of families don't perceive significant conflict around technology. Parents of young children
(birth to age 8) don't perceive regulating children's technology use to be a conflict (Wartella et al., 2013). Even
parents of older children (8 to 18 years) don't report significant struggles. In a 2016 Commonsense Media
report, nearly two-thirds of parents (62%) disagreed that getting a child to turn off their smartphone or tablet
was a struggle. The majority (85%) agreed that monitoring child safety was important, and nearly the same
amount (81%) disagreed that the child was less likely to communicate face-to-face. That said, parents of boys
and of those children with lower grades did report greater struggle. Similarly, a 2018 report of families in the
European Union also determined that most do not report conflict on technology use (Livingstone et al.,
2015).

In large part, there is optimism that the lack of conflict observed in families is the result of technology
oversight integrated into parenting practices and the parent-child relationship. Technology and adolescence
researcher Candice Ogders (2018) observes,

      Because online problems can be largely predicted by young people's vulnerabilities offline, much of our existing
      knowledge about what promotes healthy child development is applicable even in what seems like a foreign
      digital landscape. Strategies such as the maintenance of supportive parent-child relationships that encourage
      disclosure, parental involvement in the activities of their children, and the avoidance of overly restrictive or
      coercive monitoring will help to support adolescents and keep them safe online, just as they do offline.

In the next section we explore types of mediation practices in families, and the potential for conflict, and the
opportunities for parent-child communication.
318 | 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

Mediation practices

Mediation practices vary by type and family (Rudi &

Dworkin, 2018). Frequently, mediation practices are

labeled as active or "enabling" (of positive technology

use) or restrictive. A recent qualitative study with 40

parents of Australian teens (Page, 2021) identified five

mediation strategies, three of which were active: physical

observation, digital surveillance, and trust-based and

discursive strategies; one restrictive: restriction and

control through social or technical means; and one (as

alluded to in Chapter 6), indirect: talking with other

parents. Parents' active mediation occurs through direct    "Apple TV Parental Controls" by Wesley Fryer is

media's effects. Co-viewing or co-participation (such as

playing games) enables parents to actively mediate and monitor children's exposure and scaffold healthy use.

good behavior.                                            effects (Coyne et al., 2017).

                                                               The EU Kids Online report (2020) surveyed children
age 9-16 years in 19 countries. An average of 33% said their parents actively talk to them about the internet,
30% said sometimes, and 37% said never. Across countries, on average, higher percentages of children at
younger ages reported parent discussion about the internet "at least sometimes:" 67% of 9-11 year olds, 61%
of 12-14 year olds, and 54% of those 16 and older. When asked about active mediation strategies by parents,
friends, and teachers, the highest percentages were reported for parents (e.g., 64% reported that parents "help
me when something bothers me on the internet," compared with 45% friends and 35% teachers). Internet
safety is a common topic of mediation, with 85% of EU children reporting that their parents talk about this.
More technical controls are far less frequently reported (22%, on average, report parental control through
GPS monitoring, use of software that blocks or filters internet content, or tracking applications) . Also, a
minority of children -- about 15% -- reported restrictions on using a web camera, downloading music, or
                                                               7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS | 319

using social media. That said, there are very clear differences in social media use restrictions by age, with the
majority of children age 9-11 indicating that they cannot use social media.

The resolution of "conflict" with mediation is more nuanced than might be believed. Recent research with
Australian families of teens revealed the range of ways that parents negotiating technology use with their
teenagers (Page, 2021). Traditional mediation strategies may be used, but when they are not successful parents
turn to other strategies, such as trust-based and discursive (reasoned negotiation) ones. Similarly, in interview
research with pre-teen and teenage children (n=23) and their parents (n=18, Blackwell et al., 2016), children
expressed the desire for shared expectations, rather than more attention to the issue of technology. They
claimed that parents primarily told them what not to do, and didn't have a very accurate perception of either
the quantity or quality of their screen time, or its effects on them. The interviews unlocked a more complex
dynamic than of parents establishing rules and children breaking them. They identified a give-and-take in
negotiating family life, in which children's needs and desires for technology use are taken into consideration,
and reflect nuance -- for example, when "rule violation" is acceptable. The authors concluded that families
respect the developing teen's need for privacy and independence, while maintaining consistent and realistic
expectations around work, attention, and the interests of the whole family to better manage household
technology use.

Influences on parental mediation

Age of child

Parental restrictions on children's technology use largely curve with the child's age -- with monitoring
occurring through co-use in early childhood and middle childhood, then tapering off through adolescence.

                                                   with games (Connell et al., 2015). As an indication

use media to soothe babies who are fussy and demonstrate poor self-regulation. Mediation with school age
children can be restrictive (limiting use of hardware or software, including taking away technology as a
punishment), monitoring (tracking use, messages, and the child's location), and active (talking to children
about their technology use) (Auxier et al., 2020; Blum-Ross et al., 2018; Livingstone et al., 2015).

Parents' conversations with their children about the content of their media also varies by child age. In
Commonsense Media's 2016 study of parents and their teens and "tweens," parents were more likely to talk
with their 12-14 year olds about media content while watching television, viewing apps on a device, using a
computer for something other than homework, and playing videogames than with their teenagers; only when
it came to social media did parents report higher frequencies of discussing content with children. Coyne et al.
(2017) observe that research has yet to determine the interplay between parents' mediation strategies and
more specific child characteristics.

Family demographic differences

influence mediation. Parents who are higher in income

and educational attainment and who demonstrate more          Consider how factors such as income

their children (Livingstone et al., 2018). Similarly,

Wartella et al.'s (2013) observation of permissive

parenting style and mediacentrism, noted earlier, also showed demographic correlations. Parents who were

lower-income and single reported greater consumption of media in the household than those with other

demographic characteristics. Media was reported as a favorite family activity, and mothers were more likely to

report using it as a parenting tool (e.g., keeping a child occupied and safe while she attended to other duties).

It should be noted, however, that in a U.S. sample Connell et al. (2015) found scant relationships to co-

viewing with young children by parent education level or race. Parents in the EU with more education and

income used a diversity of mediation strategies and encouraged non-school media use for learning. Cross
national variation in parent mediation strategies has been found among the Finnish (actively engaged), Czech
(passive), and in EU and UK countries and Russia (restrictive) (Helsper et al., 2013).

Mothers are more likely to demonstrate mediation than fathers (Connell et al., 2015; CSM, 2016). In their
research among Portuguese school-age children, Ferreira et al. (2017) identified not only parent gender
differences in mediation by type of activity (e.g., fathers actively mediating children's use while playing
videogames), but gendered perspectives by children of parents' technology mediation. Children perceived
fathers as more skilled in using technology, reported that their technology was for work (vs. mothers' devices
that were to be shared), and that the father's mediation was more technical (e.g., uploading, removing
software) and mother's more digital (e.g., exposure to content quality).

Parents' technology use, comfort, and skill

Parents' mediation strategies appear to relate to their attitudes toward technology, their competencies, and

their own use, as observed in research in EU countries (Brito et al., 2017; Livingstone et al., 2018) and

research in the US (e.g., Commonsense Media, 2016; Wartella et al., 2013). Observing the construct of

reasoned action applied to technology acceptance (Ajzen, 1985), Nikken and Opree's (2018) survey of

parents of young children (ages 1-9) in the Netherlands identified basic proficiency associated with the ease

of active co-use. Advanced and basic proficiency with technology related to restrictive mediation, and

advanced proficiency related to imposing technical restrictions. As Naab (2018) observed from in depth

interviews with 29 parents of young children, parents are often uncertain about digital strategies and gain

proficiency over time through interaction with their child, acquisition of knowledge about technology's

affordances and challenges, and their own comfort with the interplay between themselves and their child's

                                   needs.

ways far different than those of their parents, and a     Children are challenged when their

skill with technology than their parents (Livingstone et  https://youtu.be/A6A331B1oq8

al., 2018), or when children need to assist parents with

language translation and technology. Perhaps this is why

teens don't turn to parents for safety issues related to

technology (Blum-Ross et al., 2018; Commonsense Media, 2018), or for information on sexual health. Flores

and Barroso (2018) identified SES differences in parental technology comfort and use and the ability to talk to

their teenagers about sex. Limited knowledge of how technology works, including realities of peer

communication, privacy issues and laws, and the potential for exposure to imagery, act as barriers to parental

communication that supports the child's sexual health.

Various scholars have characterized this complicated parent-child power dynamic (Dworkin et al., 2019).

differential in knowledge can upset the traditional

family hierarchy. In interviews with parent-teen pairs

in 1995, Kiesler et al. (2000) determined that fathers' attitudes prevented them from seeking help from their

children about internet-related issues; the fathers voiced concern about a shift in their parental authority.

and Van den Bulck (2017) predicted that reports of

often do you teach them to use the following media, technologies, and/or applications?" Again, a 5-point

Likert scale was used and applied to 13 technologiesm including smartphones, online purchases, and tablets.

After controlling for demographic variables (including parent and child gender and age), there were

significant associations between a parent help seeking/guidance by children and parent-child conflict. The

authors observed that child guidance was dominant on some technologies -- smartphones and specific apps

-- but not all.

An example of context as influence on parental mediation: The
COVID-19 pandemic

When conditions encourage children's technology use, parental mediation can shift. Clearly, the COVID-19
pandemic was an influence. As their children connected with friends, attended school, and sought out
hobbies online during isolation and quarantine, parents' efforts to mediate children's screen time changed. As
a report by Pew (2021) indicates, fewer parents reduced children's time on screens and took away children's
smartphone privileges. On the other hand, more parents were active in checking children's exposure online,
and parents' beliefs that their children spent too much time online nearly doubled. Among parents of
children 11 or younger, in 2020, 28% felt their children spent too much time on their phones. In 2021, that
percentage climbed to 42%. (See figure below).

With regard to older children, parents reported that, during COVID, connections through
videoconferencing, and with resident children through gaming and time spent together, deepened personal
relationships (Joyce et al., 2021).

Technology's Role in Parent-Child Communication

The primary reason that parents secure phones for their children, even before age 12, is to communicate with
them (Auxier et al., 2020). Through texting and through voice and video calls, parents can convey
information to children that supports their development, enable coordination, and promote closeness. The
efficiency of using ICT for communication also makes co-parenting relationships easier, such in the case of
divorced and separated parents (Ganong et al., 2012; Saini & Pollack, 2018), and maintains parent-child
                                                              7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS | 325

connections during separations, including military deployment (Carter & Renshaw, 2016) and immigration
(Casmiro & Nico, 2016; Karraker, 2015).

Shin et al.'s (2021) literature review on technology designs that foster the parent-child
relationship identified factors indicative of family qualities and technology-specific conditions.
They include:

      reciprocity in the family,
      reinforcement of transparency,
      affection and trust,
      physical proxy of each other through an object or interface design,
      accessibility, level of technology sophistication and communication resource, and
      enjoyable, age-appropriate shared content between parents and children, and situational

        awareness and routine.

                                           design that favors media richness (closer

                                           approximation of real life) and synchronicity, and

                                           of the chapter indicates, the use of technology as a

means to facilitate parent-child relationships is quite a complex issue. Although there are elements specific to

digital media and the programming of the for communication and interaction, challenges arise through

human factors inherent in the individuals and their relationships.

Connections, for example, may not always be smooth, and whether due to technology or the actor,
complications can arise. Use of technology to maintain the parent-child relationship may lead to what
Parrenas and Boris (2010, as cited by Karraker, 2015 p. 13) refer to as the "antithesis of intimacy."

during COVID-19 for those facing separation due to

welfare issues, technological and human barriers

prevented this alternative to in-person visits from being successful (Goldberg et al., 2021).

Shin et al. (2021) observe developmental differences reflected in the availability of technology and use by
parents and children that affect satisfaction. For young children, technology that is playful, age-appropriate,
and encourages creativity can foster engagement by both parent and child. School-age children and their
parents have a strong desire to be together, learn more about each other, and feel a sense of warmth and
security. Yet designs may not be user- or communication-friendly, and differences in ability and access can
create barriers to effective use. For older children (e.g., adolescents), when parents and teens have access to
phones and social media, and when a common time for interaction is apparent, communication appears
effective. Yet as Dworkin et al. (2019) observe, the paradox of connecting and distancing can make parents'
use of social networking and unscheduled calls feel intrusive and like a privacy invasio.

Assets and challenges are apparent for specific populations of parents and children as well. Parents and
children attempting to maintain communication through technology across legal separations face particular
scrutiny with regard to child privacy and safety (Saini & Pollack, 2018). In a survey with 106 family
caseworkers, Saini and Pollack (2018) identified that the majority of legally separated parents and children use
technology to maintain communication. This can be quite positive, as they can each keep abreast of the life
details of the other and maintain connectedness, particularly when a child is long-distance and living in the
other parent's home or in a foster home. Caseworkers also saw it as a way to protect the child from conflict in
the parent-to-parent relationship, and enhance the child's feeling of safety. Yet rampant posting on social
media diminishes the child's safety, as well as the privacy of the parent who may closely monitor and track the
child. As with other cases representing the range of technologies' uses and affordances, the picture is a
complex one. Because of this, the caseworkers in Saini and Pollack's study advocates for ICT not as a
replacement for parent-child connections, but as a way to enhance communication.

Possible disruption in the relationship: Parents' own
technology use

As noted above, parents' own technology use is a

significant factor in their attitudes about monitoring and

mediating children's use, and in shaping and modeling

children's technology consumption. Samual's (2017)

counter response to the argument that smartphones were

destroying a generation (Twenge, 2017) was that

smartphones distracted parents, leading them to

demonstrate "minimal parenting." McDaniel's (2019)

and Kildare and Middlemiss' (2017) reviews of the

literature concerning parents' use of technology when       "Communication" by SPIngram is licensed under
with their children paint a third picture of                CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.

communication in the relationship: that of nonverbal

messaging through distracted use. Noting that the majority of research in this area has focused on parents of

young children, McDaniel observes the many reasons parents would use their phones with a child present.

Not only do they seek information and communicate with others, seek emotional support, or continue work,

but their use attempts to relieve the boredom of childrearing. This "technoference" (McDaniel's term for the

"everyday intrusions and interruptions of devices in our face-to-face interactions") can have potentially

serious consequences to the child through the parents' ability to connect and engage and through the child's

own observation of the parent's distracted action, and can negatively impact the parent's own emotional state.

Parenting outcomes of being distracted by one's phone include reduced verbal and nonverbal interactions

with the child, reduced awareness and sensitivity to the child's needs and responses, and reduced coordination

and communication in co-parenting. McDaniel, and Kildare and Middlemiss, note that these responses are

directly associated with the relational mechanisms in attachment formation, although longitudinal research

to date hasn't validated these assumptions.

Additional parenting consequences of being distracted by technology include the difficulty of multitasking
between the device and the needs and attention of the child, and time displacement (e.g., focusing on a phone
compared to active time with a child). From the child's perspective, they may express dissatisfaction in the
time spent with the parent and in turn, feel ignored. Kildare and Middlemiss cite a study in which 32% (of
6,000) children reported feeling unimportant when their parents were distracted by a phone. As the authors
of both review articles observe, more research is needed to more definitively understand specific dimensions
of parental technology use with children (e.g., how much time is spent on phones when with children,
specific activities parents do while on their phones) and impacts on parenting, the relationship, and child
development. They also observe that it's not reasonable to expect parents not to engage with technology
328 | 7.1 TECHNOLOGY'S INFLUENCE ON PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

when with their children, observing the complex reasons that parents use technology. They advocate for
education on appropriate use, and engagement in ways that are healthy for the relationship and for the child.
This resource from Zero to Three offers parents ways to focus on their children, not their phones.

"Sharenting"

As discussed in Chapter 6, parents express their caregiver and relational identities online through blogging,
posting on social media, and texting ideas and images of the children to others (Blum-Ross & Livingstone,
2017). A challenge can occur in the parent-child relationship when children object to their images and
information about themselves being shared, particularly without permission (Saner (2018) refers to this as a
"permanent digital tattoo"). While not as overt an expression of distraction by technology use as those
discussed above, "sharenting" can still send a message to the child that their feelings are not being considered.
Blum-Ross and Livingstone (2017) determined that when parents of younger children share images and
experiences of their child and childrearing, they may also have misgivings about the archival nature of the
internet and the possibility of their posts resurfacing when the child is older. Parents also express a certain
element of guilt, part of the complex feelings parents describe, as discovered in Shin et al. (2022)'s review of
the literature of parent-child relationships through technological innovation. Parents hold an awareness of the
child's aging to the point of awareness and expressing feelings of dissatisfaction with their private information
being shared. Blum-Ross and Livingstone share this incident, which directly points to the potential conflict
with "sharenting" and the need for parent-child communication to maintain communion:

      Harvey confronted this issue when his 6-year-old son Archie began to express discomfort at appearing on the
      blog. Harvey described how Archie had begun to ask what the photos Harvey took were for, questioning "is

this a photo for you, Daddy, or is it a photo for the blog"' Increasingly Archie would refuse to be in pictures,
eventually exacting revenge by covertly using Harvey's phone to post an unflattering picture of Harvey eating a
sandwich on his dad's Instagram feed. Harvey was working with Archie to help Archie decide what "he wants
me to write" so he could be more in control. Yet, finding himself cajoling his son, Harvey described a struggle
between respecting his son's boundaries and keeping his commitment to the blog and his readership among the
wider blogging community. (Blum-Ross & Livingstone, 2017, p. 116).

Focus on technology-facilitated parent-child relationships
in young adulthood

A significant amount of research has examined the role of technology in the parent-child relationship during
young adulthood. One conclusion is that the availability and use of ICT is a positive influence on this
relationship. A review by Hessel and Dworkin (2018) identified differences in how young adults use
technology to communicate with parents, compared with siblings and grandparents. The authors indicated
that when children go to college (given that college students are an often sampled group in this research area),
there may be a stronger focus on the relationship, and technology has an intentional purpose. While they
indicate that the research on persons other than parents is limited, young adults appear to use a variety of
methods to maintain relationships with parents through technology, including adding parents as "friend"' on
social media, texting, and sending email (though the Hessel and Dworkin review and McCurdy et al.'s 2022
research with college students validates that email use has declined). Purposes include utility (sharing, asking
for help), immediacy, and emotional connections. Relationship quality appears to be positive, as
demonstrated by emerging adults' reports of satisfaction, feelings of intimacy, and the number of types of
media used for communication.

As an example, Vaterlaus et al. (2019), surveyed 766 young adults and adolescents (just over 10% of the

sample) and their parents on their use of technology

interactions. And young adults' reports of using computer-mediated communication with parents
(particularly text messaging when it came to both mothers and fathers) were significantly associated with
feelings of closeness, togetherness, and connection in their time spent with the parent. The authors observe
the role that technology can play in maintaining quality relationships between parents and teens, and
acknowledge the challenges brought about through an individual being distracted by media when in the
presence of the other. They recommend additional research and educational efforts on the benefits of using
technology together in ways that foster and facilitate relationships.

Yet Hessel and Dworkin indicate that a dominant theme in the literature indicates potential challenges with
autonomy, or rather the lack thereof. Frequency of contact with parents and parental over-involvement
related to lower feelings of autonomy, whereas those with a strong parent-child relationship reported higher
levels of autonomy. They also observe that, as noted in Chapter 5, there are differences by generational cohort,
as research with college students just two years apart indicates differences in email and social networking
behavior with parents.

                                                 McCurdy et al. (2022) also point to differences in

                                                 communication behavior and perceived young adult/

                                                 students, those who used a rich communication

                                                 authors identified that students perceived stronger

maintain boundaries. Knowing what skills their parents had, and which applications they did and didn't use,

worked to their advantage as ways to find necessary separation for their individuation. From Miller-Ott et al.'s

(2014) research, frequent texting, establishing rules around availability, repetitive contact, and relational

arguments were more direct strategies for healthy individuation with connectedness.

Research also suggests new opportunities for connecting with parents: gaming, social media, video creation,
even family genealogy applications. Given the range of potential technologies for interaction and differentials
in access and use together, Hessel and Dworkin (2018, p. 369) wisely observe,

Rather than building research around specific technology, such as Facebook, categorizing technology options
by context will produce findings that are more transferable and durable. Using theoretical foundations such as

Media Richness Theory may help to identify which technology choices complement which types of
communication between which family members for what purpose.

Conclusion

This chapter reveals complexities in the notion of the parent-child relationship and technology. Most families

don't perceive conflict, though when the focus of research, perception may be skewed depending on who is

being interviewed. Positively, many children and parents manage negotiations around children's healthy

technology use, and parents practice active or other types of mediation that encourage children's positive use.

There isn't a need for practices that are restrictive or

punitive. Active mediation strategies align with a life-  many children and parents

within these is the generational difference in parents'

own knowledge and use of technology. When children grow up knowing more, and "reverse mediation"

occurs, the power dynamic can shift. In some homes, this can be sensitive. The dynamic shifts as well when

parents' technology use leads to their being distracted from their children. This sends a strong non-verbal

message about the importance of the relationship, and can have damaging effects on parenting, on the

relationship, and consequently on child development. As technology continues to evolve, and as generations

of children and parents change in their knowledge, skills, comfort, and expectations about using technology

individually and with each other, the clear message for both parents and children is one of intentionality.

children, are interconnected, and how families transmit their assets and disadvantages to the next generation.

[p.441:22]

For parents, technology visionary and parent danah boyd suggests approaching technology with an attitude of
flexibility (Tippet, 2017):

From my perspective, it's about stepping back and not assuming that just the technology is transformative, and
saying, okay, what are we trying to achieve here? What does balance look like? What does happiness look like?
What does success look like? What are these core tenets or values that we're aiming for, and how do we achieve
them holistically across our lives? And certainly, when parents are navigating this, I think one of the difficulties
is to recognize that this is what your values are, and they may be different from your child's values. And so how
do you learn to sit and have a conversation of "Here's what I want for you. What do you want? And how do we
balance that?" And that's that negotiation that's really hard. And so I think about it in terms of all of us -- how
do you find your own sense of grounding?

7.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Reflecting on the parent-child relationship and technology

     Recall when you began to be active with technology -- when you got your first smartphone,
     perhaps, when you became active on social media, when your homework and school projects
     began taking up more time online, and/or when you started using technology for entertainment,
     perhaps playing videogames and/or streaming media. Now reflect on your parents' reaction to your
     use (and possibly that of your siblings). Consider Wiggin's intersection of agency and communion
     for two people in a relationship. Identify a key discussion or negotiation you had around your
     technology use. Where would you place yourself? Your parent?

     The many influences on parental mediation

     Interview one or both of your parents (or the people in your life who actively parented you during
     middle school and high school). Create a list of questions about the ways in which they mediated
     your technology use. Were they active and engaged? Were they restrictive? Were they permissive?
     Talk to your parents about why they mediated technology in your household the way they did. Ask
     them about their memories of those years and their interactions with you. What influenced their
     actions? Do they have any regrets? Do they feel successful? If they were to make three
     recommendations to parents of 10-14 year olds about parental involvement in children's technology
     use and maintaining a positive relationship, what would they be?

Fathers take to the internet ("sharenting")

In these two videos, fathers take to the internet asserting their roles as parents. In one case, the
father (Tommy) is addressing his daughter's behavior publicly; in the other, the father (Brad) is
advocating on behalf of his daughter. Both videos, when posted, went viral.
Tommy:

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/technologyfamily/?p=422#oembed-1

      Brad:

                              view them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/technologyfamily/?p=422#oembed-2

View both and answer the questions below. These questions help identify the father's motivations
for using the virtual world as a sounding board for his frustrations, the possible consequences or
benefits of his actions, and the potential impacts on the father-daughter relationship. Provide
recommendations on how to handle the situation the fathers faced to provide a (more) peaceful/
positive resolution that maintains the relationship and respects the roles of both the fathers and
the daughters.

    1. What is the father concerned about? What is the father's motivation for taking his concern
        to the Internet?

   2. What does the father hope to accomplish? How is it related to his role as a parent? Does the
        father demonstrate a balance/imbalance of warmth and demandingness? What do you see
        in his demonstration of agency vs. communion?

   3. What would the father's action do to impact his daughter's well-being? Why? (How would
340 | 7.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

             his daughter feel when she learned about this video)?
         4. How (if at all) do you see the father's response as reflecting the daughter's age

             (approximately 12-14 years)?
         5. What would the father's action do to impact the father-daughter relationship? Why?
         6. Would you recommend that the father take a different tact? If so, what? If not, why is this

             the appropriate response?

     Considering questions for technology design to promote parent-child relationships

     At the conclusion of Shin et al.'s (2021, 441:25) review of the literature on technology and parent-
     child relationships, they pose a variety of questions for future research. Consider each or one of
     these questions alone or with another person or in a small group. You might want to pose these
     questions to your friends and family, particularly your parent(s), and get their take on future design
     considerations.

         1. How can technology empower children to initiate conversation and interaction with parents
             in families living together? If technology is designed with novel accessible functions and
             forms that can empower children to initiate interactions with their parents, can these
             functions help children's perception of family belonging?

         2. How can technology create communication topics (triggers) through shared activities?
         3. How can technology effectively support households with children who have a wider age gap

             (e.g., 3 and 12 years old)?
         4. How can technology support a parent-child dyad's different expectations and needs in

             communicating with each other? Is synchronous communication always suitable for the
             target dyad? Younger children tend to be more engaged with their parents, while adolescent
             and older children take their privacy and me-time more seriously.
         5. What are the other family members' preferences about privacy? While the target dyad might
             feel favorable toward, for instance, always-on technologies, this may be uncomfortable for
             others who are not close enough to share details of their lives.
         6. How can technology support the constantly changing relationship between parents and
                                                                                                                     7.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 341

        children throughout developmental stages and life courses? Designs that support a
        relationship should also be able to dynamically change when the relationship does.
    7. How can technologies support parent-child interactions, instead of serving as a replacement
        for them?

Parent learning about mediating children's technology use (in ways that promote the
parent-child relationship)

There are many guides for parents about protecting their children online. Identify hypothetical
children in a hypothetical family and identify some online resources. Keep an eye to both the
development of the child (what are they using, technology-wise? What do they understand, rule-
wise?) and the context and culture of the family that might influence the ways in which the parent
attempts to mediate the child's use. Compare sources of advice. Which would you find most helpful
and recommend to parents?
342 | 7.4 BLOG PROMPTS

7.4 BLOG PROMPTS

     Read the article: "Yes, Smartphones are destroying a generation, but not of kids." Reflect on
     information in the chapter about parents' use of technology, and on our discussion of the Millennial
     generation of parent users who may unconsciously be swept up with unintentional over-use or, to
     the contrary, a heightened awareness of technology's seductive powers. Do you agree with this
     perspective on our attention to parents as technology users?

     Select one of the two videos highlighted in the Learning Activities for this chapter. Relate the
     father's actions in that video to what was discussed in the chapter about parenting and parent-
     child relationships. Do you believe that the father's actions were right? Wrong? Why? Why not?
     How might you respond were you the same parent in the same situation?

     Technology can introduce a shift in the balance of power in parent-child relationships. A teenager
     may be more familiar with how to use apps and devices than his or her parent. This can lead to the
     teen feeling they have the upper hand and the ability to work around whatever rules the parent
     has set forward. And it can lead to the parent responding to the unfamiliar power shift with
     underconfidence or an over-assertion of authority (e.g., making tougher restrictions elsewhere).
     What are your thoughts about this possible power shift in families due to comfort differences with
     technology? Is this something you or others you know have experienced? How might you aid a
     family who is facing this dilemma?

     In this Wired magazine article, Jaclyn Greenberg writes about feeling more connected to her
     adolescent daughter when they learned a language together via an app. After reading the article,
                                                                                                                             7.4 BLOG PROMPTS | 343

provide a reflection on her experiences from your own perspective. How might this have felt for
the teenager? What are your own experiences in sharing a technology with a parent? Perhaps an
app like Duolingo or a game that involves the two of you in the same goal? How might it
strengthen the parent-child relationship? Are there elements of the experience that might play out
Wiggins' agency and communion dynamic for both members?

   Chapter Insights

           Many ICTs (applications such as WhatsApp, FaceTime, Zoom, Email, texting, messaging, and
             Instagram) play a role in family communication and feelings of connectedness. Yet there may
             be challenges these applications introduce to effective family communication.

           Early research on family communication and technology revealed the value of interactive
             technologies and feelings of connectedness. Still there are differences in effectiveness
             depending on family membership.

           Videogames offer a number of benefits and challenge to family connectedness.
           The concept of connected learning values relationships when the individual explores

             interests using technology. Parents can function as "learning hero" and facilitate children's
             learning beyond the classroom.
           Families can create technology together. An example offered in the chapter is that of a father
             and his two children who do an almost-weekly podcast. Consider ways that engaging with
             children around technology creation can strengthen family closeness/cohesion and
             demonstrate flexibility. Such an activity can also contribute to individual family members'
             development.
           Key to family joint technology use is the set of rules families establish together about when
             and how technology is used. These rules include when family members are together, in the
350 | 8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY

             household. Consider the values and norms that families create for day-to-day functioning
             and the well-being of their members. ICT use is an extension of those values. Members' use
             can also be a disruption of those values in ways that call for conflict resolution.
           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Introduction

We've previously discussed technology use within the

family and across families. In this chapter, we examine

more specific ways in which families use technology as

families. We'll look, for example, at the role that

technologies like FaceTime and Zoom play in family

communication and feelings of cohesiveness, for example,

and at how specific technologies like videogames and

streaming media content are used for joint entertainment

through co-viewing and interactive participation,

contributing to feelings of cohesiveness and familiarity,

and encouraging shared interests. Participation with       "Family video time" by iceplee is licensed under

parenting as well, and impacts children's development.

And during COVID, communication, interactive, and creative technologies meant ways for families to stay

together, play together, cope with the strain of isolation, and find deeper means for satisfaction.

As a quick review, we looked at the family as a system open to external and internal forces. As the whole of the
system is dependent on the interactivity and full functioning of all family members, technology was viewed as
an influence external to the family, on individuals and subsystems in the family (e.g., a parent and child), and
on all family members jointly. The family structure includes an understanding of the roles played by
individuals within it.

We also examined how differences in technology use within the family illustrate the flexibility needed to
embrace members' own preferences and needs. Whole family differences helped convey how family units are
subject to wider ecological system resource availability and constraints that can affect technology and internet
                                                     8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY | 351

access, values for use, norms and behaviors, and achievements. Limited access can also affect the voice and
presence families have in social and political discourse.

Technology use by families and family members is measured by practical indicators, including:

   Device ownership (which, how many, which model, how many different).
   How devices are used and for what purposes.
   Device or application frequency (e.g., minutes per day, hours per day, days, interaction events).
   Whether device use is individual or shared.
   Whether device or application behavior is problematic -- e.g., addiction, being a tech luddite.
   How members use tech by device, application, function, and their attitudes and skill differences.

      Variations by member use; factors such as age, employment, and attitudes that influence these variations.

These dimensions are important to keep in mind as we explore use by families as a whole, or by subsystems
within the immediate and extended family, along with family-level outcomes.

                                                    that family members give to their interactions, and
                                                    creates shared realities. In turn, these shared realities
                                                    deepen the sense of family norms, values, and feelings of

                                                    perception of technology -- media can thus be beneficial
                                                    in strengthening the bonds that create the sense of family.

Early research by Padilla-Walker et al. (2012) examined types of technologies used by families (specifically
parents and their adolescent children) and those more strongly related to families' feelings of connectedness.
As previously discussed, connectedness is a warm, loving, positive relationship between parents and child/
family members. Connectedness was measured using the five items of the warmth/support subscale of the
Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire-Short Version (PSDQ; Robinson et al., 2001; e.g., ``I have
warm and loving times together with my child/my parent.'' Each item was measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
352 | 8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY

Cell phones, videogames, and co-viewing media showed the most significant and positive relationship to
family connectedness. Email and social networking did not indicate strength related to the outcome variable.
The authors determined differences by family characteristics: parents with a higher level of education reported
more connectedness related to technology use.

The authors posited that co-viewing of media indicated shared interests and fostered shared communication,

mentioned in the previous chapter, children and parents interacting together with media, and children

Email and social media. In the Padilla-Walker et al. study (2012), email and social networking were not
related to connectedness. Email offers asynchronous communication, which may seem less personal, and
more like communication that just carries news and information, particularly as more immediate methods of
texting and private messaging are available. In the author's own collaborative research with over 1,500 families
around the same time (2011), we determined that type of technology varied by family member. Email and
social networking are particularly popular with extended family, while texting -- a more intimate form of
communication -- was more likely to be used with one's children and the other parent (Rudi et al., 2014).
Since the time the study was conducted, there has been little substantive change in how email is used or
perceived among family members.

Social media, in contrast, has greatly expanded in terms of perception, use, and variety of applications. The
2012 research by Padilla-Walker et al. reported minimal interaction between parents and teens on social
media, citing limitations in personal expression (e.g., Twitter's 140 character limit) and the perception that
using social media was only between friends. More recent research, however, indicates that aspects of social
media can strengthen family connectedness. A 2022 review of the literature by Tariq et al. identified 14
articles on social media use and family relationships/family connectedness. As with the Padilla-Walker et al.
(2012) study, the majority of articles focus on parents and adolescent use. Connectedness is related in part to
the dynamics of the parent-child relationship; adolescents or young adults, for example, may feel their privacy

is at stake when parents "friend" them on social media. Stronger outcomes related to connectedness were
determined in studies that focused beyond parents, and on integrated connections with siblings and extended
family (e.g., feeling closer by having another outlet for sharing information). Yet the authors note that the
literature is sorely limited, with the majority of focus on teenagers and young adults rather than whole
families, and observe that questions rarely address the motivations for family members' joining social media or
how social media use relates to connectedness.

Also limited in the research is the range of types of social media applications, with a strong preference given
for Facebook. Tariq et al. (2012) observe a study (Nouwens et al., 2017) that highlights adults' variation of
application use depending on the contacts and users in that application. In other words, parents use of a
platform like Instagram or TikTok would depend on whether their child uses it, or they know other people
on it.

Even earlier research by Stern and Messer (2009) looked      Currently, the literature is limited in

                          more complete (or "media rich") than voice- or text-only

                          communication. As Lebow (2020) observes, social science research

                          will, over time, unveil the values and costs of depending on

permission by the family  videoconferencing for family communication during COVID, as
                          families experienced significant loss, strain, and attempts to maintain

family rituals and celebrations. Other variables on family functioning during COVID related to reliance on

virtual technologies for communication, include accommodating disparities in technology access and skill,

and the systemic impacts of supporting family members who face the additional strain of factors related to

mental or behavioral health (e.g., access to AA meetings).

Family Variation in Communication and
Connectedness via Technology

Karraker (2015) identifies how the use of technology for communication can help families "transcend spatial
limitations and provide for identity and cultural renewal" (p. 60). Families who may depend on technology to
maintain relational communication and the flow of information include transnational families, divorced/
noncustodial families seeking connection and coordination, military families during deployment, and
commuter parents. Forging social connectedness in new locations can be a critical lifeline for migrating
families (Farbenblum, et al, 2018; McAuliffe, 2021).

This video depicts a military family whose members rely on videoconferencing technology to stay in touch.
The father is deployed, and his wife and school-age children connect to share each other's days. The clip
promotes a positive association with the family staying in touch during deployment. Similarly, we can
consider connections with extended family -- particularly grandparents -- through videoconferencing and
other communication forms such as email, social media, and collaborative tools. During COVID-19,
especially, families relied on virtual visits when members couldn't travel and/or were in quarantine (Rose et
                                                    8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY | 355

al., 2021). Some families found improved communication and connectivity with young adults; others held
nightly family dinner times virtually so all family members could stay connected (Joyce & McCarthy, 2021).
Voida and Greenberg (2012) suggest that playing videogames across generations improves the opportunities
for the sharing of activities and experiences, thus improving family relationships.

Yet consider some of the possible consequences or downsides of relying on technology for continued
communication. When we experience the lack of physical touch, smell, and sound, Karraker (2015) asks, how
much is it really like being there? Over time, does it become easier to meet virtually, eventually bringing about
disruption? She notes, "While technology can enable families to reduce the strain spatial distance places on
intimacy, technology may also be the `antithesis of intimacy' (Parrenas & Boris, 2010, p. 13). Most likely, as
with every social change confronted by the family, technology will sometimes enhance long-distance intimacy
for global families and will sometimes diminish it, while certainly changing the dynamics of global families in
a digital age." (Karraker, 2015, p. 69).

Videogames and Co-viewing Media

Playing videogames as a family or a family subset, such as  During COVID-19, did you use

Engaged Family Gaming is a site promoting the benefits
of gaming together and providing resources for parents.

An annual report by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA, 2022) provides statistics on who games
and on the benefits of gaming. It indicates that 66% of Americans play videogames, including  of those over
the age of 18, and with numbers fairly evenly divide between males (52%) and females. The majority (69%) of
families in the U.S. have at least one member who plays videogames.
356 | 8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY

In Chapter 6, we discussed the roles and functions that

parents have in parenting; in Chapter 7 we looked further

into parents' roles in mediating and moderating their

children's technology safety and use. Here we focus on

joint consideration when family members interact with

one another when playing videogames or co-viewing

media. When her daughter was about 8, the author

played Nancy Drew Mystery games alongside her. The

games were sold on DVDs at the time (downloads came

later), and formatted for a PC. The games were

challenging and filled with depth of information on

specific content, as each game had a theme (e.g., history

museum, aquarium, Egypt exhibit). To solve the mystery

meant solving any variety of puzzles, using keen eye-hand             "Top Ten Animal Crossing Villagers" by
coordination, and employing memory of clues. They                     AntMan3001 is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.

could take days to solve. Consider all the ways in which
playing Nancy Drew with her 8-year-old enabled the author to fulfill her role as a parent1.

In their 2022 report on videogames, the ESA observes reasons why parents play videogames with their
children.

1. It's fun for all of us.
2. It's a good opportunity to socialize with my child.
3. My child asks me to.
4. I enjoy playing videogames as much as my child.

For example, 90% of parents are present when their child acquires a videogame. And 9 out of 10 require their
children to ask permission before purchasing a game. Nearly all (94%) parents pay attention to the videogame
played by their children. Three-quarters (77%) report playing videogames with their child at least once a week
-- up from 55% in 2020.

Over two-thirds (71%) note that playing videogames has a positive impact on their child. And even more
(88-91%) agree that they help children learn collaboration and problem-solving skills. With regard to

connectivity, most people (83%) play with others ,with 56% playing with friends, 35% with a partner or
spouse, and 32% with other family members.

                                     education level. They also determined that family

communication moderated (had an influence on) the effect of playing and family closeness, but only for those

families with lower levels of family communication. Families reported finding fun, spending time together,

and feeling closer when they played videogames, presenting a positive picture of the activity.

Pearce and colleagues (2021) examined the use of the videogame Animal Crossing with the idea of using
entertainment as a way to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic. From interviews with parents and their
children (in some households, both parents or all children were not interviewed; children ranged from 5-15
years), the authors found that playing the game contributed both to emotion-focused coping and problem-
focused coping. Emotional-focused coping includes escapist/avoidant, distraction, mood management,
emotional expression, and spending time together. Problem-focused coping included being occupied and
passing the time, which offered parents a way to protectively buffer stress. Playing the game lent to being part
of a routine, which related to resilience by individuals and the whole family. Finally, playing offered a way to
socially interact, something which, during the pandemic, was very limited. Children expressed that when they
played the game with others there were "kind of hanging out with people" (p. 12).

Connected Learning

In Chapter 5 we considered the role of technology in children's learning. Traditionally, we think of
"educational technology" as that used by teachers and schools in schools and to assist children with
homework. But the connected learning paradigm unbound learning from a place or space to follow the
individual's pursuit across what Barron (2006) refers to as a "learning ecology." As an example, a child
interested in dinosaurs may talk about them in class as part of a science curriculum. She may learn about
different dinosaurs, their names, their anatomies, and whether they were predators or prey. Beyond the
classroom, however, she may further explore dinosaurs online, in applications and games, in ways that
sharpen her knowledge and ability to differentiate. Her parent may plan the family vacation around a special
exhibit at a museum in a large city. An adventure to the seashore with her 4H club enables her to look for
358 | 8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY

fossils, which she then takes back home and, with the help of her parent and the internet, identifies as part of
the Paleolithic age.

      The Connected Learning Framework, Instruction and Pedagogy for Youth in Public Libraries, CC

Connected learning uses technology, space, time, and especially the interest of other people to build
engagement in learning. Those who assist the child in this engagement are called "learning heroes." Parents'
funds of knowledge can flow into family activities (Rogoff, 2003) to connect children to history, culture, and
experience, further tying together family members' understanding and interests. Beyond family-specific
opportunities for connected learning, the concept, when applied to minority youth and their exploration of
new media and technology for learning, creativity, and personal identity, finds real promise (Watkins et al.,
2018). The Digital Edge provides results from a year-long ethnographic study of adolescents at an urban high
school, incorporating interviews with teens, parents, and teachers, and observations of the technology-
enhanced settings in school and especially out. Results suggests that teens' "eager adoption of different
technologies forges new possibilities for learning and creating that recognize the collective power of youth:
peer networks, inventive uses of technology, and impassioned interests that are remaking the digital world."

Joint Exploration of Media and Technology

Family podcasting

An even more tangible way that families can be involved in
cohesive ways with technology is to co-create technology
together. This may include building a website or maintaining a
social media page, podcast, or a YouTube channel. A good
example of this is the Nowatski family. Beginning in 2015, Al
(the father) and his two children, Liam and Anna, created the
Children of the Force podcast. At the time, the children were 6
and 8, respectively. They started the podcast because the family
often talked about Star Wars. Weekly, they talk about all things
Star Wars -- digging into the lore, current films and TV shows,
conventions, and news. The conversation moves to current
events and the kids' opinions on a wide variety of topics. The
podcast lasts about an hour, and as the children have gotten
older and more involved in school, friends, and activities, they
sometimes skip a week. Readers are encouraged to check out
the Learning Activity that centers on this podcast. If watch the
author's interview with the family (Liam and Anna are now in
their teens), you can consider the ways in which doing the
podcast as a family contributes to the family's cohesion, communication, and demonstration of flexibility.

Maker spaces

Ito et al.'s 2020 report on Connected Learning addresses how co-creation can be beneficial to children and
the family. Co-creation can occur, for instance, in libraries that offer "maker spaces."

Intergenerational learning environments can offer non-traditional configurations of learners using technology
together to create opportunities and reimagine relationships to technology and the natural world. Projects
that have been studied include technologies with indigenous families, constructing identities through making
projects, parents collaborating with children to learn, and eliciting family sense-making with language and
culture in digital projects.

Learning through and about technology together

Tech Tales is a series of workshops that center on indigenous knowledge systems through storytelling, family
culture, family values, intergenerational sharing, and robotics. Through comparative case study research, the
scholars explored processes used by families in creating their stories. An example of this project, with a focus
on family engineering, is discussed and shown here. As the description of Robotics and e-textiles backpacks
for family learning says:

      In this video, we highlight a program called Tech Tales, a collaboration between the University of Washington,
      Pacific Science Center, Seattle Public Libraries, and Native American-serving organizations in the Pacific
      Northwest. In Tech Tales, nondominant families engage in engineering learning through storytelling, robotics,
      and e-textiles. At the center of the design is the recognition that all learning is cultural, and that all families and
      family members come to the workshop space with deep expertise around their own histories. As families
      animate their stories through robotics and programming through Scratch, they engage in playful and creative
      interactions, connecting relations and stories (stargazing, eagle relatives visiting, returning to Africa to reunite
      with family) with contemporary technologies (LEDs, motors, sensors), and they identify and explore new (or
      prior) interests while developing new competencies in multiple disciplinary forms of work (art, computer
      science, electrical engineering, and robotics).

Another project is Family Creative Learning (http://familycreativelearning.org/), created by faculty at the
University of Colorado-Boulder. Families are invited to learn together about computing, and to interact with
each other, working in teams as families and with other families. Through the experience, multiple points of
learning occur, and relationships develop within the family and with other families. Common themes from
the project include the shifting perspective of oneself, constructing identity, and becoming empowered. A
leader's guide supports the delivery of similar workshops worldwide. Readers are encouraged to seek more
information on the project website.

Establishing Family Rules about Technology Use as
a Family

                          Whether families use technology alone or together,

                          research supports the value of clear communication

                          about technology use. While we've discussed the ways in

                          which technology supports family communication and

                          cohesion, focusing on communication helps families also

                          set rules about technology management and device use

                          that are shared and benefit the group. Yet these rules may

                          not come easily for everyone. As noted in the previous

                          chapter, parents who feel more knowledgeable about the

Grace Duffy CC BY-NC-ND.  use and impacts of technology are more likely to instill

                          guidelines or practice authoritative practices to negotiate

use that is safe and reasonable. Those lacking in parental competence may either place straight guidelines

without conversation or be laissez faire and not engaged around children's use (Brito et al., 2017). Children's

own desire for and adherence to family rules around screen time and screen use will vary by age and influences

from their wider social ecology. As our insight from Lanigan's socio-technological framework indicates,

family technology rules are influenced by the attitudes, preferences, and behaviors of each family member.

The discussion about family rules, therefore, reflects family communication as indicative of the perspectives

of each family member.

An aim of family communication is to reach shared perspectives, with guidance accommodating the needs of
all. What are some techniques for doing this, specific to screen time among family members?

8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY | 365

                                                   There are a variety of tools and resources available to help

                                                   families determine screen time and safe technology use

                                                   and to identify common ground on technology use. One

                                                   is the Family Media Plan by the American Academy of

                                                   Pediatrics. This tool encourages parents and each child to

                                                   identify a plan together, based on the child's age. There is

                                                   a long checklist of items that the parent and child can

                                                   select jointly, then use daily to monitor the child's use.

                                                   What is the advantage to families of having this kind of

                                                   checklist for self-creation of a plan? One of the Learning

                                                   Activities asks you to create a media plan for three

                                                   children of different ages, then compare differences in

                                                   Media Plan is that guidance is offered only for children

age 18 and younger. Parents can have as much difficulty putting the phone down, or engage in practices that

are distracting to others or unhealthy for themselves.

As we'll discuss in the next chapter, self-regulation and the establishment of boundaries are new skills for
adults attempting to balance work and family in this post-COVID-19, high-tech world. This family education
site of a digital media nonprofit suggests eight elements that all families should consider:

 Total screen time
 Screen-free times of the day
 Screen-free family events (including dinner time)
 Not using the phone while driving
 Not using screens before or during bedtime
 Tackling habits (e.g., by silencing phones to quiet the desire to check for messages)
 Creating a family pledge
 Identifying tech-free family activities

While information and communications technology can be a distraction and create conflict within a family,
research indicates its value in encouraging family communication and strengthening family cohesion. The
array of applications and devices for collaboration, creativity, and communication between family members
has never been greater. For many families, technology tools -- especially videoconferencing -- were the single
strongest way of maintaining family connections during COVID-19. These connections include extended
366 | 8.1 TECHNOLOGY USE FOR FAMILY COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY

family members, and family members distant due to immigration, travel, and deployment. And videogames
can be a fabulous way for family members to have fun, solve problems, and strengthen cognitive skills, and for
parents to monitor children's media exposure.

Yet as families become increasingly busy and stressed, and children adapt to newer technologies at seemingly
younger ages and parents attempt to stay vigilant, it can be a challenge to use technology in ways that are
meaningful and maintain family connectedness without conflict. And for still other families, as discussed in
Chapter 3, the limits on resources of access, time, and money can create differences both within and across
families. With other life demands, technology use has become one more focus for family flexibility and
accommodation to ensure connectedness and cohesion.

8.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Family Creative Learning project

     Create (or at least plan) your own Family Creative Learning project. Review the facilitator's
     handbook and information about the overall project on the website. Using pages 8-18 of the guide,
     plan a project (set of workshops) for a community of families with 7-12-year-old children. This may
     be a community well-known to you (e.g., your younger sister's elementary school; the afterschool
     program you work in), or it may be an aspirational community you feel would benefit from a project
     like this. Add as much detail as you can, including the type of food to be shared, the projects
     developed, and outcomes you hope to achieve. Don't worry about being familiar with the software
     mentioned in the handbook (newer or better technology may be available anyway). The important
     thing is that you use the basic elements and aims of this project to plan for active engagement and
     relationship building between families.

     Children of the Force

     In the chapter we briefly discuss the Children of the Force podcast, a product of Al Nowatski and
     his children, Liam and Anna (now teenagers). The podcast, started in 2016, arose from their shared
     interest in Star Wars. Episodes can be found at their website: childrenoftheforce.com. Select at least
     one of the episodes to listen to. You can also watch this interview with the family from the spring
     of 2022:
                                                                                                                    8.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 371

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/technologyfamily/?p=355#oembed-1

Consider the following questions:
      What does the activity mean to the family sense of closeness (cohesion)? How does the
        activity serve as a platform for family communication, and as a demonstration of family/
        family member flexibility?
      How is Al asserting his role in the family? How are his children asserting their roles as
        children? How does the technology experience affect the execution of those roles, rules, and
        structure? How does it affect the processes of relationship maintenance and strengthening?
      Consider the contribution of creating this podcast to each child's development over time. In
        what ways might it influence the sense of identity? Self-concept? Social awareness?
      How might Al operate as a "learning hero" as one or both of the children build on the podcast
        experience to engage with their interests?

Family Media Plan

The American Academy of Pediatrics offers a Family Media Plan, an online tool which includes
helpful guidelines for safe and healthy technology use for children, and for shared decision-making
by children and their parents.

      Play around with it to see how it works, and create separate plans for a family with three
        children at different ages.

      Review each plan. How did you determine what to include for each child based on their age?
      How easy or difficult would it be for a family to help all children follow this plan?
      Consider your role as a family professional (e.g., therapist, educator, family service provider).

        How would you help families work with the plan?
372 | 8.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Co-viewing Media

     Commonsense Media offers helpful guidelines on co-viewing media with young children in ways
     that are helpful to their learning and to parent/child relationships. Explore the tips and explanations:

           Focus their attention.
           Encourage them to think about the order of events.
           Strengthen their understanding.
           Make it relatable.
           Expand on what kids say.
     Now select a popular film you might watch with a child between 4 and 8 years old (if you can't
     think of one, Commonsense Media also has a very helpful guide to media selection based on child
     age). Watch the film one time through, taking notes on each of the points above. Then create a
     media viewing guide for parents or caregivers to use to co-view the movie with their child.

8.4 BLOG PROMPTS

In Common Sense Media's "device-free dinner" research, a news outlet might report the results like
this:

      51% of parents report that having devices at the dinner table makes them feel disconnected.
      35% of parents report that having devices at the dinner table causes arguments.

        Examine the study report. Based on this reporting, are these findings correct? Was the study
        done in a way that gives you confidence in the findings?
        This activity is useful for reading research findings. Here are a few suggestions:

    1. Look at the central research question. What was the study trying to find out?
   2. Check the method. Based on what they wanted to learn, was their sample representative of

        the population they reported on? How did they gather the data? Is the method reliable?
   3. Examine how many people were in the total sample (n=867). Then check the reporting of the

        numbers for each part of the report. How did the news outlet get the percentage reported?
        Is it representative of the whole sample? If not, which portion is it referring to?
   4. Are there other findings that might have painted a different picture of families, devices,
        dinner time, and quality time together?
   5. Put on your critical hat, and scrutinize the study.

As a related post, say you were a developer for Commonsense Media and your team was to
determine a strategy that would be meaningful to parents. Would you aim toward
recommendations and tips on reducing phones during dinnertime? Why? If not, would you have
another message for parents?

     Based on the data from the videogame industry, many families play games together, and parents
     see that the time with their children is well spent. Yet parents are also concerned about their
     children's exposure to too much screen time and too much violence, two factors likely with the use
     of videogames. What do we recommend to parents who might be fond of videogames and would
     like to play them with their children so that use is safe and healthy, as well as fun and a way to
     connect as a family? How would guidelines vary based on the age of the child?

   Chapter Insights

           Work is an external system influence on families.
           Boundary theory is often used to describe work-family balance. Basic ideas in the theory

             include terms like boundary permeability, negative or positive spillover and boundary
             keepers.
           Consider this statement: "Technology is theoretically neutral and does not dictate boundary
             permeability." Do you agree or disagree?
           The are many ways ICT is used in work-family balance. It can influence - positively or
             negatively -- family satisfaction, workplace performance and individual's mental health.
           The term "new ways of working" is used to describe more flexible arrangements for work.
             Consider generational differences in the desire for flexibility and these new work
             arrangements. Consider too what flexibility and work arrangements means in studies that
             reveal challenges to the individual's mental health.
           A review of the research presented in this chapter. The picture it paints is quite complex and
             unclear. What does that tell you about the question of technology's influence on work-
             family balance?
           The video interview with Simon Sinek presents a fairly strong opinion about how well
             Millennials and GenZers were prepared for the workforce, and the need for companies to
380 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

             accommodate. After viewing the video see if you agree. Or perhaps your thoughts are less
             black and white on this issue.
           Our collective experience using ICT during the COVID-19 pandemic may have shifted
             perspectives about work and family balance. After your own experience with school/work/
             home life during COVID-19, consider your thoughts about the role, influence and value (and
             perhaps consequences) of information and communications technology.
           Policy recommendations organizational action are listed in the chapter. How might
             businesses and universities (as a business and an institution that helps prepare future
             professionals) support individual's acquisition of "digital cultural capital"?
           Given predictions of new ways of working and potential impacts on individuals and families,
             there are new roles that family professionals can and should play in aiding families now and
             in the future for maintaining a healthy balance.
           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Introduction

If COVID-19 brought families anything positive, it was the ability to complete multiple responsibilities in a
single location and with fewer constraints on time. Many families were home-bound, and thus needed to
attend to work, school, interests, religious fulfillment, caregiving, and other matters from home. They relied
on the internet and digital communication tools as they had before the quarantine, but this time without the
traditional bounds of place and time.

These images captures what it was like for many:

working with baby CC 2.0 BY NC-ND
Jenny Bradford.

These mothers are juggling multiple responsibilities, accommodating attention across needs, and using
technology to fulfill demands. When you look at these images, what emotions arise for you? How do you
think the mothers feel? How about their children? Imagine yourself in a similar situation. Demands pile up
across work/school/activities and in your personal/family/friend life. And somewhere in the middle are the
intentions you have for your health and well-being (sleep, anyone?).

The concept of work-family balance (or other balance of role demands) relates to the satisfaction that results
when an individual, as a member of a family, competently straddles role demands across the spheres of the
household and workplace (and often additional domains). Our interest in work and family balance isn't new.
Scholars have long been researching and theorizing about the ways in which individuals can successfully
balance their attention, energy, and focus across roles in multiple spheres, with success having many
382 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

implications. Workplaces vary, as do work demands.

hours, and non-standard/atypical work hours (time

spent working outside of the workplace) -- raised

interest in the topic by scholars. And in the last 20 years, access to the internet and the advent of mobile

devices has exponentially made study of work-family balance more complex.

Perspectives on Work-family Balance

Boundary theory is frequently used to explain the dynamics of work-family balance and to identify
antecedents and consequences (Berkowsky, 2013; Olson-Buchanan et al., 2016; Nam, 2014; Rice, 2017).
Boundaries of time and space, in particular, are seen as either fixed or permeable in reinforcing or allowing
fluidity in the execution of role demands. Physical spaces and the persons in those spaces -- the boundary
keepers (e.g., employers, family members) -- help reinforce boundaries by laying explicit and tacit
expectations on the individual for role fulfillment.

                      Work-family balance and boundary theory. Adapted from Clark, 2000.
Clark's (2000) discussion of boundary theory as it affects families observes that differences in the balance
experience are characterized by degrees of permeability in boundaries and flexibility in the execution of work/
family roles. Permeability indicates whether "elements from one domain are readily available in the other;
the ability to be physically in one setting yet perform a role psychologically from another" (p. 1020). A father
who calls to check on his children who are home after school is demonstrating that the boundary of the
family is permeable as the demands of his role enter the workplace. This is the result of his work conditions
and his psychological separation from work to make the phone call.
384 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

Flexible boundaries occur when "a person could relax the

boundary to meet the demands of the other domain,"

and when spatial and temporal markers of a boundary

can be moved (Nam, 2014; p.1020). For example, when a

teacher grades papers over the weekend, and at home, the

work boundary is flexible. The responsibilities of work

are completed in a home-based (or other) setting.

Boundary crossing occurs when there is some level of

integration: high permeability and high flexibility, or high

flexibility and low permeability, offer autonomy (the         Architect at work in home office. Permission-
choice for role completion in one domain or another);         ShareAlike 4.0 International. Peter Theony

low flexibility and high permeability result in interference

(higher probability of roles enacted in one domain to the exclusion of the other), and low flexibility and low

permeability mean segmentation (or boundary keeping). Nam observes that individuals with the potential for

interference are more likely to suffer the consequences of heavy workload, more stress, and diminished

satisfaction.

Transfer, or spillover, occurs when the individual's mood resulting from handling demands in one sphere
affects the other. Spillover can be negative (e.g, work stress taken out on others at home) or positive, also
known as enrichment (e.g., getting a promotion at work positively affects the parent's mood at home).
Berkowsky (2013) refers to this as cross-domain compensation. Competencies gained in multiple roles can
also help the individual deal with the negative stresses associated with roles in one domain. A parent who
receives a positive review at work, for example, may carry that feeling of competence in to their childrearing
attitudes. Recovery periods return the sense of balance and individual well-being after experiencing and then
resolving work-family conflict (Demerouti et al., 2014).

There are traditionally three domains of interest when studying work-family balance: the workplace,
the family, and the individual. Studies may also examine the wider influence of balance on society (reviews
by Olson-Buchanan et al., 2016, and Rice, 2017, indicate potential impacts on society; Shockley et al., 2018,
provide a cross-cultural perspective). An example of a societal benefit is when the workforce is solid as the
result of contented employees who feel that they successfully can balance responsibilities across domains.
Family, individual, and work outcomes reflect comprehensive and systemic impacts. More work hours, for
instance, may mean greater work productivity, yet also more role strain, personal stress on the individual, and
family dissatisfaction.

Based on a review of the international literature, Wheeler et al. (2018) recognize secondary effects. Most often,
parents' stress from conflict or imbalance influences children through their own psychological functioning
and relationships. Children's mental health and/or achievement can be affected. They cite cross-family

differences in cultural orientation, including gender equalitarianism, and intrafamily (between parent)
differences in occupational profiles that may reveal differences in child impact.

The ability to balance roles may be viewed as a skill possessed by the individual, when in fact a complexity of
influences affects the ways in which balance is achieved (Shockley et al., 2018). Working parents in countries
with high rates of inequality and low rates of economic growth and inflation, for example, value the
opportunity for longer working hours, so their perception of stress from work hours will be different. The
perception of conflict also appears to be influenced by culture (Shockley, et al, 2018; Xu et al., 2018).
Countries with more collectivistic cultures view family-to-work conflict as less of an issue; because work is
perceived as a means to provide support for and honor the family, additional work and longer work hours are
seen less as a conflict and more as helping the family. The perception that longer work hours create conflict in
the family is more likely in countries with a more individualistic worldview.

Gender equality and supports to the family play a significant role in demonstrations of balance. Because
women take more responsibility for domestic housework and child caring, it is harder for employed mothers
to achieve balance without additional child care. Higher rates of family vs. work conflict are seen in countries
that have a wide gender gap (Shockley et al., 2018). Disparities also occur across education lines. In the
response to COVID-19 pandemic, many workplaces offered extended leave and benefits for child care.
Additional benefits such as flexible or reduced hours, paid/unpaid time off, and child care or tutoring benefits
favor those with higher levels of education (Miller, 2020). For example, 29% of those with post-graduate
degrees report paid time off, compared to just 9% of those with less than a college educationt.

Even with the availability of work-family policies in recent decades, a backlash has challenged their success.
386 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

Perrigno et al. (2018) observe four mechanisms at play in the effort to sabotage well-intentioned work-family
policies: 1) inequity, 2) stigma, 3) spillover, and 4) strategy. One can imagine that integrating ICT in the
workplace and attempting balance with family responsibilities only makes policy action even more complex
and challenging.

Moving forward, readers are cautioned about extant research on work-family balance. Focusing only on the
existing body of research about worker and family experiences can lead to overgeneralization. Too often, there
is a tendency for research to reflect the experiences of those who are "WEIRD" (Western, educated,
industrialized, rich, and democratic).

Technology Integration
and Work-Family
Balance

While ICT has long played a role in in cross-

boundary role maintenance (e.g., the mother who

uses a phone to check on her children after school),  "Working breakfast at Mr Brightside, Caulfield South"

seem to practically evaporate boundaries of time

and place in how and when work gets done. In fact, the fluid nature of work due to the use of technology

across boundaries in the last 20 years leads Hughes and Silver (2020) to assert that, rather than seeing work

and home in balance, how work gets done should be seen as the new standard. Adjustments to family life,

with more flexible workplace arrangements, are being embraced as a fact of the future (Anderson et al., 2021).

Technological innovation for the workplace may have tapped into a longstanding need. Rice (2017) observed
that many workers do not find that workplace hours accommodate a sense of balance with family
responsibilities. She cites a 2010 study in which 60% of Australian workers indicated a preference for
telework. And 2017 data indicated that workers would take an 8% pay reduction if it allowed them to work
from home (What a way to make a living, 2020). Nevertheless, prior to COVID-19, fewer than 5% of the
labor force in the U.S., and 2-9% in Europe, reported exclusively working from home (Eurostat, 2017). These
statistics highlight the dramatic effect of the pandemic on a more mobile workplace. Equally, the availability
of college courses online shifted exponentially with COVID.

For those whose jobs can adapt to these "new ways of working" (Demerouti et al., 2014), new challenges are
present. Studies of teleworking offer insight into the conditions which may contribute to a sense of balance or
imbalance. Early research on technology integration indicated positives for worker productivity, and for
worker perception of autonomy, yet later work suggested minimal benefit for working from home (Olson-
                                            9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE | 387

Buchanan et al., 2016, p. 21). In particular, women did not demonstrate higher job satisfaction even if they
perceived more control and flexibility. Solis' (2016) examination of teleworkers in Costa Rica identified that
having more work time at home, shared or inadequate space, and inflexible work schedules related to
perceptions of work-family interference. In part, the presence of the mother at home, though working, may
over time enhance children's expectations of her availability. Employer attitude also appears to contribute to
teleworking success; the actions of managers who are reluctant to trust employees to be productive can
diminish employee feelings of autonomy and recognition.

                                                      Many jobs, however, do not offer flexibility in time or

further divides among families.                       Buchanan et al., 2016). This is particularly true in
                                                      professions requiring skilled labor. Latin American

                                                      countries like Ecuador, Guatemala, and Bolivia, more

greatly dependent on manufacturing or agriculture, have less potential for telework (Pimintel, 2020). This

was also evident for essential workers during COVID-19, for whom the need to be present at work and the

need for child care support continued uninterrupted.

The internet, and mobile and digital technologies, offer the promise of managing work with more autonomy
and success amidst a more fluid landscape of a modern workplace culture that thrives on employee availability
(Demerouti et a.l, 2014). Research on technology's influence on work-family balance before COVID-19
informs our understanding of the adjustments needed as we look to a future that is "tele-everything"
(Anderson et al., 2021). Theoretically, perceiving work conditions as more flexible relates to higher job
satisfaction. Use of mobile technologies might modify that relationship, however, if workers feel in less
control due to communication demands (for example, from an employer during family time).
388 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

                                           Research by Nam (2014) examined the influence of

                                           internet and mobile phone use on 850 workers' perceived

                                           flexibility and permeability and on job outcomes (job

                                           satisfaction, job stress, and workload). Workers' sense of

                                           stress decreased with use of mobile phones for work.

                                           Nam found direct (positive) relationships between the

                                           use of technologies and perceptions of work and family

                                           flexibility and of work-family permeability. And these

                                           variables related to each other: permeability of work-to-

                                           family life was positively related to flexibility in work-to-

                                           family life. In other words, those using technology to

                                           accomplish work tasks at home were likely to facilitate

                                           home-related needs at work. For some workers, although

                                           family. For others, telework reduced feelings of stress, yet

contributed to feelings of being overworked. And effects observed may reflect more than the direct impact on

the individual; Ferguson et al. (2016) revealed that using technology to continue work from home can have

compounded effects on the employee through influence on the family. They examined cell phone use at home

for work by employees (so called "mWork"). An employee's decision to quit the job in response to heightened

workplace demands related to strain that appeared to correlate with strain on family members.

Nam suggested that organizations continue to monitor employee satisfaction with the use of technology. The
changing use of technology by employees at work and for work, and for work at home, requires that policies
regarding work-life balance consider the growing interplay of technology with flexibility and worker
satisfaction.

demands, for example, may be a predictor in one study, influencing whether the use of technology for
boundary permeability is necessary, and appear in another as a moderator, affecting the degree to which using
technology influences the balance.

            Variables identified in technology and work-family balance research

Antecedents. Olson-Buchanan et al.'s (2016) review identified that use of ICTs to perform work during non-
work time was positively predicted by perceived usefulness of the technology, along with job conditions
(higher job status, work demands, work norms/expectations), expectations from family and friends, and the
ability to multitask, and negatively predicted by preference for segmentation (individual difference for
boundary maintenance). Rice (2017) similarly determined that use and comfort with technology predicted
individual differences in work-family arrangements, which also influenced work and individual outcomes
from flex arrangements.

Readers may remember discussion of Davis' technology acceptance model (TAM, 1989) in Chapter 2. The

TAM characterizes use of technology in terms of positive perceptions toward that use. Individual differences

communication devices for coordination. Gender influence appears related to correlative societal and role
demands -- men with more education, for example, held jobs that enabled more autonomy. And work
position influenced the degree to which individuals held boundary permeable/flexible positions that
conditioned their use of technology.

Outcomes. A focus on workplace, family, and individual outcomes continues to be present in technology-
related research. Work outcome variables include perceived flexibility or control (autonomy), work
productivity, hours worked, work-nonwork conflict, psychological strain, and job attitudes. Family outcomes
include family connectedness and satisfaction.

Perhaps the largest area of outcomes-research relates to the individual -- specifically, dimensions of worker

individual health (blood pressure, heart condition, frequency of illness), and mental health (depression, stress,

role strain). Longer work hours and the negative spillover felt by family contribute to higher work-nonwork

                                    conflict, higher perceived stress, and burnout. Rice

Writing about tele-work, Leineweber and Falkenberg (2018) report that Nordic countries have the highest
rates in Europe of workers working from home. For these workers, the constant availability offered by new
technologies and telework leads to feelings of constant involvement, including during free time. As Olson-
Buchanan et al. (2016) observe, "the flexibility of time and space and role demand, aided by the use of
boundary cross technologies, fosters role conflict by allowing for interruptions and distractions and hindering
one's ability to meet the demands of the salient role" (p.18).

Social isolation is a potential result of telework or flexwork. Studies have observed that increased online
communication has reduced casual conversation between colleagues (e.g., talk around the water cooler),
which can then influence work outcomes. While working from home can mean the availability of a parent to
care for a child or be present when the child is sick, consistent space and time flexibility can risk compromised
productivity. Exploitation of the flexibility by employees to multitask can diminish chances for promotion
and opportunities for achievement. This is particularly likely for women, the elderly, and those with children
with disabilities, who have competing role expectations on their time. As a result, despite the availability of
technologies that offer flexibility, the difficulty of doing both home and work roles well contributes to conflict
and possibly weaker work performance.

Moderators. Research on work-family balance also identifies moderators in the individual, work, and family

realms. Variables related to the individual include negative affect, time management skills, preference for

and shows agency in determining boundary

permeability.

Moderators in the workplace include social stressors, technology support (or lack thereof), and job-related
factors such as job status. Technological support, for example, boosts perceptions of flexibility, indirectly
benefitting work satisfaction. It appears to work beyond aiding the individual's knowledge and confidence in
using technology, providing an indirect boost to perceived flexibility and work satisfaction. A study of parent
and family educators in the U.S. determined a strong relationship between workplace infrastructure
(including technical support) and encouragement (including shared values for technology) and perceived
usefulness and ease of use (Walker & Hong, 2017). Taken to its natural conclusion, technological support's
value to individual technology comfort could positively influence competence in use for work-family balance,
resulting in reduced work strain and burnout.

Family demands can influence worker attitudes. Workers whose family members have positive attitudes about
technology's usefulness, for example, report higher work satisfaction. But these variables don't work in
isolation. More recent advances in education, integrating technology in children's school work and learning,
have introduced stresses on families as children spend time online and need assistance. A recent study by
McKinsey and Lean (2020) observed that, for many women, this can influence the decision to leave their jobs.
Justifications include lack of flexibility at work, feeling like they need to be available to work at all hours,
housework and caregiving burdens, worry that their performance is being negatively judged because of
caregiving responsibilities, discomfort sharing the challenges they are facing with teammates or managers,
feeling blindsided by decisions that affect their day-to-day work, and feeling unable to bring their whole self to
work. Black women and other women of color experience these constraints to a greater degree.
394 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

The future view of work

Looking to the future, experts foresee shifts in work that that will

make it less placed-based, more flexible, more automated, and

reliant on on-demand consumer expectations (Anderson et al.,

2021; NAS, 2017). Ens et al. (2018) identified a digital work

typology based on how work is reconfigured through the

availability of digital technologies. This typology reflects job

mobility (degree of flexibility in the location of work) and precarity

(degree of instability due to flexible employment), and it was

crafted to construct a notion of "decent digital work," or digital

work that enables autonomy, competence, and belonging (p.2)

They label worker types as follows: the gig worker (high precarity,

low mobility), the digital nomad (high precarity, high mobility), the   "Our Uber driver wins the award for

These new digital-work realities can affect individual well-being. The transition to more flexibility in location
can challenge feelings of competence in managing tasks and time, and the sense of belonging. Consequences
heighten with greater mobility (traveling elite) and precarity (digital nomad), threatening the sense of
connection. According to the authors, "Autonomy suffers from a need to maintain a steady supply of work
and meeting clients' needs" (p. 6). There exists the potential that spillover from these digital work
arrangements can affect the workers' emotional release at home and the time needed for recovery.

Work-Family Balance Policy Recommendations
Reflecting New Digital Realities

In 2021, the author prepared a background report for the United Nations on the role of technology in the
family (Walker, 2021), with an emphasis on work-family balance. This section presents an adaptation of the
report's policy recommendations.

development of what Ollier-Malaterre et al. (2019)

call "digital cultural capital." Technology has been said to present a paradox through its problematization

of work-nonwork boundary permeability. It makes permeability possible, yet creates challenges requiring

individual attention and responsibility to provide equitable balance in role performance. "Digital cultural

capital" represents the awareness, motivation, and skill to perform technology management. A new employee

benefit, for instance, may be tailored educational supports on how to manage ICT to support work and

family goals.

Employers can help foster more personal responsibility to avoid negative spillover in setting boundaries for
communication -- using smartphones wisely, deploying privacy management tools, practicing good digital
citizenship and online self-presentation (Olson-Buchanan et al., 2016; Blum-Ross et al., 2018). As Ollier-
Malaterre et al. (2019) stress, the development of "digital cultural capital" should be learned through the
social class divides that enable some groups to develop skills over others.
396 | 9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE

Employers can acknowledge individual differences that might affect workers' abilities to work from home
while also supporting their children's learning (McKinsey & LeanIn, 2020; What a way to make a living,
2020). "Boundary management" may be a new skill employees need to acquire. Providing support may reduce
psychological stress and enhance parent/worker confidence, promoting mental health and well-being and
potentially making parents more available to assist with their children's learning from home.

                                    Policies must hold a vision for
                                    future innovation and what that
                                    will mean to the workplace and to
                                    families.

At the same time, employers must be wary of permeability effects on workers. Research suggests that
workplace permeability benefits employers more than employees; when individuals lack the capacity to
manage demands across work and family spheres, job dissatisfaction, job-related stress, and role overload
occur. Policies for employees need to be consistent and clarify expectations for daily work and performance
reviews (Blum-Ross et al., 2018). They should also regard individual differences in employee preference and
avoid inequity and division. Older workers, for instance, hold different views on autonomy and permeability
than younger one. Training and support programs that advance the technology skills of older workers can
lessen gaps in worker performance.

Greater responsibility for the privacy and security of a more permeable, flexible work and family life in online
spaces must be taken. As Ollier-Malaterre et al. (2019) note:

      technology amplifies the blurring...also because the very definitions of what is public and what is private are
      under scrutiny: Information shared on social media, for instance, is sometimes deemed by scholars and lawyers
      as private and sometimes public...In an era in which putting up curtains on windows and planting high trees
                                            9.1 WHAT BOUNDARIES? TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN WORK AND FAMILY BALANCE | 397

      around houses no longer suffices to safeguard privacy, many new questions for individuals arise about privacy,
      visibility and surveillance that societies or collective actions may at some point strive to regulate. (p. 435)

The reach of organizations expands with technology changes, ultimately affecting individual workers and the
blurring of boundaries and roles. Attention needs to be placed on the longer-term exposure to forced
teleworking (as with COVID, or permanent shifts made post-pandemic), and considerations necessary for
workplace supports that extend to the home. Employers can consider financial subsidies that cover costs for
home internet, ergonomic workspaces, and peripherals that make home-based work less taxing on personal
resources. Other proactive planning will be for transitions as work-home arrangements change. As employees
have flexed and reoriented their boundaries to satisfy work and family needs, a return to previous or adjusted
arrangements will bring about the need for recovery (Dermouti et al, 2014) and support (McKinsey &
LeanIn, 2020).

Research Considerations

Without a doubt, research on the intersection of work-family balance and technology needs to be expanded
-- in ways that include a greater representation of workers, work contexts, and family experiences, and that
examine how cultural assumptions with regard to technology integration shape work-family policy. The
French government, for example, encourages companies to minimize technology disruptions after work
hours. This helps to control technological effects at multiple levels (Ollier-Malaterre et al., 2019).

Within the research, attention to individual and family outcomes from technology-integrated work-life
balance must be elevated on par with that directed at workplace well-being. A systemic view must regard the
reciprocal and transactional costs and benefits to the family, and should include the effects of work-family
balance on children, an area that to date has been given limited attention in the literature. Children's well-
being as influenced by parents' work status and work conditions deserves closer study. Work-family conflict,
with its impact on the parent-child relationship (and inherent to this, parents' attention, communication, and
responsivity), appears to be an indirect route through which work-family balance can influence externalizing
or internalizing behaviors.

Disparities in work-family policy, and in its equitable execution, exist worldwide. U.S. policies for family leave
and childcare support lag behind those of other countries that are economically competitive and have low
employment rates. Might there be similar resistance to comprehensive policies that address the complexity of
technology preferences, work demands, and the needs of families? In chapter 12 we consider the role of policy
in integrating research findings on ICT and the family into the real world. The future of families demands
that our critical lens extend to the role technology plays in the peaceful balance of work and family demands
and benefits.

9.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

Future family-friendly workplaces

This chapter discusses the notion of balance of roles and responsibilities between work, home, and
one's personal life . COVID-19 advanced the idea of a fluid work space, unbounded by time or space,
as white-collar workers worked from home. This enabled greater agency for individuals to manage
demands. At the same time, for many -- especially parents -- the lack of boundaries made creating
that balance even harder. As we "return to work," many workers and employers are mixed in their
views about the healthiest and most effective work arrangements.

      Imagine a workspace arrangement in the near future that capitalizes on workers' needs to
        manage family and personal responsibilities. What would that look like?

      Imagine an arrangement that capitalizes on home-based settings. What policies or resources
        might the employer recommend or require to ensure that employees can be most
        productive?

Digital equities and work-family balance

Jobs that can be done anywhere, anytime offer the most flexibility in meeting work-family
demands. These jobs often rely heavily on the internet and digital technologies. And they depend
on the internet being available, and on devices being plentiful between workers and in households.
Consider the following professions:

           car mechanic
     Can each be done at home? Do they need to be completed in a physical space? What information
     and communication technologies would aid the fulfillment of responsibilities for the family? Who
     may or may not have access to these devices? Who may or may not have access to the internet?

What does the changing world of work mean for the field of family social science? Should we be
changing how we teach about family relationships and management to adapt to work that is
anywhere, anytime, social, mobile, and collaborative, and focused more on results rather than place
and time?

Do you foresee that changes in the workplace will mean changes for the division of family roles, so
that work is accomplished AND the functions and responsibilities of the family to children, couples,
and the family as a whole are fulfilled?

Consider the critical post question #1, above. In light of possible changes ahead for families, how do
we advocate as professionals for family time, communication, connectedness, engagement, and
presence to respond and attend to the needs of growing children?

In the Families and Technology course, students tracked 12 hours of their personal technology use
and analyzed what that use meant to their personal well-being and relationships. Many identified
mixed feelings -- that it was valuable to their school work and personal lives but was also a
significant source of distraction. Many reported that they felt that they were addicted, or at least
that they'd become dependent on technology. As we consider boundary blurring and work and
family, consider what this means for you in the future. What steps will you take to find necessary
boundaries that help you maintain a healthy balance? Student lives in school add on to or mimic

   Chapter Insights

           Security, safety, privacy, and compliance with policies and regulations are concerns in
             managing both health and finances through the internet and with digital applications. These
             can be potential threats to family well-being.

           Applications offered to help families manage finances and/or health care may widen the
             digital divide.

           Personal expression and the sharing of information about one's health have become popular,
             particularly through blogs, video channels (e.g., The Clarity Project), and health apps. Such
             sharing of personal health experiences has pros and cons.

           Telemedicine has become popular, particularly in the aftermath of COVID-19. There are
             benefits and possible concerns of telemedicine (or telehealth).

           Apply the criteria of USE (easy to use, safe, effective) to the selection of health care
             information and financial apps. Consider how easy guidelines like acronyms might be helpful
             to family members and consumers.

           Among other household expenditures, technology has become a stable and increasingly
             costly item. Given a list of categories for tech spending, calculate your average monthly and
             yearly cost of technology. Consider how your own costs compare with others (to identify
             factors that go into our technology spending, such as sharing passwords to streaming
410 | 10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT

             services or free printing). Consider too how your costs compare to other major expenditures,
             such as college tuition, to gain perspective about family households' tech spending burden.
           The use of apps like Venmo for money exchange has become popular, as have mobile apps

Introduction

Without a doubt, ICTs have made it easier for families to search for information and manage data on health
and finance, and communicate with related professionals. Looking for a clinic, resolving a question about a
child's health, accessing health records, and making visits to a doctor can all be done online or through an
app. Similarly, finding information about investments and retirement savings, accessing bank records,
mapping the closest ATM, and even sending money to another person can be done with a few clicks. In this
chapter, we briefly explore the range of applications and devices families use to manage their health care and
finances, and identify ways in which such use can be positive for individual well-being yet have family impacts
as well.

As we consider these topics, we are reminded of our key consideration of equity and access. The digital divide,

and education levels, and, particularly, those without
neighborhood internet access. Families in rural areas
similarly face challenges with accessing health
information online (Choi & DiNitto, 2013).

Information on personal and family health and money can be deeply private and sensitive and require
confidentiality. For this reason, HIPPA laws (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) were put
into place as the internet became more publicly available. Financial data, too, is subject to invasions of privacy
and security threats. In 2017, a data breach at Equifax risked credit information on 145 million individuals
(including the author). The sensitive data shared included names, social security numbers, addresses, and
dates of birth. While for most users there were no serious consequences, the breach did mean that when the
immediate fix was to block credit details, individuals later faced challenges in obtaining their own credit
information. There is also evidence of the breach's impact on children (Kim & Capitani, 2017). One family
discovered that their 7-year-old's information was affected, which led them to wonder about the challenges
they would face if their Social Security number was exposed.

Family professionals can help families gain basic understanding and comfort using digital tools to manage and
understand money and health care. They can also advocate for the full range of families to have equal access to
the internet and digital technologies, and to the same efficiencies and opportunities afforded to others.
Because privacy and safety are so central to the topics of money and family health, we reinforce our critical
lens on technology use by beginning with a focus on this issue.

Privacy and Safety of Information and Data

Privacy and online safety are major issues facing everyone who uses the internet. With regard to family
privacy, inclusive

scrutiny: Information shared on social media, for instance,
is sometimes deemed by scholars and lawyers as private
and sometimes public.... In an era in which putting up
curtains on windows and planting high trees around
houses no longer suffices to safeguard privacy, many new
questions for individuals arise about privacy, visibility, and
surveillance that societies or collective actions may at some
point strive to regulate. (p. 435)

                                     These issues are particularly critical for families.

their privacy and use sites that adhere to child-protective policies. As noted in Chapter 5, children's level of

development and emerging abilities to reason through online threats can leave them vulnerable. COPPA laws

that protect children's privacy extend to sites also interested in engaging children around health and money

issues.

This brief overview suggests that the impacts of data security and sharing can be individual or family-wide,
and can affect organizations and whole governments. Actions for safety thus fall in the personal, policy, and
system levels. Because the issue of cybersecurity is so large, it is beyond the scope of this chapter or book to
cover it in detail. Rather, we provide an overview of the various elements that comprise cybersecurity, their
potential impacts, and the personal and regulatory steps that can be made. This is an ever-expanding topic as
new forms of hacking (e.g., ransomware) and data chains are developed. Readers are encouraged to explore
some of the sources in the Additional Resources section or do a search for information on topics of interest in
this area.

Dimensions of online safety

There are four dimensions of safety online, as summarized by Commonsense Media:

   Safety: Protection of personal accounts and information from hackers and others to protect physical
      and emotional well-being.

   Privacy: Data is often collected to be used for marketing and targeting and personal sharing.
   Security: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of a person's data.
   Compliance: Adherence to existing laws and regulations.

Relatively recent data suggests that most Americans feel that their online data is not secure. A 2019 report by
Pew indicated that 62% of those sampled reported that it is not possible to go through daily life without
having their data collected by companies; 63% report this for government sites. What's more, in most cases
two-thirds or more are concerned with how the data is used and that the consequences of gathering the data
outweigh the benefits, and more than half have little to no understanding of how the data is used, particularly
by the government. There is a more generalized understanding of the commercial use of data to track interests
and user demographics for the purpose of making life "easier." (For those curious, the Pew report includes a
section explaining data uses by the U.S. government.)

Yet although we are concerned, few of us object or don't "agree" when asked when website popups solicit
compliance about their data use policies. Likely, we are daunted by the long texts of legal information -- in
the Pew study, 63% say they understand little or nothing about laws to protect data privacy -- or simply don't
want to take the time to read it all. And opinions are mixed when it comes to the purposes for identifying
types of data. While many object when a social media site tracks posts about depression, few object that a
school would sell information about poorly performing students to a nonprofit company that supports
learning. This graphic from the report indicates views on a range of ways in which data is used. If you were
part of the sample, would you find these topics of data sharing acceptable or unacceptable? If you're not sure,
what could help you know?

Americans report experiencing one of three types of

issues: fraudulent charges on a credit card, someone

taking over their identity on social media, or someone trying to get a loan in their name. A student at the

University of Minnesota related a harrowing experience with identity theft when a smartphone was stolen

during a personal theft and assault. The assailants forced the individual to share the phone's passcode and

AppleID, which enabled access to a variety of apps. This included Venmo (discussed later in the chapter).

Requests for money from members of the contact list, and charges on accounts available through apps on the

phone, led to hundreds of dollars being stolen. More information on cybercrime can be found here.

Cyber safety

Digital applications and websites are subject to
compliance with laws and regulations that fall into
the general category of cyber safety. Cyber safety is a
term for "the collective mechanisms and processes
by which valuable information and services are
protected from publication, tampering, or an
assortment of unauthorized activities that are

Privacy and security concerns include those
discussed above, when a person's data is shared for marketing or when data sharing breaches confidentiality.
The COPPA laws intended to protect children's privacy, discussed in Chapter 5, address some of these
concerns.

Various laws are in place to protect security and privacy: https://privacy.commonsense.org/resource/

Regulatory compliance is a site's compliance with all available laws, rules, and regulations. HIPPA's strict
practices, in part, standardize health information and protect patient privacy, and penalties for non-
compliance can include federal penalties and legal action. Internal compliance ensures that a site remains in
compliance with federal and state laws.Industry compliance includes employee practices that safeguard data
use.

Health Information and Care: Use of Technology in
Personal and Family Health

The use of the internet and digital applications can have

impacts on individuals -- with indirect value to others

in the family -- and on whole families. With an            This video discusses security

health extends beyond the individual. During the

COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of Americans used

the internet to arrange vaccine appointments for

themselves or another person (McClain et al., 2021). Reviews of technology used for individual and family

health fall into the following categories:

1. Web sites with health information.
                                                         10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT | 417

 2. Social support and exchange of information on social media, discussion forums, YouTube channels, and
      more.

 3. Applications for the management of disease, as a complement to interventions, and for monitoring
      personal and family health.

 4. Wearable technologies for health data management, such as Fitbits and Apple Watches.
 5. Health care services delivered via technology (e.g., telemedicine) and the purchase of medical devices and

      pharmaceuticals.
 6. Robotic devices that provide emotional support and relieve stress in conditions such as dementia.

Reviews on individual conditions with clear family implications -- such as dementia and eating disorders --
provide useful information on the various ways that technology can be used to aid and assist (though
sometimes challenge) health and recovery. As these are discussed below, consider how their use may impact
the individual and have direct or indirect impacts on the family. Consider too what concerns may arise. For
example, wearable technology collects massive amounts of data on individual health behavior and
physiological conditions . This can inform health care practitioners in ways that mean more accurate
reporting and diagnosis, but it can also mean data exposure and the need for protection from privacy
violations (Cilliers, 2020). And while purchasing prescriptions online can be efficient and convenient for
those homebound or in rural areas, recent reviews of online drug providers finds that consumers show be
wary. Providers were found to pair drugs with services not designed for long-term support, or to enhance
prices to capitalize on convenience.

Information about health online

For better or worse, the internet has become a significant source of information about health, illness, disease
prevention, and recovery. Prior to the availability of the internet, individuals sought out health practitioners
for information, turned to trusted others (e.g., family or friends), or sought written materials or audiovisual

Social support and information exchange

                                                      The ability to learn about health conditions from others'

                                                      personal experiences is a major advantage of the internet.

                                                      Early research on families and health online came from

                                                      the mental health community, when parents of children

                                                      with mental disabilities exchanged information through

                                                      discussion forums (Scharer, 2005 ). Significant research

                                                      has since explored the emotional and informational

                                                      and individuals find others who share similar experiences,

                                                      though they may not be known personally or have access

information, and enabled personal relationships and connections for direct support.

Applications for caregivers of those with dementia have demonstrated particular value. Shu and Woo's 2021
review of the literature indicates that people use the internet to diagnosis dementia. In-home technologies
serve to support seniors living alone and offer support to caregivers of dementia patients, and social media and
YouTube offer education on dementia that is valuable to patients and caregivers alike. Yet research suggests
                                                         10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT | 419

that internet use by the elderly greatly depends on the perception of value, comfort, and skill in using social
media for learning.

Online groups have also been identified as valuable for patients with eating disorders (Howard, nd), providing
valuable peer-to-peer support for positive recovery and emotional encouragement. And in some cases, hard-
to-diagnose diseases have been addressed through facilitators like Dr. Lisa Sanders' column Diagnosis in the
New York Times and dramatized on Netflix.

While the internet has expanded access to information about an illness such as cancer (VanEenbergen et al.,
2020) or schizophrenia (Hswen et al., 2020), or about a medical condition one is attempting to prevent (e.g.,
diabetes, Sauder et al., 2021), concerns have been raised about the potential for false information that might
lead to mistreatment of the condition, exacerbation of symptoms, mental health consequences, or worse.
Many online influencers and groups are neither sponsored by a medical or health care agency nor facilitated
by a professional. While discussion of treatment modalities and new research is positive for learning,
moderation can help the conversation stay positive and constructive for all involved.

One example of how social media can influence health information is a study of children's perception of the

dangers of nicotine, examining children's exposure to the e-cigarette "Puff bar" through 148 TikTok videos in

2020 (Morales et al., 2022). The videos had been collectively viewed over 137 million times. Elements of

                                    content regarding the cigarettes included skits and

                                                               Self-authored blogs, social media pages, and video
channels are also ways that individuals share and consume health information. For many, these offer deeply
personal mechanisms for sharing and taking part in others' experiences. For example, the Clarity Project 1 was
a YouTube channel offered by Claire Wineland. She was a teenager who had cystic fibrosis, and her videos
shared her daily experiences of living with the disease. Sadly, she passed away in 2018 during recovery from a

lung transplant. Before her death, she had amassed tens of thousands of followers and become an advocate for
those living with a chronic medical condition. Here's a sample video journal:

Health care management

Apps and other technology that detect falls or gas and carbon monoxide leaks can reduce concerns for persons
with dementia. Other apps can track medication use and offer reminders to aid compliance. Recovery apps
for illnesses such as alcoholism or eating disorders offer mood check-ins, mindfulness tips, constructive
monitoring of eating and exercise, and ways to identify triggers.

Readers may be interested in seeing the details of this clinical trial for an app that aids those with anorexia
nervosa after intervention. As there is a significant rate of relapse, the app is intended to optimize clinical
service done face-to-face and improve treatment response. The web page includes descriptions of measures
used by the researchers to assess use and usefulness of the app, and clinical details of the patient's condition,
thus pairing technology use with the condition it seeks to aid.

Yet such health management apps appear to be primarily focused on the individual, not those providing
assistance and support. Grossman and co-authors (2018) acknowledge that of the hundreds of thousands of
medical apps available, few address caregiver needs. Only 18%, for example, offered stress reduction activities
for caregivers.
                                                         10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT | 421

Wearable technologies

Wearable technologies provide ways to monitor body response and can send
information to health care practitioners. Fitbits and similar products can
also be used by individuals with dementia (Shu & Woo, 2021), providing
fall detection and information on sleep, physical activity, heart rate, and
arrhythmia that can guide physicians in care plans.

Although research is limited on the effectiveness of activity trackers and

wearable technologies for full family health, there are positive indications.

This Australian study by Shoeppe et al. (2020) tested physical activity gains

in the family after each member wore a fitness device for 12 weeks. In this

study, the whole family included both parents and at least one child age

9-13. In addition to fitness trackers, family members also used a tailored     Image by Create Health, CC BY
app to align with the device, information on recommended activities, and a     2.0
motivational poster, and received motivational texts up to three times per

week. Measuring outcome by the number of steps, all family members showed significant gains. The

researchers focused on the value of family dynamics (e.g., parental role modeling, consistent communication)

and reciprocal motivation (e.g., family members acting as agents of change) as likely influences on family

member success. Although the study is limited by the number of participants and the lack of a control group,

the authors suggest that it indicates promise for whole family health. These devices, however, are also subject

to data breaches (Cilliers, 2020).

Telemedicine

As this piece in Everyday Health indicates, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) defines
telemedicine as "the practice of using technology to deliver medical care at a distance, over a
telecommunications infrastructure, between a patient at an originating site and a physician or other licensed
practitioner at another site." This is different from telehealth, discussed above, which includes the use of
"electronic and telecommunications technologies that support a variety of remote healthcare services, such as
medical, health coaching, and education services."

As would be expected, the use of telemedicine rose during the COVID-19 pandemic. When physicians'
offices were used to treat individuals with the virus and stay-at-home orders kept families inside, one's home
became a preferred location for the delivery of care. Seivert and Badowsk i (2020) indicate the benefits of
telemedicine to the individual, the provider, and the health care system. Individual benefits include access to
medical professionals beyond traditional hours, cost savings, and travel reduction. For professionals, benefits
422 | 10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT

include travel and cost efficiencies, care provided to hard-to-reach areas, such as rural territories, and increased
practitioner satisfaction. For health care systems, telemedicine offers the ability to expand service beyond time
and place boundaries, decrease staff burnout, and reach underserved populations. Additional benefits enable
professionals to provide caregiver support, and monitor patient vital signs and compliance.

Yet there are barriers and drawbacks to telemedicine. Staff members need training to deploy telemedicine
effectively and ethically. Some individuals/patients are concerned with privacy or interruptions by others, may
be challenged with access to the internet or in comfort with using a range of applications, or are less
comfortable talking over the internet. When others are nearby, some individuals may feel reluctant to talk
about health or mental health concerns.

Robotic devices

                                                   One avenue with promise for health care, particularly for

                                                   those living with dementia, is robotic products. As

that, while there is promise in robotic devices for family member health care, particularly for those with

dementia and Alzheimer's disease, knowledge and assessment tools are as yet unavailable to evaluate specific

device use for specific needs. As with other technologies -- and as the thread through this book holds --

consumers and family members must become knowledgeable enough to make individualized decisions based

on personal goals and needs.

Health e-literacy

With the overwhelming number of websites that share health information, plus the exchange of information
through social media and from person to person via apps such as WhatsApp, it is up to individuals to
                                                         10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT | 423

determine whether information is safe and useful. Personal health literacy, as defined by the US Department
of Health and Human Services is, "the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and
use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others."

Evaluating health information online

       A helpful acronym USE:
       U: is the site easy to use (e.g., to navigate, read, understand?

             Is it an app or device? Or interactive software? Does it do what is it supposed to?
             Are the tools and resources easily readable? In the language needed? With ability

                accommodations?
             Does it work with other devices or platforms?
       S: is it safe? Does it feel secure? Private?
             Is it secure? Does it track your data? How can you tell?
       E: is it effective? Does the information provided seem like it's coming from a

             Is it up to date?
             Who provides the information?
             Is the information accurate?

Another health information source from the U.S. government, Medline, offers constructive questions that
broadly explore source and quality:

Health information through social media

For some, it may be more challenging to determine the accuracy and usefulness of information passed along
within a personal social network, including "friends" on Facebook, those followed on Instagram, and TikTok.
This video by John Oliver on HBO examines Whats App and the spread of misinformation about
COVID-19 and immunizations, especially among family members: As the video indicates, information
spread through immigrant communities, with little oversight by the app companies or the government to
regulate the sharing of potentially harmful information. A 2021 review of the pre-COVID literature about
health misinformation in social media (e.g., up to 2019) by Suarez-Lido and Alvarez-Galvez identified that
Twitter was the predominant platform, with the research identifying the following topics (in order of
dominance): vaccines, drugs or smoking, noncommunicable diseases, pandemics, eating disorders, and
medical treatments. Medline suggests that social media users follow similar questions about the accuracy of
health information online, and, when in doubt, that they don't share the information.

Assessing individual health e-literacy

A number of tools are available to help assess an individual's e-health literacy; indeed, a recent search
identified more than 200 measures. A resource for identifying tools is at https://healthliteracy.bu.edu/.
Health literacy domains of competence range from communication, comprehension, and content knowledge
to information-seeking skills and numeracy. Many measures offer Likert scales (e.g., strongly disagree to
strongly agree), giving a quantitative number to items that can be summed, averaged, and viewed by
subcomponents. Sample items may include:

   I have the skills I need to evaluate the health resources I find on the Internet,
   I can tell high-quality health resources from low-quality health resources on the Internet, and
   I feel confident in using information from the Internet to make health decisions.

One example measure is the All Aspects of Health Literacy Scale (AAHLS ), which has 16 items, measures
application/function, and takes about 7 minutes to complete. For professionals designing sites (discussed in
more detail in the upcoming chapter on family professional application of technology in practice), this
health.gov site provides a useful checklist.

In the Families and Technology course, most students report using an app to track their finances or make
purchases. Far fewer maintain a budget, communicate with a professional, or seek information online.
Consider your parents or grandparents. Is their behavior using financial apps (or "fintech") different from
yours? Research suggests that there are clear age trends in online/tech-aided spending and shopping. Younger
generations (e.g., Millennials, Gen Z-ers) are more likely to use digital technologies, and their spending is
different as well. As indicated in this graphic from a report by the Medium, Millennials are more likely to
spend on events, experiences, and efficiencies than Gen Xers and Baby Boomers.
428 | 10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT

As Lombardo in The Medium observes, "It's not that Millennials care any less about appearing more
successful than previous generations, it's that the definition of success has changed. Whereas yesterday it was
measured in things, today it's measured in experiences."
Of the population born after 1996, Emily Pribanic says "Generation Z is a bunch of tech-savvy savers who
have all the information and resources they need at their fingertips." Compared with Millennials, Gen Z is less
likely to rack up student debt or carry a mortgage, and are more likely to save. They embrace technology for
person-to-person money transfers (like Venmo or PayPal) and are active information seekers in making sound
financial decisions. The tech-savvy nature of the generation -- assured to have grown up with ICT -- will
demand that banking is mobile, systems are cashless, and apps make financial management efficient.

Use of technology and money management

The growth of fintech, including personal financial management (PFM) technology, has gathered researchers'
interest about use, differences in use, and impact. Millennials (those born between 1980 and 1996), for
                                                         10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT | 429

example, have been studied for how their use of PFM takes the place of more traditional methods (e.g., going
to an ATM). PFM includes applications that focus on budgeting (like Mint), credit score monitoring, and
personal informatics, used to review balances and overdrafts and to make behavioral corrections to stay
financially balanced. It's acknowledged that Millennials have their share of financial considerations, paying off
student loans, acquiring stable jobs and income, paying rent (or returning to live with their parents), and
saving for retirement. And many don't feel knowledgeable about how to manage their money 2.

                                                                  Walsh and Lim (2020) indicated that PFM use led to

that PFM use didn't translate automatically to financial knowledge or skill. Overall, they point to the need to

include PFM in a system of financial education and management for Millennials, rather than see it as the

mechanism for change.

Cryptocurrency

As Ladrum notes, Millennials have demonstrated their industry by creating an alternative currency.
Investopedia defines cryptocurrency as:

      a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
      double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology -- a
      distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that

430 | 10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT

      they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government
      interference or manipulation.

Recent research by the Federal Reserve suggests that 12% of American adults use cryptocurrency (O'Sullivan,

2022 ). In a 2022 report from T. Rowe Price, 28% of their sample of U.S. adults included cryptocurrency in

their investment portfolio. The Federal Reserve report indicates that most of those who use bitcoin (one type

of cryptocurrency) do so as an investment; these users tend to have more education and income. A smaller

percentage uses it for transactions; these users tend to have less education and income and to be "unbanked"

(not having a bank account). It is valuable to keep an open mind and flexible attitude as we learn more about

cryptocurrency and its value, particularly given its recent entry into the financial market and for use by

families. As Hernandez (2019) writes, there is

cashless lifestyle

"From Cash To Digital" by FamZoo is licensed    Fintech has also revolutionized the ways families spend
under CC BY-SA 2.0.                             and share money. We are moving towards a cashless
                                                society and relying more on online shopping and delivery
                                                services for our groceries and household needs. We
                                                exchange money with others without it touching our
                                                hands. The shopping experience has radically changed.
                                                Age trends in online/tech-aided spending and shopping
                                                suggest generational differences in the likelihood of using
                                                digital technologies in shopping.

How many purchases do you make during a week using cash? When Pew asked this question in a 2015 survey,
24% of the respondents said none, while half (51%) said some. Each semester this question is put to students
in the Family and Technology course. In the spring of 2021, 56% of students said none. While the
composition of the sample in the Pew study didn't match those of an undergraduate course, we still see the
pattern of change over five or so years, with an increasing number of people reporting that they never use
cash.
                                                         10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT | 431

Paying without cash is certainly not a recent innovation. Credit for purchase transactions dates back hundreds
of years, and electronic credit cards were introduced in the 1960s. Decades of credit card use allow research on
consumer behavior, and research shows that not using physical cash for transactions ("friction-free
spending") leads to overspending (Schwartz, 2016). ApplePay was introduced in 2014, enabling consumers to
load bank information on their phones and make purchases without using a physical credit card.
Use of money-sharing applications like Venmo, Zelle, and CashApp is also growing. Research from Pew in
2022 indicates that about 57% of Americans use PayPal, while approximately 1/4 to 1/3 use other apps. There
are clearly demographic differences in use, with older adults less likely to find them necessary, safe, or easy to
use, as seen in the figure (Anderson, 2022).
432 | 10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT

The future of purchasing may include biometrics such as fingerprint sensors. As research develops on these
newer forms of a cashless lifestyle, experts believe that the temptation for overspending will only increase.

Online shopping

How often do you shop online? Have your online
shopping patterns changed since COVID-19? In 2015,
research by Pew indicated that 79% of people shopped
online, with 15% saying they shopped online weekly.
Greater frequencies were reported for less frequent
shopping: 28% said a couple of times a month, 37% said
about once a month, and 20% reported never shopping
online. In recent years, however, shopping online has
become more popular, particularly as more shoppers
come from younger generations who are more tech-savvy CC2.0 by MarcoVerch
(e.g., GenZ). During COVID-19, 32% of adults
purchased food online from a restaurant, with those age 18-23 years reporting the greatest frequency (53%;
Vogels, 2020). Shopping online is apparently driven by hedonistic, normative, and utilitarian motivations
(Koch et al., 2020), and during COVID-19, hedonistic motivations for online shopping increased (Koch et
al., 2020). This isn't terribly surprising, given the isolation and lack of social contact that occurred during the
pandemic.

                                                          purchases. This can mean the closing of small

establishments, with impacts on investors in brick-and-mortar businesses, on workers, and on land values.

Balls estimates that delivery costs will increase or be passed along through wage and benefits cuts to drivers,

and that additional vans for delivery will negatively impact the environment through carbon emissions. And

then, of course, the more business we give to online sellers, the more sharing there is of our personal data and

our credit card and bank information.

Technology as a financial consideration in household
spending

Household spending estimates frequently don't include

technology costs. This article, written as late as 2021,

includes a range of household items, and technology isn't

mentioned, even under "miscellaneous." This is

surprising given our use of personal computers in the

1980s, the introduction of peripherals for those devices,

and then the advent of cell phones, smartphones, and

wireless technologies in the new millennium. National

surveyors have taken notice of the ways in which overall

household budgets have been consumed by technology

How much do you spend per month and per year on these items? Consider what you'd pay for those items
you may get free, perhaps from what someone else pays for (e.g., wifi covered by the University for your
dormitory and classrooms) or for what you "bootleg" (e.g., your parents' Hulu account). A Learning Activity
for this chapter encourages you to keep track of your technology expenses. They can add up, and be a
significant portion of your budget. According to Pew, (McClain et al., 2021), nearly half of broadband users
in low-income households say they worry some or a lot about being able to pay for their high-speed internet.
Not surprisingly, those with higher incomes worry less.

Financial e-literacy

As with learning about health, digital apps and online resources are valuable for gaining and exchanging
financial knowledge and skills. For example, a study by Moor and Kanji (2019) explored women's
conversations about money on an online site called Mumsnet. They determined that women use the
discussion to clarify social norms about money and relationships, to develop communication skills specific to
money through interacting with other women online, and to learn about resource allocation. As discussions
about money are a key challenge in many marriages and relationships, finding support from others on how to
communicate within a relationship is incredibly valuable.

Yet, as with health information, families need to be wary about the accuracy of information about spending,
saving, and investing shared by those online. Social media influencers, bloggers, and web-based scams can
promote information that is misleading and possibly dangerous. One recommendation is to ask -- again, as
one might with health information -- who is the source? Is the information credible? Resources such as
factcheck.org can be useful as well.

                                          (Serido & Deenanath, 2016; Yeung et al., 2002). A recent
                                          report by T. Rowe Price (2022) indicates that parents are
                                          the dominant source of trusted information about
                                          money; social media ranks second, with 40% of children
                                          11-14 reporting this source.

                                          Experts recommend that parents instill a habit of saving,

Segment their allowance. CC2.0 by TrentD  create opportunities to earn money, help children make
                                          smart financial decisions, show them the value of giving,

and guide them in the ways their money can grow (Huddleston, 2020). As with other behaviors, a parent's

own financial literacy is greatly shaped by experience, culture, and context, and personal perceptions about

money (Britt, 2016). And as Chowdry (2019) observes, generational differences in experiences and

perceptions of how money is used and understood relative to the digital world can be barriers to parents'

choosing and interacting with their children around technology. Yet children are developmentally capable of

learning about the basics of savings at a relatively young age (e.g., 5 years). And while families vary greatly in

the ways in which they teach children about money (Britt, 2016; Morris, 2021; Serido & Deenanath, 2017),

new fintech tools offer promising mechanisms for a cashless, virtual financial world.

Credit/debit cards for children

"Smart" debit cards are attached to an app that allows parents to control the amount of money in the
account, and children can use a physical card to make purchases. This makes it easier for parents and children
to monitor the amount of money spent, and removes the need for small amounts of cash. For example, if a
parent gives their child money for a chore or a weekly allowance, the smart card can be filled. Some apps are
designed to be interactive and enable children to dictate different uses of the money, under the traditional
save/spend/share. Apps may be designed around doing chores, setting time or date goals for earning and
saving, and vary by level of parental control. Scholars appear positive about the use of these applications, as
they represent the worlds that children are growing up in and toward, though some raise concerns that app-
to-app communication removes the personal interaction that is meaningful for family communication and
deeper learning (Carrns, 2018, NYT).
436 | 10.1 TECHNOLOGY USE IN FAMILY HEALTH AND MONEY MANAGEMENT

Apps and interactive sites to teach children about money

Financial experts recommend that parents find useful apps and online sites to help facilitate financial literacy
(Morris, 2021). Sites like The Mint (themint.org) and Practical Money Skills (practicalmoneyskills.org) offer
games for learning about saving, spending, earning, and giving, along with quizzes and calculator tools
(Keeley, 2022), while Biz Kids (bizkids.com; bizkids.com [YouTube]) is a TV series featuring teenagers. In
usability, learning, and content presentation, the sites consider the age of the child (the Mint, for example,
offers information for children, teens, and young adults) and includes other audiences (parents and
professionals; Chowdry, 2019). They are often available on platforms and with operating systems that
complement the range of devices used, and may be available in languages other than English. According to
their website, Practical Money Skills is available in 19 languages and 46 countries.

This chapter closes out our journey through the use of technology (ICT) by families, and what research to
date suggests as impacts of use (many impacts beyond the consumer), and the myriad variables that influence
those impacts. We now shift gears to examine the professionals who put this knowledge into their practice in
their work with families: therapists, social workers, family educators, and more. We'll discover that more than
a body of content knowledge, technology are tools for practice. And the great divide among practitioners may
exist in access to those tools and in the knowledge and comfort in using them effectively.

10.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

Online privacy check

Think your social media site is secure? Commonsense Media offers privacy evaluation of a number
of popular sites, along with advice for ensuring online privacy. Check out the page, explore the
questions asked in their site evaluations, look at the criteria for pass, warning, and fail ratings, and
review the criteria for security testing in categories that include data sharing, device safety, account
protection, device security, and software updates.
Then select several sites for evaluation. Type the name in the box "search for a privacy evaluation."
For example, https://privacy.commonsense.org/evaluation/Facebook. As of 2022, it was given a 55%
"warning" rating. Read about safety, security, privacy, compliance, and the other factors that this
rating is based on. When you apply this evaluation to Instagram, TikTok, or other sites (or games
that a family or child might play), what concerns might you have going forward? What might be
the "deal breaker" for you in choosing not to continue to use a particular site? Or does it not really
matter?

How far can it go? [data tracking and health information]

Threats to the provision of health care, including abortion services, go beyond the availability of
doctors and clinics. As this piece from Shira Ovide in the New York Times observes, data trackers
will identify the location of individuals crossing state lines, and where abortions and other health
care are being offered.
446 | 10.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Beyond awareness of this data tracking, what are the recourse for individual citizens' human rights
     to privacy, safety, confidentiality?

     Children and internet safety

     Play Reality Check, selecting at least one of the five missions? How might this game be helpful to a
     9-year-old child? What about to a 16-year-old, who has a better understanding of internet safety?

     Check your spending on technology

     In this activity you'll estimate the amount you spend on technology for a month and a year. Using
     this form, identify the amount of money you spend in each category. This is for you, so be honest
     and use as much flexibility as you need. The costs include:

           Monthly charges for phone data usage/plans, streaming services, and internet service
           Occasional charges for peripherals (e.g., cords, cases, rentals) and repairs
           Annual costs (e.g., service plans, warranties)
           Major costs (devices, annualized for the expected life; if you purchase a laptop for $1,000

             every 4 years, for example, your yearly cost would average $250.)
     Once you have the totals, do a sum for the year, and calculate the monthly average.

           Consider how this compares to the amount you spend in other categories. If you spend
             $2,000 a year on technology and $7,200 a year on rent, your technology costs are 28% of
                                                                                                                   10.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 447

        what you pay for rent. Consider your total yearly expenses, which might include tuition,
        lodging/rent, utilities, food, transportation, and clothing. What is the portion of your total
        expenses goes to technology use and access?
      Now consider this amount of money for technology use and access for a single parent with
        two children living at the poverty level of $21,960 per year. Her household budget will
        include child care for the two children (on average about $226/week or about $20,000).
        Consider the many ways in which she'll need to stretch her money; how would she pay for
        wireless access, a smartphone and data plan, and hardware? If you were in her situation,

     The chapter discussed the many ways in which social media, the internet, and applications can be
     beneficial to those dealing with or recovering from an illness, including eating disorders. On the

10.4 BLOG PROMPTS

In the chapter we've looked at financial education games for children, allowance and chore
management apps for families, and financial management apps (e.g., Venmo). We've also
considered the types of health-related questions parents might ask online. Return to those
activities, choose one (financial access or health information), and go online to identify at least
three different sources. Compare and contrast through the eyes of a parent, and discuss the merits
or challenges of selecting a site, app, game, or device.

Check out "10 Interactive financial websites that teach kids money management skills." Offer your
thoughts about one or more of the games or apps as a way for children to learn about money. If
you were a parent, would you select one or more of these for your child? Would it depend on the
child's age? What is your assessment of the game or app?

Finding information on health and using technology to manage finances are both commonplace for
families. Yet it can be hard to do. Information searches yield an overwhelming amount of
information, and navigating apps for tracking finances can feel scary when families hear about
security breaches. All of this is even harder when adults don't speak English, have a disability, or
live in highly stressful conditions (e.g., homelessness, abuse). As family professionals, how do we
advocate for the health and financial access through technology for everyone?

We've discussed spending on technology, and you've considered how much of your own budget is
spent on digital technology and the internet. Consider this for a family. How might spending on

   Chapter Insights

           For family professionals, technology skills and knowledge are critical competencies in the
             21st-century workforce.

           Digital citizenship straddles is both a content area for family professionals, and something
             that must be integrated into practice for ethical and effective delivery of care and services.

           Family professionals' integration of technology is dependent on attitudes toward technology
             use, attitudes that are based on models such as Davis' (1989) that frame use as related to
             intention, acceptance and attitude, and perceived ease of use and usefulness. Research with
             family educators validates this framework and identifies workplace conditions as directly and
             indirectly related to attitudes.

           Individuals' technological comfort and competence benefit from training that occurs in
             professional preparation programs and in continuing education. Preparation is often shaped
             by professional standards of practice inclusive of technology use. Professional standards are
             present in licenses (e.g., teachers, therapists) and certifications or credentials (e.g., Certified
             Family Life Educator).

           Family therapists can be guided by organizations such as
                   the American Counseling Association and
456 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

                   the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapists, which have standards for
                      ethics, client safety, and confidentiality.

           Family educators can be guided by standards of technology integration

                   for educators in formal settings (such as the International Society for Technology in
                      Education, iste.org) or licensing standards set for teachers at the state level.

                   standards collaboratively constructed by professional associations, including the
                      National Council on Family Relations, the National Parenting Educators Network, and
                      the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences

           The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted family professionals' comfort, use, and innovation
             in using technology to deliver programming to families. Research with family educators, for
             example, indicates that tremendous accommodations and innovations were embraced to
             address the far-ranging needs and preferences of families and children. Supportive resources
             for professionals greatly facilitate comfort and skill, and address educators' own feelings of
             isolation and being overwhelmed.

           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Family Professionals

So far, this book has primarily focused on the ways in which families use technology in their lives; the impacts
of technology on relationships, human development, and family life; and the research and policy that guides
our understanding. But what of the professionals who work with families? In many ways, they are the ones
who translate what we know about technology to family members so that the information is useful and
meaningful.

traditionally considered "family-first," including clergy, psychologists, teachers, academics, researchers, and

children directly in some way, service that may include integrating technology in ways that help enhance

individual and family life.

Given family members' use of technology for acquiring information, sharing content, and supporting

individual and shared goals, ICT offers an obvious avenue for professionals to reach wider audiences and new

methods for effective delivery. Family professionals

for online environments, and trying out innovations amidst fears around privacy and comfort. The pandemic
pushed family professionals further into a phenomenon now present in their practice.

In short, technology use is not a "one-off" topic for family professionals. It is a new reality of family life and
for family professionals that requires considerable understanding and critical perspective for professionals'
effectiveness with families and their comfort, skill, and competence in engaging effectively and ethically in
practice.

This chapter focuses on how family professionals use technology in their work, and on avenues to
professional development regarding technology. To that end, it also addresses the forces that promote quality
in technology use as an area of family professionals' work, and avenues that provide guidance and support. We
begin with a quick look at the intersections of types of family work, then look at the value of using technology
in family practice to see how technology can be applied in practice. Then we consider the skills and
competencies needed for family professionals in the 21st century, particularly as they relate to integrating
technology into practice. This means possessing digital citizenship skills, and the acquisition of these skills.
There are three primary avenues to professional development that promote and reinforce (or can act as
barriers) to development: pre-service preparation, continuing or professional development, and ongoing
workplace conditions. Each of these will be explored, with attention to professional standards and current
research. The chapter ends with recommendations on technology integration in family practice.

The Intersections of Family Practice

To best situate technology as both content and delivery in family practice, we begin with a scope of
competencies and areas of specialization. Myers-Walls et al. (2011) delineate the boundaries and intersections
of family practice across education, therapy, and service fields (see figure below). All dimensions embrace
family systems theory, include an ecological context, are sensitive to diversity, follow research-based practice,
and hold to professional values. Differences occur in practice specificity -- for example, in family education
the focus is education and prevention, with an emphasis on normal, healthy functioning. Family therapy
features therapeutic intervention, assessment and diagnosis, and psychotherapy. Family Case Management
involves family advocacy, meeting family needs and coordinating services. As demonstrated in the figure, each
element has overlap with the others. For example, family life education and family therapy intersect through
the life course perspective, and encouraging interpersonal relationship skills. Family life education and family
case management intersect through family policy (and a solution focus) and in family resource management.
All domains intersect through an adherence to family systems theory, and the ecological context, a sensitivity
to diversity and marginalized populations, reliance on research-based practice, and values and ethics (if this
feels familiar these too are the foundations to this book).

Family Therapy

In family therapy, intervention is therapeutic and may include psychotherapy. The focus of the therapist's
work is short-term and solution-focused. According to the AAMFT website, Marriage or Couple and Family
Therapists (MFTs)

      are mental health professionals trained in psychotherapy and family systems, and licensed to diagnose and treat
      mental and emotional disorders within the context of marriage, couples, and family systems.... They evaluate
      and treat mental and emotional disorders, and other health and behavioral problems, and address a wide array
      of relationship issues within the context of the family system. Marriage and family therapists broaden the
      traditional emphasis on the individual to attend to the nature and role of individuals in primary relationship
      networks such as marriage and the family. MFTs take a holistic perspective to health care; they are concerned
      with the overall, long-term well-being of individuals and their families.

These therapists graduate from accredited post-graduate preparation programs, and are licensed by the states
in which they work. The American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT.org) provides
credentialing standards for programs of higher education that ensure quality and ethics in supervision and
460 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

training. MFTs may work in a wide range of settings as well, including private practice, government agencies,
and nonprofit mental/health organizations, and in research and teaching,

Family Case Management/Family Service

In family case management, the focus is on meeting family needs, family advocacy, and coordination of
services. Case management is a component of most licensed social workers' practice (according to the
NASW), and is a specific role adopted by those in the field. According to the NASW:

      With its strengths-based, person-in-environment perspective, the social work profession is well trained to
      develop and improve support systems (including service delivery systems, resources, opportunities, and
      naturally occurring social supports) that advance the well-being of individuals, families, and communities.
      Furthermore, social workers have long recognized that the therapeutic relationship between the practitioner
      and the client plays an integral role in case management. (p. 8)

       As you consider these different areas of specialization, what do you see as potential differences
       in technology for program delivery or technology as a content focus? Others in the social work
       profession serve in a variety of roles, including working as clinical social workers, with
       therapeutic practice similar to that of psychologists and marriage and family therapists. As with
       other family professions listed above, social workers who work with families are licensed by the
       state in which they work and receive bachelor's and graduate degrees from accredited
       institutions. For more information about the range of practice, training, and certification of
       social workers, see https://www.socialworkers.org/Practice/Practice-Standards-Guidelines.

The Use and Value of Technology in the Delivery of
Family Practice

New technologies and digital media can be integrated in family practice for outreach, evaluation, and
assessment of learning; to foster discussion for sharing information and perspectives; in the delivery of
content; and to facilitate social connections beyond face-to-face meetings (e.g, Blum, 2021; Breitenstein et al.,
2014; Darling et al., 2020; Taylor & Robila, 2018; Walker, 2020). This can reduce the cost of program
delivery and reach larger numbers of people without sacrificing effectiveness or participant satisfaction (Jones
et al., 2014; Kumpfer et al., 2015). And it can mean tailoring to specific audience needs. Technology design
addresses the wide-ranging and complex needs of contemporary families (e.g., Alford et al., 2019, addressing
                                              11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS | 461

and learning inside the classroom and out (Haythornthwaite & Andrews, 2011; UNICEF, 2017).

technology use in social work practice and examine

contemporary challenges to integration. In the 1980s, clinical practice involved one-way mirrors with clients

to allow for interdisciplinary and team participation in assessment and training. Later in that decade, social

work services on the internet emerged as online self-help support groups. By the 1990s, groups of clinicians

offered online counseling services to the public using secure websites. Today, social work services include a

much wider range of digital and electronic options. These allow social workers to engage clients through

email, texting, or video teleconferencing using web cameras. Social workers who refuse to acknowledge

technology as a practice trend risk falling out of step.

Piercy et al. (2015) identified a variety of ways in which marriage and family therapists used technology in
practice. Interview research with 63 practicing therapists (18 male and 45 female) showed that technology
related to business management (e.g., outreach, marketing, administrative services), assessment of clients,
psychoeducation, direct treatment, the offering of self-help resources, and accountability. Face-to-face therapy
was enhanced through the use of media, instructional videos, and psychoeducation materials. Therapists
indicated that some clients were better able to communicate with technology, given their experiences of social
anxiety.

Online educational and intervention programs

Evidence-based parenting programs and other face-to-face, short-term programs have been adapted to
electronic delivery, including electronic text, audio, video, and interactive components delivered via the
internet, DVD, or CD-ROM. Early evidence indicated promise for time efficiency (cutting down on travel
462 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

cost, implementation), participant completion, maximizing intervention fidelity, and sustainability
(Breitenstein et al., 2014).

Nieuwbower et al.'s (2013) meta-analysis of 12 studies of internet-based parenting education applications
found short-term benefits to knowledge and attitudes. Their study included programs of 2-15 sessions, with
professional and in some cases peer support, deploying novel applications, including instruction by animated
characters, remote coaching, progress monitoring, and video vignettes. Spencer et al.'s (2020) meta-analysis of
28 published studies, and Corralejo and Rodriguez's (2018) and Hall and Bierman's (2015) analysis of
technology-adapted parenting education programs, observed the inconsistency in results and scope of the
evaluations, from those indicating feasibility and a high degree of satisfaction with parents and/or staff, to
those with more rigorous evaluations that demonstrated impacts on short-term outcomes in parenting,
parent confidence, or child behavior. The majority of the studies focused on interventions for parents of
young children. Spencer et al.'s analysis, for example, identified only 3 of 28 programs for parents of children
12 or older. And Corralegjo and Rodriguez (2018) observed the need for more research and applications
offered in non-English languages. Researchers also observe the need to attend to participation, as rates of
attrition seem high with online-only applications.

Spencer et al, 2020), hybridizing online delivery with person-to-person contact (Day & Sanders, 2018), and

an online component to complement face-to-face delivery (Love et al., 2016; Walker, 2017). Some of this

research is discussed below.

Triple P parenting has adopted its EBP intervention program to technological interfaces with a television
series, an online version (Turner & Sanders, 2011), and recorded podcasts (Morawska et al., 2014), all
demonstrating short-term effects greater than those in control samples. Day and Sanders (2018) examined
clinical outcomes, program engagement, and satisfaction in a random control trial of the online Triple P
parenting program, the online program with telephone consultation by a trained practitioner, and no
treatment. The supplemented online component revealed greater benefits in reducing overall negative
parenting and frequency of child behavior problems. Participants reported greater satisfaction with the

program and showed higher rates of module completion than did either the online-only group or the no-
treatment group.

                                  online parenting education can be designed to be

user-friendly and to integrate learning design principles (Hughes et al., 2012), including social interaction and

direct connection to the practitioner may provide social capital and learning benefits that exceed the value of

self-directed learning alone. Deploying mixed methodologies that include a social component may be key to

reaching diverse audiences.

Social components can be added to online applications that complement face-to-face parenting education.
When the Triple P Parenting program incorporated social media and gaming features (e.g., badges as
incentives to participation) in outreach with a highly vulnerable population, outcomes for reducing child
behavioral problems, permissive or over-reactive parenting, and parental stress were improved (Love et al.,
2016). Respondents appreciated the flexibility, anonymity, and shared aspect of the online community. And a
web platform for ECFE parents (Parentopia, introduced in the About the Author page) and staff to connect
between classes (or to act as a supplement when parents couldn't attend face-to-face) proved effective at
strengthening social connections and a sense of identity in program affiliation (Walker, 2020). A key was in
participatory design of the technology to align with program community orientations, values for parent
inclusivity in language and access, and repeated usability testing to make the platform user-friendly (Walker,
2017).

and includes many variables to consider in effective
deployment.

While research on the design of technology-enriched or online delivery of parenting education is still in its
infancy, lying in wait is research on the implementation of these systems for effective and sustained delivery.
Forgatch et al. (2013) observed the implementation process of the Parent Management Training Oregon
model (PMTO) with community service systems and the search for fidelity in program implementation.
They identified a two-system (adopting community and program developer) and four-stage (preparation,
early adoption, implementation, sustainability) model that characterizes the many considerations. The
PMTO scholars also note the benefits of using technology in program implementation and fidelity. A
centralized database incorporating video intervention sessions permitted reliability checks of raters, and a
centralized website enabled program leaders to fine-tune implementation and oversight of facilitators'
competence. As the PMTO model has been replicated in multiple states and countries (including Iceland,
Norway, and Mexico), online data management enables efficient implementation on a global scale. Even so,
the authors raise a number of questions about policy and practice that reveal the added complexity of using
ICT in program implementation.

                                    interpersonal skills over routine and manual tasks, and

as noted in Chapter 9, there will be growth in on-demand employment. The NAS also called for

multidisciplinary research and improved tracking of the workforce and of technology development.

More recently, the Pew Internet and American Life project interviewed 90+ leaders about the future and
about employment skills relative to technology. There was agreement that work would be more flexible and
less bounded by time or place, and would require workers to have adaptable skills.

Related to family professionals, in 2016 Nicholas Long offered these predictions for practitioners
of parenting education:

    1. There will be an increase in studies that examine how provider knowledge, training, and
        skills impact the effectiveness of different parenting education services.

   2. There will be an increased focus on identifying core competencies as well as ethical
        guidelines for parenting educators.

   3. There will be a growing interest in certifying those who provide parenting education
466 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

                services (beyond program-specific certification).
           4. There will be a greater focus on how to most effectively train and supervise providers of

                parenting education services.

And the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) highlighted technological skills as
a necessary component of workplace skills in the "employability skills framework" for the 21st century, as
complementary to applied knowledge and effective relationship skills.

 http://www.aafcs.org/credentialing-center/pre-pac/assessment-alignment

As indicated above, media and technology skills are also recognized by the AAFCS as key competencies, along
with learning and innovation skills and life and career skills.
In writing about the application of technology to family therapy, Piercy et al. (2015) observe shifts in human
behavior and the perception of meaning through both symbolic interaction and social constructivist lenses.
Social constructionism believes meanings are transitory and developed through interaction and social
agreement. When couples use digital technology, they are creating relationship through online interaction
and, even more, are constructing couple identities, expressing themselves as couples, and negotiating the
meaning that technology offers to their relationships. The authors also note that, while cyberspace can
enhance perceptions of and opportunities for intimacy, it can also reflect deception and fraud. Examples
abound of being "ghosted" or "cyberstalked," and of personal information being used without permission.
From such interactions, individuals interpret and make meaning, creating symbolic worlds that can shape
behavior. Couples come into therapy having constructed a narrative of themselves through these online
interactions -- narratives and self-identities which therapists must accommodate. Piercy et al. (2015) hold
that it is essential that therapists are aware of the force online interactions can hold for relationships and
intimacy. And Blum (2021), who has used TikTok as a medium for relationship and therapy education, warns
that users may disregard boundaries and perceive that a therapist's presence online is an invitation to begin
1:1 therapy.
468 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

As educators such as Mike Ribble observe, being a good digital citizen is a requirement for us all, as
information technologies are now a part of our daily life. This means having the knowledge to use technology
intentionally, and in ways that ensure safety along with effective use. To that end, we require not just digital
skills, but a full understanding of information technology as it can impact human life. We need to possess the
qualities and knowledge of a good digital citizen. Family professionals assist couples, parents, and families in
using media in healthy ways, and understand areas of potential conflict that family members can resolve
together.

Digital citizenship

To begin a discussion of technology skills, knowledge,
and comfort for family professionals (Godfrey, 2016) is
to center on the Elements of Digital Citizenship (Ribble,
2015). These provide broad categories of consideration
for safe and effective use of the internet and of
information and communications technologies:

 Digital access: full electronic participation in

society

 Digital commerce: electronic buying and selling of       "265-365 (Year 7)Digital citizenship" by 
   goods                                                   Georgie R is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0.

 Digital communication: electronic exchange of

information

 Digital literacy: basics of technology and its use

 Digital etiquette: electronic standards of conduct

 Digital law: electronic responsibility for actions and deeds

 Digital rights and responsibilities: freedoms extended to all in a digital world

 Digital health and wellness: physical and psychological well-being

 Digital security: electronic precautions to guarantee safety

Further clarification of these elements can be found in Godfrey's article (p.19), and in these scenarios created
for teachers.
                                    11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS | 469

Digital citizenship strands have been simplified into four
dimensions, along with what the Dig Cit Doctors call "enduring
understandings:"

Digital Citizens keep themselves and each other safe.
Enduring Understandings:

    1. Laws, rules, and social norms govern digital spaces.
   2. Digital identities, data, and online activities are commodities.
   3. Individuals and organizations may misrepresent themselves online.
Media Information and Literacy
Digital Citizens responsibly consume, create, and share digital content.
Enduring Understandings:

    1. Effective search strategies help individuals locate information online.
   2. Digital information varies in value, quality, and reliability.
   3. Media influences individual perceptions and societal actions.
   4. Technology can be used to express and amplify ideas.
Digital well-being
Digital Citizens prioritize their digital well-being and the well-being of others.
Enduring Understandings:

    1. Self-awareness and the use of intentional strategies can support a healthy digital diet.
   2. Online personas are constructed reflections of an individual's identity.
   3. Technology may play a role in both advancing and impeding human connection.
Social Responsibility
Digital Citizens are socially conscious and empowered to influence change.
Enduring Understandings:

    1. Digital citizens have a collective responsibility for the ethical design, use, and regulation
        of new technologies.

   2. Technology is a powerful vehicle for civic engagement.
470 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

           3. Technology both highlights and perpetuates social inequities.

Framework for teaching digital citizenship

Family educators -- whether teaching in formal settings, such as higher education or secondary schools, or in
non-formal settings in work with parents -- can teach elements of digital citizenship. Ongoing shifts in
technology device availability and in applications used in formal education, informal learning, and social
worlds (e.g., TikTok, Schoology) mean that parents need to stay current for active engagement, anticipate
challenges, identify probable hacks, and provide guidance. Parenting education can acquaint caregivers with
relevant information on children's developmental domains and age stages to help parents understand what
children are capable of and responsible for as they navigate their presence online, face potential threats, and
reap creative and collaborative rewards.

                                                      Parents are curious about how to know when

Educators can assist parents and                      children are ready for smartphones, how much screen
families with vetting the quality of                  time is healthy, preventing threats to privacy and
material when choosing what to                        safety, and preventing cyberbullying. And parents
read.                                                 vary in their ability to discern differences in online
                                                      information and in skills that relate to education and

                                                      literacy. As parents use technology in their roles as

parents -- texting and video calls to communicate with children and to reassure and coach their children

through challenges, learning alongside children with education technologies, and sharing the joy of gaming --

parenting education can help promote the value and use of these new media and possibly create new rules for

parent-child communication. Finally, parents may need help navigating these spaces, as they too can be

subject to social comparison, bullying, and overuse.

When new technologies and workplace policies mean the navigation of flexible work, home, and space
boundaries, family professionals can help working parents acquire "digital cultural capital." This isn't an
exhaustive list of topics that can be covered by family educators, but indicates some of the many elements of
parenting and family life that naturally integrate technology.
                                              11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS | 471

       Ribble (2015) offered a four-stage reflection framework for teaching digital citizenship that can
       be applied to traditional, formal classroom instruction and non-formal learning opportunities for
       parents and families:

            1. Being aware of technology use and its appropriate use. Students are asked to reflect on
                their technology use at home and at school.

           2. Guided practice.
           3. Modeling and demonstrating. Teachers as well as adults need to practice good digital

                citizenship habits in their own lives.
           4. Feedback and analysis. It is important to have a classroom environment where students

                feel comfortable in discussing how they use technology at home and at school.

Family Professionals and Competency Standards
Indicative of Technology Skills and Knowledge

Each of the family professional speciality areas have competency standards that guide preparation and
practice; within these lie opportunities to integrate technology as both a knowledge and skill area for
professionals. Competency standards are used to inform state and national licensing, as well as credential and
accreditation requirements, in turn informing the creation and selection of curricula offered in higher
education programs of professional preparation. They are also used to inform professional development
opportunities, conference themes, and training. And professional standards inform job descriptions and
requirements used by employers of family professionals. In short, these standards hold tremendous
importance in shaping practice direction and innovation.

Family Education

The National Parenting Education Network (NPEN) framework on the competencies of parenting educators
finds content knowledge bridging both parenting and human development, along with knowledge of the
practice of parenting education (figure below). Competencies also include requisite skills to practice and
deliver parenting education. These include:

   Foundations of parenting education
472 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

   Adult learning and education
   Educational methodology/instructional design
   Working with parents in groups
   Working individually with parents and family (home visits, one-on-one instruction, consultation,

      coaching)
   Assessment and evaluation
   Relationships and communication with parents and families
   Professional behavior and development

https://npen.org/Professional-Parenting-Educator-Competencies (used with permission)

At the center of the competencies are the educator's attitudes and dispositions (Wadlington & Wadlington,
2011). These include professional conduct (e.g., accepts responsibilities), professional qualities (e.g.,
demonstrates a commitment to the individual student), and communication and collaboration (e.g., displays
                                              11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS | 473

sensitivity in interacting with others, UMN, 2017). And all dimensions are informed by ongoing
developments in research and theory. For those who practice family life education, working as family and
consumer sciences teachers, financial or nutrition educators, or in other family-related specialities, guidelines
for practice with technology can be found by professional bodies that promote quality teaching and support
teachers.

Technology standards in formal teacher preparation

State teacher licensing includes standards for teaching with technology. In Minnesota, where all teachers must
demonstrate competency in teaching standards and in content related to their content area license (e.g.,
science education, preK-grade 3, parenting and family education), teaching standards include a specific
section related to technology competence, with the following elements:

   Technology-enriched learning environments
   Diverse learning
   Assessment
   Discrimination
   Technological knowledge
   Digital citizenship
   Contribution to the teaching profession
   Broadening student knowledge about technology
   Variety of technologies

Competency 2H, for example, reads "demonstrate knowledge and understanding of concepts related to
technology and student learning;" Competency 3R reads "identify and apply technology resources to enable
and empower learners with diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and abilities." And 9M reads "understand
the role of continuous development in technology knowledge and skills representative of technology
applications for education." These standards are created with guidance from professional bodies for teacher
development, some of which specialize in technology. The Council for the Accreditation of Educator
Preparation (CAEP) covers the following technology themes within their seven standards areas:

   Student learning
   Clinical practice
   Technology integration

PK-12 instructor standards groups, including the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)
474 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

(https://www.iste.org/standards) and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium
(InTASC), identify more specific technological themes:

   Modeling (ISTE)
   Real-world issues (ISTE, InTASC)
   Reflective learning (ISTE)
   Communication (ISTE, InTASC)
   Global awareness (ISTE)
   Leadership (ISTE)
   Research / Professional practice (ISTE, InTASC)
   Technology integration (InTASC)
   Professional engagement (InTASC).

Formal education technology theory, research, and practice, inclusive of teacher preparation, has much to
offer family education as a basis for how to understand, integrate, and study technology integration and
educator support. The TPaCK framework, for example, identifies the intersection of using specific
technologies (T) to enhance pedagogical practice (P) and enrich content knowledge (CK) delivery (Mishra
and Kohler, 2006; figure below). Other models promote technology selection to align with learner activity
levels (passive to active) and desired instructional outcomes of Replace, Augment, Transform (e.g., PICRAT,
Kimmons, 2012), or translate particular technology use aligned with traditional learning theories or
frameworks, such as Bloom's taxonomy (Churches, 2010).

     Reproduced by permission of the publisher,  2012 by tpack.org

Because many who practice family education are not working in formal settings or do not hold teaching
licenses, there are likely to be differences in practitioner preparation and oversight. Most definitely there are
differences in practice. Those who work in non-formal education often have adults (21-60+ years) as an
audience. The participants' attendance is for enrichment and is often voluntary, not for degree acquisition.
Therefore, learner motivations for attending are different. Learning needs are more experiential and problem-
focused. These adult learners find value in support and a feeling of community, as much as in knowledge and
skill acquisition.
476 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

Family education technology integration standards

Standards specific to family education technology integration that match the specificity and breadth of formal
classroom (e.g., K-12) teacher preparation do not exist. The American Association of Family and Consumer
Science (AAFCS) offers guidance that informs family and consumer science teachers and Extension
Educators focused on family and consumer science. Specific to family education, groups like the National
Council on Family Relations have standards for Certified Family Life Educators (CFLE). Certification
requires demonstration of competence in knowledge across nine content areas and in education
methodology. Although technology knowledge and skill is represented in these standards, it is more generally
addressed: https://www.ncfr.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/FLE-Content-and-Practice-
Guidelines-2014-objectives.pdf.

There are sub-specialties in parenting education informed by the National Parenting Education Network

(NPEN), in nutrition or health education informed by certification with the National Commission on

Health Education Credentialing, and in finance education informed by the Financial Educators Council.

Readers are encouraged to explore the specific standards set out by each body for specificity and inclusion of

technology knowledge and skill.

paraprofessional, professional, degreed, and licensed (MN) educators. While as a network they can offer

standards of practice that are inclusive of technology skill for delivery, and these may inform practice, they

don't dictate training or certification in ways that bodies such as those for social work and family therapy do,

as discussed below. Until there are more unified efforts toward both family educator standards of practice and

preparation, guidance and training on technology will continue to be fragmented and, sadly, dependent on

the individual or workplace. In a U.S. study of 722 parent and family educators, the majority (74%) indicated
"learning on my own" to a moderate or major extent as the training that prepared them to use technology
(Walker, 2019). Reports of training by professional development (50.6%) or in college (42.6%) were lower.
Only one-third reported needing technology training to maintain a professional credential, and nearly all of
these were licensed teachers.

Family Therapy

Couple and family therapists are guided in practice by

competencies set by associations such as the American

Counseling Association (ACA), the American

Association of Marriage and Family Therapists

(AAMFT), or the National Association of Social

Workers (NASW). The ACA's 2014 edition of ethical

standards was the first to include a discussion of social

media in practice in the section on Distance Counseling,

Teletherapy and Social Media (section H, pp 17-18).

The section speaks to informed consent and security,       Credit: EKATERINA BOLOVTSOVA

knowledge and legal considerations, distance counseling

relationships, client verification, records management and web maintenance, and the use of social media. The

AAMFT includes a section on technology-assisted services (section VI) in its ethical standards. As in the ACA

guidelines, this section covers delivering services through telehealth, informed consent, confidentiality,

documentation and the privacy of records, and professional responsibilities. In part, these guidelines concern

the delivery of services beyond traditional place-based therapy -- in other words, jurisdiction considerations

that cross state or country lines. They also identify the boundaries of professional identities -- when, for

instance, maintaining separate accounts as a professional and as a private citizen (e.g., virtual professional

presence).

Given research by Piercy et al. (2015) that indicates the range of ways in which technology is used by family
therapists, while it is very appropriate that professional associations address ethical concerns when using the
internet to delivery therapy, there are numerous skill sets needed to effectively deploy technology in practice.

Family Service and Social Work

In 2017, a collective of professional associations for social work -- the National Association of Social Work
(NASW), the Association for Social Work Boards (ASWB), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE),
and the Clinical Social Work Association (CSWA) -- created Standards for Technology in Social Work

Yet a middle ground for professional support on technology use lies in the everyday practice and context of
practitioners. Since 2010, the author has conducted research on technology use by parent and family
educators and on workplace conditions that influence technology acceptance. Repeatedly, whether sampling
educators in a single state and practice emphasis (e.g., parenting education in Minnesota, Walker & Hong,
2017) or nationwide with a diverse sample of 700+ educators representing multiple dimensions of family
education (Walker, 2019; Walker, et al., 2021), the findings validate workplace conditions as a significant

influence. Those perceiving higher workplace supports in infrastructure (e.g., encouragement) and resources
(e.g., access to devices, training) report more accepting attitudes toward technology and are more likely to use
a range of technologies.

The research model adopts Davis' (1989) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which stems from concepts
of behavioral intention (e.g., Ajzen, 1989). Technology attitudes accepting of innovation and information
and communications technologies drive the intention towards use, and the use of technology itself. Two
factors related to acceptance are PE -- perceived ease of use, and PU -- perceived usefulness. PU is influenced
by PE (this makes sense, since if we believe something is easy to use we are more likely to find it useful to our
purposes). Modifications of Davis' original model include consideration of external conditions, such as in
research of preservice teachers in Singapore by Teo et al. (2008).

                                   Validating this model to align with the conditions and

Examples included usefulness (e.g., "Using technology will improve my work"), and ease of use (e.g., "I find it

easy to get technology to do what I want it to do"). Workplace conditions were measured by a 12-item index

of workplace infrastructure (e.g., technology support, devices, including "A variety of hardware and software

is easily available for me to use in my program) and workplace encouragement (e.g., discussions about

technology, including "I often exchange ideas about technology use with other Parent Educators"). Our

analysis method used Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Path Modeling. As previously noted, from our

sample of 722 national family educators, technology attitudes were related directly to PE and PU. Workplace

encouragement and workplace infrastructure indirectly influenced acceptance attitudes as mediated by PU

and PE, respectively. Workplace encouragement also showed a small but direct influence on technology

acceptance.
482 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

Research like this provides support for examining the primary and often enduring context that shapes family
educators' practice and technology use, and for advocating for conditions conducive to innovation and
accommodation with new media. Yet the reality is that family educators are irregularly held to technology
standards in the workplace. While some mention the receipt of devices or training by their employers (also
highly variable, and far less likely for those who are self-employed or working with non-profits), few note that
use of technology is a performance standard for review or for hiring (Walker, 2019). Moreover, workplace
conditions of family and parenting educators vary even more greatly, with some workplaces offering
tangible encouragement (e.g., performance assessments) and support (e.g., training and technical support)
specific to technology use, while most others do not. Parenting educators, occasional family educators (e.g.,
teachers, counselors), and family life educators vary from those in higher education/administration, who have
more technology resources, report more positive attitudes, are more confident about their skills, and view
formal technology training as useful. These disparities indicate that those preparing family educators may not
have realistic ideas about workplace conditions, and are therefore not adequately preparing or filling the gaps
needed by practitioners. They also validate the sense that those working on the front lines with parents and
families face less supportive conditions, which weakens their ability in practice.

COVID-19 Impact on the Delivery of Family Practice
and Education; The Use of the Internet and
Information and Communications Technology

The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with the best evidence for advocating for family professionals'
knowledge and comfort with technology. The pandemic started while we were working to resolve tensions
around the use of technology in practice, the value of teaching online or delivering therapy at a distance
compared with face-to-face encounters, and the degree to which practitioners deploy new media in their
work. Schools, organizations, and businesses were shuttered, and the delivery of service relied on the internet
and on the ability of professionals to adapt.

Using her association with Early Childhood Family         Here is a short video about ECFE
Education in Minnesota, the author conducted research     (featuring the Bloomington, MN

spring of 2020, and again one year later. As COVID
began, educators were fearful, yet optimistic. They felt
that they could adapt their programming, yet knew that
they needed strong administrative support, including
technology resources. Primarily, they worried for
families -- that families would not be able to access

support are evident. These are quotes from educators                  ed-1
faced with adapting their programs for COVID:

      With so little planning time, and support for the
      technology available through the district, It really felt like
      the train left the station without [me].

At one moment, I would feel ineffective, as though I was
working in a vacuum, putting material for families out
into a void where it wasn't doing anyone any good. And I
felt selfish for wishing I would hear from families, knowing that they were likely stressed and overwhelmed. I
struggled to know that there was anything that I was doing -- to meet any real needs.

One year later, and with a sample representative of the whole state and distributed by parenting, early
childhood educators, and program coordinators (with some holding two or more roles), educators reported
on an amazing array of accommodations used to reach families at home during the pandemic. Smaller, more
rural programs could continue with reduced classes, face-to-face. All programs needed to deploy the internet
and technology applications for outreach, teaching, and assessment. More than 90% reported using email and
videoconferencing (e.g., Zoom); approximately half reported using technologies like social media, a school
website, a learning management system, texting programs like Remind, and YouTube.

During COVID-19, for example, parenting educators

in Minnesota moved group-based discussion and the                     Sensitivity to differences in

lowered expectations for attendance, and found other

creative ways to engage online (e.g., asynchronous

video posts, collaborative tools) and safe face-to-face methods for families to engage in smaller numbers. They

also addressed equity through the use of take-home learning packets provided by the district (at no cost to

parents), loaned tablets and wifi hotspots, and worked with districts to redistribute budgets to accommodate

parents with limited technology access.
484 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

Educators expressed pride at pulling together to offer flexible opportunities for learning for parents
and children and ways for family relationships to stay strong, along with sadness that more
resources weren't offered to help reach more families and that technology assistance was fair at best
(Walker et al., in press). Nearly one-fifth reported receiving no resources, and the majority indicated that their
own experiences and support from their peers were the best methods for learning how to use technology.
Being "thrown into the fire" of having to use technology did prove to be a good teacher and confidence
booster. When asked to compare their proficiency with technology at the beginning and end of the school
year, educator ratings (out of 10) changed from a mean of 4.98 to 7.84, a statistical difference significant at p
< .001. For many, the experience was mixed, with triumph in maintaining programs to meet families' needs,
and the reality of the challenges faced in making that happen. As one educator said:

      So many things! It was an honor to work with families. It was exciting, draining, and everything in between to
      be able to design, develop, and implement online ECFE classes. I was discouraged often, feeling like I was
      missing the mark, and then I'd rebound and realize that the work we were doing was potentially the most
      important of my career to date. At times I was lonely. And I feel intense gratitude for my EC colleague who
      hung in there and worked so hard for families.

Recommendations for the Future

To address the ICT needs of families means continuing research that translates to practice that fully assists
families with managing new digital realities. It also means that we do not assume that family professionals are
supported or prepared to integrate technology in their practice. We must identify necessary competencies and
standards that will drive preparation, professional development, and workplace conditions (Walker, 2016).
The figure below show practitioners who work with families on the issue of technology use as the center of
service delivery and as supported in their digital citizenship knowledge and skills by wider bodies of
professional development and oversight:
                                              11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS | 485

There are additional ways to lend support to professionals. Ttechnology integration, for example, can be
included in the higher education curriculum of family science, social science, education, and other applied
fields. The University of Minnesota course accompanying this book -- FSOS 3015 Families and Technology
-- is a way to stimulate critical perspectives on the many ways in which technology impacts children and
family life. Association professional development efforts can include technology integration as a topic area,
conference theme, podcast, or blog series. Online Community of Practices/Professional Learning
Communities can focus on technology integration to offer peer ideas and assistance. And agencies can work
individually or, as the NASW did, collaboratively to create standards for practice and advocate for their
inclusion in licensing or performance. Additional recommendations include the following:

 1. Family professionals are naturally situated to aid children and families with the growing
      responsibilities and challenges for decision-making and wise use of new media and interactions in a
      virtual world. This means seeing technology as both a content area in practice as well as a means
      for service and education delivery.

 2. Family professionals must feel comfortable and competent as digital educators and integrators.
      Therefore, they need professional standards that guide preparation and practice. Standards developed
      for classroom teachers and/or the helping professions (e.g., social work, NASW, 2017) may inform
      recommendations for the range of those who work with families.
486 | 11.1 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY PROFESSIONALS

 3. Research on technology integration in family practice is still in its early stages. Adapting and
      testing new ways to communicate, convey information to, assess, and encourage community with
      parents has yielded valuable information about the costs and benefits from instructor and learner
      perspectives.

 4. Industry can build on the expertise of family professionals in the design of apps and online
      platforms. This includes parenting apps, for example, that may build on algorithms to tailor advice to
      parents and also include the rich context of childrearing decisions and influences. Those creating
      financial education apps, or interactive platforms to teach children money management, can work with
      family professionals with expertise in this area.

We now move to our final chapter: integrating policy with family practice and research on technology use and
impacts.

     Professional standards related to technology integration

     Consider the field or specific profession you plan to pursue or are already working in. Identify the
     technology standards of practice that have been offered. These are often available from
     professional associations, such as the National Association of Social Workers (NASW.org), the
     American Association of Marriage and Family Therapists (aamft.org), or the National Parent
     Educators Network (npen.org). They may also be present in license requirements for the profession
     set forth by an individual state. As you review these standards, do you feel ready if you were to be
     given a test today? Where you would go to get the knowledge and skills required? Will they come
     from your personal experience? From your training in school? On the job? Through professional
     development? Based on your own knowledge and experience of technology use by our society and
     from what you know of the profession, are the standards sufficient? Are there ways you think they
     could be improved upon? Who or how would you advocate for these changes?

     Digital Citizenship application (1)

     Ribble proposes nine elements of digital citizenship, below (see also Godfrey, p. 19). For each,
     propose a scenario in which you would see the element applied to family professional work. It
     might be the integration of ethical principles in the delivery of practice, or it might be a content area
     that would be taught or presented in work with families. Here are some examples of digital
     citizenship scenarios as applied to elementary education.

           Digital access: full electronic participation in society
           Digital commerce: electronic buying and selling of goods
                                                                                                                   11.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 493

      Digital communication: electronic exchange of information
      Digital literacy: basics of technology and its use
      Digital etiquette: electronic standards of conduct
      Digital law: electronic responsibility for actions and deeds
      Digital rights and responsibilities: freedoms extended to all in a digital world
      Digital health and wellness: physical and psychological well-being
      Digital security: electronic precautions to guarantee safety

Digital citizenship application (2)

Create a digital citizenship lesson to present to parents. Choose the age group of children the
parents will have -- young children, middle childhood (elementary age), teenagers. Consider
whether the children or parents represent specific interests for learning and for technology use --
those with disabilities, those who represent a culture or speak and write in a non-English language,
those who may be migrants or immigrants or may be separated due to work or military service.
Identify the amount of time that you'd have with the parents (and children, if they are included as
learners) and the format for your lesson (in-person, online, hybrid). What content would you
deliver? What outcomes for learning would you want to achieve? How would you facilitate their
learning in ways that build on their own experience and interests?

Parenting educator technology competencies

With the Parenting Educator competency framework in mind (as discussed in the chapter),
consider the content and practice needs related to technology use that a parenting educator might
need. Consider the content of the book -- from our use as a society; to differences in families; use
by couples, children, and parents; in the workplace; for health and for money management.
Consider both the required knowledge about human development AND about parenting to deliver
494 | 11.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     your practice. What content related to technology might you need to know? What do you need to
     KNOW about families use of technology that will be integrated into your work? Now consider how
     you deliver education -- is it in person, in classes, online, through an app? Who is your audience?
     What do you need to be able to DO with technology to deliver your services effectively to families?
     Are there particular attitudes or dispositions that might be influenced by technology?

11.4 BLOG PROMPTS

Professionals who work with families use technology in their practice. With changes in our
interactions and information sharing in virtual environments, the use of mobile devices, and the
creation of applications we have yet to imagine, this use will become an even greater part of
ongoing professional development, practice, and institutional and field policy landscape. How do
family educators, scientists, service providers, therapists and counselors, program administrators,
and others keep up? Whose responsibility is it?

Consider your thoughts about the use of laptops and other electronic devices in college classrooms,
especially lecture classes, acknowledging the growing research indicating that note-taking is not
effective, students are distracted, and technologies can be distracting to others. Although there are
a number of reasons why policies might remain flexible, and devices used/encouraged, this doesn't
take away from our need to explore ways that technology, in context, truly supports learning and
instruction. As a college student, what does this mean to you? Do you bear responsibility for your
learning and, if so, how do you manage your technology use in classes in ways that promote your
learning and not a distraction? What expectations do you have for your university to offer you
learning environments AND professionals that support your success in integrating technology or
otherwise using it wisely? Do you see changes needed?

It can be asserted that family professionals who are on the front lines with families should model
and encourage digital citizenship. Or one could argue that this is not the job of a family professional,
that our work is about the content and practice of family life, not teaching about technology. What
do you believe?
496 | 11.4 BLOG PROMPTS

     Imagine that you work for an agency that provides education and resources for grandparents
     raising grandchildren. You feel that an app would help grandparents easily track the children's
     developmental milestones, doctor's appointments, school records, and other information. You've
     done some investigation, but find only apps that seem overly complicated and aimed more at
     biological parents. You learn that grant money is available from the Brookstone Foundation for the
     development of innovation for this population. The proposal requires that you indicate how you'd
     go about designing the app. What would you do to create a piece of technology that would be
     useful to these families?

     COVID-19 created the need for all family professionals to adapt the delivery of their services.
     Consider the three types of professionals discussed in this chapter: educators, therapists, and family
     service/case workers. Explore individual accounts of each type of professional. What similarities or
     differences in their experiences do you observe? What systemic, organizational, or public policy
     support might address their needs?

   Chapter Insights

           Policies involving the safe use of the internet, social media and digital devices have evolved
             over the last 30 years.

           While policies to keep children safe online are essential, they must not stand alone yet stand
             in complement to myriad other policies for children's health and well-being across the
             ecologies that influence their development.

           Areas of ICT policy include digital equity, digital privacy, platform accountability, digital ethics,
             digital competencies and digital culture.

           ICT policy exists on many levels, from the family, to nearby ecologies of schools and school
             districts, and public and private institutions, to policies affecting tech companies, and as set
             by governments and global non-governmental agencies including the United Nations.

           The policy development process applied to other matters can be used with technology, and is
502 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
USE

             a recursive process from understanding the agenda through policy implementation and
             evaluation.
           Taking a systemic view at policy in which it is integrated with ongoing research and practice
             with children and families is a way to shift the field of family science and practice. In that
             way, researchers are informed by the needs of practitioners and families, practitioners have a
             direct application to ongoing research and are supported by policies, and the policy level can
             monitor, synthesize and shape research in ways that move the needs of children, families and
             communities - and the professionals who serve them - forward.
           After reading this chapter, identify what you feel inspired by, the questions that remain for
             you, and the steps you can take for your own technology use to be more intentional.

Introduction

We complete our journey on technology and the family by addressing ways to implement positive change for
families through policy. The quotes above capture the spirit of social justice in policy, and the potential power
in coming together to identify strategy for the world. While public or social policy may seem to happen at the
widest level of our eco-systemic view of families, policy can realistically occur at any level. Wikipedia offers the
most general definition: "Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational
outcomes."

This definition works well as we consider that policy can               For an excellent overview of
dictate laws and regulations "for the good of the             family policy, readers are encouraged
people," yet can also guide the practices of a school         to watch Karen Bogenschneider's
district, company, or, smaller still, a household. It's       discussion: family_policy_lecture.
essential to include policy in our critical view of families
and technology because, as our understanding of its
benefits and consequences evolves with the speed of
innovation, we realize the need for guidance around
decision-making to "achieve rational outcomes" that
benefit all (or at least the majority).

Think of children's safety online. Nearly 30 years ago, guidance consisted mostly of advice to parents about
keeping children from exposure to predators in chat rooms. As a parent I vividly remember this in the 1990s
when my daughter was interested in playing computer games and encouraged by her friends to explore the
               12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
                                                                                                                                                         USE | 503

internet. But with the explosion of social media, data sharing and privacy violations (some by family
members), human trafficking, data tracking, and identity theft, policies and laws have been developed to
address what tech manufacturers can and can't do, specifically for children under 13 years (e.g., Child Online
Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA), what can and cannot be shared (e.g., Children's Internet Protection Act,
or CIPA), and how children's rights can be protected. A global conference in 2022 focused on data and age-
appropriate content in site design, digital literacy, and advocacy against child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
online.

In terms of policy, a focus on    It's also important that, as we talk about policy with
technology and the family should  regard to technology and the family, we don't lose site
be in the same conversation as a  of other policies valuable to the well-being of children
focus on the complex conditions   and families. Just as our use of technology for
that influence child and family   communications or for information gathering is used
well-being.                       in complement to other media and sources, policies
                                  that affect the well-being and safety of children and
                                  families act in complement to other policies. 1

In Chapter 5, for example, we discussed concerns over technology use by teens relative to their wider ecology,
observing that those demonstrating risks from technology are likely responding less to the platform or device
and more to their environment. Stressors of living in conditions that can affect physical and mental health will
only be exacerbated by negative influences from social media, violent videogames, or the lure of apps that
encourage endless attention. Technology use and access is part of the wider scope of policies that support
families. Technology-focused groups such as Commonsense Media also advocate for more global policy
affecting child well-being, and associations that may advocate for technology rights and protections include
these as a larger scope. See, for example, the American Psychological Association and the Society for Research
on Child Development.

Throughout the book, we've discussed policies regarding digital technologies and families. These have been a
blend of legal protections and guidance toward "rational outcomes," and many align with Commonsense
Media's resources for advocacy areas of Digital Equity, Digital Privacy, and Platform Accountability.

 Chapter 3: internet access through infrastructure supports worldwide
 Chapter 4: protections related to safety, trafficking, and tech-facilitated intimate partner biolence
 Chapters 5 & 7: child protection laws; developmental readiness for children's smartphone ownership;

1. This point has been made about other policy foci that don't address the full scope of the issue. For instance, Stephanie Murray in the Atlantic
  (2022). recently wrote about policies for childrens academic achievement that ignore parents' and family contributions to learning.

The discussion here focuses on elements of policy as it relates to technology use, evidence of policy that
occurs on many levels, and how policy intersects with the eco-system of personal technology use, research on
family use and outcomes, and community-level practice that influences family well-being.

Areas of Technology Policy

       In its 2017 report, Children in a Digital World (p.11), the United Nations offered six priority
       actions:

            1. Provide all children with affordable access to high-quality online resources.
           2. Protect children from harm online -- including abuse, exploitation, trafficking,

                cyberbullying, and exposure to unsuitable materials.
           3. Safeguard children's privacy and identities online.
           4. Teach digital literacy to keep children informed, engaged, and safe online.
           5. Leverage the power of the private sector to advance ethical standards and practice that

                protect and benefit children online.
           6. Put children at the center of digital policy.
               12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
                                                                                                                                                        USE | 505

       Livingstone and Blum-Ross (2020) offered further recommendations for support to
       parents' involvement in children's digital futures (pp. 191-194):

            1. Provide support for parents that encompasses the digital environment.
           2. Offer parents a realistic vision in public and media discourses.
           3. Recognize the contribution of parents in educational settings.
           4. Pay attention to the design and governance of the digital environment.
           5. Make room for parents' voices in policymaking.
           6. Make sure the policy, and the design of technology, is based on evidence.

We can add to these recommendations the myriad environments, actions, and competencies for professionals
outlined in the previous chapter, integrating technology in their content area knowledge and in their skills for
delivery.
Across this ecology, then, we see a variety and types of policy actions relevant to technology and family well-
being.

Digital equity

Digital equity focuses on reducing the digital/skills/access/information divides by ensuring greater access to
the internet, to devices that connect to the internet and for communication, and to the training and
accommodations needed so that all can use technology with the same level of comfort and skill.
Commonsense Media offers a state-by-state view of information on digital access. For Minnesota, for
example, it states that as of October, 2022,

      249,845 students and 6,379 teachers lack adequate internet access. Up to 162,607 students and 1,046 teachers
      are without the technology and devices at home to support distance learning. About 22% of the students who
      lack access are Black, Latinx, or Native American.

Digital equity policies include:

Making broadband internet accessible. Increasing internet access not only benefits individual households,
but improves family access to health care, education, and employment. One such program in the U.S. is the
506 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
USE

Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s Lifeline program. The FCC also makes funding available to
restore internet access after an emergency, and offers other internet access initiatives. And as noted in Chapter
3, global groups advocate for universal internet access -- though given public opposition and infrastructure
costs, this may be a significant challenge.

Training and material supports. Groups like the National Collaborative for Digital Equity have programs
that offer refurbished laptops, mentoring, assistance to libraries, and company incentives and youth
development programs. They include a database of digital equity resources that includes funding ideas,
information on early literacy on technology, and help for libraries.

Making digital applications and devices accessible to accommodate language, literacy, and ability.
The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) / Center of Development
Expertise for Accessibility Task Force defined digital accessibility as "the ability for a user to perceive,
understand, navigate, and interact with hardware, software, websites, and documents regardless of age and
ability." As indicated, this goes beyond ensuring access to ensuring that a device or the internet is usable and
navigable, taking into consideration the range of abilities individuals possess. An excellent example of policy
and procedures for full (employee) access comes from the Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities:
Digital Accessibility and Accommodations: Learner's Guide.

Digital privacy

The U.S. Department of Commerce defines digital                         "Slide_TechnologyGivesKidsPower" by William M
privacy as "the protection of personally identifiable                   Ferriter is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.
or business identifiable information that is collected
from respondents through information collection
activities or from other sources and that is
maintained by the [agency.]" 2 A number of federal
regulations are in place for digital privacy and safety,
particularly as they regard children. Digital privacy
is often scope of technology policies proposed and
enacted by companies, agencies, and schools for the
protection of its citizens. These are discussed below.

Federal actions to ensure children's digital safety

2. The Department of Commerce's digital privacy policy is stated here.
               12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
                                                                                                                                                         USE | 507

include the Child Internet Protection Act (CIPA) and the Childrens Online Privacy and Protection Act
(COPPA). The U.S. government's Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act ensures education about
online threats. Though non-specific to e-documents, FERPA (Family Education Records Protection Act) and
HIPAA (Health Information Portability and Accountability A`ct) protect the sharing of personal
information related to school records and health information, respectively.

Microanalytics offers a good overview of digital privacy, including specific threats such as cookies, phishing,
and unsecured browsing. At home, parents need to be aware of privacy protections on all devices, including
smart toys, smart homes, and virtual and augmented reality, and of advertisements targeted at children.

       As many schools moved to distance learning, Commonsense Media offered recommendations
       for families on digital privacy. These speak to safety and advocacy, and even lean toward
       suggesting family policy for digital privacy.

            1. Make privacy a family value. Commonsense Media has a number of resources to help
                your family better understand how to protect your privacy and why it's important,
                including an FAQ, advice articles, and classroom lessons on privacy and security.

           2. Be careful what you share online about your kids and their classmates. It's worth
                knowing the facts before posting pictures or letting other people post pictures of your
                kids. One important rule of thumb with distance learning: Don't post photos of your kid
                attending online class to your social media if their classmates are visible.

           3. Learn about parental controls to minimize distractions and data collection. You don't need
                to be an expert at managing technology to help your kid stay safe and focused online.
                Check with your school's technology department to find out what safeguards and filters
                are already in place and what additional parental controls you can set up.

           4. Know whether classes may be recorded or monitored. You should understand your
                school's policies regarding video-conferencing and classroom monitoring. It's useful to
                know how your kid's teacher will track student attendance or progress and what this
                means for their grades. And be sure that your kid -- no matter how old they are --
                knows the expectations for video-chatting in online classrooms.

           5. Learn more about your school's educational apps and platforms. Particularly now, schools
                have an important job in safeguarding student privacy. Parents and caregivers should get
                familiar with their school's tools, try to learn about the risks of the top distance learning
                apps, and ask the school directly how they are protecting kids

           6. Ask questions, and exercise your privacy rights. Remember that you have rights to access
508 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
USE

                your kid's education records and any information that apps collect from your kid under
                federal and state laws.

Platform accountability

Platform accountability policies hold websites -- and social media companies in particular -- responsible for
monitoring the content shared online that is offensive and stimulates hate crimes. One group fighting on this
issue is Stop Hate for Profit. In mid-September 2022 the White House held a summit on hate-fueled violence,
which included discussion of the spread through social media.

Digital ethics

Digital ethics policies address behavior on the internet and digital devices. While this is a broad area, and
includes privacy and safety actions, digital ethics covers issues beyond these specific elements. For example, in
Chapter 7 we discussed the case of a father who went online in a viral video to complain about the racist
bullying his daughter endured. As part of that rant he outed the father of the bullying children, including the
man's name (though stated that he'd informed the man ahead of time). While we can see this as an act of
desperation by a caring father, we might also question its ethics considering the consequences that befell the
bully's father in the 24-48 hours after the initial video was posted. Digital ethics often involves cases in which
there are unintended consequences. E-portfolios, for example, have become a popular and convenient way for
students and professionals to share their work. Yet as Wilson et al. (2018) discuss, too often individuals cited
in that work are exposed when permissions have not been secured. Reyman and Sparby's 2019 book on
Digital Ethics presents a number of related cases.

Digital competencies

As presented in the previous chapter, professions -- including the family professions -- identify standards of
excellence for their practitioners. These standards are translated into competencies, and university preparation
programs and programs overseeing licensure and other accreditation ensure that pre-professionals
demonstrate those competencies. The last twenty years have seen the addition of digital competencies in the
               12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
                                                                                                                                                        USE | 509

practice standards of professionals. These include the nine categories of Ribble's Digital Citizenship and
competence in ensuring that their practice is ethical, safe, protects clients, and effectively deploys the internet
and digital media as tools in the delivery of service.

Digital culture

While less specific the policies discussed above, policies that speak to a digital culture embrace the new world
of ICT as holding possibilities yet needing intention and shaping. When we examine the professional
competencies for professionals, such as those reviewed in Chapter 11 for social workers, we see a wholesale
adoption of a new way of working for practitioners.

Embracing this cultural shift means offering guidance     Consider your university or a place
through policy across all dimensions of practice, and     where you work as a setting for
ensuring that policies are worded to include an           shifting the culture to embrace
understanding of new virtual worlds, devices, means for   technology. What is the vision at the
communication and social interaction, and the need for    end of this shift? Who would be
re-training and joint decision making. Shifting           affected? How would the institution
environments to embrace the digital culture means         get there? What policies would be
collaborative, visionary, and informed planning, policy,  needed to create a digital-positive
implementation, and assessment.                           culture?

Outlets for Technology
Policy for Children and
Families

 In addition to specific laws enacted to protect children and others from invasions of privacy and harm, such

as COPPA, CIPA, FERPA, and HIPPA (fun saying them, isn't it? ) policies related to technology use can
be found from global to local levels.
510 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE

                                           United Nations

       The Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) Division for Inclusive Social
       Development (DISD) identified digital technology as one of four megatrends facing families (along
       with urbanization, migration, and climate change). In 2021, I prepared a report for the UN on digital
       technologies' impacts on the family, specific to parenting education and work and family balance, and
       recommended a number of policy actions specific to these two areas (and detailed in Chapters 11 and
       9, respectively).
The United Nations more broadly promotes Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that address a wide
range of issues facing the world's population.
Equity and access for families are key considerations
for SDG 3 (health care) and SDG 4 (education)
targets. As shown to the right, SDG4.4 deals with
ICT skills, with an indicator based on the
proportion of the population possessing those
skills. Fostering families' access to technology in
developing countries, including those in Africa with the least internet coverage, would help address SDG 9,
which promotes inclusive and sustainable industrialization. Similarly, ensuring wider and more equitable
access for global families will target the need for information for sustainable living (SDG 12).

National agencies and associations

Professional associations, including the American Psychological Association (APA), the American
Association of Marriage and Family Therapists (AAMFT), the National Council on Family Relations
(NCFR), and others, have advocacy arms that provide information on legislation and on action toward policy
creation or enactment.
12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE | 511

The National Association of Social Workers, for example, offers this guidance in their 2021 Federal Blueprint
for Social Welfare Policies:

     NASW calls on national leaders to:

             Make telehealth expansion under COVID-19 permanent, including removing geographic or
                site restrictions, allowing the use of audio-only devices, and ensuring parity in payment
                with in-person service payment rates.

             Expand internet connectivity for underserved households.
             Unlock government data to drive solutions to social problems by promoting the

                accessibility and mining across agencies of administrative records.

The International Society of Technology in Education promotes policy in the following areas:

   Educator preparation and professional development
   Broadband internet for learning
   Student privacy and security
   Digital citizenship
   Higher ed modernization
   Computer science and computational thinking

Smaller entities, such as school districts and companies, may have technology policies that primarily act as
legal documents to outline safe use. These policies point somewhat inward, conferring guidance and
protections for those within the scope of the agency. According to the Sunstate Technology Group,

      A Technology Use Policy is a contract between a business and its employees, contractors, vendors and anyone
      else who is given access to the company's technology assets (desktops, laptops, phones, software, network, files,
      etc.). The policy outlines exactly how the technology can be used as well as the consequences for unauthorized
      use. It's a good idea to go through the policy with every employee at onboarding and annually thereafter.
512 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE

School districts

                                      The Roseville (CA) school district offers a comprehensive technology policy
                                      , which includes a technology plan for the school district along with actions
                                      guidance on a number of areas including security (access, internet safety,
                                      student digital safety), employee training, agreements on use for students
                                      and for staff (in English/Spanish) and support for parents detailing
                                      conditions for home-based use of school software and other technology; see
                                      the list at left. Here is a sample student agreement in English. The terms of
                                      the agreement relate to use of technology "in a safe, responsible and proper
                                      manner in support of instructional programs," and for the rational
                                      outcomes defined as "for the advancement of student learning." As with
                                      many legal agreements (the school district being an agency of the city or
                                      state government), definitions are offered, conditions are stated, and
                                      penalties are listed, here ranging from removing the student's account to
                                      legal action as appropriate.

The area of student data privacy includes a lengthy list of applications approved for use by the school district.
Internet safety ensures CIPA compliance, and safety and legal compliance offers summaries of CIPA,
COPPA, and the Family Education Records Protection Act (FERPA).

The Minnetonka School District (MN) offers de
tailed advice for children and parents on digital
safety, indicated at the right. The Stillwater Public
Schools (MN) make a clear point about ensuring
access for all learners as part of their education
technology policy. And Sonia Livingstone offered
this salient critique on setting school-based
technology policy.

Companies/Industry/Non-profits

Companies also have technology-related policies, many that relate to data security and safe use. These have
become so prevalent that template documents are now available for a number of policies. This is a sample
from the company Astra-Zeneca.
12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE | 513

Technology industry

In addition to policies used with their employees for data safety and security, technology company product
policies can ensure user safety by protecting data, prioritizing parental controls, advocating for truth and
against hate speech online, funding independent research, designing humane products, and stopping tracking
of and marketing to children (Commonsense Media). The degree to which these companies create and follow
policy may relate to their dependence on the financial bottom line. Why would a social media platform be
motivated to change the algorithm that pushes content to users that might be harmful to mental health, yet
keeps the user engaged? Whose job is it to incentivize, monitor, or sanction these companies? Questions arise
on the role of the federal government when tech companies fail to monitor or control content (which,
admittedly, is a tricky thing).

Family

Family-level policy on technology is a significant step toward collectively maintaining standards of safety and
healthy use. All members weigh in and clarify desired outcomes that reflect individual and family well-being,
and agree to actions that result in those outcomes. Although there is plenty of guidance for parents on ways
to monitor their children's use and promote safety, a whole-family technology use policy includes adult
behaviors as well. This example from Judith Kohlberg (2021) nicely covers elements of a family technology
plan and ways to create it collaboratively.

The Policy Development
Process

As indicated in the figure to the right, the policy

development process involves a series of steps

(Hawlett & Geist, 2012), all of which are applicable

to creating technology policy, regardless of the

jurisdiction or level. The first three steps may be

considered policy development, with                   Adapted from Hawlett & Geist (2012)

implementation and assessment completing the

cycle. As with any cyclical action, information gained from the evaluation is further integrated with ongoing

policy formation and implementation.

Agenda setting establishes the issue at hand and sentiment for the need to create policy. Essential is that all
key informants and decision makers are heard during this stage.
514 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE

Policy formation occurs as key actors construct a policy reflecting the interests of the community and, as
Hawlett and Geist (2012) observe, "contingent on the nature and the configuration of the policy community
and network in the specific sector concerned" (p. 19). Often, research is conducted and evidence brought
forward about the issue, the pros and cons are considered, and actions recommended. Stephanie Schaeffer's
2001 Understanding Research: Top Ten Tips for Advocates and Policymakers remains a critically helpful
guide in assessing the trustworthiness of research (including that published online) to be used as evidence for
a policy. Even deliberations at local levels, including the family, should be based on evidence and reasoned
thinking. Oftentimes for wide-scale technology policy, data on internet access, technology use and impacts
will be used as a foundation for decision-making (e.g., UNICEF, 2016a, b, 2020).

Decision-making, while often subject to small- and large-scale politics, is ideally based on a rational approach
to policy making, with policy constructed and implemented to reach rational conclusions. As the Center for
Effective Services (CES) in Dublin, Ireland, observes, "Political issues include getting buy-in, setting a vision
and managing opposition." Decision-making also takes into account the steps required to lay out the policy in
technical detail for implementation planning, and those that may relate to regulatory integration.

Implementation of a policy puts into place the priorities and actions stated in the policy. It is essential,

however, that the policy development process has culminated in a clear road map for efficient

                                 implementation. Imagine the family whose

Too often, a weakly phrased and  technology policy is that "we respect each others use

chaotic implementation.          basis for implementation. The difference in policy
                                 setting and implementation is intention vs. action. At

                                 the least, according to the CES, there should be

leadership, communication, and feedback. Leadership can affect and deploy existing policies, resources,

structures, and programs. Communication occurs across the system to provide ongoing reports of action and

feedback (including positive reinforcement and cheerleading internally and to stakeholders when necessary).

Feedback "should be established between policymakers and front-line practitioners once implementation has

begun, to ensure the policy is being implemented as intended, unplanned consequences are addressed
efficiently and to support the learning capacity of the system" (CES, 2022). 3

Evaluation of policy (according to the Centers for Disease Control 2012) applies evaluation principles and
methods to examine the content, implementation, or impact of a policy. Evaluation is the activity through
which we develop an understanding of the merit, worth, and utility of a policy (p. 1). As this indicates,
evaluation is an ongoing process that checks the quality of the policy as written, the steps in implementation,

3. Readers interested in CES' complete policy implementation guide can find it here.
   12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE | 515

  and the effect. Perhaps at its most basic, policy impact evaluation can be sitting back after a policy has been in
  place and implemented for a while to ask if a difference has occurred (as intended by the policy).

             CDC policy overview

  It is up to those setting and implementing the policy to determine what the outcomes might be, whether they
  be in the short term or the long term. A school district technology policy, for example, may seek more family
  engagement through its social media platform. In the short term, this might be measured through analytics of
  platform use, including quantities of parents, and subsets that represent population groups. Longer-term
  impact might be indicated through engagement that traverses the virtual and physical landscape, with family
  feelings of connectedness, participation in school policy, and engagement with their childrens' teachers
  observed across families representative of the school community.
  As the National Collaborating Centre for Public Policy out of Canada observes in their guide to policy
  evaluation (2012), it is also important to observe the unintended consequences 4 (and benefits) from policy
  implementation. As discussed in this book, attention to policies regarding technology -- information and
  communications technologies, learning technologies, digital technologies, and the like -- has grown over the
  years. Readers may find that groups such as the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
  Development) or the World Bank can be relied upon to document the impact of governmental or educational
  policies.

 Intentional Integration of Policy with Research and
 Practice

  Research is critical for our understanding of phenomena and, as often said, we have learned a lot but have so
  much more to learn. Our research needs to keep up with technological changes and innovations; preferences

4. As Sonia Livingstone observes, sometimes tech policies aimed at children can implicate their caregivers in not-so-positive ways
516 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE

and uses by consumers; differences by the many demographic dimensions that characterize individuals,
families, and societies; and the many contexts (e.g., work, school, leisure) of family life. It needs to close the
gaps in our current knowledge, moving beyond convenient college student, higher-tech, and white higher-
SES samples, especially those in the U.S. and other "WEIRD" countries, and explore the range of populations
of families and technology users. And it needs to use up-to-date research methods and statistical techniques to
ask the questions that, to date, we haven't even considered.

Research, however, isn't enough. For any family research study we must ask, how does this finding inform
practice with families? How does it contribute to ways to make families' lives safer and more equitable?
Practitioners and policy makers must partner with researchers to ask these questions (and be incentivized to
the applied nature of such investigations). Traditionally, this integrated perspective has been the domain of
health and public health practice (Brownson & Jones, 2009), education (Read, 2010) ) and criminal justice
(Lauren, 1997).

An example from the last chapter provides a good example of policy utilizing research findings. Research has

identified ways in which children learn effectively (i.e., understand content and gain cognitive and behavioral

skills and attitudes and dispositions) with technology and with which technology, when, and how. It also

informs how to teach with technology, including how to differentiate instruction and how specific

technologies can be effective (see, for example, the quick turn to Zoom during COVID-19). Such research

informs practice by teachers, and also informs policy. A professional association (like the International Society

for Technology in Education, ISTE) reviews the research and establishes standards, not only for teachers, but

for students, administrators, and teacher coaches. These standards inform state licensing policy, which defines

the set of competencies required for licensure, in this case, specific to the use of technology and digital literacy.

Yet these policies do more than dictate practice competency. Through its influence on statewide/national and

                                                international practice, . this more macro level of

guidance also promotes a culture                technology integration, a culture which affects
of technology integration, a                    professional development, employment practices, and
culture which affects professional              occupational supports. Over time, the attitudes and
development, employment                         skills of professionals rise to this standard of
practices, and occupational                     expectation because their actions are not isolated, but
supports                                        part of a systemic response. This raises the probability
                                                that any family working with that professional will be

                                                met with a technology-forward attitude, and that

practice will accommodate the families' needs.

Integrating research, practice & policy as a framework
12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE | 517

toward collective action on family and technology

In 2016 I authored a piece for the Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences titled Creating the Future We
Want: A Framework for Integrating Family and Consumer Sciences Research, Practice, and Policy on
Technology Use (Walker, 2016). The framework was informed by other systemic models, such as the Head
Start Family, Practice, Community Engagement framework (Office of Head Start, 2011), which links wider
policy with practice to influence direct and indirect outcomes. With regard to family engagement, parenting
education and parenting support are a direct outcome of policy and practice efforts (practice that includes
supports to teachers); the influence parents have on their children's academic achievement and development
is an indirect outcome of policy and practice engagement work.

In the case of our field addressing technology, I proposed that, "to create the future we want," we take a

systemic approach to technology, rather than allowing

it to be up to the whims of those interested in using    To create the future we want, we
tech, to occur in a piecemeal and uncoordinated          need to take a systemic approach
fashion, and to be left only to programs with the        to technology, rather than
resources to deploy technology. I became passionate      allowing it to be up to the whims
about this because, after a decade of playing in the     of those interested in using tech,
sandbox with my colleagues in education, where           to occur in a piecemeal and
technology was heralded as a new tool for learning       uncoordinated fashion, and to be
and instruction and where I witnessed family             left only to programs with the
professionals literally "left to their own devices"      resources to deploy technology.

(Walker, 2019), I decided it was time that we step back

and create a culture of technology in our practice --

one that regards the value of our ongoing research, respects the needs of practitioners, and embraces a systems

approach to implement lasting change. Readers are strongly encouraged to read the article for component-by-

component explanations.

Here is an overview of the systemic framework offered in that paper:

Research on technology that focuses on related dimensions of a)
technology use as demonstrated by access, comfort, and skill, and b)
individual and family processes and outcomes.

      Technology use research variables include:

                      user characteristics (demographics, tech attitude, comfort, skill),
                      technology (type, context , characteristics), and
                      functions and purposes for technology use (e.g., communication, entertainment).
                      Works backward: presents the outcomes desired, then the actions which directly

                        influence the outcome.
             Process and outcomes facilitated by technology include:

                      Individual family member well-being,
                      Family well-being and satisfaction,
                      Individual and family processes (e.g. learning, communication, social capital,

                        connectedness), and
                      Outcomes external to the individual or family (e.g., technology developed,

                        community well-being)

      Professional Impacts Areas and Delivery Strategies Related to Technology

             Individual and family impact areas
                      As a knowledge area (to promote balanced, effective use)
                      As a skills area (to promote effective use)

             Impact strategies
                      Technology employed as effective practice (e.g., instruction, program design,
                        counseling)

      Field Foundations Related to Technology Integration

             Training: preparation of professionals on the use of technology (preservice, inservice)
             Standards for technology use in practice
             Maintaining and promoting quality research through methodology, summaries, directions
             Theoretical and conceptual models to frame research, practice, and policy

The framework is not linear, but interactive:
12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY USE | 519

Research on technology use and family processes and outcomes informs:
       (1) the design of technology to aid service delivery and effectiveness,
       (2) the promotion of effective use by individuals families through knowledge and skill,
       and
       (1) the development and advocacy for policies regarding tech use by families, and
       (2) the coordination on research methodologies and conceptual frameworks.

Research on effective use of technology in practice, and on technology as a content and skill outcome area for
professionals, informs the need for field support and standards for training, implementation, guidance,
workplace assistance, and regulation.
Field foundations, which hold an integrative understanding of technology use by families and the role that
practitioners and policy play in effective technology use by families, enact a vision for positive family and
individual outcomes by:

   promoting effective knowledge and practice by professionals AND
   advocating for progressive public policies, and - promoting quality research on practice and by families

The essential point of the framework is that as a family field (this holds for family service, family education,
and family therapy), our research on technology use and impacts informs our practice so we may best serve
families, and our foundations are inclusive, visionary, and integrative.
This is only one of many possible scenarios in which our field looks broadly at technology as an influence on
family life, and on practice and policy. There are many ways to bring about progressive change, yet it is critical
that we address the topic with the complexity and future thinking it deserves. Our ten truths about
technology, covered in Chapter 1, remain truths. Our global world will continue to evolve, technological
change will continue to impact family life in ways we have only begun to imagine, and the call for research to
investigate the use and impacts on family and child development processes and outcomes will only get louder.
520 | 12.1 SHIFTING THE CULTURE: POLICY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH TOWARD HEALTHY FAMILY TECHNOLOGY
USE

In Conclusion

As I close out this book, it is my fervent hope that we indeed take technology seriously, no longer keeping our

heads in the sand or treating it as something to be feared, something for other fields, or something that we use

in some domains (such as our teaching) but cannot

translate to influences on the populations we care          If we look at ourselves as future
about. Whether our interest is in special populations       participants on this earth (i.e.
of children or families (e.g., military families,           Salk's `good ancestors'), and as
transgender youth, Hmong divorced couples),                 practitioners, researchers,
information and communications technology impacts           administrators and policy makers,
their lives. Usually for the better. And if our work is in  how can we not be interested in
supporting practitioners (or supporting ourselves as        the ways that ICT influence us,
practitioners), we must advocate that resources and         and ways that we can be -- and
training and standards for our work be created and          help others to be -- more

updated.                                                    intentional in our use, alone,

I hope that reading this book has inspired you to ask together, and as a global society.

how technology shows up in our field, and question

how it can be more present as a topic in what we teach and in our lines of research. If we look at ourselves as

future participants on this earth (i.e. Salk's `good ancestors,') and as practitioners, researchers, administrators,

and policy makers, how can we not be interested in the ways that ICT influence us, and the ways that we can

be -- and help others to be -- more intentional in our use, alone, together, and as a global society.

12.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Integrating research, practice, and policy

     Consider one of the topics in the list below. A) Suggest a clear research question related to the
     topic, indicating at least two dimensions of technology use and specifying the family processes and/
     or outcomes being studied by the research. Be sure to include ideas from early in the book about
     our understanding of family dynamics and of technology use. B) Identify ways in which a
     practitioner would make use of that research with families. How might we see that professionals
     employ that knowledge from the research in practice? C) Finally, considering the type of
     practitioner and/or the research, indicate the role played by policy or an organization to provide
     support to that practitioner on that topic. Be as specific as possible.

           College students communicating with their parents using texting.
           Fathers and their sons playing videogames together
           Schools using online platforms to share grades and school information with parents.
           New mothers using Facebook to gather information about infant feeding.
           Couples using a money management app for their household finances.

     Family Impact Seminar brief

     The Family Impact Seminar process is an amazing way for professionals and citizens to inform
     policy makers on issues related to families. Research impact reports are created that summarize
     issues and identify potential policy issues. See, for example, this list from the Purdue Family Impact
     Seminar.
                                                                                                                   12.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES | 523

You'll notice that there's no topic related to technology.
      Create an outline for a Family Impact Seminar research brief on technology and the family.
        Consider what background research you'd include and the policy areas you would promote.
        OR
      Review the existing topics. Would you enhance any of them with research or policy
        recommendations related to technology?

Policy formation

Policy making is not for the faint of heart. It takes a deliberative, evidenced, collaborative process to
articulate policy clearly, and with enough information to guide implementation. Policy
implementation takes leadership, communication, and ongoing assessment to ensure that all
elements and players are fulfilling policy tasks. Review the chapters in the book and the topics
covered. From what you've read, as a group, identify an issue around which policy would be
created. You may want to take on different roles -- for example, if you are setting technology for a
school, your roles may be that of school board member, principle, teacher, student, and parents.

    1. What is the topic?
   2. What is the level of policy? (For whom is the policy proposed?)
   3. What are the conditions the policy is intended to affect? Will this set well politically with all

        players and among those involved with and influenced by the policy?
   4. What are the realistic policy actions? Now refine what you've written to make them cost-

        effective, time-efficient, and with the biggest payoff for the most people.
   5. How will the policy be implemented?
   6. How will you know the policy is successful? What might you learn that will help you revise

        implementation or elements of the policy?
524 | 12.3 LEARNING ACTIVITIES

     Context-specific Policy formation

     This article from BBC describes a village in India that mandates a time each day when TV and the
     internet is turned off. This is to encourage family time. According to the article,

            "We decided at the village meeting on 14 August - the eve of India's Independence Day - that we
            needed to stop this addiction," Vijay Mohite, president of the village council, told BBC Hindi. "From
            the next day, all television sets and mobiles were shut down when the siren went off."

     What kind of technology policy might a group or jurisdiction you are part of, enact?
     As a group, identify a jurisdiction you are familiar with - your home town, your high school, the
     company you work for, the sports team you play with. Each person take a role: parent, employee,
     director, player, owner, etc. In your role, is there a socially progressive policy regarding technology
     that would benefit the whole group, and of course, you? As a group discuss policy options until you
     land on one you all agree on.
     Using the guidelines for consideration from the activity above, identify the purpose for the policy
     (what are you trying to change? improve? ) and then what it might require to implement such a
     policy - again so that each member of the team/organization/town/high school or whatever can
     follow it?

12.4 BLOG PROMPTS

Reflect back on the content from the beginning of the book about technology and society, tech's
functions, and warnings about its benefits and its challenges, thinking through to the many ways in
which families use and are affected by technology, and to professionals' use. Now that you've
reached the end of the course and have reflected on myriad topics affecting your own use, your use
with friends and family, and future perspectives, how, if at all, have your perspectives about
technology changed? If things haven't shifted for you, why might that be? Are you inspired to
make any changes? How about your role as family professional? How do you see yourself
integrating technology in your practice and in ways that build on new research?

In 2018, Pew reported that a majority of people in the U.S. disagreed that the internet has been
good for society. What do you believe, and why?

This piece in Bold cites researcher Candace Odgers, who advocates for closing the digital gap for
youth (Odgers was also mentioned in Chapter 5). She says that "closing the digital divide will
require public and private investments in infrastructure, equipment, and digital literacy across
multiple sectors" and "will need to involve young people in designing solutions that will stick."
Recommendations target parents, teachers, the tech industry, and policymakers. And they focus
on improving youth well-being and mental health, and on ensuring privacy and security. This is a
tall order. These policy recommendations cut across home, school, community, industry, and
government. How might such a shift in digital equity and youth well-being be possible? Is it top
down?

TECHNIQUES (CATS) BY ANGELO AND
CROSS

The following exercises for critical thinking are from Angelo, T. and Cross, P. (1993). Classroom assessment
techniques: A handbook for college teachers, 2nd ed. Jossey-Bass. They can be adapted to the content
presented in this book and for courses promoting critical perspectives on technology in society. Many are
suitable for small group work; others can be tailored for individual thinking applications.

                         Angelo and Cross

For any of the following:
 These do not require grading, or even intense review.
 These can be tied to participation grade, or used as a way of taking attendance.
 Alternatively, you can ask students to not put their names on their responses. They may feel less pressure this
way, which may be beneficial for sensitive or very challenging material. But they may also feel that there is less
value for them.  You may choose to review only a subset of students' responses and still get a sense for trends
and themes.

I. Assessing Prior Knowledge, Recall, and Understanding

The CATS in this group are recommended to assess declarative learning, the content of a particular subject.
1. Background Knowledge Probe: short, simple questionnaires prepared by instructors for use at the
beginning of a course or at the start of new units or topics; can serve as a pretest
2. Focused Listing: focuses students' attention on a single important term, name, or concept from a lesson or
class session and directs students to list ideas related to the "focus."

the student writes 1-2 paragraphs explaining the word choice

15. Approximate Analogies: students simply complete the 2nd half of an analogy--a is to b as x is to y;
described as approximate because rigor of formal logic is not required

16. Concept Maps: students draw or diagram the mental connections they make between a major concept
and other concepts they have learned

17. Invented Dialogues: students synthesize their knowledge of issues, personalities, and historical periods
into the form of a carefully structured illustrative conversation; 2 levels of invention (select and weave quotes
from primary sources or invent reasonable quotes that fit characters and context)

18. Annotated Portfolios: students assemble a very limited number of examples of creative work and
supplement with own commentary on significance of examples

IV. Assessing Skill in Problem Solving

The CATS in this group focus on problem solving skills of various kinds--recognition of types of problems,
determining principles and techniques to solve, perceiving similarities of problem features and ability to
reflect and then alter solution strategies.

19. Problem Recognition Tasks: students recognize and identify particular problem types

20. What's the Principle?: students identify principle or principles to solve problems of various types

21. Documented Problem Solutions: students track in a written format the steps they take to solve problems
as if for a "show & tell"

22. Audio- and Videotaped Protocols: students work through a problem solving process and it is captured to
allow instructors to assess metacognition (learner's awareness of and control of thinking)

V. Assessing Skill in Application and Performance

The CATS in this group focus on students' abilities to apply important--sometimes referenced as
conditional knowledge--knowing when and where to apply what know and can do.

23. Directed Paraphrasing: students paraphrase part of a lesson for a specific audience demonstrating ability to
translate highly specialized information into language the clients or customers can understand

24. Application Cards: students generate examples of real-work applications for important principles,
generalizations, theories or procedures

25. Student-Generated Test Questions: students generate test questions and model answers for critical areas
of learning

26. Human Tableau or Class Modeling: Students transform and apply their learning into doing by physically
modeling a process or representing an image.

27. Paper or Project Prospectus: Students create a brief plan for a paper or project-based on your guiding
questions.

VI. Assessing Students' Awareness of Their Attitudes and
Values

The CATS in this group are designed to assist teachers in developing students' attitudes, opinions, values, and
self awareness within the course curriculum.

28. Classroom Opinion Polls: Students indicate degree of agreement or disagreement with a statement or
prompt.

29. Double-entry Journals: Students record and respond to significant passages of text

order to make a connection between the articulated goals and those of the course.

33. Focused Autobiographical Sketches: Students write a brief description of a successful learning experience
they had relevant to the course material.

34. Interest/Knowledge/Skills Checklists: Students complete a checklist survey to indicate their knowledge,
skills and interest in various course topics.

35. Goal Ranking and Matching: Students list and prioritize 3 to 5 goals they have for their own learning in
the course

36. Self-Assessment Ways of Learning: Students compare themselves with several different "learning styles"
profiles to find the most likely match.

VIII. Assessing Course-Related Learning and Study Skills,
Strategies, and Behaviors
