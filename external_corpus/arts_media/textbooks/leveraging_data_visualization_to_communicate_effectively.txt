Prologue

This book is devoted to sharing knowledge and scenarios where visualizations can help you better understand data.
Humanity generates an estimated 2.5 quintillion bytes per day. To put it in perspective, "2.5 quintillion pennies laid out
flat would cover the Earth five times" (Chardent, N., 2023, para 2). Data overload is a growing issue; your ability to lever-
age technologies like business intelligence and advanced analytical tools is a valuable skill. But where do you start?

   Common data visualization techniques are not rocket science, and most organizations have the tools and platforms
they need to make data-driven decisions. Essentially, everyone should become a data analyst for their organization.

   This textbook introduces students to the principles of effective data visualization with audience comprehension in
mind. Readers are introduced to effective chart types and how to select and design visualizations that clearly convey
data patterns and trends. Using best practices for labeling, scaling, and annotating visualizations, it provides techniques
to effectively communicate information that supports data-driven decisions, transforming data into actionable insights.
The textbook also covers common pitfalls and biases in data visualization.

   Students will develop skills to evaluate patterns, identify trends, and analyze data. They are guided through hands-on
exercises, case studies, and projects to create a variety of visualizations using tools such as Excel, Power Business Intelli-
gence (BI), Ishikawa, SWOT, PESTLE, decision trees, and more. The subsequent visual data are then applied to effectively
communicate in various settings with diverse audiences.

Potential Audience for This Textbook

This book is intended for graduate students from a variety of academic backgrounds seeking practical application of
data-driven design and decision-making for a business setting. Using grounded theory, the textbook addresses ways to
leverage data to tell a story effectively and ethically.

   Storytelling with data is not an inherent skill, and it is easy to get lost in a plethora of visualization choices. In some
cases, students become enamored of technology and lose sight of good design principles, leading to the likelihood that
the audience will become disconnected from the story. This textbook teaches a variety of decision-making tools, includ-
ing ways to visualize data to minimize complexity and maximize audience understanding.

   Besides creating dashboards in Excel, this book introduces students to quick insights using Power BI to see emerging
patterns and trends. Additionally, students will learn to create interactive dashboards and use various techniques to add
context. Students will also learn to publish dashboards to multiple audiences through the Power BI app. Students are
always amazed when working with a large dataset to discover correlations and outliers that they didn't know existed.

   This book was possible because of the Private Academic Library Network of Indiana (PALNI) and the PALSave: PALNI
Affordable Learning textbook creation grant. The book, Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Effectively, uses
an icon set throughout to alert students of specific resources, including accompanying data files, YouTube video demon-
strations, rich discussions of the "why" behind the visualization, step-by-step instructions (both in text and video), and
links to open textbook references.

1. Communicate Results

       Data saturation is everywhere. We've often had the belief that more is better; however, that actually isn't true in
       the case of data. The rapid rise in our ability to collect data hasn't been matched by our ability to support, filter,
       and manage data. As an example, think about the first problem that people complain about when a city experi-
       ences great growth--the roads are too crowded. The infrastructure can't keep up.

          --Sarah Spivey, Forbes 2020 World's Most Influential Chief Marketing Officers

          What Do You Think?
          Michelle, the CEO of a midsize engineering company, was in another one of those meetings she had
       grown to dread in the three months she had been running the growing and in-demand firm. Dane, one of
       her brightest lead engineers, was supposed to be explaining a new product line to the management team.
       The line would be unveiled in the next few months. Appearing somewhat nervous, Dane had been allotted
       just 20 minutes on the official meeting agenda but had already spent 15 minutes discussing the project's
       background. Nearly every decision-maker in the room was already familiar with the need for the project and
       had been for some time. At 10 minutes in, Michelle, squirming a bit in her seat, knew he would never get to
       the crucial part that everyone desperately needed to hear. Specifically, the management team needed to
       understand the functions of the new product line. They also needed to understand the benefits for existing
       clients and how to market in an organization-wide, all-hands-on-deck capacity.
          Michelle, a successful executive who had come up through the sales side, had been handed the reins of
       the organization after the start-up founders decided to take a step back from the day-to-day operations.
       The founders, who were also engineers, had been impressed by the powerful way that Michelle had
       described her vision for the organization over a series of get-to-know-you meetings. Michelle was energetic
       and succinct and used visionary language that portrayed a vivid story of the company's future. She credited
       these abilities to her work experience sharing data with clients who appreciate efficiency and effective
       reporting. This day, Michelle had purposely given Dane, the best engineer on her team, a 20-minute slot.
       She had already summed up what she thought he needed to do effectively to bring the team up to speed.
          Dane struggled through the background information, unaware he was repeating information most deci-
       sion-makers in the room already knew. The voluminous slide deck he prepared was full of data and exces-
       sive bullet points, and each page appeared identical to the next as he droned on and on to the room of
       important insiders. Michelle, who prided herself on understanding the details of company initiatives and
       products, found herself struggling to follow along. Her attention drifted off, and other audience members
       were noticing. She worried about moving Dane along in the presentation, fearing it might aggravate his ner-
       vousness and cause the meeting to go further adrift. She also noted that Dane's presentation was reflective
       of many such presentations that lost their focus in presenting important ideas, relevant data, or discernible
       takeaways for audiences. As Dane continued, Michelle wondered if there was something different her team
       could do to be more influential during these important moments. . . .
          How does this case relate to your own experiences at work, home, or school? What do you think Dane
       could have done differently with his pitch? What outcomes or goals should Dane have kept in mind? Who is
       the audience in this case, and how do you think they felt? Why should Michelle be concerned about the
       communication of her team? Do you have any suggestions for her moving forward?

                                                                                                                                                         Communicate Results | 1
Introduction

Michelle's quandary about the missed opportunities for better communication in her organization is not an isolated
example. Her situation may have invoked some sympathy from your own experiences and feelings of frustration as you
thought through a range of similar struggles. Those struggles may have included memories of a work meeting where
communicators never got to the point or a class lecture that contained information that seemed indecipherable. It may
have also included a close friend or loved one who aimlessly guided their half of a conversation to everywhere except a
finish.

   The failure of presenters to share important information seems almost like a rite of passage in many leadership
tenures and organizational cultures. Failure to reach an audience in these situations seems almost the rule instead of
the exception. As a result, the need for a speaker to reach an audience is more important than ever, particularly when
the goal of their message is to gain buy-in, to reach a decision, or for action to be taken on the part of the audience
members.

   This text provides readers with tools to communicate their ideas and data clearly. Clarity is key to connecting audi-
ence members to important information. Throughout this text, you will see additional resources and learning objectives
to guide the journey. While not everything can be learned in this text (applied practice is needed), the information will
provide a solid foundation for readers to discover tools that work for them and that reach their intended audience. To
that end, the following chapter unpacks essential communication models on which the following processes are based,
accompanied by discussions surrounding audience analysis. This chapter then turns to the powerful use of persuasion
and storytelling to deliver our messages.

   Chapter 1 addresses the following learning objectives.

1.1 Communication Models and Management of Information

       It is the responsibility of the sender to make sure the receiver understands the message.
          --Joseph D. Batten, leadership scholar

Considering the Complexity of Communication in a Busy Sender-Receiver World

Source: Group of signs image generated by Google     Too often in our communication experiences, we find our-
Gemini--Public Domain                             selves overwhelmed with information as we struggle to assign
                                                  meaning to the plethora of messages we are receiving. As our
or the speaker's.                                 opening case already displayed, these moments can incite a
                                                  flurry of emotions and confusion. Those familiar with travel or
                                                  navigation can appreciate the feeling of being in "uncharted
                                                  waters" despite having a clear travel plan or destination.

                                                     In such moments it is easy to miss important parts of the
                                                  message necessary for understanding. Think through your per-
                                                  sonal experience in situations where others are sending you
                                                  messages. You may spend a lot of time trying to determine the
                                                  actual message you are receiving. You might also wonder about
                                                  the messenger--their motives and how you fit into the messen-
                                                  ger's plans. Additionally, you may spend time thinking about a
                                                  potential response and how others will process your response.
                                                  Those moments may feel confusing, and we may find ourselves
                                                  with more questions than answers . . . and a strong desire to put
                                                  off any decision at all. Many audience members are reluctant to
                                                  voice their confusion out of fear of embarrassment--their own

The Communication Process as an Ongoing Play Between Sender and Receiver

In situations like this, it's common to feel responsible for our failure to understand. However, it's essential to recognize
that understanding is a joint responsibility between the messenger and the recipient. The way the message is conveyed
plays a critical role. Assumptions about the recipient's knowledge, vocabulary and terminology, or bias can hinder effec-
tive communication. As authors, we view communication as a multifaceted and dynamic process that occurs between
individuals within their environment and amid the context of their circumstances. Imagine communication as a complex
theater performance--a play unfolding between two people.

The Communication Process: A Play by Mitchell and Deckard

The play starts with a sender, a coequal actor in our play and otherwise known as an individual seeking to impart infor-
mation to the receiver. The sender and receiver approach each other with their own unique culture, experiences (pro-

                                                                                                                                                        Communicate Results | 3
fessional and personal), perceptions, biases, and knowledge. We can call those background considerations context. Both
the sender and receiver may be aware of, indifferent to, or oblivious to the differences between themselves and oth-
ers. Together, sender and receiver operate on a channel of communication that includes a plethora of tools that can be
issued verbally or conveyed nonverbally through facial or body language, written word, or items they produce. As you
can see, there are a great deal of factors present for every communicator as they convey their message, which ideally is
the information they seek to impart to their coequal actor on this proverbial stage.

   While we all enjoy a play with a happy ending, this acting is a bit more complex. It includes some other details that
we must first decipher. First, returning to those concepts of verbal and nonverbal, we must consider the reactions that
the sender and receiver give each other during this communication process. We call those reactions feedback, and it
includes words, facial expressions, and body language expressed by either party while processing the message. Feed-
back can be abundantly clear or very subtle, with the potential for both characteristics to occur within seconds of each
other during our communication play. We also must consider another concept, noise, as it becomes an important ele-
ment of the communication process and is prominent in our play. Noise refers to anything in the context, channel, or
message that delays, disrupts, distracts, or prevents the otherwise normal flow of communication. Noise can be caused
by anything, whether we notice it or not.

   By the way, the ongoing communication doesn't necessarily follow a script; it's an infinite play. Achieving success in
this communication play can be hindered by many distractions. What is the audience noticing? Let's revise the concept
of "noise" within our play. Imagine the receiver of the message arriving at a 9 a.m. meeting after a difficult and distress-
ing morning. Upon arriving at work, they are bombarded by four hot-button problems requiring immediate resolution.
Simultaneously, their office mates and email inboxes demand attention. To add to the stress, they skipped breakfast due
to a family matter that couldn't wait until after work. And guess what? That same urgent matter will likely require addi-
tional attention during their nonexistent lunch break. All these profound factors contribute to the noise that disrupts
communication between sender and receiver in our play. Sometimes, the noise is barely discernible to the sender, or
perhaps the sender faces similar challenges while trying to convey their message through the channel.

Introducing the Credible Speaker and Ethos, Pathos, and Logos

Note: Author Photograph     The factors that make communication complex also highlight the need for practition-
                         ers to consider their messages for audience-centeredness, clarity, and organization.
                         Aristotle, a Greek philosopher and scholar, encouraged a combination of ethos, pathos,
                         and logos. He contended that the well-rounded speaker could reach audiences in highly
                         effective ways via these three appeals. Ethos refers to the credible speaker--their expe-
                         riences and character as the reputation that audience members come to know and trust.
                         Pathos considers the emotion a speaker conveys in their words and, more importantly,
                         how those feelings are considered by audience members. Logos describes the logic or
                         reasoning through evidence that a speaker utilizes to reach their audience. Logos can
                         be the very structure of an argument, or it can consider the best types of evidence to
                         use with a particular audience. Together, these three appeals act as strong pillars that
                         support the speaker, their connection with the audience, and their argument.

     1.1 Exercise 1: Identify Ethos, Pathos, and Logos in an Appeal

        Learning Objective #1--Identify communication models that predict connection and identification between
     speaker and audience

                          Consider the last request you heard. Think back through the last 24 hours of your day and the
                       last time someone asked you to consider something or do something of significance. What evi-
                       dence of ethos, pathos, and logos did you hear in their appeal? Do you think the sender of the
                       message intended their appeal to have those aspects? How do you think they specified their
     appeal to you as an audience member?

Communication Models That Decipher the Complex Communication Process

If you sense that this text on data visualization and storytelling leans heavily toward audience focus, trust your senses.
Effective communication, where sender and receiver manage to relay the desired message despite the distraction of
noise, must start by considering the audience before creating the message. This consideration should occur even in the
split seconds available in the bustle of life. That said, regarding communication, an audience-centered approach has not
always been the case despite Aristotle's advice on ethos, pathos, and logos.

   As communication models from the last century illustrate, we've only recently begun to fully consider the complex
interplay of sender and receiver. The Linear Model, offered by Sharron and Weaver (1949) relied solely on the messenger
for analysis. Osgood and Schramm's Interactive Model, offered in 1950, considered the receiver of the message but
did not fully capture the nuance of verbal and nonverbal communication in a busy model. Both the Linear and Inter-
active Models reflect times in society where speakers, rather than audience, had the most agency in communicat-
ing widely. The Transactional Model, introduced by Barnlund in 1970, recognized the subtlety of complex interactions
where sender and receiver continuously decipher each other's language. It also accounts for the constant presence
of nonverbals including facial expressions and body language within the context, field of experiences, and relational
dimensions present in the sender and receiver exchange. Table 1.1 provides a summary of these models.

          Step-by-Step Instructions for Considering the Transactional Model of
Communication

Keep the following in mind while receiving messages to ensure you capture all the information being communicated
intentionally and unintentionally:

 1. Observe: Note how the sender enters the conversation. What was their body language before communicating?
      What nonverbals were displayed during their message, after they were done, and while you were responding? Be
      aware of the context, field of experiences, and relational dimensions present in this channel.

6 | Communicate Results
2. Listen: What is the person saying? How are they saying it? What do they intend for you to hear?
3. Confirm: As needed, confirm the message you believe you are receiving to get greater clarification and, in some

      cases, to validate what they are telling you. Remember: Your own nonverbals such as nodding and looking intently
      show signs of interest.
4. Note: Is there information they are not sharing? Do you need further information before responding? Before ask-
      ing, it may be good to ask if they are open to your questions.
5. Respond: Once satisfied with your understanding of what they are saying and after gaining additional information,
      if necessary, is it important to respond immediately? While responding, observe nonverbals and listen for affirma-
      tion or questions they may have for you.

Please note this process may happen quickly, interchangeably, and with several layers of sender and receiver feed­
back.

   Before turning away from the transactional communication model, it is important to note that all communication,
including the complex deciphering of the sender and receiver process, can be overwhelming and not perfect. All com-
municators need to give themselves permission to unpack these experiences through trial-and-error learning.

Exploring Cognitive Overload and the Buffet Effect

Christoper Schimming at the Mayo Clinic (2022) formally identifies "noise" as information overload. They indicate the
phenomenon, which they call cognitive overload, occurs when the brain has too much information to process. Cognitive
overload can be overwhelming to the individual experiencing the phenomenon. It can also lead to a point of paralysis
where the receiver chooses not to do anything, incapable of deciphering or acting upon the information received. The
situation is compounded if the person is relied upon to make a judgment based on the information. It is easy for both
parties to become frustrated. This condition is exacerbated by constant sources of data and information through tele-
vision or streaming shows, movies, social media, and the internet, to name a few. As teachers, your authors have even
noticed that our lectures and exercises compete with iPhone text messages and emails. It's important to fully under-
stand the symptomatic reactions to cognitive overload and their effects as detailed in Table 1.2.

   Table 1.2: Reactions to Cognitive Overload With Explanations

Reactions to Cog­ nitive Overload Reaction Explained

Paralysis      You are unable to deal with the topic or information because it appears more complex than manageable.

Anger          If information is not consistent with what you know or feel, you may get angry as your beliefs, knowledge, or
               experiences get challenged. Repeated efforts to address an issue with this information may make it worse.

Passivity      You decide to go along because forming an opinion on the topic may be too overwhelming.
Understanding
               You may process information by relying on the knowledge or input of others who are more trusted. You may
               also rely on your trusted ways of learning to slowly gain the knowledge you need to arrive at an opinion or a
               decision.

                                                      Communicate Results | 7
   Finally, when considering cognitive overload, we should also
consider that many senders have arrived equipped with infor-
mation-heavy messages filled with data, graphs, and exuberant
amounts of PowerPoint slides due to what we call the Buffet
Effect. If you have ever enjoyed the plentiful choices of an elab-
orate buffet, you know that at the onset, the choices seem irre-
sistible and delicious. However, those of us who decided to try
many (or even all those choices) know it is impossible to do so
without feeling the aftereffects of our choices. In such a
moment, the food once considered for its nutrition and suste-
nance has instead become something that causes indigestion,
sleepiness, or lethargy. Simply put, we don't need all those buf- Source: Veggie Buffet by takoradee--CC BY-SA
fet choices. Instead, we need food items that will give us the
requisite calories, energy, and ability to conquer our day.

   Applying the Buffet Effect to communication, senders preparing their messages may have adopted a similar approach
as the restaurant owners hosting a lavish buffet, although with less appeal for the receivers. Instead of making strategic
choices about evidence to support their claims, senders may have decided to add a bit of everything to their argument.
They may include elements of excessive background along with undecipherable and endless graphs and statistics. If
given 15 minutes to talk, they may have used every minute and still not gotten their information across. We can easily
see how the Buffet Effect, reinforced by access to information, can lead to cognitive overload.

     and conduct key analysis before creating or delivering a presentation

                          Consider a time when the Buffet Effect happened in your own communication experience. You
                       can consider this cognitive overload from the point of the sender or receiver. How did you feel
                       during this experience? Was this feeling the sender's intention?

The Use of Figurative Language

   You've probably noticed we use figurative language in this text. As two teachers author-
ing a text on data visualization and storytelling, this was intentional. A term like Buffet
Effect, a metaphor for how cognitive overload can affect messages, is an example of figura-
tive language. As communicators and teachers, we see this as a valuable resource. Beyond
metaphor, we can include simile, personification, and hyperbole as powerful language tools.

   Before turning away from the Buffet Effect, it's important to note that practices that offer
too much information can be the exception instead of the rule. In this text, we will talk
about different types of evidence, tools, tips, and best practices to effectively reach your
audience. The remainder of this chapter will explore strong persuasive tips and storytelling
to frame the reasoning behind the message. Before doing that, however, let's turn next to
audience analysis.

1.1 Self-Assessment: Buffet Effect

   Learning Objective #1--Identify communication models that predict connection and identification between
speaker and audience

                       Look at your calendar for the last three days. Make a list of all the meetings you had and think
                    about the communication in those meetings. Particularly consider the appeals and requests from
                    senders and receivers. Place an × next to those meetings where the cognitive overload or Buffet
                    Effect was evident. If the Buffet Effect was not present, place a + next to the meeting. Then for
                    each × and + meeting, describe the following information.

   For × meetings, what went wrong? What did you not understand? What should the sender have done differ-
ently?

   For + meetings, what went well? What was the sender asking of you? What did the sender do to be so effec-
tive?

1.2 Exploring and Unpacking Audience Perceptions

Managing Fear Among Unknown Audience Members

   In this section we explore the audience and how to gain infor-
mation about them. The audience can often be the most fearful
aspect of our communication experience. After all, most of the
appeals we make as senders involve leaving the decision-mak-
ing strictly in their hands. While most of us have a fear of the
unknown, we often have a greater fear of how an audience will
react to anything we are offering. We might ask: Will they like
me? Am I dressed appropriately? What do they know about the
subject I am discussing? Will they accept the information I pro-
vide? Will someone ask a hard question? Of course, it is per-

these questions.

   This fear of public speaking may include fear of being seen as nervous, anxiety about panic setting in, toxic perfec-
tionism, and terror at the thought of going forth on your own. It could also include defensive thinking and behavior,
detachment from thoughts and feelings, and even rationalizing a career or class change to justify not speaking in public
(SocialAnxiety.com, 2021).

   Fear of public speaking can happen to anyone when not managed. A notorious incident took place when Michael Bay,
a successful movie producer and director, left the stage at a Samsung product rollout after a teleprompter failed. You
can watch the video and consider what went wrong, how you might have reacted in that same situation, and obvious
details that Michael missed in the flurry of the moment. How could this difficult experience have been different?

Regaining Confidence Through an Affirming Set of Guides

Many individuals walk into communication experiences with a variety of baggage. After years of working with students
who were struggling with confidence, we came up with four recommendations to help communicators. Many of those
students were overwhelmed by anxiety, which never permitted them to consider their audiences. We hope this confi-

   List 3 examples of experiences you have in the following categories:
 1. Work (professional): Just as it sounds. What work activities bring you to this moment?
2. Work (formative): These jobs may not be your current professional trajectory, but they made you who you are as

      you were developing into the professional you've become.
3. Education: Which key learning experiences played a role in your development?
4. Home internship: Think through the roles in the family business, chores, duties, or other activities.
5. Training: Beyond education or experience, did you have specific training that equipped you for what you presently

      do?
6. The good: Think about the other things that have happened to you, personally or professionally, that were positive.
 7. The bad (and ugly): These were negative at the time, but they are now part of your story, and you learned from

      them.

Beyond Fear: Learning About Different Types of Audience Members

Let's explore some special considerations regarding audience types. We all walk into a situation with life experiences
that guide us, inform our cultural experiences and judgments, and assist us as we meet new people and make sense of
those meetings. Rhetorical scholar Kenneth Burke termed such moments and judgments, particularly as they engage
our persuasive processes, as identification. Identification is the way that communicators relate with each other based
on background, differences, tone, speaking styles, and so on. While this identification might sound like individuals will
only relate to those who have similar experiences, this is just a starting point. As we meet more people and learn of their
differences, our identification bubble expands through common ground.

                      Unpacking Kenneth Burke's theory on identification can take some time, but this resource can help. The
                   process also requires self-awareness of our own characteristics and identities. Once we become more
                   aware, we can find common ground with our audiences and will be in better shape as communica-
                   tors.Writing with Andrew. (2021, Oct 4). Finding Common Ground With Identification | Kenneth Burke's

   A key part of that identification process is recognizing the differences inherent in all audiences. Specifically, we must
consider the audience's demographic and psychographic aspects. According to Land et al. (2020), demographics con-
sist of the characteristics of a population. Psychographics consist of a buyer's habits, hobbies, spending habits, and val-
ues. Both demographics and psychographics are key to our preparation and can be predictive of an audience member's
openness to our message. That said, it is imperative to remember that audiences vary despite common characteristics.
Approaching all groups as if they are the same can lead to unfair biases that may be off-putting to audience members.
While keeping in mind demographics, psychographics, and maintaining flexibility in our approaches, let's list key aspects
of each, as shown in Table 1.3.

                       graphic miss: What opportunities were lost, what appeal could have been added, and what are the
     repercussions of the miss?

Diversity and Bias

As you may be starting to understand via this chapter and through your own experiences, audiences are all different, and
in any consideration, this is a wonderful thing. As a popular colleague of ours often says, "different" does not mean defi-
cient--it just means different. Recognizing diversity, otherwise known as our differences among various demographic
and psychographic traits, can be powerful for communicators. Even more impactful is when we assemble and recognize
diverse teams or unite them through the communication we offer. In fact, Forbes (2021) indicated that simply boosting
diversity in our workplaces can increase creativity and innovation, create greater organizational opportunities for pro-
fessionals, and lead to better overall decision-making.

   We also must recognize the bias that influences our perspectives, practices, and resulting modes of communication.
Bias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared to another, usually in a way that can
impair or eliminate fairness. For instance, as midwestern university authors working at global institutions, we are likely
to have differing perceptions from the global gathering of students and faculty we regularly meet. This can include our
concept of time, customs such as greetings, or how we build trust.

   The important first step in confronting bias is recognizing that we all have certain predilections that favor certain
cultural experiences. If that bias remains unchecked, it can be detrimental to how we connect and communicate with
others. In Chapter 8, we will explore to a greater extent how we communicate across gaps to reach diverse audiences,
including those of different genders, cultures, and generational demographics.

   In the meantime, keep reflecting on the fact that bias is real, and account for it. Often the term bias raises concerns
for individuals. That said, by considering how bias (e.g., our natural experiences or cultural backgrounds) may influence
our communication, we prepare for healthy audience interactions.

                                                                                                                                                       Communicate Results | 13
                    In this section we discussed bias that can account for an individual's perception, but there is also research
                 bias. The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay Libraries produced a great online resource to get you thinking
                 about research bias. Check it out and see why bias is such a problem in our communication and research,

Conducting Audience Analysis Toward Successful Communication

Now that we have accounted for bias while considering the demographics and psychographics of diverse audiences, let's
determine how to move forward with our messages. Peter Cardon (2021), an expert on effective business communica-
tion, wrote about key components for audience analysis. First, as communicators looking to have influence, we should
identify any benefits our message contains for audience members. Similarly, we also must recognize any constraints
posed by our communication within the existing system structure. The term system structure refers to the overall
organization and interconnections within a communication system. It includes how different components interact and
influence the flow of information. A good example of a constraint is the limitation on the number of characters when
writing a tweet.

   Next, what are the recipients' values and priorities? These key determiners help us fiercely home in on our audience.
After values and priorities are analyzed, we should review our own credibility on the subject. Remember, we often
undersell our abilities, experience, and knowledge in this area, and this can be a core mistake of an otherwise strong
message. We should also estimate and anticipate audience reactions to our message. Remember that communication
is an imprecise tool; however, anticipating a response that has not yet been received can lead to a better understanding
of your audience. Finally, we should simultaneously keep secondary audiences in mind as we prepare our message. Sec-
ondary audiences may not be the front line for our message, but they certainly factor into how decisions are made at
multiple levels.

   Now that you know the initial planning steps for your message, how often have you used audience analysis in your
current strategy? It is common for many communicators to do one or more of these steps. It is also common that many
otherwise highly skilled and talented individuals do none. How do you think their communication improves by perform-
ing this analysis?

   Beyond the audience analysis, there are specific steps to ensure our message resonates with our audience. Rather
than relying on guesswork, we can directly investigate opinions. Consider any one or more of the steps in Exhibit 1.1 for
potential audience analysis tools.

   Audience analysis can be a complicated endeavor. As always, no one may do it identically or perfectly for every situa-
tion. That said, diligence in seeking information about your audience, as well as their interests, can be highly beneficial
to a communicator. Managing our confidence, accounting for audience diversity, and recognizing bias, maximizes your
preparation skills.

1.3 Powerful and Influential Presentations

       Words have power.
          --Seanan McGuire, author

Seeing the Infiniteness of Sources for Our Persuasive Influence

Anytime you observe the word influence, we encourage you to consider the word persuasion. Influence is the capacity
to affect the character, development, or behavior of someone or something, or the effect itself. When we use influence,
we persuade. The definition of persuasion points to the process in which one or more persons try to influence another
person or group's behaviors. Some teaching scholars make the argument that both influence and persuasion can be
separated from other forms of communication that may take on more objective natures void of subjectivity. While we
appreciate the sentiment, we would point out that selecting objective communication involves subjectivity that suggests
influence and persuasion.

   Textbooks, including this one, are arranged by decisions
about what information to include/exclude and how it should
be portrayed. In our classrooms, our campuses have made very
subjective decisions about what a higher education classroom
should look like, just as teachers and students alike have
decided how best to appear, dress, and be present in such an
environment. On the way to the classroom, we are bombarded
by persuasion in advertisements, podcasts, and social media
feeds that portray a life those posting wish it to be displayed.
Everything, as it turns out, knowingly and unknowingly, has
some element of persuasion. With this notion in mind, we
should seek to make our influence impactful, dynamic, and with
the most efficient communication possible. In the following

                                                                                                       Note: Author Photograph

tial, persuasive, and audience-centered presentations. We will also discuss learning tools for that process, including
presentation software to augment our argument.

                       your list? What does that reveal about you as an audience member? Was that persuasion effective?
                       Was there anything you now recognize as subtle persuasion?

Leading to Direct and Indirect Persuasion

We discussed ethos, pathos, and logos at the start of our chapter. Ethos refers to the credible speaker while pathos
refers to the important emotional connection between sender and receiver in the communication process. Logos, which
consists of the evidence we assemble to support our argument, also includes the way we construct that message. Con-
structing a message effectively speaks to the very influence and persuasion we referred to in this chapter.

   Ethos, pathos, and logos become powerful tools to account for in an argument. However, for a communicator, it is
important to note that simply including elements of those three is not necessarily the most effective way to reach an
audience. Communicators should also understand the varying degrees ethos, pathos, and logos can be used depending
on the audience. For instance, how we present our ethos (credibility) will be different depending on the receiver. Our
pathos (emotional connection) may center on shared values in a professional setting whereas personal pathos might
center on family bonds. Certain groups, such as cultures that value relationships and trust in decision-making, may not
be as receptive to evidence at the onset of a presentation before establishing a relationship.

   In the case of transactional communication, flexibility is key to prioritizing the audience. Some audiences need a
direct approach when asked to act. Direct persuasive approaches, where the solution or answer is upfront, are often
effective in the United States with audiences that are familiar with U.S. business culture. Other audiences, such as those
in Chinese organizations, may find direct approaches to be off-putting and unsettling. Such audiences will likely prefer
indirect persuasive approaches that reflect their processes (e.g., learning background, time to consider potential solu-
tions, followed by determining logical next steps).

   We will talk more about audience and cultural differences in Chapter 8. For now, let's examine direct and indirect
approaches to persuasion to gain familiarity with two powerful techniques. As always, keep in mind that no uniform
method is a sure bet for all audiences. Instead, take these tools and determine the best way to craft your communication.

Direct Persuasion in Action With Busy Deciders

Direct persuasive approaches work well when audience members want their answers up front. We often call these audi-
ence members deciders. These leaders may fully understand the problem and the solution but have not yet committed
to a specific change.

   Business scholar Barbara Minto (2021) developed a way to reach such deciders in a highly effective way while training
new sales associates; she called it the Pyramid Principle. Its adaptation, naming, and usage have been commonplace in
business communication. The process involves an introduction of the problem called the Situation, Complication, Ques-
tion, and Answer, or SCQA. It is followed by the What, Why, and How. Exhibit 1.2 better explains the function of this
adapted version of the Pyramid Principle.

          Answer (A): Briefly provide the named solution you will explain in the body of the presentation.
          The SCQA should consist of no more than 20% of the total presentation. We don't want to dwell on a
       background the audience of deciders already knows.

                                                                                 Body
            · What: Expand upon an answer or idea. Name the component parts the audience needs to under-

                stand.
            · Name three whys to support adopting the "what." Keep at least one financial in nature, particularly

                in business.
            · Describe how to make the solution happen.
            · Discuss the timeline for completion. With visuals, this can be very appealing.
            · State the risks to adopting your solution, then discuss how those risks could be mitigated.

   The Pyramid Principle can be hard to decipher for eager audiences. Exhibit 1.3 showcases an example of how the pyra-
mid components work in practice.

             1947, is located five miles from downtown Harrison City and seven miles from a thriving university.
             Bailey's is rooted in their traditional way of doing business and just recently got an electronic cash
             register in addition to their pen and paper inventory system. Bailey's does not use social media and
             certainly does not advertise. In fact, 80% of their business comes from repeat customers living in
             the community surrounding the store. Their biggest competitor, Taylor's Pumpkins and Specialties,
             is located 15 miles from Harrison City and 17 miles from the university, with 55% of their yearly sales
             coming from university students buying pumpkins alone. The manager of Bailey's is Mariah, and she
             often closes a quiet shop while wondering if they could be doing something more. . . .

Indirect Persuasion and Monroe's Motivated Sequence

Now that we have addressed direct persuasive approaches, we should also consider indirect persuasion and how it
applies to our argument. Indirect persuasion is appropriate for audiences who may already be familiar with the topic
but have not yet made up their mind. It also resonates with potential allies toward a solution or open-minded individ-
uals. Monroe's Motivated Sequence is a method of persuasion and is based on Dr. Allan Monroe's studies related to
psychology. Monroe made the case that humans, when presented with a dilemma, are inclined to respond to the need.
His sequence allows the author to offer a solution after presenting the problem. It also offers communicators a comple-
mentary vision of what they present.

                                                               Monroe's Motivated Sequence

                                                                                                                                                       Communicate Results | 19
          Attention: In this phase, we connect with the audience. This might be a story, example, rhetorical ques-
       tion, startling statistic, and so on that reels the audience in. The important thing is to get their attention.

          Need: This is the problem that frames our sequence. What is the thing that needs to be solved? This
       should be thorough.

          Satisfaction: Monroe was careful not to call this solution, though that is just what it does. Satisfaction is
       the sender's solution to remedy the problem and take the burden away, therefore satisfying the need.

          Visualization: This crucial step allows the audience to see what life will look like when the change is
       adopted. It allows them to dream and visualize the solution.

          Action: The last step is to give the audience the crucial steps to get started.

                   Monroe's Motivated Sequence has many uses in persuasion and can take on many different forms. Any-
                   one watching commercials may have noticed its characteristics of quick and repetitive use, such as here

Persuading and Influencing Through Presentation Software

Finally, having the proper means to display the information for our arguments, whether that be through direct or indi-
rect persuasion, is a fundamental responsibility of the author. This means we are duty-bound as communicators to sup-
port our message with appropriate visualization. While this text will refer to data visualization throughout the remaining
chapters, it's important to start by understanding what that means within presentation software. Presentation software
will allow you to display your ideas and persuasion in a convenient and organized way.

   We've compiled a list of presentation software for you to consider. This list is not exhaustive; you may have your
favorite. As visualization designers, we would note two things. First, we recognize that some software is more common
to us because we became familiar with it through its availability, learning, and organizational use. Second, we should all
be cognizant that trying new software may be beneficial to slide preparation and design. Table 1.4 shows only a partial
list!

It is important to note that for your presentation software to be effective, it must work for you. Its usage should be con-
venient and efficient, supportive of your ideas, and not distracting. Beyond this, you should consider what we hold as
the primary rule of slide design: Everything you create should strive to be consistent aesthetically with the culture of
your audience and their visual consumption. Essentially, if it works well for the audience, the design works well for your
needs.

Strategies for Effective Slide Visuals

First, you should outline your design before creating slides. This ensures that the number of slides is consistent with
your time limits as a presenter. Next, your slide deck should have a title slide that states the name of the presenta­
tion along with your own. It can also offer imagery that supports the idea you are presenting. Consider adding a visual
agenda bar that allows audience members to see your place in the presentation as it advances. This reminds audience
members of your place in the presentation, what has been covered, and what will be covered next.

   Visual animations can be appealing, and they lend support to your idea--be sure they do not distract from your pre-
sentation. Color templates and fonts should be consistent, and where possible, add claim headings at the top that sum-
marize each slide. Remember to only display information relevant to the presentation in the most effective way. Too
much or too little can be distracting. Also, information that does not need to be in the presentation but could be sup-
portive during questions may be placed in appendix slides at the end of your deck. Finally, if you have a company logo,
you could consider placing it at the top right of your slides throughout the deck. Remember, accommodating the audi-
ence means providing the most important parts for their consideration.

1.4 The Power of Storytelling

       Story is probably the most fundamental and important element of entertainment in the world. It's a basic build-
       ing block. It comes into play in virtually every creative medium. Storytelling is the oldest profession. Don't believe
       what you've heard. People were telling lies long before another business was invented.

          --Jim Shooter, former editor-in-chief, Marvel and Valiant Comics

Rethinking Our Communication for the Frame and Narrative of Storytelling

Once upon a time there were two teachers who decided to write a textbook about data visualization and storytelling. . . .
Sound familiar to you? It is because we all have been absorbing stories from the very start of our lives. As authors, we
have found that whenever we discuss storytelling, certain audience members start to get a little nervous. Some busi-
ness leaders, for example, don't see a place for storytelling in their vast networks of official decision-making where bulky
slide decks and Excel spreadsheets abound. Others see storytelling as something reserved for personal time and not at
all part of their communication.

22 | Communicate Results
We push back on the notion that storytelling doesn't belong in communication. In fact,

we think it is more effective and supplies both the shared sense-making and underlying

communication of all that we do. As an example, the same business that denies the use of

storytelling may simultaneously pay millions of dollars for advertising in commercials that

feature entities and characters that are fictitious. The breakroom of the organization may

also contain a few people making sense of the new addition to the company handbook.

We can almost hear Lisa explaining to Kim what happened to Jerry at last year's holiday      Source: Image used under
party that prompted the handbook's update. The same employees will arrive at work fresh      license from Freestock.com
from listening to story-filled ballads in music, podcasts, news, and biographies. They most

assuredly spent the night before binge-watching streaming shows on cable, television, and smartphones. Perhaps they

even curled up with a good book. Storytelling is occurring for nearly everyone. The question remains how we use it for

ourselves.

Think about your own last 24 hours of story consumption. List all the forms you engaged in (biographies, books, gossip,

movies, music, podcasts, poems, streaming shows, and workplace conversations).

For our purposes, storytelling and narrative become fluid terms in practice that we place under a banner of sto-

rytelling. Storytelling describes processes by which communicators account for past experiences, support ideas with

framing, offer certain dream-casting visions for the future, justify values through real-world or fictitious examples, and

discuss leadership through verbal or written artifacts that describe those who have gone before, lead today, or are yet

to come (D'Abate & Alpert, 2017, Hansen, 2012). Further, we see storytelling as relating and meaning-making. This sup-

ports the work of narrative scholar Walter Fisher (1985), who first crafted this notion that stories connect the sender

and receiver. In summary, our influence, arguments, and ideas are a form of storytelling too. This doesn't mean we will

replace our Excel sheets with "Once upon a time . . . ," but it does mean we will examine how storytelling may help us

reach audiences.

Freytag's Pyramid for Storytelling

The fundamentals of storytelling are made more common to us by our constant absorption of them on a daily basis.
Aristotle himself noted that a story has a beginning, middle, and end. Later, Gustave Freytag, a German novelist and
playwright, developed a pyramid in the late 1800s that explains the familiar action of the story. Called Freytag's Pyra-
mid, it has since been adapted to describe the familiar patterns (see Figure 1.2) we see in many stories to this day. In the
beginning, we have the exposition or starting point of the story that sets the scene and establishes the characters. Next,
the rising action builds up the key moments in which the protagonist must face a crucial moment, otherwise known as
the climax or turning point. Next, the falling action ensues, which often contains the winding down of drama following
the climax as characters and circumstances fall into their new places. The resolution or denouement is considered the
end, where events conclude, takeaways and lessons are applied, and meaning is derived from the action.

Introducing Narratives to Frame Powerful Messages

Establishing the building blocks of storytelling alone does not help us connect our communication with storytelling. In
fact, there are times we might be called to utilize only a part of a story to convey the idea of our message. To discuss this
further, let's examine narratives as described by Fisher (1985). Narratives, known as Narrative Paradigm Theory, operate
from the basis that every speaker, both knowing and unknowing, is a storyteller and that we connect to each other via
these devices often and openly. In fact, as authors, we encourage students and interested practitioners to examine how
often others communicate using stories, imagery, descriptive narratives, or even looser examples of figurative language
such as metaphor or simile. Example: "I am so hungry, I could eat a horse!" While most audience members doubt that
we want to eat a horse when we make such a declarative statement, they do understand the implied meaning in our
message.

Seven Basic Plots to Every Story

As communicators, we often rely on such devices to better explain ourselves. In fact, we regularly utilize common nar­
ratives between sender and receiver. Christopher Booker, an English journalist and author, studied stories from across
the globe featured in books, movies, music, plays, and poems. Entitled The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories, Booker
(2004) recounted the common plots within most stories (as shown in Exhibit 1.5). These plots include overcoming the
monster, rags to riches, the quest, journey and return, comedy, tragedy, and rebirth. While most of our own stories have
purposes of their own, there are certainly elements of each that can be utilized to describe our experiences.

   You may still be struggling with how these narratives fit into your everyday storytelling academically, per-
sonally, or professionally. To get your creative juices going, we will provide some examples.

    · A rebirth story: Jim talks about the time he overcame the disruptions to his life while learning to
        manage his alcoholism.

    · A tragedy narrative: Suyeon discusses a brilliant yet fundamentally flawed supervisor, who was cruel
        to his subordinates and in turn was promptly dismissed after costing the company a lot of money.

                Oprah Winfrey's rise to fame.

Take a story that is important to you, could be meaningful to others, and which you would be willing to share, and con-
struct a story using just one of the plots. Refer back to Freytag's Pyramid on story structure. Keep in mind a basic story
needs a beginning, middle, and end. After constructing the story, find someone and share it with them. How did it go?

Ten Great Stories Every Leader Should Tell

Beyond those plots, author Paul Smith (2019) provided insight into common stories that organizational leaders should
utilize to connect with audience members. We have found these stories depicted in The 10 Stories Great Leaders Tell,
much like the previously discussed plots, to be insightful, interesting, and refreshing for eager audiences in workplace
cultures. These stories, described in Table 1.5, range from founding stories to the customer profiling of who we serve
stories. These 10 stories match the functions of most organizations to such a degree that at times they seem universal.
The work of Smith (2019) responds to the prevailing drive for professionals to engage in more storytelling while making
it predictable, recognizable, and most importantly, structured for those doing the work.

   It's important to remember that Smith's stories can be powerful tools to frame your argument. Frames follow the
structure of your argument and serve as a connecting theme or narrative to reinforce your ideas.

· For example, if you are developing a new product and pitching it within your organization, you could utilize the
   who we serve or what we do for our customers frames to discuss the idea. We might create the idea of Julia, an
   18-24-year-old female-identifying consumer who has an interest in apparel. Using Julia as our frame, we could
   describe her demographic, the buying power of that demographic when amassed globally in the billions, and how
   they are currently underserved for such products.

· A founder of a start-up could utilize a where we came from frame to discuss the history of the organization and
   returning to some of the fundamentals of customer service that helped create their products. They could also
   point to some much-needed innovation by using a why we can't stay here frame or talk about the future through a
   where are we going story.

        Think of how such stories can fit into your slides and data visualization. These narrative devices can be
     employed subtly, directly, or implicitly to reinforce your ideas without distracting the audience. Returning to
     the core of this chapter, utilizing story, frames, or narratives to encase your evidence fulfills the very notion of
     Aristotle's ethos, pathos, and logos.

Chapter 1 Summary

There has been a lot of information to process in this first chapter! You were introduced to multiple topics that provide
a foundation for audience-driven communication through data visualization. Special attention was placed on the power
of clarity to express ideas and data effectively.

   This chapter opens with Aristotle's credible speaker utilizing ethos, pathos, and logos--the experiences, emotions, and
motivations accompanying each speaker in their communication efforts. These factors make communication complex
and dynamic. Communication models serve as tools to organize the complexities of the interplay of communication and
to predict the connection between speaker and audience. The Transactional Model was highlighted specifically for its
recognition of the experience between sender and receiver utilizing demographics and psychographics.

   This chapter then turns to the powerful use of persuasion and storytelling to deliver effective messages. Strong com-
municators use a combination of direct and indirect persuasion models. Barbara Minto's (2021) Pyramid Principle, Mon-
roe's Motivated Sequence, and SCQA were highlighted for their ability to frame powerful messages.

   Our influence, arguments, and ideas are a form of storytelling. Storytelling in communication design is an effective
tool for an audience-centered experience. Storytelling frameworks such as Freytag's Pyramid for organization and
Christopher Booker's Seven Basic Plots for reasoning strengthen the speaker's intended message. An overview of differ-
ent types of narratives is provided to spark ideas for designing messages.

   Communicators need to analyze the intended audience. This chapter introduced you to the speaker's responsibilities
throughout the design process as well as the presentation of data. The Buffet Effect describes the cognitive overload
audiences might feel when looking at overwhelming (messy) data. Awareness of biases and audience perception are nec-
essary for reaching diverse audiences. How a speaker uses their own biases within their message also plays a role.

   Finally, having the proper means to display the information for our arguments, whether that be through direct or indi-
rect persuasion, is a fundamental responsibility of the author. Storytelling through data, data visualization techniques,
and presentation can connect the audience to a communicator's message. The following chapters will provide technical
instructions for collecting, designing, and displaying data to tell your story!

Chapter 1 Case: Utilizing Communication Resources for Problem-Solving

                              In this case project, you work with an enrollment dilemma faced by an organization: the Humphrey
                              School of Dentistry, a fictitious school with very real gender balance problems seen so often in
                              many organizations. You are tasked with coming up with a solution featuring your recommenda-
                              tions for solving this case drawn from Chapter 1 resources. Discuss audience-centered communi-
                              cation, persuasion models, and storytelling. Think carefully about how each of these important

28 | Communicate Results
aspects of communication supports your recommendation. You should approach this case from the vantage of problem-
solver and use any personal experience and research to support your efforts.

Case Objectives

 1. Identify communication models that predict connection and identification between speaker and audience.
2. Describe the various aspects of audience perception and of speaker and message, and conduct key analysis before

      creating or delivering a presentation.
3. Flex between direct and indirect persuasion models to deliver influential communication.
4. Listen critically to identify powerful narratives and use effective storytelling to frame meaningful messages.

Case Guidelines

Please read the following case and use the prompts to craft a recommendation for the Humphrey School of Dentistry.
   The Humphrey School of Dentistry is one of the finest dentistry schools in the world with a 150-year history, boasting

some of the most successful graduating dentists to find top work placements in the field. Humphrey is known for its
top-ranked career center and key internships for its students. Humphrey, part of the larger Acadia University system,
is also known for the many programs, services, and campus activities it offers to its students and alumni. Humphrey
regularly graduates 200+ dentists a year, only 35 of whom identify as female or non-gender-specifying graduates. These
students represent a total of 17% of the overall graduating class, far smaller than the 34% of nonmales that make up the
dental field.

   Many Humphrey classrooms are filled with dental students who are overwhelmingly male. This statistic concerns
Dean Gupta, a dentist and scholar as well as the first woman appointed to lead the Humphrey School in all its history.
This very literal and observable gender imbalance is acutely noticeable to Dean Gupta as she walks across the Acadia
University campus, which conversely has a campus student body composition that is 55% female. Dean Gupta is no
stranger to gender imbalance from her own academic and professional experience and wants to see Humphrey actively
work through this issue, and she has tasked your group with making a recommendation.

   Use the following prompts to guide your completion of the case.

 1. Audience: Evaluate the multiple audiences that may be present in this case. Consider expansively how we might
      determine those audiences internally or externally and potential ways to gain further information from those audi-
      ences as necessary.

2. Data gathering and analysis: Conduct research to collect the relevant data and information related to the case.
      Critically evaluate the data to ensure credibility and accuracy. Much like the case, your quest for information may
      be incomplete in part, but do the best you can to find necessary information to begin to formulate a recommenda-
      tion.

3. Recommendation: Utilize evidence, research findings, insights from your data collection, and personal experience
      to formulate a solution for the Humphrey School and for Dean Gupta to evaluate. This recommendation can be as
      expansive or as limited as you determine it needs to be when considering what is most appropriate for the audi-
      ence.

4. Persuasion: This initial case requires you to convince the Humphrey School, and more specifically Dean Gupta,
      about your recommendation. Given your knowledge of Dean Gupta and her role as an insider and decider, con-
      sider how direct persuasion via the Pyramid Principle will be effective. As you consider the implementation of your
      plan long-term after it has been adopted, is there a way that indirect persuasion via Monroe's Motivated Sequence

                                                                                                                                                      Communicate Results | 29
      could be helpful?
5. Storytelling and narrative: Create a compelling narrative that effectively communicates the information discussed

      in your recommendation. Think expansively about how storytelling and narrative can play a part in helping con-
      vince audience members.
6. Assessment: Consider how the communication tools from Chapter 1 have assisted your problem-solving. Discuss
      the different ways that such tools can be helpful in your day-to-day organizational leadership personally and pro-
      fessionally.

   Post your narrative. Be prepared to discuss how you use the communication tools in your own leadership.

       Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it
       to completion.

          --Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric

          What Do You Think?
          Callie Noble started working at the United Way in 2018, and her first assignment was building reports for
       Vigo County about ALICE families. ALICE is an acronym for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed.
       Essentially, an ALICE family earns more than the federal poverty level but less than the basic cost of living in
       the county. Callie has lots of great data, and her team worked diligently to create reports but soon realized
       that they needed to visualize their data to connect with their social media-based audiences to increase
       awareness of this issue. Their first report shows 2016 data. The research center shows information for 2023
       and a 2024 update.

Introduction

                                                        According to Al Shalloway, CEO of Net Objectives, "[Data] visual-

                                                        (Twitter, Feb 12, 2014). Probably not what you were expecting right?

                                                        a campfire. Does this memory trigger all kinds of senses that help

                                                        you remember the story? According to statistics, 65% of the popu-

                                                        lation consists of visual learners (Zopf et al., 2004).

                                                        The setting here is a campfire, but the real art comes in the story-

                                                        telling: "Storytelling requires an understanding of your audience,

                                                        your topic, and your goal" (Dale Carnegie, 2018, p. 6). Connecting

                                                        your storytelling to your audience's senses helps them remember it.

2.1 The Art of Storytelling When Data Are Complex

       Every great design begins with an even better story.
          --Lorinda Mamo, designer

We live in an era where an overwhelming amount of information surrounds us, creating a vast and constantly expanding
sea of facts and figures. Decision-makers often find it challenging to navigate in this environment of excessive infor-
mation, commonly referred to as "too much information" (TMI). The concept of information overload and the phrase
"information explosion" gained recognition as early as the 1960s. Alvin Toffler, a renowned "futurist," popularized these
terms in his book Future Shock, published in 1970.

   With the advancement of technology, particularly the rise of HTML and the internet in the 1980s and 1990s, the chan-
nels for accessing and sharing information multiplied. From RSS feeds and email to instant messaging, tweets, blogs, and
social media platforms like Facebook, the ease of creating and disseminating information led to a sense of being over-
whelmed. This abundance of information often leads to distraction and loss of focus.

   To describe the challenges faced by decision-makers in this environment, several terms emerged. Infoxication, infobe­
sity, data smog, and information anxiety are some of the terms used to denote the combination of TMI, duplication of
data, misplacement of data, and the resulting anxiety and difficulty in staying focused.

   In summary, the exponential growth of available information, coupled with technological advancements and the pro-
liferation of communication channels, has created a scenario where decision-makers face challenges in effectively pro-
cessing and making sense of the overwhelming amount of data surrounding them.

When Data Find Their Voice

We know complex data hold immense potential to generate efficiencies, expand markets, and empower discover-
ies--driving software developers to find new ways of making data visualization easier to create. For example, when you
upload an Excel file into Power Business Intelligence (BI), you can quickly get insights on those data with a click of a but-
ton. However, don't expect to throw lots of graphs on a slide deck and have the audience understand them as well as you
do. The more complex a problem, the easier it is to leave your audience disengaged or yearning for clarity. It is at this
juncture that the power of storytelling shines, offering a path through the tangle of complexity, transforming numbers
and concepts into relatable "human" stories.

   Effective storytelling requires the storyteller to unravel the intricacies and nuances of the data, but they must also
possess the skill to distill the "complexity" into a narrative and visualization that resonates with the audience. The pur-
poseful weaving of visualizations with effective storytelling creates the bridge to audience understanding, but more
importantly, it sets the path so the audience is willing to take a journey of understanding and discovery. Cognitive psy-
chologist Jerome Bruner suggests, "We are 22 times more likely to remember a fact when it has been wrapped in a story"
(Harrison, 2015, para. 3). In the past two decades, organizations have embraced the importance of data visualization to
the point where data visualization skills are required of all managers. Data are driving this change as decision-makers
increasingly rely on data. Let's look at an example of how design thinking has become a tool for innovation.

                        At Boeing, managers of the Osprey program needed to improve the aircraft's takeoffs and

                        landings, but every time the plane taxis off the runway or lands, the "sensors create a terabyte

                        gress" (Berinato, 2016, para 2). When Ryan Kiggins (2016) presented at the Global Product Data

                        Interoperability Summit, he shared his role at Boeing, which included "design thinking trainer

                        and facilitator" and why design thinking should become part of an organization's culture and

generated by               Incorporating design thinking into data storytelling and data visualizations can lead to a
Copilot--Public Domain
                        user-centric, engaging, and memorable experience that enhances clarity, comprehension, and

                        impact. Stories like this reinforce why storytelling is so important.

There are compelling reasons to combine storytelling with data visualization using design thinking. Design thinking, a

concept introduced by Tim Brown (2008) in his Harvard Business Review article, has become a widely adopted approach

in various organizations to gain a deeper understanding of the user, customer, or client needs. According to Esther Han

(2022) of Harvard Business School Online, "Design thinking is a mindset and approach to problem-solving and innova-

tion anchored around human-centered design" (para 5). It prioritizes understanding the needs and experiences of users

or customers (Kitch, 2023). It puts user needs at the center and provides a way to help storytellers understand their

audience. The fundamental nature of design thinking lies in its five-stage process, often associated with creating a prod-

uct. The five-stage process is (1) empathize, (2) define, (3) ideate, (4) prototype, and (5) test.

One of the key contributions of design thinking is the cultivation of empathy. How do you create empathy in story-

telling? It starts with knowing your audience through user research, persona development, storytelling from the user's

perspective, and incorporating elements that evoke emotional appeal.

Supporters of design thinking as part of the data visualization process are laser-focused on knowing the audience.

One such supporter of design thinking is Google. According to Pferdt (2019), "At Google, design thinking helps us foster a

culture of innovation, and lets our teams generate and test ideas creatively and effectively" (para. 3). Google storytellers

use three principles of design thinking: (1) empathy: know your audience; (2) expansive thinking: consider different per-

spectives; and (3) experimentation: practice before an audience and be willing to embrace constructive criticism and/

or feedback (Konrad, 2023). Essentially, using the three principles from Google's design thinking allows you to prototype

your presentation. And keep in mind, a story that works for one audience might not work for another! And what happens

when the data has to speak for itself?

                  Data visualization is a process where complexity meets creativity, where data find their voice, and
               where storytelling becomes the compass.

Start with setting up the story so data can find their voice. In the realm of data visualization, the story lies in the weave
of visual elements and words to form a cohesive narrative. The challenge lies in ensuring that our visualizations can
still tell a compelling story even when we are not physically present to guide the audience. Data in their raw form sel-
dom evoke emotions or captivate attention. Unlocking the power of visualization transcends numbers and statistics,
giving data their own voice. The answer lies in carefully considering the elements that make up a compelling narrative.
Design thinking encompasses design choices for a specific audience and thoughtful arrangement of visual elements to
contribute to the story being told.

   The following list conveys the compelling reasons to use design thinking when your main goal is to use data visualiza-
tions to tell a story, and you are not physically with the audience:

             1. Contextualization
                       Example 1: The design must be relevant to the audience and include real-life examples and ministories

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 35
                    that annotate the text. For example, using apps like ThingLink to pop up information. (Besides text,
                    ThingLink can also pop up video or audio files.)

                       Example 2: Prerecorded video narrative to explain key insights, serve as a guide, and include a video
                    description. For example, provide a link to a YouTube video to provide components of the story.

                       Example 3: Make sure the story arc takes your audience on an emotional journey. In Linda DeLuca's
                    (2018) article "How Story Arcs Help You Design a Better Presentation," she presents six common story
                    arcs. DeLuca doesn't share these six as the only structures available; instead, she suggests, "It's not as
                    important to use a particular arc, but rather to understand that stories have shapes" (para. 12). So if you
                    are not physically present for the storytelling, explore ways to shape the story arc. It might include back-
                    ground music, video, and short animated clips. A story arc structure connects to design thinking in the
                    context but also in the retention and comprehension. In a story arc, the storyteller sets the context,
                    establishes empathy, and connects with the audience. Think of the story arc as an overlay. It should create
                    a foundation of understanding, just as design thinking emphasizes understanding the users and perspec-
                    tives.
             2. Engagement

                       Example 1: Interactive platforms that allow the audience to explore. For example, a dashboard that
                    allows the user to interact and learn more.

                       Example 2: Interactive elements--tooltips, filters, and linked visualizations that provide additional infor-
                    mation.

                       Example 3: Expansive thinking where you have existing Q&A prompts (essentially thinking of the ques-
                    tions the audience will ask) or have a platform like Power BI that has live query capability.

                       Example 4: Use foreshadowing to build anticipation and suspense by gradually revealing insights or
                    trends in data. This aspect of engagement is somewhat game-like.
             3. Emotional connection

                       Example 1: Use expansive thinking to embrace creativity and innovation by incorporating metaphors,
                    analogies, or storytelling devices like anecdotes, personification of data, and symbolism (visual cues that
                    make sense like stoplight colors or gauges).

                       Example 2: Use design thinking principles of prototyping. For example, finding data's true voice may
                    require multiple iterations and feedback loops, essentially testing different visualizations to refine and
                    evolve the data's voice to connect to the audience.

                       Example 3: Considering ethical and social implications. By integrating ethical considerations, the data's
                    voice can become more responsible, inclusive, and accountable.
             4. Simplification and clarity (remove ambiguity)

                       Example 1: By fostering collaboration and diverse perspectives, design (expansive) thinking ensures a
                    more comprehensive and better representation of the data's voice. For example, a CPA can clearly under-
                    stand all aspects of ratio analysis, but a nonaccountant might struggle with the interpretation. That's why
                    it's important that an accountant creating a data visualization considers collaborating with nonaccoun-
                    tants, especially if the audience is mostly nonaccountants.
             5. Guiding attention and focus

                       Example 1: Use design thinking to identify desired outcomes. For example, if the organization uses key
                    performance indicators (KPIs) in current reports, use KPIs in visualizations. Use components your audi-
                    ence will recognize.

                       Example 2: Use design thinking to connect to feasibility by considering current goals and strategies.
             6. Retention and comprehension

                       Example 1: Use design thinking to consider the personalization of the user's experience. For example,
                    a technique that uses personalization of data-driven storytelling is possible by responding to the user's
                    cues to guide the individual user through the narrative. This just means that the user makes a choice

36 | What Is Data Visualization?
                    based on their preference and that decision drives the storytelling narrative. As a user, I gain comprehen-
                    sion of what I find important.

                       Example 2: Use design thinking to test your data visualization. For example, use a pilot audience to test
                    your data visualization where you are not physically with the data visualization. Then use eye-tracking
                    technology or analyze user interactions and engagement patterns. This can provide insights into where
                    users focus their attention, how they navigate through content, and where they interact with elements.

                       Example 3: Use design thinking to test retention. For example, conduct a follow-up of your pilot audi-
                    ence with open-ended questions to gauge their recollection of key insights.
   In data storytelling, the framework should start with a captivating introduction, a clear problem statement, a climax
(like the most important findings or insights), supporting evidence, and a memorable conclusion that contextualizes the
problem. The key thing to remember is that data storytelling is not the same thing as data visualization. Visuals are an
element of the process.
   Before we go further, let's look at a simple example to define what is meant by data, information, and insights shown
in Table 2.1.
   Table 2.1: Examples of Drilling to Insights

Example  Example of Information                          Example of Insights

   The main components of an engaging story include plot, characters, setting, theme, conflict, point of view, narrative
style, conflict resolution, pacing, and dialogue. It is important to note that the framework you use to tell a story depends
on the topic and the audience. At their basic core, stories have a beginning, middle, and end. This text will weave "telling
stories" throughout each chapter as you learn to create dynamic data visualizations. It takes practice to be good at both
and even more practice to integrate the two.

   For more than two decades, data storytelling consultants have played a crucial role as intermediaries, bridging the
gap between data and decision-makers. Their expertise lies in presenting the right information in a compelling manner.
To gain insights into the possibilities of data storytelling, we can explore the examples shared by these consultants on
their websites. Numerous consultants exist in the field, including Storytelling With Data, Duarte, and Juice Analytics.

   Zach Gemignani (2023) of Juice Analytics showcases an intriguing blog topic titled "How to Summarize Data Using
ChatGPT," which demonstrates the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in storytelling. This highlights the growing
trend of consultants embracing AI technologies to enhance their data storytelling capabilities. AI can assist in data
analysis, pattern recognition, and even generating narratives, thereby augmenting the storytelling process.

   Furthermore, it is worth noting that some consultants have evolved their focus to emphasize using data for social
good. Examples include Viz for Social Good and Periscopic: Do Good With Data, where consultants aim to apply data
storytelling techniques to address social and environmental challenges.

   Overall, these consultants offer a wealth of resources and workshops.

board), the creator may employ data-driven animations to enhance the narrative. To see an example of this, review Neil

When to Not Use Data Storytelling

While visuals are an essential part of data storytelling, visuals are used to inform, explore, or analyze the data. For exam-
ple, a weekly meeting that reports facts or a status report is most likely used to inform. Informative data are usually
broad, while insightful data are deep. Some data communication doesn't work well with data storytelling. For example, if
your dashboard updates continuously or is automated frequently (like daily), it's hard to tell a story because the data are
changing. An interactive dashboard allows the user to explore and discover their own insights, and during this explo-
ration stage, they don't need a data storyteller. Let's look at a comparison in Table 2.2 of when less storytelling is needed
and when to use data storytelling.

   Table 2.2: Is Storytelling Needed in Every Situation?

Less Storytelling Needed             Use Data Storytelling

Data are informative                 Data are insightful

Purpose is exploratory               Purpose is explanatory

Data are concrete (raw data tables)  Concrete data for context

Data updated continuously            Abstract data visualizations for insight

Consider if your friend gave you the entire week's forecast if you asked, "Should I bring an umbrella today?" So what is
the difference between concrete and abstract data? A few definitions are in order to support Table 2.2.

   Concrete data in data visualization refers to the actual dataset that is being visualized. It includes the raw data points,
their attributes, and their values. For example, a dataset would contain concrete sales figures for different products over
time. In the context of storytelling with data, concrete data refers to the specific facts, figures, and statistics that are
present to support the narrative. As a rule of thumb, always compare with prior periods (month, quarter, year) to easily
see growth or contraction. Revenue trends are considered concrete data.

   Abstract data in data visualization refers to the high-level representation and organization of data for visualization
purposes. Essentially it involves transforming concrete data into a visual form that can be easily understood and inter-
preted. It entails selecting the appropriate visualization technique--like a chart, graph, map, or infographic--to convey

38 | What Is Data Visualization?
insight and patterns in the data. The abstract data capture the overall story or narrative that the visualization aims to
communicate.

Data Storytelling Framework Templates

To assist with your storytelling skill, let's look at a few data storytelling frameworks. Frameworks adopt a model of sto-
rytelling and how data can be integrated within the story. The acronyms define a key focus area, provide structure, and
ensure a logical flow that engages your audience. Some models will fit your situation and data better than others. In the
next section, we provide an example of a modified framework template (context, audience, story, and situation) and how
to use it. You can also find it in the PowerPoint file that accompanies this chapter.

CASS: A Data Storytelling Framework Template

Review Figure 2.1 to see the modified (context, audience, story, and situation) CASS template. This framework combines
several of the models and is a great template to evaluate existing data storytelling or build your own storytelling with
data when you have a large dataset with several insights to share.

   Context--Determines how the data will be shown (trends, correlations, comparisons), including variables, the need for
variables to change, the "how" variables that need to change, and the "so what" (essentially, what are the consequences
of change or no change?).

   Audience--Who makes up the audience, and who are the decision-makers? How are the data relevant? What infor-
mation do decision-makers already know about this topic?

   Story--How are the data used to frame the story or make your point? How is the story engaging? What characters
motivate the audience to make a change? How is the problem linked to changes, and why does it change now? What
story structure sequences the events so the audience understands the key insights?

   Situation--Is the design framed in a relevant format for the visual content, and does it meet the audience's expecta-
tions? Does data transformation engage and motivate the audience? How does the story frame the data? This framework
has 10 key criteria for the data storyteller to consider:

             1. Are the data valid and relevant (for this situation)?
             2. Are the data credible?
             3. Do the data support an action or decision? (#3 and #4 work together)
             4. Do the data support desirability, feasibility, and viability?

                       a. Desirability refers to the degree to which a data visualization or data storytelling approach meets the
                    needs and expectations of its intended audience. It involves understanding the preferences, goals, and
                    requirements of the users or audience.

                       b. Feasibility refers to the practicality and achievability of implementing a data visualization or data sto-
                    rytelling concept. It involves considering the available resources, technical capabilities, and constraints.

                       c. Viability refers to the sustainability and long-term success of a data visualization or data storytelling
                    initiative. Viability considers factors such as the value proposition, potential impact, scalability, and align-
                    ment with the goals and objectives of the organization and its stakeholders.
             5. Do all visuals use an appropriate scale (and avoid other manipulations)?
             6. Are the data insightful? (Do they successfully transform concrete data into abstract visualizations?)
             7. Are the data self-explanatory, and are there enough data to provide context?
             8. Do the data support an emotional connection?
             9. Does the story arc support retention and comprehension?
             10. Was the data storytelling tested on a pilot group?

tions, let's use Wes O'Donnell's Information Is Beautiful: How Data Visualization Will Save the World (2015) for an exam-
ple. Please watch the video before you review the completed CASS template (Figure 2.2).

                      1. You will notice a few items with questions in the CASS template. The first issue is in the audience sec-

                   tion. Under the decision prompt, where or what is the call to action? Is the purpose to build an awareness
                   of how climate change will impact our great-grandchildren?

                      2. The 10 criteria help determine the data validity, credibility, and so on. There are two areas where it is
          unclear. The first item still in question is "focus on desirability, feasibility, and viability," which may be an issue
          because it is not clear whether a call to action is made or is not clearly stated. The second item is "tested on pilot
          group." Wes O'Donnell's presentation was made at an independent TED Talk in Muskegon; however, it's unsure if
          he tested his presentation on a pilot group.
   Fun Fact: If you recognize Wes O'Donnell's name, he is an occasional TV cohost on Mysteries Decoded!

2.2 The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Data Visualizations

       The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures.
          --Ben Shneiderman, American computer scientist

The purpose of this section is to compare the good, the bad, and the ugly of data visualizations, but let's discuss and
define the terms good, bad, and ugly in a data storytelling context.

   Good data visualization represents projects that effectively communicate and clarify complex data. It avoids issues
found in a bad data visualization or an ugly data visualization. Reviewing the CASS template in Figure 2.1, a good data
visualization has these characteristics about data:

 1. data tell the truth, and visuals use appropriate scale;
2. data are valid, accurate, relatable, and credible;
3. data are insightful, explanatory, and concrete;
4. data are transparent and supports the action or decision; and
5. the consumer of the data is provided with relevant context that impacts the data (e.g., maps are representative of

      population density centers).

   Bad data visualization represents projects that are incomplete or contain misleading information or incorrect con-
clusions. Data storytellers should never lie or misrepresent the data. In bad data visualizations, storytellers might exag-
gerate or downplay certain data points, distorting the story. Other characteristics of bad data visualization are when
storytellers cherry-pick, manipulate (like compressing the scale), mislabel, or intentionally hide some data. Some bad
data visualization projects cross the ethical line.

   An ugly data visualization refers to a project that usually has overly cluttered charts, excessive labels, ambiguous
color schemes, and crowded graphs. In some cases, it might have correct data, but the wrong type of chart was used.
Some storytellers might be inconsistent without realizing it. If the inconsistency is intentional, it moves from ugly to
bad.

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 43
   A good data visualization storytelling project provides contextualization, engagement and an emotional connection,
clarity to complex data, and guides attention and focus. In addition, the story should flow logically with a story arc
structure and summarization that supports comprehension and retention. Every data visualization storytelling project
should be designed to create a compelling and impactful narrative that effectively communicates data-driven insights
to your audience. Data projects can be static and simple (like infographics) or complex with interactive elements.

Did You Unintentionally Mislead Your Audience?

You work with charts every day, but did you realize you could mislead your viewer by using count instead of frequency?
The best way to demonstrate this is to show you! Comparative bar charts provide a visual comparison of univariate, cat-
egorical data for two or more groups.

   Each year the Princeton Review conducts a survey. One of the questions is asked to parents and students. It is, "Ideally,
how far from home would you like the college you (your child) attend(s) to be?" As you might expect, parents and stu-
dents do not agree. Let's look at the frequency table along with the relative frequency table. Frequency measures how
often a particular event occurs (essentially the count). In Figure 2.3, 2,878 students and 1,230 parents voted that an ideal
college is less than 250 miles from home. Relative frequency indicates a proportion in relation to the total (shown as a
percentage).

   Figure 2.3--Showing Count and Frequency for Students and Parents
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author adaptation
                                                                                                                                                          of data from Princeton
                                                                                                                                                          Review College Hopes &
                                                                                                                                                          Worries Survey Report
                                                                                                                                                          (2019)

   So 2,878/9,282 = .31 (or 31% of students voted for a college less than 250 miles from home).
   And 1,230/2,618 = .47 (or 47% of parents voted for a college less than 250 miles from home).

44 | What Is Data Visualization?
   Now let's look at the two charts. Both charts have a clear title, an appropriate legend, and appropriate labels, and the
column colors make sense. But using count is inappropriate since the sample size is not the same.

Next, let's look at some charts that work with the same data but represent the good, the bad, and the ugly (Exhibit 2.2).
These charts were created in Power BI and show the results of a year of revenue for eight salespeople. The key point
here is that you can use very powerful software to create your dashboard and still have bad and ugly data visualizations
if you don't use the right charts, correct scales, or good design protocols.

   Exhibit 2.2--The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly in Power BI Charts

                                                                                   What Is Data Visualization? | 45

   There is room for improvement in all the charts. For example, if this is a stand-alone chart on a slide, adding the year
and company name would be appropriate. However, if the chart resides on a dashboard, the year and name can be at
the top of the dashboard and the chart doesn't need them.

Does Your Pie Graph Add Up to 100%?

Figure 2.4 was modeled from a chart shown on a news broadcast in 2012. The names shown on the broadcast are
removed. Although the intent was to show the closeness of the race, pie charts should always add up to 100%. Notice
that this one does not. This one also falls under the category of bad and ugly: bad because the pie chart doesn't add up
to 100% and ugly because the colors might unintentionally sway the audience to think more positively of one candidate
over another. The colors used here duplicate the chart shown during the news broadcast. Both pie charts and doughnut
charts should be avoided. Your audience will struggle to estimate a quantity from angles, and matching labels to the
slices can be especially difficult if you have small percentages--and that small percentage might be important!

                                                                                                Note: Author Illustration

Did Your Image Size or Proportion Mislead Your Audience?

   Figure 2.5 shows another misleading graphic where size matters. The news station misled the audience because the
size was not depicted in actual proportions. The following was a graph showing gas prices with the highest price in Cal-
ifornia and the lowest in Mississippi. But notice the misuse of proportion.

   Figure 2.5--Misuse of Proportion: Bad Chart
                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration

Did the Scale Used in the Graph Mislead Your Audience?

   The same news channel produced a graph that did not have the scale set to zero. In Exhibit 2.3, the chart on the left
shows the axis scale starting at 32% and the chart on the right shows the scale starting at 0.00%. I'm sure you can see
that the chart on the left is misleading!

   Now that you have seen examples of good, bad, and ugly data visualizations, let's see if you can differentiate them in
the following exercise.

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 47

2.3 The Four Pillars of Visualization Work Better With Context

       Visualization and belief in a pattern of reality activates the creative power of realization.
          --A. L. Linall Jr.

Now that you have seen how good, bad, and ugly data visualizations are prevalent, let's take a step into becoming a
data storyteller. If you've been creating PowerPoints at your organization, you have certainly told a story. But how well
did you tell that story? Did you use the best visualization techniques to tell it? Creating your own infographic or data
visualization may start with available templates (much like PowerPoint slide decks or infographic templates in an info-
graphic app). Do you remember the first time you learned PowerPoint? Did you explore one PowerPoint theme design
after another or have trouble modifying an existing slide deck to make it "fit" your purpose? When you start creating
your own data visualizations, don't be surprised at how often you need to fall back on good data visualization design
techniques like those presented by Noah Iliinsky. Noah Iliinsky, a data visualization expert, cautions how quickly a pre-
senter can get off track.

   When Larry Swanson of Content Strategy Insights asked, "Are there benchmarks, or how do you know you're on
track?" Iliinsky answered, "It goes back to purpose, know your customer and what they care about" (Swanson, 2020, Pod-
cast 89--24:32). You must start with the purpose and be able to check off the "why," "who," and "what does my audience
need" to understand (What actions do you want to support? What is the most important takeaway message? How will it
be consumed?). The more specifically you drill down to purpose, the better. As shown in Exhibit 2.4, before building an
interactive data visualization, make sure to embrace Noah Iliinsky's four pillars of visualization with an added compo-
nent of context.

   Exhibit 2.4--Iliinsky's Four Pillars Plus Context

Iliinsky's Four Pillars of Visualization  Plus Context Equals Elevated Understanding

·Purpose,
   ·Content (what to visualize),
   ·Structure (how to visualize it)
   ·Format (appeal and focus).

In this case, context means making the topic easier to understand by giving extra information about the time, place,

48 | What Is Data Visualization?
situation, history, background, and so on. That's part of the storytelling process! So how does storytelling relate to inter-
active data visualizations?

mation Is Beautiful website, shares a graphic that interacts when you roll your mouse over certain areas to give you
more details. McCandess considers all the aspects of data visualization but includes more of the storytelling components
than Noah Iliinsky.

                    According to McCandess (2020), to have a successful visualization you need (1) good and accurate infor-
                 mation, (2) the goal of visualization, (3) the story or concept that accompanies the visualization, and (4) the
actual visual form that works best for the visualization.

                          How would you complete the four pillars + context (see Exhibit 2.4) to help the ALICE team present
     their data in a social media post?

2.4 Infographic Basics

       The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.
          --John Wilder Tukey, American mathematician and statistician

To begin, let's look at the simplest data visualization--an infographic. An infographic is a graphical representation
intended to communicate information in a concise and meaningful way. Most infographics are "static," but the trend is
moving toward interactive infographics.

   You have probably used infographics more than you think! According to an old study by Levie & Lentz (1982), people
following directions with text and illustrations do 323% better than people following directions without illustrations (p.
195-232). Perhaps you've assembled something using diagrams--think about your experience if the instructions were all
text describing what needed to be done. Did the visual help you understand each step?

   You expect infographics to take visual form in social media, but don't be surprised to see them in scientific communi-
cation to explore datasets and communicate findings on websites, theses, dissertations, and resumes (Jaleniauskiene &
Kasperiuniene, 2023).

   The designs of infographics range from very simple to complex, but all include content and visual elements. It
takes practice before it becomes a basic digital skill. Studies across several disciplines (computer science, education,
health sciences, digital marketing and media management, sociology, mathematics, ESL, and sports management) show
that students who learned to create or analyze infographics "gained metacognitive strategies, better recall, enhanced

50 | What Is Data Visualization?
depth of understanding, better communication skills, and saw the process as engaging and enjoyable" (Jaleniauskiene &
Kasperiuniene, 2023, p. 200)!

   According to Beegle (2013), the "best infographics build a narrative in much the same way a story does, starting with
the premise and then revealing something new at each turn" (p. 65). In Figure 2.6, the infographic reveals layers of infor-
mation about immigrants. The use of flags brings the user focus to the immigrant's country of origin. There are charts
to show the education attainment level and the percentage of immigrants who speak English proficiently. In addition,
the infographic indicates how much immigrants contribute to Indiana's economy through taxes paid. As you look at this
chart, what other information would you consider including or would you want to know?

The Simplest Evaluation of an Infographic

The first step to creating an infographic and then evaluating it is a simple process of informing yourself using the 5 Ws
(who, what, when, where, and why). Use the 5 Ws to help convey information in a relevant way. In this illustration (Figure
2.6), let's go through the 5 Ws.

   Figure 2.6--How to Use the 5 Ws to Review an Infographic

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 51

Who?--immigrants in Indiana
   What?--raise awareness
   When?--2019 data
   Where?--Indiana
   Why?--bring awareness of education levels and contribution to Indiana's economy
   This illustration was made in the app Venngage, using source information from the American Immigration Council. All

infographic software has a variety of icons that are available for use, but it also includes great charting tools.
   The next step is analyzing some existing infographics. Just doing a search on infographics will yield all kinds of ideas

in both design and content. Notice the use of color, symbols, and images. Ignore interactive infographics for now.
   Try to gain a sense of an infographic that tells a story that prompts emotional tension. As you search for an infographic

you like, see if you can pick out the 5 Ws. If you find one that you don't understand, see if you can do a little research to
52 | What Is Data Visualization?
find the context. An infographic is not good if it doesn't meet the definition (communicating information in a concise and
meaningful way). It's like hearing a story without knowing all the characters. And more importantly, infographics should
contain a driver or "call to action."

   To illustrate the importance of context, look at Exhibit 2.5, where both infographics are from the Wabash Valley United
Way's Facebook presence. Are these graphics designed to raise awareness (educational) or do they call you to do some-
thing?

   Exhibit 2.5--Do These Infographics Have a Call to Action?

ALICE!

Note that these infographics are specific to the Wabash Valley in Indiana; therefore, someone from a different state
might not understand the context of ALICE since not all states have adopted the ALICE project. If you visit the United
Way of the Wabash Valley, you will find reference to their bold goal--to move 10,000 families out of financial struggles
and into stability along with a very visual strategic plan.

Key Components to Evaluating an Infographic

Keep in mind that "80% of learning takes place visually; the average person retains only 20% of what is read when it's
delivered in text-only format; images on Facebook are liked 200% more than text [and perhaps most important for your
organization]; websites register a 12% increase in traffic after publishing an infographic" (Beegel, 2014, p. 8-9). But per-

                                                                                            What Is Data Visualization? | 53
haps the most important characteristic of an infographic is presenting complex information in a way that is easily under-
stood.

   The Encyclopedia of World Problems & Human Potential (UIA.org) identifies the proliferation of information using
new terms like infoxication, infobesity, and data smog. Interestingly, the UIA connects this problem to the UN Sustain-
able Development Goal #12, Responsible Consumption and Production, and the UN Sustainable Development Goal #16,
Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. So what do data smog, infoxication, and infobesity have to do with infographics?

   All three terms describe information overload. An infographic can cut through information overload, separate the sig-
nal from the noise, and break down complex information into bite-sized chunks making it easier for your infographic
audience to understand and retain key insights without feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information avail-
able.

Infographic Basic Components

Regardless of the type of infographic, every infographic should have the same basic components or considerations, and
Figure 2.7 provides a good checklist to assess a basic infographic. The checklist is a compilation of Beegle (2014) and
Wallace (2015).

   Figure 2.7--Infographic Quality Checklist for Basic Infographics
                                                                                               Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                               (2024)

Infographic Components--Sound or Video

Other basic components will apply if you create an infographic with motion, sound, or interaction. If you move past the
static infographic, consider these additional components as shown in Table 2.4.

     ensure understanding of the information presented in charts and infographics

                          Part 1: Find a static infographic from your organization. Use the basic design criteria listed in
                       this section to evaluate it. Share the image and discuss what changes you would make to improve
                       it. Part 2: Now use the CASS template to review the same infographic. What differences are
                       observed?

Types of Infographics

There are a variety of infographics, and the type of infographic you build will be driven by what works best for your
message. Let's review a few of these with examples.

  · Statistical infographics: This type of infographic uses charts, multiple types of graphs, and people icons repre-
      senting numbers to present statistical data in a clear and concise manner. For example, assume you want to look at
      pay between men and women in the United States. Start with the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The 2020 data
      show a gap in earnings where women earned 82.3% of men's pay (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). What other
      statistics might you want to highlight?
                                   Earnings from Current Population Survey (CPS). Link to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:
                                https://www.bls.gov/cps/earnings.htm
                                   Examples of statistical infographics will be shared in Chapter 3 of this textbook.

  · Process infographics: This type of infographic shows a step-by-step visual guide to explain a process or instruc-
      tion. So infographics that show a flowchart, a timeline, or step-by-step instructions would fit here. For example,
      the flowchart shown in Figure 2.8 shows the process for submission of an article to a journal and all the steps nec-
      essary for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

                                                                                                                                                          (2022)

  · Timeline infographics: These types of infographics have a chronological layout to represent historical events, and
      time-related information. They can also be interactive where the user sees additional details by hovering over
      some part of the timeline. For example, in Figure 2.9, hovering the mouse over the icon in 2021-2022 explains what
      faculty gain by understanding their top five strengths from taking Gallop's Strength Finder test.

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 57
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                                          (2025)

  · Interactive infographics: These types of infographics are most often interactive allowing the user to interact and
      dive deeper into the information. Interactive infographics work well for large datasets (like census data).
      An example of a simple interactive infographic starts with a basic infographic but adds interaction using an app
      called ThingLink. Essentially, when the user hovers over or clicks the icon, the user is given additional informa-
      tion. Figure 2.9 shows a static version of the infographic, but the pop-up links can provide additional information,
      even video!
                    ThingLink: An app-based program to engage and inform your audience. Link: http://www.thinglink.com
                    What is ThingLink? ThingLink is an app-based program for annotating digital items. You add an icon to
                 tag your item and can incorporate rich media. The multimedia editor allows a user to quickly create inter-
                 active images, videos, and self-guided tours. A user can also create a branching scenario for training, and
          even develop augmented reality (AR)! ThingLink is a great app for creating road maps or walking tours to incor-
          porate text, audio, and videos. Figure 2.10 shows a basic use of ThingLink.

                                                  (2020)

· Comparison infographics: These types of infographics compare two or more concepts side-by-side using visuals
   to highlight similarities and differences.
   An example of this type of infographic might be management versus leadership skills, comparing two companies,
   or comparing two products. Some comparison infographics will include a Venn diagram, so the user sees the over-
   lap between the two categories. Figure 2.11 compares inductive to deductive reasoning.

Figure 2.11--Example of a Comparison Infographic

                                                  Note: Kuhlman &

          Another good example of a comparison infographic is a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and
          Threats) or PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental). PESTLE is used to gain
          a macro picture of an industry. More about SWOT and PESTLE will be discussed in the next chapters.
  · Geographical infographics: These types of infographics use maps to visualize information. For example, the info-
      graphic in Figure 2.12 shows male and female participants by country. See how much easier it is to determine the
      information with a map instead of a table of numbers? This infographic was created in Power BI.
   Caution: Most Excel dashboards use a type of filtering called "slicers." The same application in Power BI is more pow-
erful because everything serves as a filter. No matter where you click, you drill down into more information. As you build
a dashboard in either Excel or Power BI, you may want to consider restricting some of the filtering that loses focus of
the purpose. Restrictive filtering just means that you lock down certain features (or hide some filters) so the user doesn't
get lost or misinterpret the data.
   Maps are powerful, and the more powerful the map, the greater the need to know the source, understand how the leg-
end represents the information, and whether you have clusters or patterns of data that are obscured by the boundaries
of the map (Buzzelli, 2020). For example, in using a traditional map (to show vote numbers), states are not uniform in
population, so showing a state fully red or fully blue doesn't show what might be happening in specific cities. This issue
is called a "modified areal unit problem." (Buzzelli, p. 171). This is why the popular vote seems to contradict the Electoral
College winner. For this reason, some map creators transform a traditional map into a choropleth map where the "size
of the states are rescaled according to their population" (Newman, 2016, para. 3).

                    In Figure 2.12, users can drill down by clicking on any circle in the country to find out even more detail on
where the surveys originated (i.e., the state).

Video Infographics Are Powerful

One of the most powerful ways to use infographics is to "show" your viewers rather than just narrate (tell) information.

60 | What Is Data Visualization?
The "show approach" simplifies communication and avoids misunderstandings. And sometimes you need a video info-
graphic rather than a static infographic.

   One of the most powerful narratives, videos, and interactive infographics available is an animated data-driven docu-
mentary written and directed by Neil Halloran, called The Fallen of World War II. This documentary is deeply researched
and has won several awards including 2016 Best American Infographics. This video infographic has been viewed over 9
million times.

                   http://www.fallen.io/ww2/

                      So now that you've watched this interactive documentary, what kind of tools do you need to create a
                   video infographic?

Infographic Online Apps

                    Canva is located at www.canva.com (Great infographics, beautiful templates, and a limited free plan). To
                 create an interactive infographic beyond hyperlinks, you will need to pair it with another app like ThingLink:
                 www.thinglink.com

                                     Venngage is located at www.venngage.com (Great infographics, a wide variety of templates).
                                  Venngage also has a getting started free plan that is limited. To create an interactive infographic
                                  beyond hyperlinks, use an app like ThingLink.

                                     Other popular tools for creating infographics include Visme, Snappa, Piktochart, Renderfor-
est (online infographic video maker), and for the Power BI users, PureViz Infographic. PureViz is PBI Certified and an
add-in to Power BI, and it is powerful!

   But don't forget--there's one product you might overlook, and that's PowerPoint! Microsoft provides dozens of info-
graphic templates, and PowerPoint slides can be saved as images of any size.

Complex Interactive Infographic Using Large Datasets

A complex interactive infographic is much more expensive to produce and requires some special skills if it draws data
from a database. An example of an interactive infographic without all the bells and whistles can be found at Census.gov.
The one pictured in Figure 2.13 pulls from 2019 census data. Essentially, a user selects a state, a congressional district,
and a metro area. Only urban areas exceeding 50,000 in population are available. This interaction is on the low end of
the scale and is more like an interactive "report" instead of an interactive infographic.

   The dataset is from an American Community Survey sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau from 2019, and it provides
a comparison between the metro area (in this case Terre Haute, Indiana) and the United States. It provides the total
population, median age, median home value, median household income, below-poverty percentage, foreign-born per-
centage, percent high school graduate or higher, percentage without health insurance, and percent of households with
a broadband internet subscription.

Government Datasets and Infographics

There are several datasets from different states that are open and available to the public. For example, New York
agencies publish open data weekly (opendata.cityofnewyork.us). New York features thousands of datasets ranging from
restaurant inspections to Central Park's squirrel census. Almost every state has some type of interactive data dashboard.
For example, Arizona's Judicial Branch leverages Power BI to show interactive dashboards on a variety of subjects.

   Many foreign governments have interactive infographics that include a broad range of topics you would
expect--unemployment rates, COVID, postsecondary education, education completion rates, and others. For example,
Health Education England (HEE) has dozens of dashboards related to COVID, mental health, and many more. Many of
these foreign government agencies use Power BI. And as certain issues reach global attention, expect to see dataset
collaboration. For example, many countries are collaborating with the United Nations to contribute refugee information
through an operational data portal.

Federal Interactive Infographics

The federal government is rich in infographics. For example, the Federal Trade Commission has a Tableau Public account
(essentially a third party makes the infographics but from the FTC's data). The FTC affectionately calls these Vizzes, not
just infographics. As you would expect, this site contains fraud statistics, ID theft maps, and imposters' "do not call"
complaints.

Start Building Your Own Infographic

The real test of understanding an infographic is to create one of your own, but that means you need to pick an info-
graphic app. A review of infographic software apps will yield a lot of results, so to save time, a comparison is made of
three of the more popular infographic tools (Canva, Snappa, and Venngage). Use the tool that you like best!

   Perhaps you are at a place in an organization where you would request someone else to design an infographic for you.
Keep in mind that creating infographics is considered a basic digital skill, and graphic designers can create beautiful
designs, but they won't know the data as well--and it is your story to tell. So let's explore how some of the infographic
apps work!

   Only "free" icons and "free" templates were used here. Notice that the designs are different, but the information is the
same.

          Steps to Creating an Infographic

The basic process for creating an infographic is as follows.
   Step 1--Gather the data and/or conduct research
   Step 2--Organize and conceptualize the data story (are you raising awareness or sounding a call to action?) Feel free

to use the modified CASS template (Figure 2.1).
   Step 3--Draft and revise the visualization.

   Apply the general steps to the sample scenario.

Sample Scenario: Impact of Training Infographic

   To build an infographic, let's use the following scenario. Jim Wallace, a department head at NovaDrive Solutions,
requested that Alicia, Donald, and Diana attend a meeting. Jim, the supervisor, challenged each of them to create an
informational infographic that highlights how professional training can increase productivity. Jim's goal is to enhance
productivity across all departments by expanding the role of internal trainers. It's important to note that Jim holds the
same level of authority as other department heads.

   After conducting extensive research on how professional development can improve productivity and retain employ-
ees, Jim decided to conduct his own informal study. Two years ago, Jim utilized his training budget to support internal
professional development instead of hiring an expensive external trainer. He opted for internal trainers, who are current
employees of the company. These internal trainers are responsible for onboarding new employees, introducing them to
the manufacturing process, and conducting quality control. As a result, employees have a strong rapport with them.

   Although Jim has shared this information in several department meetings, no other department has attempted the
internal training model. He aims to showcase his success and convince his peers to follow suit. Therefore, he hopes that
the infographic will finally persuade them. Jim has chosen not to share this report with the vice president yet, as he
wants to gain support from other department heads first.

   The results of Jim's internal study, conducted in 2022, are as follows:

  · The internal trainer provided four one-hour sessions to 10 employees over four months, totaling 40 hours of train-

68 | What Is Data Visualization?
      ing invested.
  · Each one-hour training session required three hours of preparation time for the internal trainer. Consequently,

      training 10 employees resulted in a total of 16 hours of preparation time.
  · The evaluations from the 10 employees showed an overall rating of 4.8/5.0 and a confidence level of 5.0/5.0 that

      the training would enhance their productivity.
  · In the subsequent year, these 10 employees worked a total of 20,000 hours. As a direct result of the training, their

      productivity increased by 1%, leading to a gain of 200 hours of work for the organization.
  · Essentially, investing 56 hours in training resulted in 200 hours of increased productivity.
   Jim asked Alicia, Donald, and Diana to create an infographic, even though Alicia expressed her concerns, saying, "You
know we aren't graphic designers, right?" Jim responded, "Well, you are familiar with design thinking here at Nova, and
you are the best presenters in my department. I believe you can figure it out!"
   The following illustrations (see Exhibit 2.8) show infographics built in three different infographic software apps by Ali-
cia, Donald, and Diana. This is the first draft from each employee.

   Compare the three designs. Which do you like from a first-glance perspective? The supervisor, Jim Wallace, reviewed
the three designs and gave the following feedback.

   I like the contrast between the green, white, and black, but I don't see a call to action. The first one does not have a
year or discuss the use of an internal trainer. The third one has a call to action, and I like the layout, but it lacks the same
flow as the other two. Can the three of you work together and combine your work to make the best one?

Team Discussion: Alicia, Donald, and Diana

Jim's quick feedback had the three employees wondering what they should do next. The group brought their lunch to the
team office and decided to use the modified CASS framework (see Figure 2.1) to evaluate the process. They soon realized
that none of the infographics had a character or emotional connection. Diana asked, "Can we turn it into a competi-

tion?" Donald wondered, "What would motivate the department heads?" Alicia added, "Is the 1% increase in productivity
perceived as minimal and not worth a change?"

     2.4 Exercise 5: Create Your First Infographic

        Learning Objective #5--Design an effective infographic using a free application
                          You have been approached by Jim Wallace's team: Alicia, Donald, and Diana to help revise the

                       infographic.
                   1. First, review the scenario, the CASS evaluation (Figure 2.17), the infographic quality checklist

                       (Figure 2.7), and the team discussion. Review the directions for each infographic software.
        2. Second, create a free account at one or all three infographic apps (see Exhibit 2.8 for Canva, Snappa, or

             Venngage). Never give your credit card number for any reason; instead, choose the free option.
        3. Third, redesign one of the infographics or design a new infographic. Include an image of the info-

             graphic in the discussion board and discuss the changes and why you made them. Discuss how Jim Wal-
             lace should tell the story. Feel free to expand on some of the team's comments.
        4. Respond to your classmates' posts and provide constructive feedback.

How to Create an Infographic in Canva

All infographic examples used free icons, free templates, and free images. For the "how to" section, find the following
instructions for Canva.

          Step-by-Step Approach to Use Canva

Note: Screenshots of Canva interface © Canva, https://www.canva.com/. Used with attribution for instructional and illus­
trative purposes. Annotations added by the author.

 1. Type www.canva.com in your browser.
2. Note that to sign up, it has you choose your experience. It may show teams available at your organization (for now,

      skip this option).
3. The pop-up will ask, "What will you be using Canva for?" Choices include teacher, student, small business, large

      company, nonprofit or charity, and personal. Choose the selection that relates to your organization. This question
      by Canva is their way of matching the templates that relate to you, but all the free templates are available to you
      regardless of how you answer this question.
4. The next screen depends on how you answered question three. For example, if you select "teacher," you will be
      asked "Where do you work?" with choices that range from elementary to higher education.
5. The next screen shows a category of over 50,000 templates. Choose the template section that matches your orga-
      nization.
6. Once you are through the pop-ups and examples, you get to a section called, "What would you like to design?" as
      shown in Figure 2.18.

                                                                                                                                                           Figure 2.18--Canva
                                                                                                                                                           Design Menu

 7. It may also say "Design anything." Take the time to explore this section--Canva does much more than just info-
      graphics. You can create designs for almost any reason, any event, or any platform. If you click in the search bar,
      type "business infographic + startup" to see the template design used by Alicia (one of the three employees
      charged with designing an infographic). If you scroll down several rows of infographics, you will find the one
      labeled Business Startup Costs.

 8. The Business Startup Costs template is 800 × 2000 pixels (not an ideal size for all social media platforms). Consider
      the best size to use for this situation. Canva will display lots of infographics in categories (i.e., business, education,
      charity, process, and timeline). Look for the ones marked free. Take time to explore. You do not have to use the
      exact template used in the comparison table.

 9. To demonstrate, click the Business Startup Costs template to customize it. The tour pop-ups will demonstrate
      helpful tips. Once you have the template in design mode you will see a side and top menu. Some of the key ele-
      ments are shown in Figure 2.19. Many of the design features are free, but things like "Add your brand fonts" or
      clicking "Brand Hub" will prompt you to upgrade. You don't need the upgrade to create an outstanding infographic.
      Choose only free options.
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 2.19--Canva
                                                                                                                                                           Template in Edit Mode

10. As you explore the menu, note the resize button, the effects button, the animate button, and so on--click through
      them all so you know what they do.

11. Click on an existing icon and then click elements. Use the search bar to search something like calendar as shown
      in Figure 2.20. The crowns represent upgraded content, so choose items that are free.

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 73

12. Click on different parts of the template to change the text.
13. Review, proofread, and conduct a quality check with the infographic quality checklist (see Figure 2.7).
14. When you are done with your design, choose File and Download. It recommends a PDF format, but if you use the

      drop-down menu, you will see that you can download it in JPG, PNG, PDF standard, PDF print, SVG, MP4 video,
      and GIF formats.
   Now that you have designed your first Canva, consider ways to make this Canva better by reviewing the checklist. How
could you make it more concise?

How to Create an Infographic in Snappa

All infographic examples used free icons, free templates, and free images. For the "how to" section, find the following
instructions for Snappa.

          Step-by-Step Approach to Using Snappa

Note: Screenshots of Snappa interface © Snappa, https://snappa.com/. Used with attribution for instructional and illus­
trative purposes. Annotations added by the author.

 1. Type https://snappa.com/ and set up your free account. You may see a "Get Started Free" button.
2. To create a graphic, Snappa starts by having you set up your graphic size. A normal infographic is 800 pixels ×

      2000 pixels (see Figure 2.21).
                                                                                                                                    Figure 2.21--Snappa

3. But if you use this option, it will create a blank infographic, so scroll down to Blogging and Infographics and select
      the infographic shown (don't worry, you aren't tied to this infographic). This opens to dozens of free templates (see
      Figures 2.22 and 2.23).
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 2.22--Choose

4. To use the template from Jim Wallace's team, scroll down to the template labeled 2020 Most Valuable Brands
      (remember, you can use a different template if you prefer.). In Figure 2.24, notice a full menu that includes icons,
      vectors, photos, and uploads, a way to change the background, and easy replacement of text.
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 2.24--Snappa

5. In the initial step, you saw sample templates with their sizes listed. For example, here are some featured designs
      and their size (this is only a fraction of what is listed at Snappa!).
      a. Facebook post (1200px × 900px)
      b. Instagram post (1080px × 1080px)
      c. blog featured image (1200px × 628px)
      d. LinkedIn post (1200px × 628px)
      e. infographic (800px × 2000px)
      f. ebook cover (1410px × 2250px)
      g. Zoom background (1920px × 1080px)

6. Customize: apply color, style, and specific elements.
 7. Incorporate data visualizations through elements, charts, or graphs as needed. Is there a call to action?
8. Review, proofread, and conduct a quality check with the infographic quality checklist (see Figure 2.7).
9. Download and share as a PNG, JPEG, and so on.As you consider Jim Wallace's team, part of your strategy is to pick

      the right medium (and best size media) to reach your audience. So what size would you pick?

2.5 Leverage Visualizations With the Use of Artificial Intelligence

       Visualizations can help us navigate a sea of data, making the complex simple and the abstract tangible.
          --David McCandless

If you were a beta tester for OpenAI ChatGPT, you were probably amazed to ask the artificial intelligence bot a question
and watched as the AI quickly provided a list of answer(s). Like any good researcher, you should use AI for the tool it is
and confirm the accuracy of the information. It is not a source, but it can serve as a catalyst for the ideation process. The
AI market is expected to grow exponentially and revolutionize every industry because of its ability to learn, recognize
patterns, problem-solve, plan, and make decisions. It's already built into several tools that you use regularly, though you
may not know it. For example, Microsoft Word uses AI-powered features like grammar and style suggestions and intelli-
gent proofreading. Google extensively leverages AI across its products with the end goal of enhancing user experience.
Even the Hey Google? assistant employs AI to understand and respond to our requests. AI is integrated into Google
Maps, Google Photos, and most of Google's product lineup.

   Infographic creators have discovered ChatGPT is great for ideation, writing listicles, and providing users with a start-
ing place for innovation. For example, we asked ChatGPT to "Make a list of quotes that relate to data visualization," and it
gave us 15 quotes identified by the person who said them. And we could refine this list by asking more specific questions.
See Figure 2.26 for a partial list.

                                                                                                                     OpenAI,
                                                                                                                     https://chat.openai.com/

   AI relies on complex algorithms that can process enormous amounts of data faster than humans, but it's a "fuzzy
front end of the innovation process that entails convergence-divergence dynamic that spans problems and solutions"
(Kakatkar et al., 2020, p. 171).

   You are exposed to more artificial intelligence than you realize. If you purchased a new automobile recently, it may
have been equipped with an Advanced Drive Assistance System (ADAS). AI powers ADAS with a plethora of safety fea-
tures including machine learning and computer vision to analyze sensor data from cameras, radar, lidar, and other
sources all to make real-time decisions for the safety of the passengers. And the use of AI in cars continues to evolve.

   Our journey in this chapter has focused on concepts that explain how data visualization can tell a story to connect
with an audience. With AI playing a role in data visualization and storytelling, there are exciting possibilities in the
future.

   Here are just a few futuristic possibilities:

  · Automated insights through analyzing patterns, correlations and outliers of large datasets that may have been
      overlooked.

  · Dynamic and interactive visualizations since AI assists users in exploring data from different perspectives includ-

78 | What Is Data Visualization?
      ing customizations that appeal to the user. AI's algorithms suggest appropriate visualization types based on the
      data and the story being told.
  · Personalized storytelling to tailor narratives to specific audiences to enhance engagement and understanding.
  · Real-time data visualizations allow users to monitor changing trends and patterns specifically helpful in fields like
      finance, social media analytics, and health care.
   Automated data storytelling can't be far behind. If AI can assist in finding insights today, how close are we to asking
ChatGPT "What's the story behind this data?"
   ChatGPT-4 (the paid version) allows you to turn on Advanced Data Analysis and upload up to 10 different documents,
and each document can be up to 500MB. It responds to your questions. To see more, feel free to watch the Flow State
AI & Automation video.

Microsoft's AI--Copilot

Although ChatGPT is phenomenal, the free version was disconnected from the internet in 2022. Copilot is a great alter-
native. First of all, it is still connected to the internet. Secondly, it provides footnotes linked to sources of the information
found. If you have explored ChatGPT, you will note that it sometimes just makes up things, and with no linked notes, it
makes it difficult to find the sources to verify the information. Copilot also provides DALL-E 3 image generation for free.

Chapter 2 Summary

This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the significance of impactful data visualizations combined with
engaging storytelling. In today's information-saturated world, persuading and captivating our audience becomes
increasingly challenging. Data can truly speak when the data storyteller can unravel its complexities and weave a nar-
rative that reveals insights. Design thinking, a human-centered approach that prioritizes the audience, becomes essen-
tial. Though what happens when you are not physically present to present your data visualization? Will the audience
still hear the voice of the data? This chapter introduces design thinking for storytelling, highlighting contextualization,
engagement, emotional connection, simplification and clarity, guiding attention and focus, and retention and compre-
hension as key strategies to employ when you are not in person as the storyteller.

   Storytelling may not be necessary for every aspect of presenting data, but certain data holds vital insights, correla-
tions, and outliers that demand a compelling story that engages the audience. It is crucial to approach both the story
and the data visualizations with honesty, impartiality, and ethical considerations.

   To evaluate your data storytelling, utilize one of the data storytelling framework templates. It's important to note that
a single framework cannot fit every situation, but observing the similarities among different models can enhance your
ability to evaluate data storytelling. Consider models like the CASS template (context, audience, story, and situation) or
the simplicity of the 5 Ws. Plan to use an infographic quality checklist for evaluation.

   You will sharpen your ability to discern between good, bad, and ugly data visualizations through the practice of eval-
uating data visualization designs. Remember that poor data visualizations may indicate manipulation, cherry-picking, or
mislabeling of data. There is often an intention on the part of the storyteller to exaggerate or downplay certain points.
Bad data visualizations typically cross ethical boundaries. Ugly data visualizations involve cluttered charts, ambiguous
color schemes, inconsistent design, or improper chart types. Inexperience often leads to ugly data visualizations. On the

                                                                                                                                               What Is Data Visualization? | 81
other hand, good data visualizations effectively communicate by contextualizing, engaging, and emotionally connecting
with the audience, simplifying complex data, and guiding the audience's attention to data insights.

   In addition to Iliinsky's four pillars of visualization (purpose, content, structure, and format), consider the context
necessary for the audience to better understand and retain your data story. Remember to review and use all the tools
available to determine the quality of your data visualization and the accompanying story.

   This chapter introduces various types of infographics, including statistical, process, timeline, interactive, comparison,
geographical, and video infographics. Take the time to explore examples of these infographic types and tools like Gap-
minder, which can tame large datasets and reveal unexpected insights. Furthermore, the chapter introduces three info-
graphic software apps and provides step-by-step instructions for using each of the apps to create your first infographic.
The final section of the chapter delves into the future of infographics, exploring the role of artificial intelligence in this
field.

Chapter 2 Case: The Power of Infographics

                                In this culminating project, apply the knowledge and skills acquired in this chapter to create an
                                engaging and informative infographic that relates to your organization or a topic that interests
                                you. Combine your understanding of design principles, data analysis, and storytelling techniques
                                to showcase your understanding of how infographics can effectively convey complex information
                                in a visually compelling way.

Case Objectives

 1. Evaluate a data storytelling project for effectiveness.
2. Differentiate between effective and ineffective data visualizations.
3. Apply design principles and use models (like CASS) to evaluate the infographic to ensure understanding of the

      information presented in charts and infographics.
4. Analyze and interpret data to extract key insights and develop an effective narrative.
5. Listen critically to identify powerful narratives and use effective storytelling to frame meaningful messages (Chap-

      ter 1, LO 4).
6. Design an effective infographic using a free application.

Case Guidelines

 1. Topic selection: Choose from a topic of personal interest within your organization, or if you prefer, choose anything
      from environmental issues to historical events, scientific phenomena, social trends, and so on.

2. Data gathering and analysis: Conduct research to collect the relevant data and information about your chosen
      topic. Feel free to speak to a coworker. Critically evaluate the data to ensure credibility and accuracy. Indicate the
      significant insight that can be highlighted in the infographic.

3. Design and visual presentation: Create a visually appealing infographic using one of the digital tools (Canva,
      Snappa, or Venngage, or others approved by your instructor). Use good design to present a balanced infographic
      that enhances audience understanding.

4. Self-assessment: Use one of the frameworks (like CASS) to evaluate your infographic. Proofread it, and use the info-

82 | What Is Data Visualization?
     graphic quality checklist.
5. Storytelling and narrative: Create a compelling narrative that effectively communicates the information presented

     in the infographic. The narrative should engage the audience, capture their attention, and guide them to draw
     meaningful conclusions or insights. Incorporate at least two lessons from Chapter 1.
6. Target audience: In a separate discussion, indicate the specific target audience your infographic was designed for
     and the audience's level of knowledge and interest that influenced how you designed the infographic.
7. Presentation, reflection, and feedback: Each student will present their infographic with a narrative/storytelling to
     the class. Then highlight the key insights and storytelling elements you used. Students should provide feedback to
     one another using the CASS template and the quality checklist as a guide. After the presentation and feedback,
     reflect on the design choice, data interpretation, and overall effectiveness.

84 | What Is Data Visualization?
3. Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and
Insights

       It is true that data visualization is part data science and part art. That being said, even the most creative art is
       supported by theories that explain why it works.

          --Michiko I. Wolcott, CMC, 20-year veteran of consulting in data and analytics

          What Do You Think?
          Sarah, a marketing executive, is eager to present data findings to her VP, but struggles to interpret and
       communicate them effectively. Sarah has invited her colleague, Alex, to give the presentation. Alex is pas-
       sionate about uncovering trends through data visualization. Any time a question comes up about working
       with the company's data, Sarah is always told, "Go ask Alex." Sarah forwarded her last year's data to Alex and
       scheduled a virtual conference call.
          As Sarah joins the meeting, she is met with a complicated data visualization shared on her screen. Before
       she can even say "hello," Alex exclaims, "Sarah, I've spent hours analyzing the data, and I believe I've found
       some incredible trends that can help drive next year's marketing strategy!"
          Sarah looks at the visualization and nervously responds, "That's great, Alex! But I must admit, this data
       visualization seems a little overwhelming. How can we simplify it for our presentation?" Alex turns on his
       camera, "I understand your concern, Sarah. We need to find a way to break down the complexity and pre-
       sent the trends in a clear and concise manner. How about we focus on the key insights and simplify the
       visualization to make it more understandable?"
          Sarah, with a sigh of relief, responds, "Thanks, Alex, I like this plan! So what were the most significant
       trends discovered?"
          Alex leans in, "Well, one trend that stands out is the correlation between our social media campaigns and
       website traffic. There is a substantial increase in website visits following each campaign launch."
          Alex smiles and responds, "Let's use a line chart to showcase the website traffic over time, with clear
       markers indicating the dates of each social media campaign. This way, we can demonstrate the direct
       impact of our campaigns on generating traffic!"
          Alex sees Sarah taking notes. She looks up, and he can see her excitement as she responds, "I can already
       visualize it. And I know the perfect story to include--we have a great testimonial from a customer about our
       July campaign to go with it. What other trends have you found?"
          Alex showed Sarah three more insightful trends. The collaborative nature of their discussion heightened
       their determination to deliver a compelling and informative story with insightful data visualizations.
          In this scenario, Alex and Sarah faced the challenge of presenting a complex data visualization that shows
       trends. Think about your own organization. Do you look for insight from your data to strategize goals for
       next year?

                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 85
Introduction

In the age of information overload, harnessing the power of data has become paramount for organizations seeking a
competitive edge. In the scenario, Sarah recognized the ability to extract meaningful trends and insights from complex
datasets was a skill she needed--a skill that can translate into a strategic advantage. Alex was able to transform the raw
data and suggest visuals, but it was Sarah who saw a need to incorporate a story. As they collaborated on visual nar-
ratives that would bring data to life, they brainstormed ways to make them more accessible (easier to understand) and
engaging for their main decision-maker, their VP.

   Within this chapter, we will delve into the principles and best practices of leveraging data visualizations to unveil
trends and insights. We will explore various visualization techniques and tools, highlighting their strengths and applica-
tions in different contexts. Graphical displays of data make it easier to spot patterns and detect unusual values. Besides
the graphical displays to help us understand our data, this chapter also introduces benchmarking, tools used to visualize
and persuade, statistical analysis tools, and visuals to support decision-making.

   We will also explore techniques to effectively communicate insights derived from data visualizations for diverse audi-
ences, ensuring that the impact of the findings is maximized. So let's embark on a journey to leverage data visualizations,
unravel the hidden stories within the data, and uncover trends and insights that can shape the future of our organiza-
tions.

3.1 An Introduction to Anscombe's Four Datasets

       The goal is to turn data into information and information into insight.

86 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
          --Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard
One of the best ways to see the importance of making a visual of data is to introduce the Anscombe datasets. In 1973,
Anscombe built four datasets of 11 points each. Statistically they are very similar: Averages, variances, correlation, and
even the linear regression formula are the same. Here are the four datasets slightly modified from the original. The mod-
ifications are highlighted in Figure 3.1.

   Figure 3.1--Modified Anscombe's Quartet

   Note: The yellow highlighting are numbers that are slightly different from the original Anscombe's quartet dataset.
   When calculated, the following statistical information is true for each of the four datasets.
  · The average x value is 9; the average y value is 7.50.
  · The variance for x is 11 and the variance for y is 4.12.
  · The correlation between x and y is .816.
  · The linear regression is y = .50x + 3.
Figure 3.2--Formulas in Excel: Using Dataset I as an Example

                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 87
   To calculate the average (arithmetic mean) for Dataset I, use the formulas
   =AVERAGE(B4:B14)
   and
   =AVERAGE(C4:C14).
   To calculate the variance (measures the spread) for Dataset I, use the formula
   =VAR(B4:B14)=VAR(C4:C14).
   To calculate the correlation (measures the relationship between x and y) for Dataset I, use the formula =COR-
REL(B4:B14,C4:C14). The .816 is the correlation coefficient. A value of 1 means a perfect positive relationship. A value of
0 means no relationship, and a value of -1 means a perfect negative relationship. Correlation tells you the degree (or
strength) to which two variables move in relation to each other. Correlation measures association but not causation. In
data analysis, you will see correlation as one of the statistical methods. The correlation (R) is not the same thing as R
Square (R2). R Square is the coefficient of determination and tells you how many points fall on the regression line.
   To calculate the intercept at the y-axis in regression for Dataset I, use the formula = INTERCEPT(C4:C14,B4:B14). I like
the name intercept, because it tells you where it will cross the y-axis. You will also see mathematicians refer to this as
alpha.
   To calculate the slope of regression for Dataset I, use the formula =SLOPE(C4:C14,B4:B14). You will also see mathemati-
cians refer to this as beta.
   Regression line (y = 3 + .50x) with a goodness of fit at .816.

88 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
   Think of a regression line where y = a + b(x). x is the explanatory variable, and y is the dependent variable. The slope
of the line is b, and a is the intercept on the y-axis.

A Scatterplot in Excel

A scatterplot displays values for two variables and is often used to investigate the relationship between two variables.
A scatterplot can show a positive relationship, a negative relationship, or no relationship at all. A positive relationship
(uphill pattern from left to right) means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. A neg-
ative relationship (downhill pattern from left to right) means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends
to decrease. If there is no relationship, there will be no clear pattern. Let's look at the scatterplot graphs for the four
datasets in Figure 3.3.

   Figure 3.3--Scatterplots of the Anscombe's Quartet

   Keep in mind that all four datasets have the same average, variance, correlation, intercept, and slope.
                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 89
   As you can see from Figure 3.4, the average, variance, correlation, and intercept are the same.
   Figure 3.4--Anscombe's Quartet Comparison

   The average, variance, correlation, intercept, and slope calculated in Figure 3.4 would lead a researcher to think that
each dataset would graph the same. Despite the similarities, we see very different graphs.

  · In Dataset I, we see a set of points that appear to follow a roughly linear relationship with some variance.
  · In Dataset II, we see a clear curve with no linear relationship (perhaps quadratic).
  · In Dataset III, we see a tight linear relationship with one outlier.
  · In Dataset IV, x appears to remain constant with one outlier.
This exercise supports the importance of visualization. You may want to explore the Excel file and look at each dataset.
The average, variance, correlation, intercept, and slope formulas are calculated under each dataset, but you can also
explore the linear regression completed for each dataset. Regression will be explained and explored later in this chapter.

     The graph (shown in Figure 3.6) will need further work. It needs a title (e.g., Dataset I) and axis titles to label the
     x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical).

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 3.6--Draft

4. The final graph shows a positive correlation, titles, bolded values, and even a trendline! This graph (Figure 3.7)
     demonstrates a positive correlation (as x increases, so does y).

Real-Life Example of an Impactful Scatterplot

Prior to 2010, estimating the age of unidentified crime victims was done by examining teeth and bones. A groundbreak-
ing study, Estimating Human Age From T0Cell DNA Rearrangements, was conducted in 2010 by examining the age and
blood test measure. The study included 195 people ranging in age from a few weeks to 80 years old.

   Please visit:
                    Zubakov et al. (2010). Estimating human age from T-cell DNA rearrangements. Current Biology Vol 20 #22.

                 https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0960-9822%2810%2901286-8
             · R2 = 0.835 and means that approximately 83.5% of the variability in age can be explained by the linear rela-
      tionship between age and blood test measure.
  · alpha = -33.65 is the y-intercept (note this is negative).
  · beta = -6.74 is the slope (note this is negative).
  · Equation: The linear equation is y = -33.65 - 6.74(x), so as a crime investigator, a victim with a blood sample of -11
      would mean the age of the victim is 40.49 calculated as  = -33.65 - 6.74(-11) = 40.49 years
Correlations can be positive or negative. Let's look at a negative correlation of a single brand of car and how price cor-
relates to the number of kilometers. It makes sense that the more kilometers on the car, the less the price. See Figure
3.8a.
   Figure 3.8a--Negative Correlation - Scatterplot of Age of Car Compared to Price

   If we were to compare the car's kilometers to the age of the car, we would see a positive correlation as shown in Figure
3.8b.

3.1 Exercise 1: Discussing Terms Used in Anscombe's Quartet

   Learning Objective #1 Determine insights
                      Your company requires all employees to complete a training series on culture. Everyone has

                  access to the same online training conducted by a third party. Individuals can spend as little or as
                  much time as they need, since employees may rewatch videos or revisit content. At the end of the
                  series, every employee takes an online exam. After completing the training, the third-party vendor

                                                                                              Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 93

3.2 The Simplest Graphics--Sparklines, Icon Arrays, Combo Charts, and
Word Clouds

       The art of data visualization lies in capturing the essence of trends, distilling complexity into simplicity, and
       enabling minds to grasp the pulse of change.

          --Anonymous
What are sparklines? Sparklines are small, condensed visual representations of data that are great for a quick overview
of trends and patterns. They are not detailed like full-fledged charts or graphs, but they offer several insights. They are
so tiny that they fit within one cell of a spreadsheet!

   The easiest way to understand these is to see an example, so let's look at POM University ticket gross revenue and
ticket net income for 2010 through 2023, shown in Exhibit 3.1. Note how the sparklines show the trend all from within

POM University's gross revenue and ticket sale net income between 2010 and 2023 show a healthy rise of income and
net income until 2020-2021 (during COVID-19). The sparklines show the trend of the gross revenue and net income as
well as the horizontal analysis.

   There are three different types of sparklines: line, column, and win/loss.
                                          Perhaps as you review the sparkline, you might ask "What about the percentage of income

                                       to revenue?" In 2010, we see a 40% profit margin, which increased to 51% in 2016. However,
                                       the percentage dropped in the COVID-19 years and has still not reached baseline (2010) per-
                                       formance. How can you bring these details to the attention of your audience? One way
                                       would be to combine graph types using a combo graph; but first, let's show the step-by-step
                                       process to create sparklines.

 1. Prepare your data. Open an Excel document and type in the months and revenue data shown in Figure 3.10.
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 3.10--Excel Data
                                                                                                                                                           for Sparkline Chart

2. Select the cell where you want to insert the sparkline (in this case, cell I3).
3. Go to the Insert tab in the ribbon.
4. Click on the Sparklines button in the Chart group. A drop-down menu will appear with the three types of

      sparklines (as illustrated in Figure 3.11). Choose the Line chart to show the revenue trend.

                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 95

5. Once you choose a sparkline, a window will pop up for the data range (B3:H3) and the location range (see Figure
      3.12). Then click OK and see your sparkline. Try each type so you can see how they chart.
                                                                                                                                     Figure 3.12--Create a
                                                                                                                                     Sparkline for Revenue

6. Customize the sparkline by clicking on the sparkline in cell I3 as shown in Figure 3.13. This will add an extra tab
      Sparkline on the main menu If you choose it, you will see lots of design and format options.
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 3.13--Customize
                                                                                                                                                           the Sparkline

With sparklines, you can identify trends including seasonal patterns or volatility. They offer a quick visual cue. Now let's
talk about a slightly more interesting graph, an icon array.

Using Icon Arrays

An icon array uses small symbols to represent individual data points. They are useful for frequencies or proportions.

color coordination of the icons.

Exhibit 3.2 shows an example of starting with a horizontal stacked bar chart often used to represent the results of survey
questions. In this example, instead of bars, you see icons representing the results. Notice that the colors also represent
information to the viewer. Red represents concern, and gray represents a "gray area" where employees check their email
too often.

             1. Let's start with some simple survey results that were collected at an organization. Essentially, the survey
          question was "How often do you check your email each workday?"
          The summarized results of the survey: 5% checked their email once or twice each day; 50% checked their email
          between 3 and 5 times each day; 40% checked their email 6 to 10 times each day; and 5% checked their email
          more than 10 times each day. Set up your Excel sheet as shown in Figure 3.15 (or use the Excel workbook for
          Chapter 3).

                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 97

          2. Highlight A2:D3 and choose Insert on the main menu and then column or bar chart.
             3. Scroll down to "More column charts" and choose Bar and select the stacked bar chart (as illustrated in Figure

          3.16).
                                                                                                                                                       Figure 3.16--Choose a

          4. Select OK.
             5. Customize: The chart, as illustrated in Figure 3.17, needs customization to reflect the following colors, add a

          title, and clean up the axis titles.
                                                                                                                                                          Figure 3.17--Customizing

        Right-click on the color you wish to change. Choose Format Chart Area and change color to show red,
yellow, green, and gray. Use these colors to take advantage of the audience's understanding of traffic lights (red,
yellow, and green).

           Change the chart title to How often do you check your email each workday? Further customize it to bold
and larger font.

           Remove axis titles if present. Feel free to further customize the legend. Make sure the legend colors
match the new colors. The stacked bar chart is the most commonly used chart for survey data. If you wish to
make a bold statement, add the 50% and 40%, especially if these two categories of responsiveness are within the
organization's policy about checking email.

6. Add an icon array. We could stop here, or we could change the chart to show icons. If

you pick the icon from those available, they are easier to match to the colors.

a. Go to Insert on the main menu, then Illustrations and choose Icons.

b. Type "people" in the search bar.

c. Choose an icon that shows people. And then click OK. For this example, choose

the icon that looks like male and female figures.

d. When it copies to Excel, you will notice that                                          Figure 3.19--Icon

Assessing the Effectiveness of an Icon Array

People-First Language: Be careful when you use icons to represent specific people. Use person-first and identity-first
language. Instead of "a cancer patient," use "a patient with cancer." Instead of "AIDS patients," use "people with AIDS."
The goal is to avoid language that dehumanizes or stigmatizes people. It is recommended to review any infographic or
icon array with this perspective in mind.

   Accessibility: Ensure that the icon array is accessible to individuals with disabilities like visual impairment or even
audience members who are color-blind.

   There are five main ways to assess the data visualization known as an icon array. These include the following:

 1. Accuracy and clarity: Do the icons use consistent size, shape, and color? Does it accurately represent the data? Can
      the audience easily understand what each icon represents?

2. Perceptions and comprehension: For this aspect, conduct user testing with similar people who will make up the
      audience. Are people able to accurately interpret the data values and trends being displayed? For example, using
      people icons may send mixed messages when colors are introduced.

3. Comparison and contrast: Can viewers easily identify differences in the data values represented by the icons? Are
      they able to compare values across different categories or groups?

4. Scalability and density: Can the visualization handle a large dataset without becoming overcrowded or losing clar-
      ity?

5. Engagement and memorability: Does the visualization capture the audience's attention and encourage further
      investigation into the topic? Does the audience remember the visualization weeks after seeing it?

Working With a Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart

Before we move away from horizontal stacked bar charts, let's review a few tips and tricks. Most researchers use some
type of software to create a survey like Survey Monkey, JotForm, Qualtrics, Google Forms, Lime Survey, and so on. Most
survey software will allow you to export to Excel; however, moving beyond the basic charts can improve data story-
telling. Horizontal stacked bar charts are useful for visualizing data that involves multiple categories as well as propor-
tions and their relationships.

   For example, a horizontal stacked bar chart can be used to
 1. display the different types of expenses in a budget for various departments or display or showcase resources (time,

      budget, personnel).
2. display a summary of the different survey responses including a further subcategory (like demographic groups).
3. display a summary of pretest and posttest survey results. This is especially helpful to compare a before and after

      survey, like Figure 3.25 of students who took a precourse and postcourse survey.
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 3.25--Example of

                                                                                                                                                           and After Survey

one end of the spectrum, sparklines show powerful trends for a quick overview of data patterns over time. Icon arrays,
with their adept use of symbols, deliver an intuitive representation of proportions and frequencies, making them ideal
for visualizing categorical data. Horizontal stacked bar charts work great for survey questions. But as we venture deeper
into the visualization landscape, the true versatility of combining these techniques comes to light with combo charts.
These hybrid visualizations merge multiple graph types into a single cohesive display, presenting a wealth of information
at a glance.

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 101
What Is a Combo Graph?

A combo graph (or combo chart) is a combination of two bar charts, two line graphs, or a bar chart and a line graph(s).
You can work from a single dataset or two datasets as long as the datasets share a common base. You want to use combo
graphs to show some kind of relationship or trend.

     Example 1--Combo Chart With One Bar Chart and One Line Graph

        Consider a scenario where you want to analyze the sales performance of a product over time. Using a combo
     chart to combine a bar chart and line graph allows the viewer to easily depict the relationship between revenue
     and quantity trends. It shows the audience if a lower revenue is due to quantity or lower prices (or both). Take a
     look at the average price in Exhibit 3.3; if you notice, the highest average price was $238 in 2020, but note that
     the average price for 2023 was only $22/unit. This is a huge selling price drop between 2020 and 2023.
Exhibit 3.3--Scenario for Hat and Mask Combo Sales

   The example in Exhibit 3.4 gives two different ways to show this information. Normally, revenue is best represented
by a line graph, but either of these would work. The decision on which combination to use depends on the story you
want to tell with your data. Ask yourself, "Which insight is more important?" If you are unsure, show this data to two
pilot groups and ask them to identify insights. Which group identified more quickly that the quantity increases because
of the huge price drop? It looks like the owner will have to start giving the hat and mask combo away!

Example 2--Combo Chart With Two Bars and Two Lines Using Horizontal Analysis

   For the next example of a combo chart, let's visit the POM University exhibit that showed sparklines. You will
use a new term, horizontal analysis, to see how it might be used within a combo chart setting. Horizontal
analysis (time series analysis) is often used in analyzing financial data to identify trends, patterns and changes
in data over time. In this example, shown in Exhibit 3.5, we are setting the base year at 2010. That means setting
the year 2010 at 100% and measuring the increases (or decrease) of all the other years compared to the 2010
base year.

Exhibit 3.5--Combo Chart: Two Bar Grouping and Two Lines + Sparklines Revisited

   Look at 2010 and compare it to 2011. In 2011, the ticket sales gross revenue was 23% higher than 2010's ticket sales
gross revenue. In 2012, the ticket sales gross revenue was 70% higher than 2010. Note we always compare all ticket sales
gross revenue for every year back to the 2010 base year.

   The same is true for ticket sales net income. The year 2010 is the base year and is considered 100%. In 2011, the net
income increased by 31% above the base year (2010). And in 2012, the net income increased by 67% over the base year
(2010). Now the question might be, What is the purpose? The purpose is to help the audience determine historical pat-
terns and determine the company's potential growth. The combo chart shows that net income usually tracks at the same
increased level as gross revenue increases; however, COVID-19 really disrupted this trend. Starting in 2022, it appears
that gross revenue and net income were once more increasing together. This is good--it means the net income is cur-
rently trending with gross income. Essentially, expenses remain on track.

   If you wish to explore combo charts, please review the Excel file associated with Chapter 3. Let's turn to word clouds,
a very easy visual with lots of uses.

What Is a Word Cloud?

Word clouds are just visual representations of text in graphic form where the size of each word is relevant to importance

or frequency. Essentially, the more often the word is used, the larger the text.

                                                                These keywords are evident in the pig image. This

                                                                Notice that even the shape tells you a little about the con-

                    Remember, the pig example word cloud was generated from the first 100 words. There are several word
                 cloud generators that work online without downloading any software. Most of them prompt you to copy or
type text to generate the word cloud. And most, by default, start you with using the first 100 words. So how are word
clouds used with large datasets?

Disruptor Intelligence Center: Global Data Uses Word Clouds

Some companies like Disruptor Intelligence Center: Global Data are using a Word Cloud to track what the top influ-
encers in a field are talking about (and it is all live). The contributor indicates the topic based on a hashtag (e.g., #Info-
graphic). In Exhibit 3.6 for BigData influencers, you can drill down into the resources and comments by selecting an
influencer or start with the cloud and choose the topic of interest. Not everyone who reads this textbook will have
access to Global Data, but if you do, read more about the features that follow.

   Remember, the more a topic is discussed, the larger the word generated in the word cloud. In Global Data, choose
Databases, and then under the Influencer Database, choose BigData. The illustration changes, since influencers use
Reddit and Tweets to contribute, but you get a sense of what the influencers are talking about.

   Exhibit 3.6--BigData Influencer Network With Word Clouds
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author
                                                                                                                                                          Illustrations (2025)

The word cloud is clickable, meaning if you select "Infographics," it drills into the information to share the top contribu-
tors. The map shows the location and number of contributions. The database also lists the top contributors organized by
the highest score. Twitter contributors are scored using (1) average engagements received on content shared, (2) num-
ber of followers, and (3) number of times other influencers have referred to them in their shared content. If you click
on a contributor's name, you will see the tweet content. One of our favorite contributors uses a lot of infographics to
discuss big data, and once you find someone's work you like, you can follow them.

   Just a note: Global Data contains company information including a list of peers, SWOT analysis, PESTLE analysis by
country, and many others. We will dive deeper into these basic tools and how to present key information visually in a
later section.

   Because a word cloud can identify trends and patterns, it is often used for qualitative research in an informal way.
Most word cloud apps filter out common words, which means the visual shows patterns of frequency.

   Keep in mind that most word cloud creators suggest the first 100 words of a story (but not all word cloud apps set a
limit). For the word cloud demonstration, please use the following key information taken from a survey about leadership.

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 105
Word Art is a little different. One way it functions is to allow the user to set up the frequency of words. Let's look at a
scenario to see how this might work.

Scenario: Survey Participants Ranked Leadership Characteristics

In this survey, participants indicated the following strengths for leaders. There were 30 participants. This means that all
participants chose "Good communicator" as one of their top 10 leadership characteristics. In a word cloud, you would
expect the phrase "Good communicator" to use the largest font. As you review the rest of the list, note the number
beside it indicates how many participants indicated that strength as one of their top 10 leadership characteristics.

Let's look at some examples of other word cloud apps.

Add Pro Word Cloud to Microsoft Word

Perhaps more interesting is the add-in availability of Pro Word Cloud into Microsoft Word. Pro Word Cloud will generate
a cloud based on a word count you set in Pro Cloud along with the act of highlighting the text. This feature is a great
way to introduce a presentation based on a written document (like a strategic plan, business plan, or marketing plan).

   Exhibit 3.7 depicts a sample word cloud created in Microsoft Word using the add-in, Pro Word Cloud. Only part of
Chapter 2 was selected to create this word cloud, but we think it captured the main points pretty well!

There are tons of add-ins for Microsoft Word, but this is a very popular feature that is easy to use. But there are many
ways to increase the interest level. For example, inserting the newly created word cloud into an image of the morning
news makes a bold and more dynamic image than just the word cloud image alone.

Word Clouds Are Great as an Interesting Starting Point

Word clouds are great tools for specific situations. For example, a word cloud image is used in Exhibit 3.8 in conjunction
with another app, essentially combining the word cloud image within the context of a newspaper.

The images were created using Pro Word Cloud. Just the Word Cloud image could have been used on a PowerPoint slide
or within this document; however, the word cloud image was uploaded to PhotoFunia-Morning News to generate the
image that combines it with a newspaper setting (date, newspaper title, and section) for a compelling way to start any
conference session where you are the speaker! And what if you handed out coffee mugs for your session?

How Word Clouds Can Be Used for Surveys

Customer and Employee Surveys: Word clouds quickly indicate opportunities for improvement. Most survey tools pro-
vide a way to export data in several ways (text, Excel, PDF, CSV). That data can then be used in a word cloud generator.
For example, the word cloud in Figure 3.32 is from a field on an exit survey. Administrators of the survey thought that
"low wages" would be the key reason employees left, but based on the keywords and their size (displayed in Figure 3.32),
the top three issues are (1) unfair treatment, (2) schedule, and (3) errors on paycheck. Most survey tools have an analytics
section to summarize question answers; however, none of them has a tool to summarize written comments.

Just as a note--research shows that exit interviews should be conducted face-to-face (Glass Door for Employers, 2017).
For example, in the previous situation, a face-to-face exit interview might shed some light on what is meant by "unfair
treatment."

   Customer surveys are another area where you can gain insight into customer "pain" points, which provide insight into
opportunities to improve and connect with your customers. In Figure 3.33, notice that a few phrases have been circled:
slow, frustrating, and difficult. Although these words are represented by smaller text, it demonstrates that some cus-
tomers did not have a positive experience.

As you create word clouds, here are a few points:
  · First, avoid simply dumping text into a word cloud generator. Take time to review what you are sending (this is
      called optimizing the data) to gain accurate insights. Consider what is relevant and important.
  · Second, always consider if another visualization method will work better. For example, survey tools often have
      charts and graphs available for straightforward questions that provide limited ways to answer the question. More
      complex data might be better represented in a dashboard where they are interactive instead of static.
  · Third, always consider how a shape might emphasize the message. For example, does the shape resonate with the
      data, or does it cause confusion? Many cloud apps will allow you to upload an image that can be used as the shape.
      Would a different shape (like Figure 3.34) add context and improve interpretation?

  · Fourth, consider ways to customize or add interactivity if it enhances the audience's insight. For example, you may
      notice that when your mouse hovers over a specific word, it pops up. You can record this activity with video edit-
      ing software as well as add narration.

Please feel free to try some of the stand-alone word cloud apps.
                    WordClouds works with typed or pasted text, uploaded Office documents (even PowerPoints), PDFs, or

                 text data. It also has a "wizard" for step-by-step help. Location: www.wordclouds.com
                                     WordItOut has limited shapes and fonts, but it is very intuitive and easy to use. You can use

Interact With Your Audience Using Word Clouds

There are several products that allow you to use word clouds to interact with your audience--Here's an example sce-
nario: You've been asked to speak at a leadership conference, and you want to start the presentation with some audi-
ence interaction. Using an app like Mentimeter (www.mentimeter.com), you set up your slide with the prompt "List two
adjectives/descriptors that describe you as a leader." Your slide has a code at the top, and your audience uses their smart-
phones to connect to the presentation (www.menti.com) and type in the code (the code in this example is 3804 2784).
The example shown in Figure 3.35 shows the setup along with a first attempt to test the interaction using my phone.

Interact With Your Team Using an Add-In to Microsoft Teams

Creating an interactive word cloud in Microsoft Teams is easy, and there are several ways to create it. The following
demonstration is from one of my active teams. You should be able to follow along.

          Step-by-Step Directions to Install a Word Cloud in Microsoft Teams (Poll)

 1. Open a team space of your choice. Within the team space, you will see a + at the end of the menu (see Figure 3.36).
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 3.36--Add-In to
                                                                                                                                                           Teams

2. When you click on the +, you should see a search bar that says Search for apps. If you don't see the Poll app after
      typing Poll in the search bar, click the box that says Get more apps. You may see apps like Poll Everywhere, but you
      should look for the Poll app created by Microsoft.

3. Once you click on Get more apps, Teams will open a categorized set of apps. Microsoft products have hundreds of
     apps available. Choose Popular on Teams and look for Polls. Figure 3.38 shows some of the more popular apps on
     Teams--another good one is Forms.
                                                                                                                                                          Figure 3.38--Apps

                                                                                                                                                          (Partial List)

4. Click Add and it will be added as a tab to your Team space. Once you add it, you will have the option to add to a
     team, add to a chat, or add to a meeting, as illustrated in Figure 3.39.

                                                                                                  Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 115

5. In Figure 3.39, the Polls app was added to a meeting, and then New Poll was selected. The pop-up provides choices
      available as of January 2024. Microsoft is continuing to update and add new features, so it is possible to see addi-
      tional engagement activities. As seen in Figure 3.40, you can boost engagement with a word cloud, but other
      options are available.
                                                                                                           Figure 3.40--What Can

6. One of the things I like about this is the ability to Save as draft instead of Launch now. As the team members enter
      the meeting space, you can decide to launch when it is appropriate. If you launch the poll before the meeting
      starts, the team members will see the question that starts the process. It might be better to save it as a draft, as
      illustrated in Figure 3.41.

 7. If you set up the word cloud question before the meeting, the team members will see something like Figure 3.42
      when they enter the team space (of course, with your question instead of mine).
                                                                                                                                              Figure 3.42--What

The uses shown in Figure 3.43 for word clouds range from a simple visual of a text document to a more intentional use
of looking at survey comments, but there are many other uses for word clouds.

   In a recent study, word clouds were used as "text mining" of electronic health records. Essentially, "meaningful words
were extracted . . . to perform pattern matching, followed by text mining and word cloud. . . . By combining these tech-
niques, physiotherapy treatments could be characterized by a list of constructed keywords, and the residents' health
characteristics were built. Feeding defects or health outlier groups could be detected" (Delespierre et al., 2017, p. 1). If
you look at the original article, this was much easier to understand than the text!

   Most statistical software packages provide a way to create word clouds, but the apps shown in this chapter can help
you with many word cloud projects!

3.3 Benchmarking, Decision-Making, and Strategic Analysis Tools

       Data visualizations must communicate answers and provide business outcomes. If the data feeding an analytics
       dashboard is not trusted, the results are meaningless. If the visualizations do not answer important business
       questions, the visualizations are not actionable.

          --Katie Horvath, CoreSignal

Today, data-driven decision-making is foundational for global business. As the quote from Katie Horvath suggests, man-
agers and researchers must present data that is accurate and unbiased. At any point, if trust is lost, the results are mean-
ingless. The integrity of decisions rests on the ethical handling and presentation of data. Storytellers need to ensure that
biases (international or otherwise) do not distort the information conveyed.

   Benchmarking is the process of comparing performance metrics (like key performance indicators [KPIs]) against
established standards. Organizations rely on benchmarking to assess progress, identify areas that need improvement,
and gauge the effectiveness of strategies. Metrics can help measure targets related to process, strategy, and perfor-

                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 121
mance. Yet the way data are presented can profoundly influence perceptions and decisions. This section explores the
intersection of benchmarking and ethical practices in data presentation. For this chapter's purpose, consider four types
of benchmarking: (1) performance benchmarking, (2) practice benchmarking, (3) internal benchmarking, and (4) external
benchmarking. Every industry should use benchmarking to help understand and transfer "best practices" from other
organizations and improve organizational performance.

Internal and External Benchmarking

Internal benchmarking involves comparing different units, departments, or processes within the same organization. For
example, a retail company with multiple store locations can survey customer satisfaction. Next, the company identi-
fies the store location with the highest customer satisfaction. The organization would analyze this location's processes,
training methods, and customer engagement strategies and share the insights gained company-wide.

   External benchmarking involves comparing an organization's processes, performance, and/or practices with those
of another organization, typically in the same industry. There is a plethora of tools that can be used to benchmark
your organization to your competitor and your industry. For example, to understand the competitive environment of
an industry, use Porter's Five Forces and Porter's Generic Strategies (both tools were developed by Michael Porter, an
economist at Harvard). Let's look at these from an external benchmarking point of view.

Benchmarking Tool 1: Porter's Five Forces

One of the best benchmarking tools to understand industry competitiveness is Porter's Five Forces because industry
leaders recognize the components. For example, MarketLine Advantage is a world-leading provider of industry profiles
that include Porter's Five Forces. MarketLine Advantage showcases over 30,000 companies, over 3,500 industry profiles,
and over 110 country profiles (MarketLine Advantage Brochure, 2023). MarketLine uses Porter's Five Forces analysis
framework "to evaluate the competitive pressures on `players,' rival companies in a particular market" (MarketLine
Advantage Brochure, 2023). Industry profiles include five-year forecasts, practical application of Porter's Five Forces
analysis, and company financial metrics. Most college libraries have access to the MarketLine Advantage tool. Let's start
by looking at an industry profile.

Industry Profile--Global Cloud Computing

The August 2023 Global Cloud Computing Industry profile is 44 pages of relevant information on the state of global cloud
computing. Based on the table of contents, the industry profile includes an executive summary, market overview, mar-
ket data, market segmentation, market outlook, (Porter's) Five Forces analysis, competitive landscape, company pro-
files (this includes financials in most cases), and macroeconomic indicators. Figure 3.45 shows the journey to finding the
Global Computing Industry profile. From the main menu, choose Analysis, Industry Analysis, and then Industry Pro­
files. Or you can use the search feature to find it. Industry profiles are updated often.

If you open the global cloud computing profile, the five forces are buyer power, degree of rivalry, new entrants, sub-
stitutes, and supplier power. But what I really like is the graph, "Drivers of Buyer Power." MarketLine dives into each of
the five categories. For example, in Exhibit 3.9, looking at buyer power, the following factors are measured: backward
integration, buyer independence, buyer size, financial muscle, low-cost switching, oligopsony threat, price sensitivity,
product dispensability, tendency to switch, and undifferentiated product. A relevant chart is supplied for each of the
five forces to show the drivers.

These are radar charts (which is a chart you can prepare in Excel). Radar charts are great for visualizing how entities
perform across multiple dimensions and to help identify areas of focus for improvement or further development.

   Another aspect of an industry profile is the competitive landscape. This section identifies the leading players. The
2023 global cloud computing industry profile identified these top players in the cloud computing industry.

 1. Amazon Web Services (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon.com
2. Microsoft (Azure platform)
3. Google Cloud, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.
4. IBM Cloud, of International Business Machines Corporation
5. Alibaba Cloud, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group (and one of the fastest group cloud computing players located in

      China)
Because this is a textbook on leveraging data visualization, it's important to understand how to build a radar chart using
the global cloud computing industry as an example and an estimate of where the two players (AWS and Alibaba) are
located. The numbers assigned to AWS and Alibaba in the "Step-by-Step Approach to Build a Radar Chart in Excel" are
estimated and are for learning to build a radar chart.

How to Interpret This Radar Chart

In this radar creation exercise, the estimate of Porter's Five Forces for each company was created for data visualization
purposes. Although the industry data from the global cloud computing industry profile is accurate, the company num-
bers were created solely for this how-to demonstration. To interpret the results, compare the polygons of the different
entities. Entities with polygons that are closer to the outer edge perform well in those corresponding variables. Entities
with polygons closer to the center indicate weakness in those areas. This radar chart represents two companies ranked
in the top five. Our results for a struggling company or a new entrant would yield very different results. In Figure 3.48,
AWS slightly outperformed Alibaba.

Strategies That Follow Porter's Five Forces Analysis

According to Michael Porter (2008), in his article "The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy," there are strategies
that can be used to reshape the five forces. The strategies outlined by Porter include

  · neutralize supplier power,
  · counter customer power,
  · temper price wars,
  · scare off new entrants, and
  · limit the threat of substitutes.

Let's look at them using the context of the cloud industry.
   Table 3.4: Strategies to Reshape the Five Forces

126 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
Neutralize      Standardize specifications for parts so more vendors can provide them. This is a great strategy
supplier power  for the cloud industry since data centers rely on servers and processors, and normally have a
                well-established network of suppliers.

Counter cus­    Expand services so it's harder for customers to leave. This is one strategy that Amazon Web

                outside the United States, Amazon Web Services has a difficult challenge. Consider collabora-

How Can Bias Creep Into Porter's Five Forces Analysis?

Bias can creep into the content development of Porter's Five Forces analysis in several ways. Bias creeps in when analysis
becomes too narrow, you make untested assumptions, or your analysis is focusing on the wrong industry (this happens
because companies often straddle more than one industry). Again, Michael Porter shared additional situations that can
reduce profits:

Bias #1--Savvy customers

  · You think you know your customers, and assume brand loyalty, but according to the State of Cloud 2023, 65% of
      organizations use a multicloud environment (Pluralsight, 2023). "Savvy customers can force down prices by playing
      you and your rivals against each other" (Porter, 2008, p. 24). An organization that uses a multicloud strategy will
      use two or more cloud providers to take advantage of the capabilities that best suit their purpose as well as pre-
      vent vendor lock-in.

Bias #2--Powerful suppliers

  · "Powerful suppliers may constrain your profits if they charge higher prices" (Porter, 2008, p. 24).

Bias #3--Entrants

  · "Aspiring entrants, armed with new capacity and hungry for market share, can ratchet up the investment required
      for you to stay in the game" (Porter, 2008, p. 24).

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 127
Bias #4--Substitutes

  · In the case of cloud computing, the types of services are identical but when you perform the analysis, you may
      assume brand loyalty that is not there.

An Introduction to Porter's Generic Strategies

The term generic strategies was first introduced by Michael Porter and upon review, is reminiscent of Management 101.
This model introduces strategies to gain a competitive advantage. It includes cost leadership, differentiation, and focus.
To apply a cost leadership strategy, your organization would:

  · increase profits by reducing costs (still charging industry-average prices).
  · increase market share by charging lower prices (still making a reasonable profit).

Cost leadership is not for every organization. To apply this strategy, you need technology to bring costs down, efficient
logistics, and a way to sustain the lower costs.

   To be successful at differentiation strategy an organization needs:

  · good research, development, and innovation,
  · to be able to deliver high-quality products or services, and
  · a marketing team that understands how to market differential products and services.

The third strategy focus is used in conjunction with cost or differentiation; Porter calls this Cost Focus and Differentia­
tion Focus, and you should not try to do both. The process to use this model includes these steps:

 1. Conduct a SWOT for each potential strategy. What strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats would result
      in the strategy chosen?

2. Use Porter's Five Forces and PESTLE to understand the industry and the environment.
3. Compare SWOT and Porter's Five Forces and choose one generic strategy that gives you the best set of options.

                 ation-cost-leadership-focus/

Benchmarking Tool 2: Comparative SWOT

Once you analyze your industry using Porter's Five Forces, the next step is to review SWOT analysis of the organization
(or players) in this industry. In this same MarketLine Advantage database, each of the players shows a company summary,
key statistics, research reports, deals, and a SWOT analysis. As you may recall, a SWOT will show strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats. Strengths and weaknesses are considered internal, and opportunities and threats are con-
sidered external.

128 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
   Once a company conducts a SWOT (either for their own organization or compared to a competitor), the next step is
to develop strategies and action plans based on the insights gained from the analysis. These include the following:

  · Capitalize on strengths: Leverage a company's strength to gain a competitive advantage.
  · Address weaknesses: Work to improve identified weaknesses and develop plans to enhance capabilities, skills,

      processes, or resources pertaining to areas of weakness.
  · Exploit opportunities: Capitalize on external opportunities that align with the company's strengths.
  · Mitigate threats: Develop strategies to minimize the impact of external threats on the business by creating contin-

      gency plans, diversifying offerings, or strengthening relationships.
Remember a SWOT analysis is only valuable if it leads to meaningful action.

   Figure 3.49 compares the leading player, Amazon, to the organization ranked fifth, Alibaba Cloud. The SWOTs consider
the following categories: operational, financial, strategic, industry, political environment, economic situation, sociocul-
tural environment, and technological environment.

   Figure 3.49--An Example Comparison SWOT Analysis
                                                                                                                       Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                       (2024)

One of the greatest weaknesses for growth is for an organization to be in the position of declining cash, especially if
capital (interest costs for borrowing) is more difficult to raise. Let's look at another benchmarking tool that adds another
layer of understanding to the situation, especially if you hope to expand your company into a new country.

   A PEST/PESTLE adds another layer of understanding to your organization's situation. It is a simple and effective tool
used to identify the key external forces at a macro environment level. A SWOT is not complete unless you conduct a
PEST or PESTLE.

Benchmarking Tool 3: PESTLE (Also a Strategic Analysis Tool)

A strategic analysis tool should be used anytime your company is considering expansion into a new geographic area.
PESTLE analysis incorporates: P = political (or sometimes referred to as politics), E = economical, S = social, T = techno-
logical, L = legal, and E = environmental. MarketLine uses PESTLE and PEST as part of the country analysis framework.
So for companies considering expanding their market, this is a critical tool.

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 129
   For example, one of MarketLine's PESTLE analyses is for the country Japan. The insight document (Japan In-Depth
PESTLE insights) was published in January 2020 and is 96 pages long! But you can apply this analysis technique in a
much smaller way. It is a pretty good model for expanding a market anywhere. Here are some considerations when con-
ducting this analysis.

  · Political: What is the current taxation policy and what changes are they considering? What is the political outlook?
        What trading policies impact your business?
        What are the specific regulations that you need to follow, and have they changed?
        Is there current legislation that might impact your business?

  · Economical: What is the overall economic situation? Is there a growing strength in consumer spending?
        Does globalization affect your market share?
        Is the economy stable? Growing? Declining?
        Do you understand the taxes that are applicable to your product or service?
        Is the government fighting loan deficits?

  · Social: What lifestyle or trends are there to consider? What is the demographic of the consumer? Are there atti-
      tudes or opinions that should be considered?
        Who is your target market?
        Is the population growing and do they have a need for your product or service?

  · Technological: Do they have relevant technology and innovations?
        What technology is critical to support your operations and/or do you need vendor support? And if you need
            vendor support, are they in-country?
        Does their technology infrastructure support your needs?
        Does the country have weak intellectual property laws?

  · Legal: Is there legislation in areas that would impact the company? For example, employment, tariffs, health, or
      safety. Are there labeling laws required?
        Is the country transparent or is there evidence of corruption?
        Are there hidden tariffs?
        Does your organization understand the country's taxation structure (e.g., value-added tax [VAT] is often a sur-
            prise to companies when they expand into Europe).

  · Environmental: Would a company product contribute to pollution? Are there recycling laws that would impact
      manufacturing the product or consumer use of the product?
        What international treaties are signed in relation to air pollution, ozone layer damage, or disposal of hazardous
            waste?

Combine your analysis with a great graphic like the one illustrated in Exhibit 3.10, which helps visualize the insight analy-
sis. You can create a PESTLE analysis in PowerPoint or one of the infographic software packages.

   To illustrate how a PESTLE might be used, assume that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is investigating expanding into
Greece. This potential expansion should always include a review of the PESTLE landscape. MarketLine provides a coun-
try profile for Greece. The March 2023 country profile is 82 pages long, but this small graphic (Exhibit 3.10) captures the
key points.

                                                                        Created in Venngage

The type of background and layout is important. The Venngage example shows PESTLE all aligned, implying that each
one carries the same weight; however, that is not true, and it will vary by industry.

   To leverage data visualization and tell the story, begin with a brief introduction that highlights the purpose and pro-
vides context to the audience. Share an example that demonstrates the importance of understanding external factors.
Next, present a clear structure. Obviously, your audience can't read all the fine print, so set up a section for each factor.
Each section should include a brief overview, impacts on the organization, specific examples, and trends.

   For example, Greece has just started a project to place a 5G network throughout the country. As a cloud computing
company, they would want the 5G network in place, and hiring talent might be an issue because of the low graduation
rate at the tertiary (college) level. Amazon Web Services would want to evaluate these factors based on their unique sit-
uation.

   In Figure 3.50, notice the minimum wage of $750.50 EUR/month. Does that surprise you?

There are several variations for this strategic analysis tool, including PESTEL (just a different ordering), PEST (where
companies do not consider legal and environment), and PESTELE or STEEPLE. The PESTELE or STEEPLE represents a
variation that includes "ethical and industry specific factors." For example, this area would include such components as
fair trade, child labor, and corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Benchmarking Tool #4--Compare With an Association Database(s)

Most industry associations provide benchmarking data specific to their sector which allows you to compare your orga-
nization's performance with industry norms. Examples include American Hotel & Lodging, National Retail Federation,
Automotive Industry, Hospital Association, and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). There are hundreds
more.

   If your organization is required to report information, you can assume that the data collected is analyzed in some
way. For example, the U.S. Department of Education sponsors the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis (EADA). The EADA
is a report required by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights under Title IX regulations. The EADA
report provides information about the participation rates, financial support, and other aspects of intercollegiate athletic
programs at higher education institutions.

          Bias in Reporting Data

The reporting of academic data, including average GPA for student athletes can vary widely from one institution to
another. Although the data are collected as part of the NCAA Academic Progress Rate, it does not require a direct mea-
sure of average GPA; however, it does consider academic eligibility and retention of student athletes. Institutions that
132 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
fail to meet these thresholds can face penalties and loss of scholarships. There is no requirement to post athlete GPA for
public viewing, but many institutions want to be both accountable and transparent and post some type of infographic
about team GPA or sport-wide GPA. Here's the catch! Some institutions post GPA data when they are good and fail to
post anything about student athlete GPAs when they are low.

   In Exhibit 3.11, note how internal and external benchmarking might be used from an infographic perspective. Most
colleges and universities track the GPAs of their athletes, and it's fairly common practice for any college or university to
track their athletes' academic journeys (internal). However, some colleges have a spotty record of posting GPA informa-
tion for public view (external).

Benchmarking Tool #5--Balanced Scorecard

There are several types of performance metrics that should be considered for your organization. Organizations need
performance indicators to measure performance and the organization's ability to reach their goals.

   One of the first in this section is a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). This benchmarking tool was first introduced by David
Norton and Robert Kaplan in the late 1990s. BSC is considered to be one of the first performance metric tools to take
into account nonfinancial information. The BSC measures four main aspects: learning and growth, business processes,
customers, and finance (or for a nonprofit, instead of customers, it can be donors).

   Figure 3.51 visually depicts what it might look like at the very early stages (this illustration was created in Excel and is
included in the Excel files for this chapter).

                                                                                                                                                          (1996)

Since the late 1990s, the BSC has been used and modified by organizations. You will often see key performance indicators
(KPIs) instead of measures and projects instead of initiatives. Instead of learning and growth, you might see organiza-
tional capacity. The framework for organizational capacity (financial, customer, internal processes, and the newer per-
spective) is often found in the form of a strategy map.

   A strategy map is a visual depiction of cause-and-effect connections between strategic objectives. When used in con-
junction with BSC, a strategy map is used to communicate how value is created by the organization. An example strategy
map is shown in Exhibit 3.12. According to Kaplan & Norton (2001), "A strategy map enables an organization to describe
and illustrate, in clear and general language, its objectives, initiatives, and targets; the measures used to assess its per-
formance . . . and the linkages that are the foundation for strategic direction" (para. 14).

   One of the easier industries to review is the airline industry. The cost of the flight is the same if the plane is full of
passengers or if it carries only a few passengers, so it should be no surprise that standardizing planes for quick ground
crew turnaround will increase customer satisfaction, since travelers hate delays for many reasons (connecting flights,
losing quality time, etc.).

Although implementing a balanced scorecard framework can lead to substantial positive change, about 30% of BSC ini-
tiatives fail. The less-than-optimal outcomes can be caused by a lack of leadership and commitment (especially buy-in).
This lack of leadership has several symptoms including unclear strategies, inadequate communication or mixed signals,
incorrect metrics, or overemphasis on just the financial metrics. BSC has been around for over 30 years, and 70% of For-
tune 1,000 companies have at least partially implemented a BSC (BSC Designer: Balanced Scorecard Fact Sheet, 2023).
According to the "Management Tools & Trends," the BSC tool is one of the top three most popular business tools (Bain &
Company, 2023).

   Incorporating a dashboard in conjunction with a BSC framework can bridge the gap between strategy and execution
by providing real-time insights. It's effective because it makes it easier for organizational stakeholders to monitor, ana-
lyze, and take action based on performance data. Let's look at the illustration in Exhibit 3.13 to learn more.

This example dashboard can support a BSC in several ways:
  · centralized performance

136 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
  · visual representation (the arrows) where stakeholders can see patterns and trends
  · real-time monitoring, possible with built-in performance alerts
  · customization (this is a very simple dashboard--many have lots more visuals)
  · reinforced alignment between strategic objectives and the metrics being tracked (by organizing metrics along BSC)
  · communication and decision support
  · comparative analysis with historical data

Sector Scorecard by Global Data (Disruptor)

Global Data uses a scorecard approach "to predict tomorrow's leading companies within each sector" using thematic,
valuation, risk, and company screen (2023). The thematic screening ranks companies based on overall leadership by 10
themes most valued by their industry. The 10 themes are different depending on the sector. So for cloud computing
services, you will see artificial intelligence, software-defined networks, internet of things, enterprise SaaS, cloud IaaS,
hybrid cloud, edge computing, multicloud management, AI chips, and Metaverse. The legend indicates that green will
impact earnings positively, yellow is neutral, and red will have a negative impact on earnings. The use of red, yellow, and
green is symbolic in the United States, similar to a traffic light.

Personal Individual Strategy Map

The BSC can be translated into your own personal, individual strategy map. The example illustrated in the strategy map-
ping article shows a faculty strategy map from an academic perspective. The strategy map for an academic in higher
education can guide personal development and define objectives in teaching, research, and service. Even more appeal-
ing is that the strategy map can help faculty members focus on strategies and should be created at the beginning of the
academic year.

   Novice educators should determine how setting one objective can contribute to the success of another. For example,
successful research publication could enhance teaching effectiveness. The key performance indicators (KPIs) track
progress toward each objective (like course evaluations, number of publications, grants, service committees, etc.).

   The takeaway from this section is that strategy maps aligned with BSC perspectives provide a dynamic evaluation of
your company with multiple views.

   Create a professional report that has three main components: (1) information about the industry, (2) two-
company comparison of SWOTs from top players from the industry, and (3) a discussion of Porter's Five Forces.

                                                                                             Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 139
        Step 1: Start at MarketLine Advantage and find an industry profile.
        Step 2: Go to the industry profile section, which lists the top players.
        Step 3: Go to the company section in MarketLine and make sure that at least two of the companies from your
     industry profiles have SWOTs listed. If not, choose a different industry.
        Step 4: From the industry profile, review Porter's Five Forces. Discuss trends and challenges for the industry.
     Summarize the important aspects of the industry.
        Step 5: Pick two of the top players (that have SWOTs) and do a comparative SWOT. Compare and contrast the
     two players. What challenges do they share? Why are these two companies outperforming other companies
     from the same industry? Which company is stronger externally (opportunities and threats)?
        What should the report contain?
         · A discussion of Porter's Five Forces and the supporting factors. Feel free to capture the radar chart as a

             screen capture--just make sure to cite it.
         · A discussion of the industry and the two players (that you chose)

                  Summarize important information about the industry.
         · An infographic comparing the SWOTs
         · A discussion comparing the two companies

                  Which company is stronger internally (strengths and weaknesses), and which company is
                      stronger externally (opportunities and threats)?

                  What components are similar?

3.4 Visual Decision-Making Tools

       Data visualization is the language of decision making. Good charts effectively convey information. Great charts
       enable, inform, and improve decision making.

          --Dante Vitagliano, CoreSignal

Visual decision-making tools can illuminate pathways to effective choices. This section delves into several decision-
making tools that have visual representations. Early in this section, fill out the interconnected bones of Ishikawa dia-
grams to drill into the core problem instead of just treating the symptoms. Next, learn to build the structured branches
of decision trees to weigh a decision using probability theory. Learn to use the discerning lenses of Pareto analysis to
concentrate resources to gain the most impact. This section even includes the House of Quality used for the streamlined
precision of Six Sigma methodologies. This section provides practical guidance on how to wield these tools effectively,
leveraging the visualization output to communicate effectively.

Decision-Making Tool 1: What Is an Ishikawa Diagram?

An Ishikawa diagram was invented several decades ago by Kaoru Ishikawa to help a team identify and arrange the causes
of a problem. It is a brainstorming tool that can help a team organize, visualize, and communicate. Often teams use
sticky notes to think of all the causes that contribute to a specific problem. You can still do that! Just start with five
or six categories and build your fins. For example, assume that you have a coffeeholic in your family. Your categories
might look something like Figure 3.52 created in Visio (i.e., people, procedure, materials, and equipment). Notice that
Visio provides a fish frame as well as primary and secondary cause shapes.

Next, have your team review each sticky note and arrange them into categories. Some example "causes" are shown in
Table 3.5 for the problem "poor coffee experience" under the categories listed earlier.

   Table 3.5: Brainstorming Example Causes

Procedure  Material  People Equipment

Grounds in my coffee Don't carry my sweetener Rude Cold coffee when I want hot

As you start to build out the diagram (as shown in Figure 3.53), you will probably think of other causes that lead to a
"poor coffee experience," especially if you are a coffee drinker!

                                                                                                                                     in Visio (2022)

Categories can be customized based on the problem. If your organization is a manufacturer, you might see categories
using the five Ms of manufacturing (manpower, machines, materials, methods, and measurements). If your organization
provides services, expect the six Ps (people, processes, policies, procedures, places, and performance). But know that
you can customize the categories to fit your situation.

   The "problem" is situated toward the nose of the fish, and the causes (and subcauses) are pointed to the spine of the
fish. Don't be surprised if you need to change your problem statement. For example, we started with "bad coffee" as the
problem statement, but then saw that an employee being rude didn't really impact the taste of the coffee. Instead, it
became clear that the real problem was a "bad coffee experience" related to visiting the local coffee shop.

   Depending on the software or app that you use, the Ishikawa diagram could be called a root cause analysis or fishbone
diagram. Exhibit 3.15 was created in Visio and shows the shapes and images that can be used. Note these are linked to
primary causes, secondary causes, and so forth.

Did you know that brainstorming is one of the most creative ways to solve a problem? And doing it with a team provides
some additional benefits. Brainstorming can

  · reduce social inhibitions among group members,
  · stimulate ideas that you might never consider,
  · enlighten the impact of the problem across departments, and
  · capitalize on multiple perspectives.
You don't have to have a fancy fish diagram. You could even create a fish diagram in a Word document, but why create it
yourself when there are templates and apps that will do it for you?
   An Ishikawa diagram can be more dynamic if you use hyperlinks and the Zoom feature in PowerPoint, but there are
dozens of videos on YouTube to enhance your storytelling. Watch Chad Littlefield's video "How to Make a PowerPoint
Presentation Interactive" to consider ways to interact with your audience like the two-minute Google activity, contribu-
tion-not-consumption, Wikipedia Game, bringing an object in physically, a translation technique, and optical illusions.

You can build an Ishikawa diagram in PowerPoint, but you should also consider searching Venngage or Canva for some
of the diagrams. As you build the Ishikawa diagram, be prepared to dig beyond the surface-level causes and also explore
the underlying currents that shape outcomes. For example, Starbucks has built an empire where they sell an experience
and not just coffee. Starbucks provides a cozy atmosphere, free Wi-Fi, comfortable furniture and laptop-friendly tables,
and the smell of ground coffee beans. Starbucks has even gone so far as to close all their stores early to train employees
on the topic of "Racial Bias Training" on May 29, 2018. That's 8,000 stores and 175,000 employees as of 2018 (NPR, 2018)!

Decision-Making Tool 2: What Is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree offers a systematic approach to dissecting choices and their potential outcomes. It is a versatile deci-
sion-making tool that can be used in any industry to transform intricate decisions into a step-by-step journey. This sec-
tion explores the foundational principles of the decision tree's creation--from understanding decision nodes and chance
nodes to assigning probabilities and calculating expected values. According to Investopedia (2019),

   A decision tree is a diagram or chart that people use to determine a course of action or show a statistical probabil-
ity. . . . Each branch of the decision tree represents a possible decision, outcome, or reaction. The farthest branches on
the tree represent the end results. (para. 1)

   It derives its name from the branches and leaves of trees, which are used as part of the design along with symbols that
can help your audience understand which decision is better. Exhibit 3.16 provides example symbols.

   Exhibit 3.16--Symbols Used in a Decision Tree

Chance or event node Alternative branches Rejected alternative  Endpoint note Decision point

A decision tree starts with a single node (the square symbol) and branches into possible outcomes. A chance node shows
the probabilities of a certain event. Draw the decision tree on paper first with all the probabilities, costs, and benefits.
Although the chance nodes normally show the expected value, the endpoint node shows the final payoff if the event
occurred as expected.

   A decision tree is best used when the decision you need to make is significant, infrequent, and strategic because it
carries a lot of risks. It is a graphical representation of the alternatives and estimates value by using probability. Not all
decision trees will have high, medium, and low probabilities; some decision tree models will only show two probabilities,
but the probabilities should always add up to 100%.

Sample Scenario of a Decision Tree

XCaliber Systems is a small software company comprising three partners who grew up together. XCaliber is not their
day job, but they love coding and making apps and have had some success selling their travel app. As they sit down to
plan 2025, they have three exclusive opportunities: (a) develop a game app, (b) develop a financial app requested by a
national bank, or (c) revamp their existing travel app with new features requested by their users.

146 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
Opportunity A--Develop a Game App

After some discussion, they surmise their best guess of a successful launch would be 35%, a modest launch would
be 50%, and a dismal launch would be 15% for the game app. Because it is a new game, they think they can use the
GoFundMe app to help boost potential revenue and estimate their best guesses for a successful launch, a modest launch,
and a dismal launch. They expect the cost of creating the app will be $80,000. Of the three opportunities, this is the one
they like the best, but they also wonder if their payoff estimates are biased based on their enthusiasm.

   Table 3.6: Opportunity A: Develop Game App

Opportunity A: Develop a game app Payoff Probability

Successful launch                      $250,000 35%

Modest launch                          $150,000 50%

Dismal launch                          $100,000 15%

Opportunity B--Develop a Financial App

After some discussion, they surmise their best guess of a successful launch would be 60%, a modest launch would be
30%, and a dismal launch would be 10% for the financial app. This app was requested by a national bank and could be
adopted by one bank, by all the banks in one state, or by all banks in the Midwest. None of the three friends is excited
about developing this app. They expect the cost of creating the app will be $60,000.

Table 3.7: Opportunity B: Develop a Financial App

Opportunity C: Revamp existing travel app Payoff Probability

Successful launch--All Midwest banks   $200,000 60%

Modest launch--All banks in one state  $120,000 30%

Dismal launch--Only one bank           $60,000 10%

Opportunity C--Revamp Existing Travel App

Over 50% of the customers that use the existing travel app have made some requested changes. The changes requested
would not cost much (about $40,000) and could be done quickly. After some discussion, they surmise their best guess
of a successful launch would be 58%, a modest launch would be 40%, and a dismal launch would be 2% for revamping
the existing travel app.

   Table 3.8: Opportunity C: Revamp Existing Travel App

Successful launch  $150,000 58%

Modest launch      $80,000 40%

Dismal launch      $50,000 2%

Next, they go to their digital whiteboard (as illustrated in Exhibit 3.17) and draw a decision tree in Excel.
   Exhibit 3.17--Decision Tree--Three Potential Opportunities

                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration

The expected value is shown at each chance node. To understand how the expected value was calculated, look at Tables
3.6-3.8.

   As seen in Exhibit 3.17 and Figure 3.54, the expected value for decision A (the game app) is $97,500. To calculate the
expected column, take the payoff multiplied by the probability. Next, total the expected column and subtract the cost to
develop the game.

   Figure 3.54--Decision A: Expected Value of $97,500

148 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
   Summary for decision A: ($250,000 × 35%) + ($150,000 × 50%) + ($100,000 × 15%) = $177,500, then subtract the cost
to develop the game and you have calculated the expected value for the decision. Notice that .35 + .50 + .15 = 1.00. The
probability will always equal 100%.

   Figure 3.55--Decision B: Expected Value of $102,000

   As seen in Figure 3.55, the summary for decision B: ($200,000 × 60%) + ($120,000 × 30%) + ($60,000 × 10%) = $162,000,
then subtract the cost to develop the app and you have calculated the expected value for the decision.

   Figure 3.56--Decision C: Expected Value $80,000

   As seen in Figure 3.56, the summary for decision C: ($150,000 × 58%) + ($80,000 × 40%) +($50,000 × 2%) = $120,000,
then subtract the cost to revamp the existing app.

   Now the three partners of XCaliber Systems sit down and compare the three opportunities. Financially, the best
option is decision B, the financial app at $102,000; however, decision A, the game app, is not far behind at $97,500. It is
possible that the three partners will still choose the game app, since it is only 4,500 less.

   Most decision trees are used where large sums of capital are involved, especially when risk is tied to an external factor
that the organization doesn't control. A good example might be the potential leasing of a venue space owned by an orga-
nization for two or more events.

   Decision trees are a great way to visualize a complex problem. Risks associated with the problem explored will have

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 149
already been considered, and visualization facilitates finding the best resolution. In the case of LucidChart, the data are
linked to a spreadsheet, and since it was built that way, you can add a button that shows you the best option.

   The biggest thing to remember is to show all the probabilities by drawing out each component first. The decision tree
yields a visualization comparing two or more projects.

   Next, let's look at another decision-making tool that involves the Pareto Diagram.

Decision-Making Tool #3--How Can a Pareto Diagram Help?

This tool enhances your ability to make informed decisions and has been adopted by many fields, especially in the con-
text of quality management. The Pareto Diagram prioritizes key factors through a visual representation of what industry
experts call the 80/20 rule. The typical data used to construct a Pareto Diagram is qualitative data.

   To better understand this application, let's look at an example. POM University purchased an automated system to
answer fan questions. The survey had an open-ended question set, and major words were aggregated to show a word
cloud. Figure 3.57 shows a summary of the data. These data are set up so we can use a Pareto Diagram. The visualization
was sorted from highest to lowest frequency, while a relative frequency column and a cumulative relative frequency col-
umn were also added. Notice that some of the phrases relate to the same issue. For example, headache and loud music
may relate to the same issue.

   Figure 3.57--Data Setup for Pareto Diagram

150 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
   A Pareto Diagram is a bar chart plotted by order of decreasing frequency relative to other data points. In addition to
the bars, the cumulative frequency is plotted as a line on the same graph. The line is called the Pareto line. You may
have heard of Pareto but didn't realize it since this graph represents the 80/20 rule. It was named the Pareto Diagram
after a well-known Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto, and is often used in the realm of total quality management (TQM).
Exhibit 3.18 shows the 80% components: loud music, impersonal, wrong information, voice, and disappointed. Pareto
Diagrams help you concentrate on a few issues to serve the largest number of customers.

   Exhibit 3.18--POM University Pareto Diagram

                                                                                                    Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 151
   Applying the 80/20 principle to this situation means that 80% of the complaints fall into a few categories. A better
way to look at it is that it helps you narrow down the list of complaints that should be prioritized. The Pareto Diagram
you see here has a few extra components that we added to draw your eye to where the 80% category lies on the fre-
quency table. Essentially, this means that 3,200 of the 4,000 complaints used these phrases.

        Step-by-Step for How to Create a Pareto Diagram in Excel

First of all, a Pareto Diagram is included in the Chapter 3 Excel file "3.4 Survey Data--Pareto Diagram." You can practice
with it.

3.5 Visualize and Persuade

       An editorial approach to visualization design requires us to take responsibility to filter out the noise from the
       signals, identifying the most valuable, most striking or most relevant dimensions of the subject matter in ques-
       tion.

          --Andy Kirk

Presenting your ideas, research, or insights is a complex endeavor that demands adaptability, empathy, and precision.
Whether you are standing before a poster show audience, addressing a small or large gathering, connecting remotely,
or speaking to individuals of varying cultural backgrounds or genders, the art of effective communication is a key com-
ponent that we refer to as "visualize and persuade."

   In an interconnected world where communication bridges gaps and supports understanding, refining these presen-
tation techniques will empower you to deliver compelling messages that resonate, captivate, and inspire, regardless of
the context or audience you encounter. Start with something simple, a poster show.

What Is a Poster Show?

A poster show is an event where posters are on exhibition and contain a researcher's findings, projects, or ideas using a
poster as a visual aid. Posters contain visually appealing representations of the subject matter. Posters are often created
in PowerPoint, and the sizes include 24 × 24 templates to 48 × 96 templates and every size in between. (Warning:
PowerPoint is limited to 56 × 56 in size.) The size depends on the guidelines of the event organizer and whether the
presenter wants a vertical or horizontal poster. Attendees can browse through the posters and ask questions to the pre-

158 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
senters, and many remote poster sessions include "live" sessions where the presenters put on a short presentation and
take questions from the virtual audience. The size shown for Exhibit 3.20 is 24 × 36.

   The example (Exhibit 3.20) includes the expected components of a virtual poster:
 1. abstract and title,
 2. link to presentation video/audio file,
 3. contact information,
 4. introduction and hypothesis (if a research poster),
 5. background,
 6. methods/results,
 7. charts or information supporting results,
 8. more examples to support hypotheses,
 9. conclusion, and
10. references.
Keep in mind to adjust your virtual poster to meet the requirements of the conference or journal.

                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration

Poster Checklist

To see if the poster is following best practices, let's start with a poster checklist (Table 3.13). Use the poster in Exhibit
3.20 and work through the Generic Poster Checklist. Always make sure to review the journal's submission guidelines in
addition to the Generic Poster Checklist.

1. Does the poster meet guidelines or organizer requirements?

2. Is the message clear and focused?

3. Does the poster have high-quality images and charts that are engaging without being over-
whelming?

4. Is the poster organized logically, with subheadings, guiding the viewer through the informa-
tion?

5. Is the data clear and understandable with good data visualization(s)?

6. Does the presentation or video (if applicable) engage the viewer?

7. If questions are asked by viewers, does the presenter add meaningful discussion?

8. Are there visual cues, with effective use of color, white space, and cohesion?

9. Is the poster accessible to all viewers, including those with disabilities (like closed captioning
for a video)?

10. Does it contain appropriate branding with contact information if viewers wish to reach out
for further discussion?

11. Does the presenter craft a compelling narrative that takes the viewer on a journey?

12. Does the poster contain appropriate citations and references?

13. Does the poster use person-first language and show a sensitivity to potential viewers?

Poster Presentation Guidelines

The following guidelines were taken from a graduate certificate in women's leadership (GCWL) program and modified to
include some of the innovative ways to participate in poster shows. Most conferences offer a poster show opportunity,
and requirements will vary from one conference to another. Therefore, the requirements listed here are just shown as
an example.

Using Posters in a Virtual or Hybrid Setting

Poster sessions can be face-to-face or offered virtually. In this example, Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College (SMWC)
partnered with Genigraphics Research Posters to provide a virtual experience. Partnering allowed students to receive
feedback in the form of discussion or virtually (through Zoom in breakout rooms). Most often, the conference will pro-
vide PowerPoint poster templates and suggest several layouts but with a specific size. In this example, SMWC used
Genigraphics Research Posters to provide a rich experience for the poster participants. As shown in Exhibit 3.21, Gen-

160 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
igraphics offered a portal for GCWL students to upload their posters in time for a virtual poster show. The audience
logged into the Research Posters session to view the poster, leave feedback, or talk to the researcher through Zoom (as
shown in Exhibit 3.21).

ment was 24 × 36, and students were given four different layouts. Surprisingly, students chose only two types of tem-
plates: (1) abstract sidebar design with large title space or (2) title-left design. Exhibit 3.24 shows an example for each.

3.5 Exercise 1: Create a Poster

   First of all, you are not required to "create" a poster. However, you are required to discuss components and
consider how you would modify an existing template.

    · Look at research poster designs in Canva and Venngage and compare them to those that you see in
        Genigraphics (https://www.genigraphics.com/templates).

    · Download a template and open it in PowerPoint. Conduct some preliminary research on a topic of your
        choice. This could be organization specific. For example, your topic might be based on a challenge at
        work (poor communication, multigenerational communication issues, a need for conflict resolution tech-
        niques, Zoom burnout, employee retention, and so on). Discuss what headings you would use. What are
        the key components that would support your topic, and how would you show them?{~?~IM: insert pln-

   Based on your instructor, either post to a discussion board or be prepared to discuss in class.

3.6 Visualization Tools Animated Through Time

       Without a systematic way to start and keep data clean, bad data will happen.
          --Donato Diorio

We have unprecedented access to data and tools available that will empower us to explore, analyze, and understand the
intricate web of global trends with clarity. Hans Rosling once said that people are not "rocks" and that we are trans-
forming. The rapid transformation in economics, demographics, health, and education shows distinct patterns through
time. Tools like Gapminder and Flourish empower users to breathe life into static datasets. Both tools engage the viewer
and facilitate a deeper understanding of trends and patterns. These types of tools play a pivotal role in transforming raw
data into compelling narratives.

   Gapminder Tool was developed by Hans Rosling and his team and is an innovative use of data visualization because
it combines animated trends into a compelling narrative that reveals the true stories of our world. This tool was intro-
duced earlier in the interactive infographic tools in Chapter 2. In this section, you will explore how to use the Gapminder
Offline Tool using your own data.

Gapminder--a Visualization Tool Animated Through Time

If you have data that has years and you want to show the trend over time, this product will fill that need. But before you
add your own data, explore Gapminder because the data already collected may offer further insight. Let's look at the
image shown in Exhibit 3.25 and explore some of the options. Notice that this is an animated infographic (see the play
button on the bottom left), which can be saved as a video that can be inserted into PowerPoint.

   According to Christine Hall (2022), "Canva acquired Flourish in mission to tell better stories with data" (para 1). Canva
has a free account available to students and educators. In addition, Canva has many apps that add to its already broad
range of infographic and design features. One such app is Flourish. To use Flourish in Canva, you must add it as an app in
Canva, set up a new account in Flourish, and connect them. One of the key impacts of Flourish is how the animation can
help inform, persuade, and inspire your audience. Before we get to the step-by-step, look at the many types of animated
graphs available.

   There are three categories of animated templates available in Flourish: (1) line, bar, and pie charts; (2) projection maps;
and (3) scatterplots. Exhibit 3.26 shows only a partial list.

3. This will bring up a "Welcome to Flourish!" account screen. Use the Sign up now button to create a Flourish
      account. We used the same email account that we had for our Canva account (see Figure 3.61 in step 4).

4. Connect the two accounts by choosing Connect.

5. Once you have the two accounts connected, you will see a screen something like the one pictured here. We found
      it easier to log into our Flourish account, create our animation design, and give it a title. Afterward, the project
      title can be searched within Canva. If you have not created anything in Flourish, it will not show up as depicted in
      Figure 3.62.

6. We selected a projected line chart because we wanted to use some information about women leaders in the United
      States and later compare it to women leaders in other countries. The template comes with example data so you
      can see how it works and replace it with your own.
      One thing to note: The data required some cleaning because when there was no change in leadership percentage
      (because of periodic elections), the Pew Center dataset skipped the year. We had to make sure there were no miss-
      ing years of data. Here is the link to the data: https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/fact-sheet/the-data-
      on-women-leaders/ Also, when you first arrive at "The Data on Women Leaders," the charts are in graph form.

· We found information about women leaders in the United States at the Pew Research Center (2021). We chose data
   from 1995-2019 and replaced the template data with our own data named "Women Leaders in the U.S. (1995-2019)."
   There is a place to upload a data file, but we just typed it into Flourish (Figure 3.64).
                                                                                                                                                         Figure 3.64--Women

· Next, we previewed the data, which included a full preview with animation in a new window. The animation was
   too fast. When presenting this data and telling a story, you want the audience to be able to see the animation. On
   the right-hand side of the line chart, there are all kinds of controls. We selected Animations and changed the ani-
   mation to 2,700 (the default was 900).

· Next, we added a large title on the graph, "Women Leaders in the U.S.," and a subtitle, "1995-2019."
· Next, you can select Create a Story and add a caption (shown in Figure 3.65). We added a quote from U.S. Senator

   Joni Ernst (visible in Exhibit 3.30).

3.7 Data Visualizations Used in Statistics

       In school we learn a lot about language and math. On the language side we learn how to put words together
       into sentences and stories. With math, we learn to make sense of numbers. But it's rare that these two sides are
       paired. No one tells us how to tell stories with numbers. . . . This leaves us poorly prepared for an important task
       that is increasingly in demand.

          --Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic
In our data-driven world, the sheer volume of information at our fingertips can be overwhelming. In this era of abundant
data, the ability to make sense of it all, draw meaningful conclusions, and make informed decisions has become a fun-
damental skill across various domains. Data visualization stands as a powerful ally in this quest for understanding, as it
allows us to transform complex datasets into clear, engaging, and actionable insights. In this section, we embark on a
journey through the multifaceted landscape of data visualization, exploring how it aids our comprehension of descrip-
tive statistics, inferential statistics, Six Sigma, exploratory data analytics, causal analytics, and predictive analytics.

   There are specific guidelines for how statistical data are presented, but it is the data visualizations that help the
researcher grasp the central tendencies, variations, and shape of the data distribution. Whether it's a histogram depict-
ing the frequency of values or a box plot revealing the spread of data, these visualizations breathe life into statistical
summaries. An analytic journey can help answer the questions, What happened? Why did it happen? What will happen?
and What should be done about it? Exhibit 3.31 of the analytic journey shows how these questions are answered.

   Exhibit 3.31--Analytic Journey: How the Questions Are Answered.

Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics should be a first step in an analytic journey. At the heart of the exploration is an initial recognition
that diverse types of data lend themselves to different visual representations. Some of this has been highlighted in previ-

tive statistics, keep in mind that this text will always focus on understanding through visuals, so if the word statistics
makes you uneasy, take a breath and be assured that you do not have to understand the math behind the statistics.
Instead, the visuals will lead you to the correct decision! So what are descriptive statistics?

   Descriptive statistics describe and summarize the data and display characteristics of the location, spread, and shape
of the data. Through visuals, you can describe a trend or specific features. Tools used to visualize descriptive statistics
include bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter graphs, box plots, and more. Descriptive statistics address the ques-
tion, "What happened?" Numerical descriptive tools allow you to summarize data for average, mean, mode, minimum,
and maximum. There are two types of statistics used to describe data:

 1. the measure of central tendency (mean, median, or mode)
2. the measure of spread through range, quartiles, variation, and standard deviation
So far, the explanation has used only words. Dive into an example to see what visuals can do to help you understand.

Example Scenario: Measure of Central Tendency--Finding the Mean and Median

The data in Figure 3.67 shows crime data reported on 14 college campuses. Everything listed here is fictitious. Notice
that the crimes range from 0 to 29 and that the student population ranges from 692 to 47,993.

   Figure 3.67--Fictitious Crime Data at 14 College Campuses

   You can tell it has been formatted as a table by the drop-down arrows. It has also been sorted from highest to lowest
by the number of crimes. The percentage was an added calculation.

   The mean (arithmetic mean) is the average of the values or the "center" of the data. In this case, the mean can be cal-
culated using Excel using the =Average (B2:B15) or (22,330) for the mean of the number of students and =Average (C2:C15)
or (9.6) for the mean of crimes.

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 173
   The median is the midpoint of a set of data values when you put them in order (either smallest to largest or largest to
smallest). It always splits the data into two equal halves. Using Excel, the formula is =median (B2:B15) or (14,211) for the
number of students and =median (C2:C15) or (5.0) for the crimes.

   You may be asking yourself,
   Why is the mean for crimes (9.6) so different from the median (5.0)?
   It could be due to outliers. Outliers are values much larger or much smaller than the rest of the values. Outliers don't
have much impact on the median, but outliers can have a drastic effect on the mean. Since the mean is the balance
point, extreme values in the data will pull the mean toward it to maintain the balance (see Exhibit 3.32 to see the balance
point).
   Exhibit 3.32--Understanding Mean and Median

                                                                                                                                               Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                               (2024)

Example Scenario: Finding the Mode

To find the mode (or modal value), put the list in order. Then count the quantity of each number. The number that
appears most often is the mode. It is possible to have more than one mode. Two modes are called bimodal, and more
than two are called multimodal.

   In Excel, there are several formulas for calculating mode. Look at the data again. You can see two 19s, two 5s, and two
1s. So these data are considered multimodal (see Table 3.14).

   Table 3.14: Multimodal and Mode

Excel formula for multimodal Excel formula for single mode

=MODE.MULT(C2:C15)              =MODE (C2:C15)
   This will show 19, 5, and 1     This will show you just the value 19.

Now let's look at a visual (histogram) of this data. The taller "peaks" of the histogram indicate where more common data
values cluster. These are the modes.

   A histogram is a visual of the modes, but it can look different depending on the number of bins (or how you cluster
your data). Notice in Exhibit 3.33 that a normal curve serves as a guide to measure central tendency. Central tendency is
the statistical measure that best represents the value where all the other data gather. If you don't see that in this exam-
ple (and you don't), that means these data are not on a normal distribution. It is skewed because one side has more data
than the other. A normal distribution, called the bell curve or Gaussian Distribution, is a continuous probability distrib-
ution that is symmetrical. Keep in mind that the sample is only of 14 college campuses.

   Exhibit 3.33--Histogram in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)

174 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
   You can create a histogram in Excel as shown in Exhibit 3.34. In this example, a bin size of 3 was used. You can click
on the axis and adjust the bin size. Graphing the data makes it easier to see that the data are multimodal.

   Exhibit 3.34--Histogram in Excel

   So the visual that might be more explanatory is a "dot plot." Note that you see the multimodal pattern of 1, 5, and 19.
Make sure to compare the dot plot (in Exhibit 3.35) to the previous histogram.

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 175
   Another visual often used (especially in a business setting) is a box plot. A box plot is a visual of the variables, distrib-
ution location, spread, shape, tail length, and outliers. It is sometimes called a box and whisker plot. The box spans the
interquartile range (IQR) of the data and represents the middle 50% of the dataset. The IQR includes the first quartile
(Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). The whiskers extend from the box to the data points outside the IQR.

How to Interpret a Box Plot

 1. Central tendency: If the median is near the center of the box (the example is not), the data are roughly symmetric;
      if it's closer to one end, the data may be skewed.

2. The length of the IQR illustrates the data's range. A longer box indicates greater variability, while a shorter box
      suggests more consistency.

3. There are no outliers in this example, but if an outlier existed, it would show as a data point beyond the whiskers.
Figure 3.68--Box Plot of Crime Data (Prepared in Excel)

   The example of the box plot created in Excel (Figure 3.68) shows a vertical format. It is possible to create a horizontal
box plot in Excel, but it requires multiple steps. Instead, Figure 3.69 shows how to create the box plot in Statistics King-
176 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
dom (an online and free statistics helper). It is much easier to see how the data are skewed when viewing in horizontal
format.

   You may want to bookmark the Statistics Kingdom website. It is easy to use and models example data points, so you
see how to set it up. As previously mentioned, it is possible to change the layout to a horizontal box plot instead of a ver-
tical box plot. We find this layout easier to understand. Statistics Kingdom has several visualization choices: histogram,
box plot, violin plot, cluster analysis chart, Venn diagram, stem-and-leaf plot, and more.

Analyze Data in Excel

In the more recent Microsoft 365, you will see an icon in Excel on the home screen renamed Analyze Data. According
to Microsoft, "Analyze data in Excel empowers you to understand your data through natural language queries that
allow you to ask questions about your data . . . [providing] high-level visual summaries, trends, and patterns" (Excel for
Microsoft 365, 2023, para 2).

   Here's how to use the new tool:
 1. Click inside the data.
2. On the Home tab, select Analyze Data.
3. Browse through the various ways to Discover Insights.
4. In Figure 3.70, one of the insights found shows that there is a correlation between students and crimes, but don't

      start making assumptions. This is a small sample and there are likely other variables that impact the data. This is a
      scatterplot chart; notice the clustering of the data points (correlations will be further discussed in the inferential
      statistics section). But still, this new AI feature is powerful!

There are several

reasons why a decision-maker would want to run descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics will summarize the data.

The data visualizations that accompany this step (histograms, box plots, dot plots) help decision-makers interpret the

data more intuitively, identify trends, and spot outliers or unusual patterns. Descriptive statistics measure central ten-

dency (mean and median), measure dispersion (range, standard deviation), and help decision-makers understand the

variation and spread of data.

This type of understanding is crucial for assessing the consistency and predictability of outcomes. Although not dis-

cussed yet, descriptive statistics can help through metrics like mean and standard deviation for quality control. Even

with the small College Crime dataset, it shows that crimes are reported more often if your student population is smaller.

Although our sample is too small to make this statement with certainty, it is possible that this might be a starting point

for hypothesis generation. So let's run the descriptive statistics using Excel.

        Step-by-Step to Generate Descriptive Statistics in Excel

Use the Descriptive Statistics worksheet in Chapter 3, and follow these steps:
 1. Click somewhere inside the College Crime dataset (see Table 3.11 for the raw dataset).
2. Select the Data tab and click Data Analysis.

                                                         Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 179
3. In the pop-up window, select Descriptive Statistics
     and click OK.

4. A pop-up window will appear. The input range should
     be the students column and the crimes column
     (B1:C15). You can use the headings as long as you check
     the "Labels in first row" box (see Figure 3.73 showing
     the checkbox checked).

5. There are several places to output the data. If you want
     it on the same sheet, make sure to give it plenty of
     room.

6. Also check the "Summary statistics" box.
7. And the last step, click OK.

Now let's look at what Excel gave us for descriptive statistics. We'll go through each term. Some of these terms should
look familiar.

Terms of Descriptive Statistics

  · Mean--an average of the numbers
  · Standard error--measures the accuracy with which a sample distribution represents a population by using stan-

      dard deviation
  · Median--exact middle of the set of values
  · Mode--the most frequently occurring value. This dataset has three numbers that repeat (19, 5, and 1). Therefore, it

      is considered multimodal.
  · Standard deviation--an estimate of the dispersion. Remember, an outlier can greatly exaggerate the range.
  · Kurtosis--refers to the degree of presence of outliers in the distribution
  · Skewness--a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution. You may have seen this drawn by a professor when

      they were explaining the bell curve.

Exhibit 3.36--Example Showing Descriptive Statistics in Excel

180 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
   There are three types of skewness:
 1. a positive skew (long right tail),
2. a symmetrical distribution (the bell curve or the normal distribution), and
3. a negative skew (long left tail).
In a normal distribution, the tails on either side of the curve are exact mirror images of each other. In Exhibit 3.37 the
histogram of the College Crime dataset shows a positive skew, or long right tail.

   In summary, descriptive statistics serve as a critical tool for decision-makers to gain a comprehensive understanding
of their data. Now we'll discuss inferential statistics and look at the difference between diagnostic analytics and infer-
ential statistics.

Inferential Statistics Versus Diagnostic Analytics

Inferential statistics takes the boundary a large step beyond descriptive statistics. It includes hypothesis testing, con-
fidence intervals, regression analysis, and more. It is different from diagnostic analytics. Diagnostic analytics' goal is to
understand why something happened. It aims to identify the root causes of past events or trends. Why did sales decline?
Why did enrollment drop? Diagnostic analytics works with historical data and focuses on analyzing events that have
already occurred. Diagnostic analytic techniques include drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. As
you might expect, the health care industry uses this analytical model every day. A sudden spike in the emergency room
count could be pointing to an infectious agent that has broken out in your area (think of COVID-19!).

   The questions often asked for inferential statistics might be "How likely . . . ?" or "What will happen . . . ?" Inferential
statistics can be applied to both historical and future data to project estimates. Inferential statistical techniques provide
insight to help the decision-maker arrive at a deduction or conclusion. Inferential statistics is a technique that allows us
to draw inferences or conclusions about the population from the sample. The tools used most often include hypothesis
test statistics (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA), though some of the concepts are beyond this text. However, not all are. So look at
the type of data visualizations used in inferential statistics.

   You can still expect to see histograms, box plots, and scatterplots as some of the first steps because you should always
conduct descriptive statistics to understand your data. Other types of tests could be probability plots, residual plots,
time series plots, and many others.

182 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
Making a Scatterplot That Tells a "Clear" Story

One of the main visuals in the inferential statistics realm is a scatterplot, which is valuable for visualizing the relation-
ships between two continuous variables. Sometimes you expect a relationship, and the scatterplot will tell you if there is
a correlation (or relationship). To understand the use of scatterplots, look at the relationship between perceived astrin-
gency and tannins in red wine as illustrated in Exhibit 3.38. Astringency is a term associated with puckering or a drying
feeling in the mouth caused by the presence of tannins in wine. Tannins are primarily from grape skins, seeds, stems, or
even oak barrels. In a technical brief by Kennedy et al. (2006) in a wine publication, the researchers found a correlation
between tannins and astringency.

   Exhibit 3.38--Positive Relationship Between Tannins (x) and Astringency (y)

   Once you see a linear relationship, it's time to take the next step, and that is to run a regression to measure the amount
of correlation. Regression analysis is an inferential statistical tool. At its core, regression analysis seeks to answer one
fundamental question: How does change in one (or more) independent variable influence a dependent variable? In this
case, we want to measure the amount of astringency that is caused by tannins. Most wine-tasting experts use their
perceived taste to assess whether a wine's tannins are acceptable in its current state or whether it would benefit from
further aging to soften the astringency. But what if you could predict the degree of astringency with a certain level of
tannins? Here are the steps using the Tannins and Astringency dataset.

        Step-by-Step to Run a Regression Analysis in Excel

Before you can do anything with statistics in Excel, you need to add the Analysis ToolPak as an add-in to Excel. This was
shown earlier in this section.

 1. Open "3.7 Scatterplot and Regression" in Chapter 3 Excel files.
2. Click inside the dataset.
3. Choose Data on the main menu tab.

4. Click Data Analysis and select Regression from the pop-up Data Analysis tool.
5. Click OK.
6. For the input Y range, choose the perceived astringency column and for the X range, choose the tannin concentra-

      tion (see Figure 3.74).
 7. The output range can be a new worksheet, but I chose to run the regression and placed it in the existing work-

      sheet.

8. Then click OK, and you will see the output as shown in Figure 3.75.
In the illustration, you will notice that there is an equation that should be slightly familiar to you. This regression line is
a fundamental component of regression analysis to help understand the relationship between two variables: One is the
dependent variable, and one is the independent variable.

   The formula is Y = a + b(X), where
  · Y represents the dependent variable, the one you're trying to predict (the perceived astringency);
  · X represents the independent variable, the one you are using to make the predictions (this is the tannin concen-

      tration in this example); and
  · a is the intercept, where the regression line crosses the y-axis.

   Let's start by demystifying all the terms.

Regression Terms

Multiple R: This is the correlation coefficient. A value of 1 means a perfect positive relationship. A value of 0 means no
relationship, and a value of -1 means a perfect negative relationship. Correlation tells you the degree (or strength) to
which two variables move in relation to each other. Correlation measures association but not causation. In this sce­
nario: .915670936 represents a highly positive correlation (which is what our scatterplot showed us).

   R Square: This is called the coefficient of determination. It tells you how many points fall on the regression line. In
this example, 84% of the values fit the model.

   Adjusted R Square: This adjusts for the number of terms in a model. You would use this if you had more than one x
variable.

   Standard Error: First of all, this is not the same as the standard error in our descriptive statistics! This standard error
is about precision. Essentially, this model predicts a variation around the regression line of 0.253016741.

   ANOVA: If you are doing basic linear regression (and we are), this section can be skipped. But just so you know what
these things are, here is the list:

   The df is the degrees of freedom (the sample minus 1). The SS equals Sum of Squares. The MS is the Residual SS /
Regression degrees of freedom. F tests for the null hypothesis. Significance F is the significance associated with the
p-value (if you look, you will see the same value in the third section under p-value). When you first see this, you may not
know what the "-13" means. Just know that it means that it is significant.

Regression Coefficients

We get to the most important part in the regression coefficients section. First let me talk about the linear regression
equation.

   Table 3.15: Regression Coefficient Formula With Coefficients

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 185
           Coefficients

Intercept  -1.590840994

Tannin Concentration 2.594588662

Equation:  = a + bx
   For our scenario:  = -1.59 + 2.59 (x)
   Where b = slope (2.59), where x = the concentration of tannins, and where a = the intercept -1.59
   The intercept is where the slope starts at the y-axis. So a wine with a tannin concentration of .5 would predict a per-

ceived astringency of -0.295.
   Plugging into the formula would give us the following:

   Regression should not scare you! And remember, you realized there was a correlation between tannins and astrin-

gency from the visual. The regression just puts numbers to the degree of correlation and gives you an inferential statistic
tool to determine astringency if the level of tannin concentration is known!

   So how else are scatterplots used?

Scatterplots That Show a Pattern

There are many uses for scatterplots beyond showing a correlation. For example, some scatterplots show a pattern but
not a correlation. To demonstrate such a scatterplot, a dataset was downloaded from The Human Development Center
(http://hdr.undp.org/en/data), part of the United National Development Programme. Statistical reports are available
with over 150 global indicators that can be analyzed in different combinations. Each tells a story. To show some specific
tips regarding data with outliers, a small 2020 dataset with 40 countries (as shown in Figure 3.76) was downloaded with
the following categories: Internet, GDP, CO2, Cellular, Fertility, and Literacy. For this example, we can create a scatter-
plot to show the country (Column A) and fertility (Column F) of the 39 countries in 2020.

The default scatterplot will look like Example A in Exhibit 3.39. The red arrow (added manually) indicates an easily spot-
ted outlier. But how could you improve the visual to tell the story better? Improve the title, add a band of color (manu-
ally), and add axis titles. Which example contributes more to your story? By using an overlay, we see the outliers more
clearly. Example B is formatted so the x-axis shows the number of children, and the y-axis shows the countries.

One of the new features in Microsoft Excel is creating a map chart across geographical regions. This is one of my favorite
charts and it's always been available in Power BI. In the Chapter 3 Excel file, choose the Scatter Plot tab. The dataset
shows 40 countries with information about the internet, GDP, CO2, cellular, fertility, and literacy. Exhibit 3.41, shows
what a "map" might look like. So the next step is to construct one.

Heatmaps and Correlation Matrix

A good visual cue is a heat map. A heatmap is a graphical representation of data by color and it is a great tool for large
datasets. For example, heatmaps are often used to show airplane delays, ranging from green for on-time landing, to
bright red for delays as much as 40 minutes. Some organizations use a heat map to show website traffic by time of day.

   It is also a great way to see if two different groups are on the same page (like CEOs and board members shown in Table
3.16). The images in Table 3.16 show the responses of CEOs and board members who were asked the same questions.
The board members saw only a moderate correlation (.6817) for Question 1 with Question 2. The next value is .5633 when
comparing Question 1 and Question 15.

   But when you look at the CEOs', there is mostly very high correlation and high correlation with a majority of questions.
In fact, on the CEOs' survey data, only Question 9 had no correlation with other questions.

   Correlation is not causation, but it is clear that board members and CEOs are not on the same page. A correlation at
.9 to 1 (100%) is very highly correlated, .7 to .9 is highly correlated, and .5 to .7 is moderately correlated.

   Table 3.16: Heatmap Shows That Board Members and CEOs Are Not on the Same Page

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 189

Question 1 is moderately correlated with Question 2 and Question 15.  Very high and high correla

A heatmap reduces mental processing because the color saturation provides visual cues. Table 3.16 shows low corre-
lation on the left, indicated by the lack of color and strong correlation on the right indicated by color cues. For this
example the numbers are not important.

   A heatmap can be produced in Excel using conditional formatting. Creating a correlation matrix is available in Data
Analysis (an add-in to Excel) to the Data table. Then you can set up conditional formatting. Compare the two. On the
right, which reflects employees, notice how you only see one correlation between Question 1 and Question 15. But if
you look at the administrators (CEOs in Table 3.16) answering the same question you see that almost all questions are
correlated: Red = very high correlation, and Green = high correlation.

   Without the context of the questions asked to both groups, it is difficult to tell the story. But it is clear that the board
members and CEOs are not in agreement.

   Heatmaps are not just a tool for business. The sports industry uses heatmaps in other ways that you might not con-
sider. Sports team coaches use heatmaps to visualize a team's player positions, "movement, movement patterns, event
occurring spots (events may include penalties, call for foul play, injuries, goals, and so on)" (Khongthaw, 2020, para. 7).

   Heatmaps used for large datasets can be somewhat overwhelming. For example, the United Nations Department of
Economic and Social Affairs uses a heat map to show supplementary graduation indicators and time series estimates of
the least developed countries. The heatmap looks like a quilt with shades of blue, orange, and tan, but just the image
provided would take over three pages in a printed textbook to show it!

Risk Matrix Heat Map

What is a risk matrix? Essentially, a risk matrix is a visual where the organization assesses its exposure to types of harm
and plots this information on a risk matrix. The matrix is then used to develop management strategies and implement
actions that manage the risk. The risk matrix should consider all the risks associated with an organization including
financial risk, operation risk, workforce risk, client (customer) risk, and reputational risk, and in the case of a not-for-
profit organization (NFP), programmatic risks. The example shown in Exhibit 3.42 was created in Excel and is included
in the Chapter 3 files. This is only an example. If you do a search on a risk matrix, you will see slightly different theories
on how the legend and colors would be assigned. Make it your own for your organization. The main point is to consider
all the risks your organization faces in the next year and use this matrix to prioritize them. Next, devise strategies that
will reduce or neutralize the impact of the potential risks. Remember, each organization is unique; an event that might
be catastrophic for one organization might be an acceptable, easily managed risk for another.

Six Sigma

Inferential statistics are a big part of Six Sigma. Shown in Exhibit 3.43, we see the empirical rule of standard deviation at
one (68.2%), two (95.4%) and 3 (99.7%). Six Sigma takes it much further by working with up to 99.9999998% data points,
which is ± six standard deviations from the mean.

   Exhibit 3.43--Empirical Rule of Standard Deviation.
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration

According to Master of Project Academy, "Six Sigma is about creating a culture that demands perfection and that gives
employees the tools to enable them to pinpoint performance gaps and make the necessary improvements using data-
driven problem-solving methods" (para. 10). Academic researchers are less likely to work with data that requires this
level of focus on acceptable levels, but practitioners might be required to work with the Six Sigma model. For example,
the quality of a new drug would require this model for quality control.

                                                                                                   Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights | 191

Exploratory Data Analytics

In exploratory data analytics, the user gains key insights by analyzing patterns to recognize potential relationships. This
is one of the first steps in understanding your data. Artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance exploratory data
analytics (EDA) by automating and accelerating the process of uncovering patterns, and insights.

                  The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.
                  --John Tukey

One product provided by Microsoft is Power Business Intelligence (BI). In Power BI, once data are uploaded, it will review
the data for insights and create graphs automatically. Power BI looks for subsets of your data. The types of insights
include (1) outliers, (2) change point in a time series, (3) correlation, (4) low variance, (5) majority (attributing to a single
factor), (6) overall trends in time series, (7) seasonality in time series, and (8) steady share. The insights will be covered in
depth in a later chapter, or you can explore Microsoft Learn using Microsoft's (2023) resource. Part of becoming a good
researcher is to be able to communicate your findings; so always use every tool you can to really understand your data.
Power BI is introduced in Chapter 7.

Causal Analytics

Causal analytics focuses on the "why" something occurred. It is important to understand the difference between corre-
lation and causation. Causation indicates that one event is the result of another event (cause = effect). Correlation tests

192 | Leverage Data Visualizations to Show Trends and Insights
for a relationship between two variables. But seeing the two moving together does not necessarily mean one variable
causes the other. "Distinguishing between what does or does not provide causal evidence is a key piece of data literacy"
(Statistical Knowledge Portal: A Free Online Introduction to Statistics, 2020, para 2).

   An example of causal analytics might involve investigating whether a marketing campaign directly leads to an increase
in customer engagement and sales. By isolating and manipulating variables, we can identify and quantify causal factors
that influence outcomes. Do not confuse diagnostic analytics with causal analytics. An example of diagnostic analytics
could be Google Analytics to help website owners understand what has happened and why it happened. Causal analytics
is like A/B testing (before and after a change of a new feature).

Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics predicts what is most likely to happen (future), so you can expect a question, "What will happen?"
Some of the techniques used include regression models, data mining, modeling, and artificial intelligence. The most
common use is by insurance and financial companies but growing industries that use predictive analytics include mar-
keting and health care (e.g., COVID-19 algorithms). The financial sector uses predictive analytics to anticipate stock price
movements, while health care forecasts patient readmission rates based on historical patient data. This type of analyt-
ics enables organizations to make proactive decisions, optimize processes, and mitigate risk. Just think, you've already
worked through a regression model used in the wine industry!

Chapter 3 Summary

In this comprehensive chapter, we demonstrated a plethora of advanced data visualization techniques and tools, explor-
ing their applications in strategic decision-making across various situations. Anscombe's quartet was introduced to
underscore the deceptive nature of statistics, emphasizing how visualizations unveil nuanced stories beyond numeri-
cal analysis. It's a great way to let the visualizations show trends and provide insights. From the simplest graphic that
resides in a cell, to animated infographics created in Flourish, you were led on an enlightening journey of discovery.

   Survey data visualization techniques, from horizontal stacked bar charts with icons to word clouds, were presented as
effective ways to convey information. Benchmarking tools (Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, PESTLE, Benchmarks by Associ-
ations, Balanced Scorecard) were explored along with a handful of decision-making tools (Ishikawa, decision tree, and
a Pareto Diagram). When working with benchmarking tools or decision-making tools, it is important to determine ways
to communicate and tell your data's story even if your audience is virtual. The chapter emphasizes the significance of
effective communication, especially in a virtual setting when utilizing benchmarking or decision-making tools.

   To enhance practical understanding, readers explored the art of presenting at a poster show, equipping them with
skills to organize graphics and data for swift comprehension by a virtual audience. This chapter also explored ways data
visualizations are used in statistics, including how to interpret a box plot; how to generate descriptive statistics in Excel;
best uses of scatterplots, correlations, and heatmaps; and ways to provide meaningful analysis.

                                        This chapter has over a dozen Excel worksheets with step-by-step guidance on creating
                                     graphs and data visualizations. This comprehensive resource serves as a valuable toolkit for
                                     leveraging advanced data visualization in both strategic decision-making and statistical
                                     analysis.

Chapter 3 Case: Empowering Women Leaders

       In a conference room in the heart of Washington, D.C., a group of aspiring women leaders from
       diverse backgrounds gather to develop a transformative leadership seminar for the coming year.
       The objective? To equip the future attendees with skills and insights needed to excel in leader-
       ship roles and drive positive change in their field. One of the key ideas from the group is to
       introduce Flourish, a dynamic data visualization platform (and part of Canva) as a dynamic data
       visualization tool. Each year, they produce an annual report of gains (and losses) made in lead-
       ership in the United States with other country comparisons. Each conference planner was given
       a dataset to input into Flourish with an idea to model some of the statistics in their opening ses-

sion.

Case Objectives

 1. Create and use decision-making tools to provide context for problems, support decisions, and assess risk.
2. Interpret research industry trends and recognize bias.

Case Guidelines

The conference planners divided up different datasets related to women in leadership. Your dataset is from the Organ-
isation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and you've been asked to compare the United States,
Greece, Japan, and the OECD average for the period 2014-2022. (See Exhibit 3.44 for a clearer picture of the data you
need to use.)

          What Do You Think?
          Matthew (Matt) mentioned he was competent using Excel to his boss. Matt works at XCaliber Food Distri-
       bution in the Midwest and has just been asked to provide data analytics to the owner. XCaliber Food Distrib-
       ution celebrated its first year in 2024 with mixed results. Today, Matt received an exported file from the
       accounting software and wants to do a full analysis of last year's sales. The email from the owner indicated
       that the files were CSV files and represented a data dump of revenue information for the last year. Matt
       knew that CSV meant comma-separated values file and that he could open the file in Excel. Matt considers
       his Excel skills to be fairly good, but the owner asked several questions in an email that showed he wanted
       to move beyond a report. Instead, the owner wanted to interact with the information in a dashboard.
          Matt reviewed the email and made notes. Here is the list:
           1. I want to know how well my salespeople are doing. Which salespeople are selling the most; in what

                city, state, and region; and what are they selling? Are there two or three salespeople who could con-
                duct the training (with pay)?
          2. Are there products that should be dropped?
          3. I want to know if using the summer intern in June and July was worth the cost (about $4,000).
          4. Is every salesperson collecting from their customer by check, cash, or credit?
          5. What is the range of invoices by customer, and who are our best customers? Are there opportuni-
                ties for upselling?
          6. Are we shipping out within the same day on a consistent basis?
           7. Do we have regional overlap? Are two salespeople selling to the same customer?
          8. I want to increase revenue to $60,000/month in 2025. Can you do some sort of analysis to see the
                best way to reach this goal--perhaps using a gap analysis or something like that?
          9. I want to be able to ask a question and get the answer instantaneously. I heard it is called a dash-
                board. Can you set up a dashboard that allows me to analyze the data right along with you?
         10. What do you think a survey of our customers will tell us?
          Based on this list of questions, where would you start?

Introduction

This chapter delves into the intricacies of constructing informative and engaging dashboards, designed to communicate
insights effectively to diverse audiences. We cover a spectrum of topics that includes the art of storytelling with slicers,
the nuances of reports versus dashboards, techniques for creating impactful visualization, and foundational rules of

dashboard design across various fields. Data no longer resides in static spreadsheets; it breathes and evolves as users
explore, analyze, and draw conclusions, effortlessly.

   We plan to illustrate the application of these concepts along with ways to tell the story better. By the time you con-
clude this chapter, you will possess the knowledge and expertise to construct interactive dashboards that transcend
mere data presentations. You will have the tools you need to weave compelling stories with data, unlock the insights
within your datasets, and be well versed in the art of data-driven communications.

   Chapter 4 addresses the following learning objectives.

4.1 Report Versus Dashboard

       Data visualization must communicate answers and provide business outcomes. If the data feeding an analytics
       dashboard is not trusted, the results are meaningless. If the visualizations do not answer important business
       questions, the visualizations are not actionable.

          --Katie Horvath, CoreSignal

What is a dashboard? A dashboard is NOT a report. Reports are the most common way to communicate business intel-
ligence: "The key attribute of a report is that it doesn't lead a reader to a predefined conclusion. Although a report can
include analysis, aggregations, calculations, and event charts, reports often require the reader to apply his own judg-
ment and analysis to the data" (Alexander & Walkenbach, 2013, p. 12). A dashboard displays data visually and draws focus
to key trends, comparisons, and exceptions. Focus is the keyword here--having only relevant data is the goal. Most dash-
boards have a technique for the user to interact with the data. In the simplest Excel dashboard, adding a slicer can allow
the user to answer additional questions, show new trends, and drill down into the data. A slicer in a dashboard is a user
interface element that provides an interactive way to filter and analyze data displayed in various visuals or charts. Before
we go much further, look at the difference between a dashboard and a report. Dashboards and reports are quite differ-
ent in Microsoft's Power BI. For the purposes of this chapter, a dashboard provides quick insights and a consolidated
view of key metrics to answer questions from the user. Users will often request a way to interact with the dashboard

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 201
(i.e., a slicer). Dashboards can provide real-time monitoring whereas reports are more historical. We will start with a
very simple example scenario.

Campus Travel Scenario: Report Versus Dashboard

The college just started a Campus Travel program run by interns majoring in travel and event management. The program
started in January 2024 and ran through April 25, 2024. All interns worked approximately the same number of hours per
week but on different days. Occasionally, there was some overlap with other interns. Campus Travel was open 4 hours
a day, every day of the week except for normal campus holidays or breaks. Scheduling the interns to work around their
classes was particularly difficult. At the end of the semester, the interns worked collaboratively to create a report for
their advisor.

   The data had the following categories: (1) date tickets were sold, (2) salesperson (intern), (3) travel destination, and (4)
number of tickets sold. The dataset consisted of 35 ticket sale transactions. For the report, the interns used the following
calculations: (a) total tickets sold (81), (b) most tickets sold by intern (6), (c) least tickets sold by intern (1), and (d) average
number of tickets sold (2.31). You see these calculations in D37:D40.

   The interns used formulas in Excel (sum, max, min, and average) as part of the report. However, the static report was
not what the advisor expected. The advisor wanted visuals, and he wanted to be able to interact with the data. The
interns were stuck in a basic report mode, assuming that a few calculations and an ability to sort and count the data
manually would work; however, the advisor expected an interactive dashboard!

   The advisor wanted to see the number of tickets for each destination and the number of tickets sold by month and by
day both as a group and for each intern. Why? Because he wanted to assess the success of the program and determine
what standards should be set for the repeat of the program in 2025. So the advisor might be asking these kinds of ques-
tions:

 1. Did all interns sell tickets to each destination? If not, why? Was it just a chance of scheduling, or were interns
      unfamiliar with the destination process?

2. Is there a day of the week that Campus Travel could be closed? Scheduling is a nightmare for the advisor and
      interns, and both deserve one day off each week.

3. Are there interns who sell more tickets and/or travel destinations and could help train new interns?
4. Should interns be required to sell a minimum number of tickets?

According to Alexander & Walkenbach (2013), "When gathering the measures required for the dashboard . . . write out a
sentence to describe the measures needed" and determine the types of techniques that will allow the user to interact
with the data (p. 15).

   There was a gap in communication. Let's compare the report and dashboard. Notice the dashboard in Figure 4.1 is dri-
ven by a "slicer." A slicer allows the user to manipulate all the graphs. The slicer provides the interaction and allows the
advisor to look at each intern's progress by selecting their name on the slicer.

Campus Travel also conducts a posttrip survey that asks three questions. Although the information is easy to read in the
table, what technique would make it easier to see insights and trends?

What Is a Data Model?

Let's work through the step-by-step process of creating a Microsoft Excel dashboard and the use of a data model. A data
model allows you to integrate data from multiple tables and multiple sources! This is a good skill to know since most
situations require you to pull data in from different sources. For example, in Campus Travel, the interns keep track of
their schedules and about how long it takes to sell a destination package. The advisor might want to consider this use
of time--especially if the intern doesn't actually make the sale but has spent hours of time working with the potential
customer.

        Step-by-Step to Create a Simple Dashboard in Microsoft Excel

poses. Annotations added by the author.

   The first step is to explore an existing dashboard that uses two table ranges. The "4.1 Campus Travel Ticket Sales Stu-
dent File" is in the Chapter 4 Excel files.

 1. Open Microsoft Excel and open the file "Campus Travel Ticket Sales with dashboards."
                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 203
2. Explore the data.
      Look at the Raw Data file. Notice that it is a table. You can tell it is a table because it allows you to sort using the
      drop-down arrows shown in the header row. Notice the total number of tickets sold and the other calculations
      used at the bottom of the table. The table extends from A1 to D36 with a header row that shows Date Sold, Sales-
      person, Destination, and Tickets Sold. Do not include the calculations.
      Click inside the table, and you will notice a new tab on the ribbon called Table Design. Select the Table Design.
      You should also notice that the table name shows as "Data."

Click the Home tab on the ribbon and locate the "Format as Table" within the Styles group. Look through the data and
notice that you see the date sold but not the day of the week.

   Select the Calendar tab. The calendar tab was created so that the date the tickets were sold could be attached to the
day of the week. The day of the week formula (shown in Figure 4.2) is =TEXT(A2,"ddd"). If you add an extra "d" into the
formula, the entire day will be the result. The month formula is =TEXT(A2, "mmmm") to show the entire month spelled
out with no abbreviation.

                                                                                 Figure 4.2--Day of the
                                                                                 Week Formula

Next, select the dashboard tab. This is a completed dashboard for you to explore. If you click on any of the chart areas,
you will see the PivotChart Fields pop-up. Try interacting with the chart by selecting the name Andrew in the slicer. You
should see all three charts change.

   In addition, click on one of the PivotTables and notice the PivotChart Fields that pop up. It shows both Calendar and
Data tables. Note that the Calendar table has "Date Sold" and the Data table has "Date Sold." There must be a common
point between the two tables you want to use. In this case, "Date Sold" is that connection (see Figure 4.3).

                                                                                                   Figure 4.3--Both Tables
                                                                                                   Show in the PivotChart
                                                                                                   Field

A data model allows the user to integrate multiple tables.
   Next, we will take you through the steps to build the data model.
  · Select the raw data file and click one of the cells within the data table. It can be any cell within A2 to D36.
  · Click Insert and look for PivotChart & PivotTable (like Figure 4.4).
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 4.4--PivotChart
                                                                                                                                                           Icon

  · A pop-up screen should show a table range for the data and a new worksheet. Notice that the data itself will be
      surrounded by a moving dotted line. Always verify that you have selected the correct data range. In this case, you
      should make sure it has selected A1 through D36. You do NOT want any row after 36 even though it has calcula-
      tions.
                                                                                                   Figure 4.5--Use the
                                                                                                   Data Model

  · Notice the pop-up has a checkbox for analyzing multiple tables. One of the powerful features of Excel is to bring
      together multiple related tables to analyze data. Since we have already done this step earlier, choose "Use this
      workbook's Data Model" as in Figure 4.5. (Note that if we had not set this up already, you would choose the check-
      box shown in the red square to "Add this data to the data model.").Once you have verified the correct data, choose
      OK. You will know it worked if you see both Calendar and Data in the PivotChart Fields.If we had not already set up
      the data model, you would be prompted to connect the relationship between the two tables (as shown in Figure
      4.6).You will know if you are working with data that do not have this relationship because your graphs will show the
      same data for each person.

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 205
                                                                                                                                                        Figure 4.6--Set Up

                                                                                                                                                        Tables

  · In the PivotTable fields, choose All. This will show you both Calendar and Data.
  · Now the fun part! Drag the Week_day to the rows section and the tickets sold to the values section. You will

      notice both a PivotChart and a PivotTable show on the worksheet. By default, it shows blue columns and total for
      both a title and a legend. Additionally, the days of the week are not in order. At this point, we have some work to do
      on this chart and the PivotTable. For example, in Figure 4.7, you see a "Total" legend that is not needed because it
      doesn't add any value.

                                                                                                                                                           Figure 4.7--Default
                                                                                                                                                           PivotChart

  · Start by changing the title to "Tickets Sold--Day of Week" and delete the legend (we don't need it). This design still
      needs work. Notice that the days of the week are not in order, and we have field buttons. To remove the field but-
      tons, choose PivotChart Analyze, click the Field button, and choose Hide All. Now follow the next four steps to
      clean up the chart.

                                                                                                                                               Default PivotChart

   Use the numbers in Figure 4.8 for the explanation and process.
   Part 1--Click on Design.

      Part 2--Choose the design with blue columns and gray background.
      Part 3--Remove the grid lines (by clicking on just the lines and delete). If you delete something you didn't intend
   to delete, use Control + z or Undo.
      Part 4--Click on the Row Labels above the days of the week and sort A to Z to arrange the days of the week in
   order.
· Next, name the tab "Charts step-by-step." You may choose a different chart design, but just make sure all charts
   have the same color palette. Add branding if applicable. The PivotChart tools (analyze, design, and format) will
   show above the menu ribbon. Select Design and choose a design you like. I chose a design that removed the grid
   lines and featured the number of tickets in each column, as shown in Figure 4.9. Choose any color that matches
   your brand colors. The one thing I may still change is the text indicating the number of tickets for each day of the
   week. Notice how difficult it is to read "Wednesday." But for now, move on.
· Next, highlight the PivotTable only to copy. Copy it within the same worksheet that you named "Charts step-by-
   step." It looks like Figure 4.9.

                                                                                                                                                 Interactive Dashboards | 207

  · Make sure you have only selected a single cell within the second PivotTable, which starts on cell A16 in the illustra-
      tion. The PivotTable fields pane will pop-up. You may need to use the drop-down to see all the fields under each
      table. Uncheck the Week_Day and check the Month. See Figure 4.10 for both a Month PivotTable and a Destina-
      tion PivotTable.
                                                                                                            Figure 4.10--Copied

  · Make sure you have selected a cell within the third PivotTable (that starts on cell A25 in the illustration). In the
      PivotTables Fields pane, uncheck the Week_Day and check the Destinations (or you can use drag and drop). We
      don't have charts yet for PivotTables 2 and 3.

  · Select a cell within the second PivotTable (the month one) and notice the PivotTable Tools above the ribbon. It
208 | Interactive Dashboards
   shows Analyze and Design. Choose Analyze in the expanded ribbon and choose PivotChart. Choose the first col-
   umn chart. As you can see, the default will need a title change, removal of the legend, removal of field buttons, and
   a new design to match the first one. Don't forget to sort the months!
· Next, select a cell within the third PivotTable (the destination one) and notice the PivotTable Tools above the rib-
   bon. Once again, choose the PivotChart Analyze and choose PivotChart. Choose the first column chart and change
   the design to match the two previous charts. You may want to sort the destinations by selecting the Sum of Tickets
   Sold and sorting from highest to lowest.
   This is a screenshot (Figure 4.11) of the results of steps 11-15. Notice all the charts have a similar look.

                                                                                                                                                       Figure 4.11--PivotTable

· Next, add a sheet and name it Dashboard. You may want to organize the tabs.
   a. Put in a light gray background by clicking on the triangle between Column A and Row 1 and choosing a color for
   the background from the paint bucket (this is in the font group).
   b.Copy the three charts and arrange it like the following, leaving a spot for the slicer.

                                                                                                                                                Interactive Dashboards | 209

  · Next, we are going to insert a slicer. Remember a slicer will provide interaction and allow the user to see ticket
      sales by day, month, and destination for each salesperson. First select the first chart. At the insert tab on the rib-
      bon, select Slicer. A pop-up menu will show your table data. Select Salesperson (see Figure 4.13).
                                                                                                                                                           Figure 4.13--Insert a

      A slicer tool will appear so that you can format the slicer to match the chart colors. Since the default is blue, it
      matches the PivotCharts. If you chose a different color for PivotCharts, change the slicer color to match. You may
      want to narrow the size of the slicer.

         You will notice that if you try the slicer, you will see only the first chart change. Slicers should drive or connect to
      all the PivotCharts.
  · With the slicer selected, you will see Slicer above the ribbon and only one choice--Options. Look through the
      Options menu for Report Connections. Select Report Connections. Choose this and a pop-up will show all the
210 | Interactive Dashboards
      existing connections. Just make sure they are all checked in your Dashboard. Now try your slicer. All charts and
      PivotTables should change when you select a name. If anything looks off, check the tab called just "Dashboard" to
      make sure that the slicer is not filtering; otherwise, you can have some strange results.
Exhibit 4.1--Completed Dashboard

   Using the dashboard, see if you can answer the questions considered by the advisor by using the slicer. The last ques-
tion, "Should interns be required to sell a minimum number of tickets?" will take more research to determine if this
requirement would help meet the learning outcomes of the program. Dashboards can't answer every question!

     4.1 Exercise 1: Interacting With Slicers

        Learning Objective #3--Apply the appropriate visualization: report versus dashboard
                          In the dashboard for this section, use the slicer that you built (or the one provided) to answer

                       the following questions. Be ready to discuss this in class or on the online discussion board (check
                       with instructor).
                   1. Interns earn college credit for their internship through the Career Development Office (CDO).
             Interns are expected to do journalling and write papers about their experience. As a teacher in the CDO,
             you've noticed that several mention the difficulty in selling the France (Paris and Nice) destination since it
             has so few interactions with locals. Did all interns sell tickets to all destinations?
        2. Scheduling is a nightmare for the advisor and interns, and both deserve one day off each week. Is there
             a day of the week that Campus Travel could be closed?
        3. Are there interns who sold more tickets and/or travel destinations and could help train new interns?
        4. Should interns be required to sell a minimum number of tickets?
        5. Discuss the data model process. Are there other file types you can use besides tables? Why do you

4.2 Simple Techniques to Visualize and Tell a Story

       We're born problem solvers. We're compelled to deduce and to deduct because that's what we do in real life. It's
       this well-organized absence of information that draws us in. . . . Make the audience put things together. Don't
       give them four, give them two plus two. The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to
       whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.

          --Andrew Stanton, writer and director
Congratulations! You've taken raw data and created your first simple dashboard with a slicer. Now it's time to look at
some simple visualizations and focus on a few indispensable tools: databars and icon sets. These unassuming techniques
wield remarkable power when harnessed by skilled presenters. By delving into real-world scenarios, we uncover how
storytellers can paint vivid narratives that captivate our audience.

What Are Databars?

Databars are miniature bar charts that provide an intuitive way to represent data within the confines of a single cell but
are different from sparklines. The easiest way to understand how databars can be used is to look at a scenario. In the
previous section, you were introduced to a dashboard created for Campus Travel. Campus Travel interns do follow-up
calls with the advisor to find out if customers were satisfied with three potential areas of their trip. This is especially
important since Campus Travel tries to package these trips with special amenities. The after-trip surveys ask three
questions. "Reflecting on your trip, which would you want more of: (1) eat a meal with locals, (2) tour with locals, or (3)
stay with locals?" Exhibit 4.2 shows the data collected from the 2024 trips.

Simple Techniques for Understanding Data

We've talked about conditional formatting in an earlier chapter, but let's look at a conditional format feature known as
databars for the survey data.

   Conditional formatting is used to visualize data through databars, color scales, and icon sets. Introduced originally in
Excel 2007, it was extended to integrate with PivotTables a few years later.

   The survey with databars is shown in Exhibit 4.3. Clearly, customers who purchased tickets with India as their des-
tination wanted much more interaction with the locals! But are there other insights we should notice? Or is there a
different way we should show the data?

   Exhibit 4.3--Survey Data With Databars: Count of Tickets

   Caution! Does this really represent the whole picture? No. To explain, let's look at an example. Six ticket holders from
Japan want to eat a meal with locals. However, six ticket holders only represent 50% of those who traveled to Japan.
Now look at India. In this case, 12 ticket holders out of a total of 13 want to eat a meal with locals. Twelve ticket holders
represent 92% of those who traveled to India. The "Total Tickets Sold" is a great column to have, but what might work
better would be turning the data into percentages.

   Exhibit 4.4--Survey Data With Databars: Percentage of Tickets

   As you review the data, note the following:
  · 53% of all ticket holders want to eat a meal with the locals,
  · 69% want to tour with locals, and
  · only 23% want to stay with locals.
But this data does bring up some questions. Why do only 25% of France ticket holders want to tour with locals? And
notice that the number of tickets for France is only 10% and represents the smallest number of ticket sales. The advisor
needs to add some open-ended questions about France's travel arrangements!
   Another aspect of conditional formatting includes specific criteria (greater than, equal to, and less than) and icon sets.

214 | Interactive Dashboards
Icon sets, like those in Figure 4.14, often use color associations like a stoplight with red for warning, yellow for caution,
and green for normal, but there are many shapes beyond using a stoplight design.

   Figure 4.14--Icon Sets Available in Excel
                                                                 Source: Screenshot of
                                                                 Excel Interface ©
                                                                 Microsoft Corporation

Revisit Icon Sets

Icon sets are specifically helpful when you are comparing lots of data and need a visual to quickly see issues. In Figure
4.15, you only see information for five landmarks, but what if you had over a thousand landmarks to review? The 2019
and 2020 years show a loss of visitors, but this is probably because of COVID-19. There was a pattern of concern for
landmark #4 before the COVID-19 years, but it appears to have improved.

   Figure 4.15--Icon Set Used for Conditional Format (Applied by Row)

   Along with icon sets, don't forget to consider sparklines! As a reminder, sparklines are best used for trends, seasonal
increases or decreases, cyclical data, and highlighting minimum and maximum values.

   Now assume that the advisor has asked all the interns to work together to present their insights and findings. Let's
start with the storytelling basics.

   The Art of Storytelling When the Room Is Overwhelming
   FEAR: Something that happens between the time you are planning for a presentation and the actual presentation. If
you have a fear of public speaking (glossophobia), it may be something that you have fought since childhood. Sweaty
palms, faster heart rate, and memories of prior poor performances or presentations may get in the way of connecting
with the audience. About the only thing that will help with prepresentation fear is practice, practice, practice. Try out
your storytelling with a pilot audience (family, friends, and coworkers are supportive and good critics). Get organized
and make sure the technology works, internet is available, and the space works. There is nothing worse than present-
ing when the display unit is too small for the room. If you know this ahead of time, you can request a second display,
encourage the audience to move forward, or even rearrange the chairs.

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 215
                                                        Imagine you will be presenting in the room pictured here and

                                                        need to keep your audience engaged even though there are

                                                        potential distractions. Do you need a wireless microphone? Do

                                                        you have a wireless presentation clicker to advance the slides?

                                                        Oh, wait! Where do the slides show? If someone asks a question,

                                                        will you hear them? Or do you need to set up a way for the audi-

                                                        ence to send questions through a phone app? Are you being

                                                        asked to present both physically and virtually? If so, that brings

                                                        another set of challenges.

                                                        Be prepared--know your presenting territory, and have water

                                                        available, take deep breaths, and focus on the material.

Domain                                                  it like a crutch, it breaks the connection with your audience.
                                                        Symptoms of a PowerPoint crutch include reading the slides,

presenting with your back to the audience to see where you are in your slides, fumbling to remember what is next even

with the slide up, and excessive "ums" and other filler words. And please, if you notice a spelling error or typo, don't

point it out to the audience! Another thing we use as a crutch is index cards. Most audience members cringe at the sight

of index cards, especially when the presenter is flipping them and shuffling them.

Basic Rules of Presenting With PowerPoint

So, storytellers, let's look at some basic rules and guidelines for presentations.

Example Case 1: Report, Inform, Explain, Announce

This type of PowerPoint has lots of facts that you need your audience to understand. Facts can be dry. So here are some
tips to help with this type of presentation.

 1. Determine ways to add visuals. Don't use clip art or cheesy stock imagery. Choose pictures that directly illustrate
      or match the tone of the slide. Use pictures of your organization if you can.

2. Start with a story or an activity that makes your point. Even if you are delivering several slides of facts, use a story
      to give the audience a way to understand the underlying meaning.

3. Connect story to summary. If you can't summarize your presentation topic in 10-15 words, then your audience will
      not "get" what you are trying to convey.

4. Avoid too much text. If you need to show financials and they don't fit well on a slide there are a couple of options:
      (a) Use a handout on the key concept or fact that you want the audience to understand, or (b) learn to use the
      Zoom function in PowerPoint to zoom into a magnified section.

5. Follow the 10-20-30 rule: 10 slides for 20 minutes with a font size of at least 30. Stay on time.
6. If you want to show charts to represent data, make sure it is the right type of chart and easily understandable. If

      you want to show a dashboard, switch to that app instead of trying to use a dashboard app in PowerPoint.
 7. Look for customized templates instead of starting with a blank PowerPoint, but don't overuse animations. Use ani-

      mations if they further your story. For example, the app Flourish is great to analyze key components that have
      changed over time.
8. Review the slides and use the slide sorter to see if it fits the overall story. Remember, most audiences want a sim-

216 | Interactive Dashboards
      ple structure: frame the issue, present the challenge, and explain how to solve the problem.

Example Case 2: Collaborative Presentation

Collaborating can happen in either a virtual meeting or a physical meeting, and sometimes it involves both. There are
some simple guidelines and etiquette. When you are a single presenter, it is possible to start with the story and only
introduce yourself after connecting to the audience with your story--but teams are different. Introduce everyone on the
stage.

 1. Introduction: Consider a team leader introducing or facilitating the team, giving them a section of the story. It can
      even be the 5 Ws. For example, "Let me introduce Jim Smith. Jim will share the first of the 5 Ws." Jim might hold up
      a small sign with the word WHO. When Jim shares his section, he can prop up the sign--and everything he pre-
      sents should fall under the WHO. Using something like the 5 Ws does not mean you have to go in a certain order.
      You could start with WHY. The crucial point is that you speak with one voice and have a unified message. Consis-
      tent language, tone, and style are key.

2. Handoff: Consider how you will hand off the PowerPoint to the next presenter. Use a phrase like "The next presen-
      ter, Jim Smith, will share the WHO--in this case, who we consider our competitors. Jim?" And Jim may say some-
      thing like, "Thank you, Sharon" and proceed with his section. It is also possible to have some mixed interaction
      where two people are prompting each other, but this takes lots of practice. The point is that the transitions should
      be seamless.

3. Audience engagement: One of the advantages of a team is that you can use them to field questions and leverage
      team dynamics to facilitate discussions or breakout sessions. Every team member should maintain eye contact or,
      if not presenting, listen to the presenter. As a team, scope out the room and make sure you know the audience.
      The audience will give you cues; don't ignore them.

4. Schedule: When a team presents collaboratively, it is a nightmare if one of the members doesn't keep to the sched-
      ule. So keep to a schedule, and have one person who is comfortable interrupting the presentation to keep it mov-
      ing. Assume you will have technical issues, and have a backup plan.

5. Good ending: You need a strong conclusion that summarizes key points. End the presentation with a memorable
      and compelling closing quote, statement, or fact. Don't read your slides, but if you need notes, use the Notes fea-
      ture in PowerPoint so you see the notes, but the audience sees the main slide content.

6. Annoying habits: Try to avoid annoying habits like clearing your throat, saying OK and using Ums. Body language
      should be natural. Project your voice so it is heard at the back of the room. If you are required to use a micro-
      phone, hold it a few centimeters away from your mouth and speak across the top of the microphone and not
      directly into it.

 7. Q&A: Always leave time for a Q&A. This is harder when you have made a collaborative presentation because you
      may not be sure if you should answer a question if you didn't cover that section in the slide. You may want to con-
      sider the kind of questions you anticipate during your practice session and determine who will answer the ques-
      tions.

8. Gather feedback, debrief/reflect: You should solicit feedback through a short survey. In addition, hold a postpre-
      sentation debriefing session to determine areas for improvement. Reflect on both individual and team perfor-
      mance.

                                                                                                                                                    Interactive Dashboards | 217
Example Case 3: Persuade, Inspire, Sell

This type of PowerPoint needs to raise the energy in the room. And the most inspirational presentations are needed
when you have a disengaged audience, one that you need to sway, or one whose support you need to gain for a tough
decision. This type of presentation requires exceptional storytellers, empathy, and a deep understanding of your audi-
ence's motivation. And it is certainly not easy to do unless you practice a lot. Here are some tips to help with this kind of
presentation.

 1. Know the arguments: Spend some time researching. Know both sides of an argument and consider the audience's
      perspective. The main goal is to convince the audience that you know what you are talking about and that you can
      be trusted to tell the truth. Acknowledge potential objections or skepticism, and address them proactively. Great
      speakers tap into one or more of three approaches: ethos (ethical appeal), logos (logical appeal), or pathos (emo-
      tional appeal).Conduct thorough audience research. Know the audience's demographics, interests, and pain points.
      An example of a pain point: If you are speaking to a group of employees about a merger between two hospitals,
      acknowledge the challenges they've faced and how the change will impact them.

2. Start with an attention-grabbing opening: Begin the presentation with a powerful and dynamic opening. It could
      be an anecdote, a surprising statistic or fact, or a compelling question. Another way to interact with an audience is
      simple--ask your audience a great question at the beginning. An example here might be, "Did you know that by the
      end of the presentation, you'll discover how a change in perspective can lead to unprecedented success in your
      career?"One of the best attention-grabbing openings I've seen was done by Steve Jobs. Steve only had a few slides,
      but I still recall the text running across the screen behind him, how it changed to a bouncing ball, and how it
      looked like he caught it. Perhaps, you didn't realize this, but his average text size on slides was 190-point text, and
      he practiced for weeks (Gallo, 2019). It seemed as if the slide was alive and interacting with him!

3. Tell a compelling story: Craft a narrative that draws and resonates on a deeper level.--Connect with them emo-
      tionally. Use visuals that support your message. If the message is complex, provide timeline or milestone visuals.
      The story is the cue to set the hook. Instead of presenting data about declining sales, tell the story of a struggling
      entrepreneur who turned their business around using the strategies you are about to share.Out of all the tips
      listed here, this may be the most important. Tell a story that gives the audience an "aha" moment. Stories can add
      spice and provide your audience a chance to relate to a point you are trying to make. In a TED Talk by Elizabeth
      Lyle, she starts by talking about her bad habit of leaving a sink full of dirty dishes. At face value, you might not
      expect it to tie into her talk, How to Break Bad Management Habits Before They Reach the Next Generation of Lead­
      ers, but you would be surprised at how she used the story of a bad habit to stress her point.Share an inspiring
      example and use persuasive language such as rhetorical questions, powerful metaphors, and compelling language.

4. Get the audience involved: There are tons of apps that work with the user's phone. To get the audience involved,
      consider polling apps, word cloud apps, and Q&A. Polling apps like Poll for All, Poll Everywhere, Mentimeter, Slido,
      and others allow the presenter to add interactive polling. The audience can respond to the poll using their phone
      by visiting the voting page. The voting page (tied to your PowerPoint) collects the votes and shows the results. This
      is not difficult, but most presenters avoid it unless they have a budget to cover the cost (the basic free package is
      generous and should be researched). If done correctly it can engage a large audience!

5. Credibility: Credibility is on two levels: credibility of the presenter and credibility of the data. Without it, the audi-
      ence doesn't connect, because they don't have trust in the narrative. It is important to choose the chart type that
      tells the story in a context the audience understands. Don't present charts they can't see, remove clutter, and keep
      your branding colors. Remember, your color choice and labels should be sensitive. Cite your sources. As a presen-
      ter, establish your expertise. Your experience, relevant qualifications, and achievements are foundational to credi-
      bility.

6. Maintain engaging delivery: Use varied vocal tones, gestures, props, and movement to keep the audience's atten-
      tion. Physically move around the stage (another Steve Jobs characteristic). Use props. If presenting a new product,

218 | Interactive Dashboards
      give a hands-on demonstration. Use "trigger words" as landmarks in your demonstration to stay on track.
 7. Create a vision and a call to action: Paint a vivid picture of the future. Help the audience see the value of their

      contribution. Conclude with a clear and actionable message to encourage your audience to take the next step.
      Inspiring an audience requires authenticity, passion, and a genuine desire to connect with your listeners.
8. Practice, practice, practice: Practice until you are comfortable in your own skin! A presenter should practice one
      hour for every minute of a presentation. A 15-minute presentation should be practiced for at least 15 hours. Record
      yourself and watch your presentation. According to Janice Tomich (2023), a presentation coach, "Issac Lidsky prac-
      ticed his speech . . . over 1000 times. That's roughly 191 hours of practice for this 11.5-minute speech" (para. 3).

Example Case 4: Entertain, Divert, Relax, Set a Mood

This type of PowerPoint will not require presenters. For example, this could be a self-running slide show of audience
pictures, cartoons, quotes, news, conference pictures, and even speed painting to music. Another interesting aspect of
a virtual meeting can be the use of a sketch artist who draws and takes notes during a presentation. The example shown
in Exhibit 4.5 is from a Global Leadership Institute conference in 2023, and the speakers discussed standards for global
leadership.

4.3 How Storytelling Connects to the Brain

       The act of sharing a story is powerful. So much so that it synchronizes the brain activity of the teller and listener.
          --Calli McMurray, Why the Brain Loves Stories

Visually, our eyes can see trends, gaps, outliers, alignment, and/or position. In 1985, Cleveland & McGill ranked the visual
attributes by measuring which visualizations are seen best. It is easier to show you. (Yes, visualize it!) As you can see
in Figure 4.16, ranked first is position along a common scale; ranked second is position along nonaligned scales; ranked
third is length; ranked fourth are angle and slope; ranked fifth is area; ranked sixth are volume, density, and color satu-
ration; and ranked seventh is color hue. Perhaps you are surprised by the ranking. But there's more . . . !

Nonverbal Cues

Stories impact people differently, and nonverbal cues can influence your audience. In most "two-person conversations,
nonverbal messages convey more than 65% of meaning" (National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity, 2020, p. 2). That's
no surprise when you realize our faces have 43 different muscles that can be activated around the eyes, nose, mouth,
jaw, chin, and brow (Anwar, 2020, para 16).

   Even more interesting is the 7-38-55 rule by Mehrabian, Wiener, & Ferris (1967), who shared this formula with some
caution. The rule states that 7% of meaning is communicated through spoken word, 38% through tone of voice, and 55%
through body language. The authors urge caution because the formula does not apply to every situation. For example,
because someone crosses their arms over their chest doesn't always mean they are closed off to your presentation; it
may just mean they are cold!

   Just remember, nonverbal cues can contradict or negate verbal messages. An interaction where words say one thing
and nonverbal cues say another is called a double message, and everyone finds this confusing.

The main components of a story are the beginning, middle, and end. A strategy for storytelling practice is to use
222 | Interactive Dashboards
PechaKucha. PechaKucha is a Japanese management style where you have 20 slides timed at 20 seconds each. The
slides automatically advance, giving you less than seven minutes to tell your story, and most slides should complement
the speaker when vocalized. The PechaKucha website offers a free online and offline global storytelling platform in over
140 countries. We searched big data and data visualization and found 100s of presentations from all over the country
(many in other languages). You can set up a presentation on the PechaKucha website, in Google Slides, or in PowerPoint.
When you sign up for PechaKucha, you choose areas of interest, but don't be surprised if you get pulled into something
different. We watched the "Presentation of the Day," and it was on Frank Lloyd Wright, which had nothing to do with
data visuals.

As we embark on a journey through the realms of psychology, neurobiology, and cognitive science we discover the pro-
found ways in which stories captivate, influence, and shape our minds. The key question is "What is it about storytelling
that strikes a chord enabling narratives to connect with our brains in a manner that few other forms of communication
can?"

Our Brain When Listening to a Good Story

If we add context to the mix, our stories affect the brain, and this is a good thing! In general, good storytelling can do
the following (as seen in Figure 4.18 and listed here).

  · dopamine: enhances memory
  · mirroring: experience similar brain experience as the speaker (we synchronize!)
  · neural coupling: listener turns the story into their own ideas
  · cortex activity: Lights up more of the brain
  · narrative transport: engage emotionally--and if you engage emotionally, you increase trust, empathy, and generos-

In this chapter, you are learning some amazing things. It's easy to get all wrapped up in the technology. Just remember,
if you start with technology, you can lose the connection to the audience. Start with the purpose and check off the why,
who, and what your audience needs to understand. What actions do you want to support? What is the most important
takeaway message? How will it be consumed? The more specifically we drill down for our purpose, the better.

   Then make sure you accompany the visualization with context. In this case, "context" means making the topic easier
to understand by giving extra information about the time, place, situation, history, background, and so on. That's part of
the storytelling process!

4.4 Dashboard Cleaning and Presentation Advice

       Hammers and nails. If you are good with a tool, you may want to use it too often. If you have analyzed a problem
       in depth, you can end up exaggerating the importance of that problem or your solution. Remember that no one
       tool is good for everything. If your favorite idea is a hammer, look for colleagues with screwdrivers, wrenches,
       and tape measures. Be open to ideas from other fields.

          --Hans Rosling

Cleaning data is an essential first step in the journey toward creating a data dashboard. Just as an artist meticulously pre-
pares their canvas before creating a work of art, data cleaning serves as a foundational step before building a dashboard.
Raw data often contain duplicates, inconsistencies, errors, unexpected blanks, and unneeded data (noise). By removing
noise, correcting inaccuracies, standardizing formats, and fixing format issues, we start with a "clean" dataset ready to
provide an accurate and reliable dashboard.

   When cleaning data, it is important to keep in mind that a combination of data may still have importance. Seemingly
inconsequential data that seem unimportant to the story may become important when paired with other information.
Power BI, which is discussed later in the textbook, is very adept at combining data in different ways to tell multiple sto-
ries easily. So let's review all the things that you need to clean up (with examples).

   Step one is always to make a backup copy of the raw data file so you can always revert to the original data file if
needed.

Cleaning Sample #1--Noise (Before)

The United Nations Human Development Report provides an Excel file with twin indices on women's empowerment and

226 | Interactive Dashboards
gender equality. However, there is "cleaning" work to do if we want to use this file in any way. Remember, our data needs
to be turned into a table before we can start analyzing it. However, we have lots of extra rows of reference materials that
would need to be deleted. Follow the notations 1-5 in Figure 4.19 to clean up the "noise."

   For notation 1 and notation 2, note rows that need to be removed. The notation for Row 3 indicates a suggestion to
revise the heading. For example, you can only have one row of headings. Then in Row 5, we would need to rename the
header row. For example, C5 is "2022," but it should really be "Women's Empowerment Index--2022." Notations 4 and 5
show that columns have missing data, so be aware that some countries had incomplete data. As an analyzer, you would
want to remove the row with the text pointing this out as well as the countries with incomplete data. Also, please note
that there are empty columns like A, D, H, J, and L that need to be removed.

   Figure 4.19--Noise (Before)

   Look at Figure 4.20 to see the same data after some cleaning was done: columns removed, blank data (countries with-
out data) removed, extra rows removed, and header rows renamed.

https://www.datawrapper.de/_/C1aHL/. If you recall, Datawrapper is one of the top 10 visualization tools shared in the
previous chapter.

Cleaning Sample #2--Unneeded Data

Lots of accounting software will provide some default information that may not add any value to the dataset. You will
recognize this as an issue because you see duplicate information. In Figure 4.21, the dataset shows every customer with

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 227
the same front register, zip code, and country. Create a copy of the sheet in its original format and a copy of the data to
clean. In this case, you can delete columns H, I, and J.

   Figure 4.21--Remove Columns That Add No Value

Cleaning Sample #3--Inconsistencies and Proper Naming Conventions

Inconsistencies happen when someone uses an override on the system. For example, they might type "Beverage" when
they meant "Beverages." Remember, the dashboard will see these as two different things, so you would need to stan-
dardize these values. Use the Filter option in the data that you have formatted as a table.

Cleaning Sample #4--Correct Data Types

Sometimes the data type is corrupted or incorrect. For example, a date for an order needs to be formatted as a number.
Another example is when three decimal places are shown for sales (and currency is only acceptable at two decimal
places). You will recognize it when it happens.

Cleaning Sample #5--Blanks Seen on Charts

If you notice a "blank" category showing up on your charts, that means you need to go back to the data and review that
column using a filter. Using the filter for the Payment type shows blanks. It is possible that a salesperson didn't post it in
the accounting system, but this would be something to investigate. Figure 4.22 shows blanks.

Dashboard Presentation Rules

Most of us will become so familiar with our well-designed dashboard that we assume everyone is following and under-
standing the presentation. In reality, our audience will be quite overwhelmed if we bring up our dashboard at the begin-
ning of the presentation. Start with a simple presentation--presenting to your team with the goal of finding insights and
helping develop a story.

Presenting and Interacting in a Virtual Team

Remote Team Scenario: Prior to COVID-19, you met your team in a great space that felt like your own. It had a coffee
center, and the administrative staff always brought in fresh snacks and arranged lunch. During COVID-19, many employ-
ees worked from home--a pattern that continues, although not all employees are working from home full time. In many
cases, team meetings are still held remotely. Those on site tend to go to the conference room for the meetings. So there
is a mix of those on site and those attending remotely. Assume you need to meet with your team to review the dash-
board, do further analysis, and look for insights. How does today's meeting compare with past face-to-face meetings?

   The impact of COVID-19 created some challenges related to gender and cultural differences. According to Mansplain­
ing and Interruptions: Online Meetings Exacerbate Gender Inequalities in the Workplace, women are "experiencing a
unique side effect of coronavirus; their voices being drowned out" (Priore, 2020, para. 1). Mansplaining "describes a man
oversimplifying common concepts to women in a degrading or condescending tone . . . as much as six times a week at
work . . .' and `Zoom conferencing' . . . make mansplaining and male conversation domination worse!" (Priore, 2020, para
6). As a team leader, you may not have noticed that men talk more or louder, but you may have noticed that those who
are physically in the conference room tend to talk over teammates who are attending remotely, and they tend to have
side conversations with those in the conference room.

   Assume you are responsible for your virtual team's performance and how they will discuss the insights you want to
present to a larger audience; you may want to try some strategies for a more productive and successful virtual team
meeting. Besides the gender differences, there are cultural differences to consider. As organizations expand globally,
what are the shared practices, beliefs, and expectations that will support successful business practices worldwide?

   Remote meetings offer a positive aspect. Most organizations expect teams to be formed based on strength and not by
geographical location. In fact, across 90 countries, "89 percent of white-collar workers `at least occasionally' complete
projects in global virtual teams (GVTs)" (Taras et al., 2021). In a study conducted by Taras et al., virtual teams had the
best success when team managers considered personal diversity and contextual diversity. Personal diversity includes
personal characteristics--age, gender, language, skills, and values. Contextual diversity refers to the team member's
environment of economic development, types of institutions, and political systems. The study showed that personal
diversity can negatively affect a team, and yet contextual diversity can positively affect a task and especially aid creativ-
ity and problem-solving at an unconventional level (2021).

   According to Melissa Lamson (2018), there are three tactics for managing virtual teams. Let's look at those three tactics
in light of the Taras et al. study.

   Tactic 1: Create the right context for your team. Context helps teammates see commonality. Make sure they under-
stand the who, what, and why (Lamson, 2018). Does the project require creative and unconventional thinking? If so, form

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 229
your team with contextual diversity in mind. If the project is more routine and you need efficiency, then form your team
around personal diversity.

· Strategy to create the right context: Sending the meeting link to the dashboard before the meeting is helpful,
   especially if you provide some guidance by assigning an element for exploration. Setting clear goals and expecta-
   tions is beneficial. To analyze and provide insights, this team should be formed with contextual diversity in mind.

· Strategy to add clarity to context: Most teams who moved to a virtual meeting space asked for clarity, for a plan,
   to be listened to, and for the freedom to innovate. A good strategy for clarity is to assign action items and follow
   up after the meeting. For example, use a simple summary tool like "muddiest point." The muddiest point allows
   each person to indicate what point is unclear. It may only take 3-5 minutes but can be quite insightful. Everyone
   should be asked to participate. You won't have all the verbal cues of a face-to-face meeting, but if you sense some-
   thing is off with one of the team members, take the extra time to reach out and listen.

Tactic 2: Build a sense of community within your group. "Statistics show that meeting face-to-face during a project will
increase productivity by 50 percent" (Lamson, 2018, para. 11). So cameras on! Introduce new members. Consider activi-
ties that provide some interaction (like posting insights or phrases to create a word cloud). Follow up after each meeting
with a brief status update.

· Strategy to build community: Leverage technology to create interactivity and build a sense of community. If your
   team used a whiteboard to generate ideas, use the whiteboard available in the virtual meeting software. Virtual
   whiteboards are not just white squares; most of the virtual meetings have a variety of templates as illustrated in
   Exhibits 4.6-4.7.

Microsoft Teams has over 60 templates. You can add "Whiteboard" as a tab for easy access.
   Explore additional add-ins for your virtual meeting: Grain, Slack, Miro, and others. Grain creates a full transcript of

AI-generated notes in a shared workspace. Slack sets up a place to consistently communicate with the rest of the team.
Although most virtual meeting apps have a whiteboard, Miro has very modern templates that make the experience more
interesting. Warmly is a personalized virtual business card to provide friendly context.

   Tactic 3: Coshare leadership. This is one of the best strategies to involve team members because it invites buy-in.
When placed in a leadership role, your team member feels more responsible for outcomes and ownership of a successful
project.

  · Strategy for sharing leadership: There are various ways to share leadership including, collaborating on a meeting
      agenda, distributing roles to a member to conduct team rituals or social connection, or asking for a verbal round-
      robin on decision-making.

Virtual Meeting Space--What's It Like in the Future?

Just as "Google it" has become a verb, one has to wonder what effect the introduction of AI will have on virtual meeting
spaces. Zoom and Microsoft Teams already have AI that can assist with meeting notes. But even more astonishing is the
real-time translation service for up to 40 spoken languages.

   Virtual meetings have been around longer than you might think. In 2005, I had an avatar that I used in my virtual
meeting with three other colleagues. Our purpose was to write a conference paper, but the technology was new and
quirky, and I never grew tired of telling my colleagues to quit walking into the wall. See Exhibit 4.8 and consider that this
technology is over 20 years old!

This type of meeting room didn't appeal to corporate America in 2005, but avatars became a common word, and there
always seems to be some company trying to improve avatars so they look more like their human counterparts!

   Why show 3D rooms? New technology (or reuse of old technology) will emerge from the growth of telecommuting.
Educators talk about the flipped classroom. Karan Mehandru (2019), a frequent contributor for Forbes, predicted a
flipped workplace model where "physical in-person meetings take place only rarely and as needed" (para. 8). Who knew
this prediction would come about so quickly--by 2025, 70% of the workforce would work remotely five or more days
per month!

How to Design a Winning Presentation to a Large Audience

Presentation content, style, theme, media, and animations should depend on the type of audience. For example, a pre-
sentation to a group of young children will have a vastly different mix of components. For a conference, we will work
toward designing the best presentation using the following parameters:

 1. audience--adult professionals
2. collaborative (team) presentation
3. length of time--20 to 30 minutes
4. need to persuade the audience (may include a call to action)
5. structured with three goals: frame the issue with a story, present the challenge, and explain how to solve the

      problem
Knowing your audience is critical for giving an effective presentation. If you don't know your audience, here are some
strategies: review past events, research the group you're presenting to, engage in prepresentation conversation, ask
event organizers, browse LinkedIn, review social media, and even conduct interactive polling.

   Collaborative (team) presentations need to send a clear and consistent message. Every member of the team should be
on the same page with the same message and contribute their strength to the storytelling. Although this is an assump-
tion, every member should use consistent fonts, color palettes, and branding, even in the way they dress. Storytelling
232 | Interactive Dashboards
should include real-world examples that connect through data visualizations. Collaborative presenters can work well
with interactivity if they each know their role. As a team, make sure to use consistent terminology with appropriate data
sources/references. It is essential that the team has practiced and rehearsed and can present within the time frame.
And always have a backup plan. Make sure to gather feedback from the audience and provide handouts to support the
data insights.

   Length of time should be determined by the need to convey information clearly. It's important to provide context and
key insights. Keep in mind--don't overwhelm the audience with unnecessary details. If your normal presentation is 20
minutes, use the extra time for questions and answers.

   Persuading the audience and including a call to action comes after knowing your audience. In order to persuade and
have them answer your call to action, your team needs to know the audience's needs, desires, concerns, and motivations.
Your message needs to align with their interests. Every detail counts. Choose words that evoke emotions. Create a sense
of urgency, and appeal to emotions. And stay credible by providing evidence to back up your claim. Three primary goals
serve as cornerstones for effective communication. Begin with a story to capture the audience's attention and humanize
the data, making them relatable and engaging. The story should set the stage and offer context and emotional resonance
that draws the audience into the narrative. Following this, the presentation of the challenge is essential--it's the moment
when data are introduced to highlight the problem or an opportunity at hand. The data become the protagonists, shed-
ding light on the issue with clarity and precision. Finally, explain how to solve the problem to bridge the beginning to
the end. The data will emerge as a powerful tool for decision-making and, even better, become the actionable insights
that move the audience toward an informed solution. These three goals woven together inspire meaningful action and
change. The audience should answer the call.

Some Technology to Help With Presentations

   As early as 2016, the Zoom feature was available in PowerPoint. Essentially, Zoom allows flexibility in the order you
present slides and ways to anchor to a summary slide. If you don't see this feature and you present a lot, you might
invest in a newer version of the software. You can determine if you have this Zoom feature by going to Insert in the main
menu, as illustrated in Figure 4.23.

   Figure 4.23--The Zoom Feature in PowerPoint

   Zoom features are a way to organize your PowerPoint. Have you ever been in the audience and asked a question and
the presenter spent several minutes finding the slide you had a question about? Well, this feature will help with that and
a lot more.

   Currently, there are three Zoom options:

 1. Summary Zoom: Summary Zoom populates a new slide with thumbnails. This works well when you have several
      topics with a few slides that relate to a topic. This option will add a thumbnail for the first slide in each section.

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 233
      Perhaps you have not used sections. Sections are found in the Home tab. For both Summary Zoom and Section
      Zoom, you need sections first.
2. Section Zoom: Section Zoom adds links to sections on the current slide. You just click the thumbnail to jump to
      that section. This option will not work if your presentation does not have sections.
3. Slide Zoom: Slide Zoom creates a link to any slide on the current slide. This is a feature that is better understood
      when you see it happen, but the following scenario might help you understand how this works. If you have ever
      used Prezi, you might see some similarities.

When might you use Slide Zoom? Look at a scenario that fits Slide Zoom and see if you can relate!

Slide Zoom Scenario

The product development team at Mitchell & Company has been asked by their director to present the estimated rev-
enue stream for a new software product. The product works in conjunction with smartphones and requires 5G net-
works. They are working with several countries in Europe and have hired engineers from Greece to test the pilot launch,
which was highly successful. The first preorder sales came from Greece and Germany. The team has previous experi-
ence with this director, and they know she will ask additional questions beyond the revenue stream predictions, so they
always prepare every aspect they can.

   The team has produced five components to present if needed. Each of these components shows up on an image of a
desk. Think of the desk as a landing page for all the information. From the landing page, clicking on an image will zoom
to a new slide, and clicking again takes you back to the landing page. The following key corresponds to images within
the landing page, which can be explored visually in Figure 4.24.

 1. Estimated financial section (which includes the revenue stream predictions). This is the only section requested by
      the director; but you know other questions will arise if past meetings are any indication. Once you click the finan-
      cials, it includes charts of pro-forma revenue, animated pilot testing charts.

2. PESTLE for Greece with key financial points (this is on the clipboard image).
3. SWOT to show strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
4. Example social media marketing materials using the SMART model.
5. Porter's Five Forces analysis.
6. A complete business plan (the leather case).

The team created one slide with images that resemble what you might see on a desk. Consider this the "landing page"
for navigation. As the team assembled the information for the PowerPoint, they considered what they wanted to link
from this navigation page. (Figure 4.24 is an edit section; the directions show navigation when presenting.)

   Figure 4.24--Using Zoom in PowerPoint to Communicate More Effectively

234 | Interactive Dashboards
   So if the director wanted to only look at the revenue stream predictions, that would be fine. But if the director asked
to see their business plan, PESTLE, SWOT, or Porter's Five Forces analysis, it would be easy to navigate from the main
page. The director sees a zoomed-in section by clicking on the financial image, and a second click takes the team back
to the landing page.

   The arrow shown from the edit mode of Zoom is setting up the Zoom effect. Therefore, if the presenter clicks on the
SWOT on the landing page, the presentation will zoom to the actual SWOT slide that shows full size to the director. As
shown in Figure 4.25, check the box return to Zoom, and the presenter will be taken back to the landing page (the desk).

   Figure 4.25--Showing How to Return to the Zoom Landing Page

   I think the more you work with sections and zooming, the more you will like it.

2. information
3. interpretation and inference
4. concepts
5. assumptions
6. implications and consequences
 7. point of view
8. purpose

XCaliber Food Distribution was established late in 2023, although the business started in 2024. The company distributes
                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 237
food items to 12 states. It has nine salespeople, though Naomi Shopker was an intern and only worked in June and July.
In 2024, the company sold $510,326 worth of products.

   XCaliber Food Distribution Company is located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The location is inconsequential since no prod-
uct is housed at their location. XCaliber Foods fills a niche of distributing excess products to small grocery stores. All
salespeople work from home and use a tech-powered distribution system. The manufacturing companies, farmers, and
others post products as available, and XCaliber Foods salespeople arrange drop-shipping to their customers. One of the
salespeople calls it a matchmaking game, and most agree. Salespeople work on commission, and the system logs the
number of employee hours as well as sales in the system. Although the sales were good for the first year, the owner
wants you to work up a dashboard and provide insights for every business aspect (people, categories of product, cus-
tomer concentration, and payment). The owner of XCaliber asked for help from Matt, an employee who built the com-
pany's website and helped customize the tech-powered distribution system. The owner sent Matt an email with a list of
concerns and wants Matt to provide some insight. The email list is provided in the "What Do You Think?" section at the
beginning of this chapter. It's repeated here for your convenience.

   Matt reviewed the email and made notes. Here is the list:

 1. I want to know how well my salespeople are doing. Which salespeople are selling the most; in what city, state, and
      region; and what are they selling? Are there two or three salespeople who could conduct the training (with pay)?

 2. Are there products that should be dropped?
 3. I want to know if using the summer intern in June and July was worth the cost (about $4,000).
 4. Is every salesperson collecting from their customer by check, cash, or credit?
 5. What is the range of invoices by customer, and who are our best customers? Are there opportunities for upselling?
 6. Are we shipping out within the same day on a consistent basis?
 7. Do we have regional overlap? Are two salespeople selling to the same customer?
 8. I want to increase revenue to $60,000/month in 2025. Can you do some sort of analysis to see the best way to

      reach this goal--perhaps using a gap analysis or something like that?
 9. I want to be able to ask a question and get the answer instantaneously. I think I heard it is called a dashboard. Can

      you set up a dashboard that allows me to analyze the data right along with you?
10. What do you think a survey of our customers will tell us?

In addition, the owner conducted a survey of the grocers (all 15 customers) to see if they are happy with XCaliber Food
Distribution's services. More about the survey results will be shared later.

                         Dataset: "Ch 4--Original Dataset--XCaliber Foods with delivery time."
                         Format: Formatted as a table. The table is named XCaliber_Foods and ranges from A1: W400. Use this
                      file to complete all steps.
                         Dataset: "Ch 4--XCaliber Customer Satisfaction Survey Form" (this file has been updated to include
                      green, red, and yellow icons).

Step 1: Make a Backup of the Raw Data

  · This should always be your first step when working with any dataset.

Step 2: Get to Know the Data

  · How many customers?

238 | Interactive Dashboards
· How many salespeople?
· To how many cities does XCaliber distribute food? How many states?
· How many payment types and what are they? What do you think of a blank payment type?
· How many products?
· Filter on the product called Blank. What product do you think it should be? And what do you base this on?
· What range do you see in the unit price?
· What is the range for the quantity?
· What is the range for revenue?
· What is the range for shipping fees?
· How many countries?
· How would you go about checking to see if orders are shipped the same day?

Step 3: Clean the Data

poses. Annotations added by the author.

· Explore: Are there any categories that do not add value?
· Answer: Yes, Column H has USA for all 399 entries.

                                                            Figure 4.27--Exploring
                                                            the Table

  · Explore: Are there blanks in the Product name?
  · Answer: Yes, the files show blanks under the filter of Product name. Sort for blanks on product name. Then add

      "Green Tea" to the product name that has blanks. Check to see if the blanks are gone.
  · Explore: Are there blanks in the payment types?
  · Answer: Yes, however these should not be modified; the owner may want to investigate them to make sure pay-

      ment was made. It is possible the customer did not pay for the delivery!

Step 4: Add a Sales Trend Graph With a Trend Line to the Dashboard

          a. Click within the data field (I clicked on J20).
             b. Click Insert, then PivotChart, then PivotChart & PivotTable (see Figure 4.28).

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 239
                                                                           Figure 4.28--Menu:
                                                                           PivotChart

          c. Choose a New Worksheet and select OK.
             d. In the PivotChart Fields, click Order Date (it should automatically organize the order date by months).
             e. Click Revenue (Revenue should be Sum of Revenue). The three components should look like the following.

          We have work to do before it is acceptable (see Figure 4.29).
                                                                                                                                                          Figure 4.29--Create a
                                                                                                                                                          PivotTable

          f. Right-click in Grand Total in the PivotTable (B16), then choose Value Field Settings, then click Number Format,
          select Custom ($0,"k"), and click OK (see Figure 4.30). Now the PivotTable shows all values with the "k," so January
          shows $47k, February shows $23k, and so on.

g. Next, select the PivotChart, then click Design in the top menu, Change Chart Type, and choose Line, then OK.
   h. Click in the chart, and on the plus, check the Data Labels, uncheck the Gridlines and Legend, and add

a Trendline by checking the box. In the chart title, type "2024 XCaliber Food Distribution Sales." Feel free to
increase the font size. After adding the trendline, you may want to move the amounts that are below the trend-
line. Just click on them and move them and drag.

                                                       the Chart

i. Next, let's get rid of all the field buttons. Click in the chart, and then PivotChartAnalyze. In the Field Buttons
drop-down menu, choose Hide All.

   j. Other items to consider: The default color is blue. When you build a dashboard, you want consistency with
colors, fonts, and format of the charts. Other items include (1) change the trendline so it is more of a dash, (2)
increase the font size of the data labels to 10 points, increase y-axis to 10 points, and (3) increase the x-axis to 10
points and bold. This dashboard will be in blue tones (see Figure 4.32).

   k. Name the tab "Trend Line."

          Now let's consider the next item that we want on the dashboard, salespeople.

Step 5: Add a Clustered Bar Chart for Salesperson, Sorted From Largest to Smallest

          a. Copy the PivotTable to a new worksheet since the dollar amount is already formatted.
             b. Click in the PivotTable and in the PivotChart Fields, put Salesperson in the rows and Sum of Revenue in the

          Values.
                                                                                                Figure 4.33--PivotChart
                                                                                                Field

          c. Click in the PivotTable, click Insert, PivotChart, and choose a clustered bar chart, and OK. The default chart
          needs work, but first click back in the PivotTable, make sure you are on a cell in the Sum of Revenue column,
          right-click, and sort from largest to smallest so the best selling salesperson is on top.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 4.34--Sort From
                                                                                                                                                          Smallest to Largest

          d. The default chart has a legend we do not need. So remove the legend and gridlines, widen the columns, check
242 | Interactive Dashboards
          the box, show data labels at the end, and remove the field buttons. Refer to the directions for Figure 4.29 to help.
          Want to have wider columns? Use the gap adjustment found in the Format Chart area. Rename the tab of the
          worksheet "Salespeople."

                                                                                                       Figure 4.35--Clustered
                                                                                                       Bar Column for Sales by
                                                                                                       Salesperson

Step 6: Add Number of Days for Shipping

One of the goals mentioned by the owner was to ship out the product on the same day it was ordered. There are many
ways you can approach this, but the easiest is to add to the table "XCaliber_Foods."

             a. Open the data file and select an empty cell at the right of the column named "Shipping Fee." This should be
          Column W in Row 1.

             b. Type "Order-to-Ship" (this represents the days it takes between order and shipping to the customer). If you
          cleaned the Excel sheet properly, you should be in Column W. As soon as you enter the column heading, you will
          see the banding that indicates you have added to the table.

             c. In Column W and Row 2, type =J2-B2 and select enter. Essentially you are taking the shipping date minus
          the order date. You will see 3 show up; copy this formula all the way down to Row 400. One thing you will notice:
          XCaliber Foods is not shipping goods on the same day the order is placed!

                                                                                                   Figure 4.36--Adding a
                                                                                                   Column to Calculate
                                                                                                   Shipping Time

          d. You may want to "refresh all"--to do this, go to Data on the ribbon in Excel, and select the Refresh All button.
          This is just good practice!

             e. Create a PivotTable with Average of Order-to-Ship in days (you will notice the average of all salespeople is
          2.8 with a range of 2.3 to 3.9). Feel free to create a clearer header. A good title is "Average Days Order-to-Ship."

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 243
                                                                                                  Figure 4.37--PivotTable:
                                                                                                  Average Days
                                                                                                  Order-to-Ship

          Clearly, the salespeople are not adhering to the goal of same-day shipping. You may want to create another Piv-
          otTable so you can see the depth of the problem. Copy the PivotTable you created in part d down to Row 17 on
          the same sheet. Set up your PivotChart Fields like the ones you see in Figure 4.38.

                                                                                                 Figure 4.38--PivotChart

                                                                                                 Order-to-Ship Detail by
                                                                                                 Salesperson

                                                                                                                  Order-to-Ship by
                                                                                                                  Salesperson

          f. What insights would you want to add to the story? Remember, Naomi was an intern in June and July. Also, these
          are averages. If you go back to the data what is the maximum number of days between the order date and the
          ship date?

             Surprising, right? The data shown here in this exhibit would work well as a combo chart.
             g. Name the tab "Order-to-Ship" We may come back to this information to create a graph for the dashboard.

Step 7: Add a Bar Chart Comparing the Size of Invoices

One of the features of selling is to upsell or persuade a customer to buy something additional. A review of the invoices
will give an indication of the normal invoice amount. When you use the filter on the data, you will notice lots of trans-
actions that show less than $500 in sales. While a customer is already purchasing from you, why not try upselling to
increase the sales?

             a. Click into your data file and insert a PivotTable.
             b. In the PivotChart Fields, drag Revenue to Row and drag Revenue to Values as Count of Revenue.
             c. In the PivotTable, right-click in the row label and select grouping. Start at zero, end at 3000 by 500, then
          select OK as illustrated in Figure 4.39. You can try different groupings to see the main invoice patterns. Remem-
          ber, there are 399 rows of data.

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 245

                                                                      Invoices

          d. Create a bar chart, remove the legend, add a chart title, add a data label, and reduce the gap between columns.
          When you get done it should look similar to Exhibit 4.10. As you review the chart, note that you have 117 invoices
          with sales less than $500.

                                                                                                                                                          Exhibit 4.10--Bar Chart

                                                                                                                                                          Bins

          e. For additional insights, add a slicer (salesperson) to see what salesperson is selling at a higher invoice amount.
          What products are bought in larger quantities?

             f. Name the tab on the worksheet "By Invoice"

Step 8: Add a Bar Chart for Top Five Customers

In 2024, XCaliber Foods sold to 15 customers ranging from a high of $83,492 sold to Neighborhood Grocers to a low of
$1,323 sold to Harvest Foods. Four of the salespeople sell to one customer (Tony Clear sells $83,492 to his only customer,
Neighborhood Grocers).

             a. Create a PivotTable with Customer Name in rows and Sum of Revenue in values.
             b. In the PivotTable, click on the drop-down arrow in the Row Labels.
             c. Look for Value Filters and choose the Top 5. It should look like Figure 4.40.

                                                                                                                                                          by Customer Name

                    d. Next, create the chart, add data labels, remove the legend, get rid of the x-axis information, add a chart
                    title, and lessen the gap between columns. It should look like Exhibit 4.11.

                                                                                                                                                          Exhibit 4.11--Clustered
                                                                                                                                                          Column With Top 5
                                                                                                                                                          Customers

          e. Name the worksheet tab "Top 5 Customers"
   Other potential charts that you should be able to complete if you mastered the Campus Ticket Sale dashboard include
Sales by Region, Revenue by Categories, Revenue by Payment Type, and Top 10 Revenue by Product. It depends on what
you want to share as insight as to what you have on the dashboard. And remember as you build a dashboard, every slicer
must be connected to every PivotChart. Exhibit 4.12 shows one example of this dashboard that is too busy.
   There are several ways you can tell a dashboard is too busy--for example,
  · if your audience would feel overwhelmed,
  · if too many tool tips pop up,
  · if you need to explain why you need a secondary axis, and/or
  · if you include confusing labels.
The owner wanted every insight, but perhaps this owner needs to see the important causes and effects. Or perhaps the
answer is two dashboards. The "too busy" dashboard includes survey data as a word cloud, but will the owner notice
the "Not same day" phrase? The survey does show some interesting trends, but there may be a better way to show it
(perhaps as its own dashboard).
   Exhibit 4.12--Example of Dashboard That Is Too Busy

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 247
Step 9: Review and Revise the Dashboard

  · The first step is to set the purpose for the dashboard(s).
  · Organize the questions by salespeople, product, customer, process (like payment methods), and future goals.

      These are the questions listed in Matt's email from the owner of XCaliber Food Distribution Company:
        salespeople: Questions 1, 3, 7, and 10--Survey
        product: Questions 2
        customer: Questions 5
        process: Questions 4, 6, and 10--Survey
        future: Question 8

                      Use this file to see if you have done the steps correctly. Remember, the Dashboard provided here is too
                      busy. How would you revise it? (See "Ch 4--XCaliber_Foods_2024_Dataset_Solution.")

Step 10: Gap Analysis

Stakeholders want to know the "why" behind not reaching goals or targets. Most companies will want a full report out-
lining what happened. A gap analysis is the best approach to answering all the questions that bubble to the surface when
goals aren't reached.

What Is a Gap Analysis?

A gap analysis measures actual results against expected results and answers the question "Why did we miss our
expected estimate?" There are several reasons a company misses its target, including missing strategies, poor processes,
inconsistent or out-of-date technologies, absent employee skills, poor management/leadership, and faulty risk assess-
ment.

   When the owner was setting up XCaliber Food Distribution Company in 2023, he estimated that the company would

248 | Interactive Dashboards
have $50,000 in sales per month. XCaliber Foods sold $510k in products, almost $90k short of his estimate. Was his
analysis of the market share incorrect? How would you explain this shortfall? A gap analysis can be market driven.

   Here are some approaches to a market gap analysis:

  · Investigate geographic sales. For example, XCaliber sells products in only 12 states but could ultimately sell to any-
      one in the lower 48 states.

  · Investigate product base. For example, the survey indicates that several grocers would purchase beer, but sales-
      people didn't offer it.

  · Investigate customer needs. For example, the customer survey indicates that several grocers want the merchan-
      dise as promised, and not several days after the order date.

  · Investigate customer satisfaction. A question on the XCaliber Foods customer survey asked if they would be willing
      to recommend them to another grocer. Why not capitalize on that?

The owner of XCaliber Foods provided a list of questions that can be organized by salespeople, product, customer,
process (like payment methods), and future goals.

   In general, performing a gap analysis at the business level has these basic steps:

Step 1--Identify the Goals to Be Accomplished and the Areas to Be Analyzed

The owner may want you to figure out why the targets have not been met, and more importantly, a recommendation on
how to meet the target.

Step 2--Analyze the Current State

Include the market gap analysis here because XCaliber Food Distribution Company is new to this market. What causes
contributed to missing the target? Were workers trained well? Did the late delivery of products contribute to poor pro-
duce and loss of sales? Did salespeople sell products consistently?

Step 3--Establish the Goal and Future Goal

The owner had expected $50,000 sales revenue each month in 2024. Now in 2025, he expects $60,000 per month in
revenue.

Step 4--Compare the Current State to the Goal (or Ideal State)

What is the difference? Do you see any patterns? What processes contributed to the gap? XCaliber Foods expected to
hire nine salespeople, but they didn't have nine hired as of January 1, 2024.

Step 5--Describe the Gap and Show the Differences in Percentages

What recommendations do you have to make sure the target is met?

                                                                  Interactive Dashboards | 249
Step 6--Organize the Recommendations and Create a Plan to Bridge the Gaps

Summarize recommendations, strategies, and ideas. A great framework for goal setting is called SMART: S = goal is
specific, M = goal is measurable, A = goal is achievable, R = goal is relevant, and T = goal fits the time (time-bound). For
XCaliber, show support with graphs from your dashboard.

   Other frameworks for gap analysis include Ishikawa (fish diagram), SWOT, PESTLE, McKinsey 7S Framework, Balanced
Scorecard, and the Nadler-Tushman Model. For this textbook, concentrate on using SWOT, PESTLE, and the Balanced
Scorecard framework.

4.6 Example Dashboards and Reports

       In my view, one of the primary functions of a data story is to drive action. Without action, we can't generate value
       with our insights.

          --Brent Dykes, author of Effective Data Storytelling
One way to grow your skills is to review dashboards and reports. Dashboards serve as a vital interface through which
organizations, institutions, health care facilities and even sport franchises make sense of the vast landscape of data.
One thing to remember: There are external (public) dashboards and reports, and there are internal dashboards (behind
a company login). This section of the chapter shows dashboards and reports from nonprofits, corporations, education,
health care and sports. By examining the application of these data visualization tools in various contexts, we gain a
comprehensive understanding of their versatility and impact. As you explore, look for common threads that connect
these fields. In this age of information overload, the ability to transform data into actionable intelligence is a competitive
advantage. Note how these interactive dashboards (and reports) support better decision-making, more efficient opera-
tion, and especially for not-for-profits, greater transparency.

Example of a Report in Education

An example report can be found at many educational institutions under the heading of "Enrollment Summary." For
example, in Exhibit 4.13, Indiana State University provides an enrollment report branded with their sycamore leaf and
using the shades of blue color palette.

Example of an Interactive Dashboard in Education

Many institutional research departments develop a public interactive dashboard experience. For example, Florida State
University provides an interactive report. You can tell it is interactive because of the drop-down arrows shown in the
illustration (which should remind you of slicers!). Similar reports will have a "Read Me" section to support user interac-
tion. Most include a video that introduces you to the dashboard as well. The reports in Exhibit 4.14 were created using
Power BI.

Dashboards in Health Care

It is interesting to see the dozens of companies who wish to support dashboards in health care settings. In Helminski et
al.'s (2022) article "Dashboards in Health Care Settings: Protocol for a Scoping Review," a team of researchers searched
through peer-reviewed literature to discover "the development, implementation, or evaluation of a dashboard that was
successfully used in routine workflow" (para. 3). The researchers discovered that there is a need for the development of
a taxonomy that identifies relevant design elements that each type of dashboard should include. These authors did not
think dashboards were part of the accepted routine workflow and believed they should be.

   The pandemic generated lots of data and some of the datasets ended up in dashboards. Tableau Public has hundreds
of public dashboards ranging from COVID-19 vaccinations to health care data breaches. Health care needs to leverage
the analysis of their data to address challenges like staffing shortages, retention, effectively planning for the future,
and managing patient care. Most of the software available to the health care industry has built-in dashboard capability.

Interactive Dashboards in Nonprofits

Nonprofit dashboards are built around mission and desired outcomes. Nonprofits' focus will often be on funders and
other stakeholders to show transparency in reaching desired goals. Transparency is a key issue raised by charity watch-
dogs. There are lots of organizations that provide help to smaller nonprofits in this area.

Interactive Dashboards in Government

Interactive dashboards in a government setting have revolutionized the way data are managed, analyzed, and commu-
nicated. In state government, interactive dashboards are commonly employed to share data related to public health sta-
tistics, economic indicators, education outcomes and many other areas. The ability to interact with the data enhances
the feeling of transparency and accountability.

   From the Office of the Chief Equity, Inclusion, and Opportunity Officer in Indiana, you can find interactive dashboards
on five broad categories (health, public safety, social services, education, and workforce). For example, in the health cat-
egory, a user can interact with data from COVID-19, infant mortality, births, preterm births, and prenatal care.

Chapter 4 Case: The Power of Dashboards and Gap Analysis

                    XCaliber Foods was established late in 2023, although the business started in 2024. The company distrib-
                    utes food items to 12 states. It has nine salespeople, though Naomi Shopker was an intern and only worked
                    in June and July. In 2024, the company sold $510,326 worth of products.

                       XCaliber Food Distribution company is
                    located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The location
is inconsequential since no product is housed at their loca-
tion. XCaliber Foods fills a niche of distributing excess
products to small grocery stores. All salespeople work from
home and use a tech-powered distribution system. The
manufacturing companies, farmers, and others post prod-
ucts as available, and XCaliber Foods salespeople arrange
drop-shipping to their customers. One of the salespeople
calls it a matchmaking game, and most agree. Salespeople
work on commission and the system logs the number of
employee hours as well as sales in the system.
   Although the sales were considered good for the first Note: Author Illustration (2025)
year, the owner wants you to work up a dashboard and pro-

254 | Interactive Dashboards
vide insights for every business aspect (people, categories of product, customer concentration, and payment). The
owner of XCaliber asked for help from Matt, an employee who built the company's website and helped customize the
tech-powered distribution system. The owner sent Matt an email with a list of concerns and wants Matt to provide some
insight.

   In this culminating project, apply the knowledge and skills acquired in this chapter and Chapter 3. Combine your
understanding of design principles, data analysis, and storytelling techniques to showcase your understanding of lever-
aging data visualizations to effectively convey complex information in a visually compelling way. Review the presentation
guidelines.

Case Objectives

 1. Understand how to clean data by removing irrelevant columns, being aware of blanks, and so on.
2. Build visuals and dashboards to structure storytelling.
3. Able to analyze and interpret data to extract key insights and develop a narrative.
4. Use a dashboard for gap analysis, to support decision-making (specifically, make recommendations using SMART

      to assess goals).
5. Ables to use decision-making and benchmarking tools (see Chapter 3, LO 6).

Case Guidelines

This case may be completed by an individual or a team of students as directed by your instructor.
  · Complete the XCaliber Foods Distribution Company Dashboard(s). Multiple dashboards are suggested.
  · Incorporate a word cloud from survey comments and incorporate the survey into the dashboard.
  · Develop a gap analysis report and a professional presentation (with webcam).
  · Upload Excel files: dashboard(s) and gap analysis report.
  · Record a presentation that incorporates techniques to visualize and tell a story. Your recording could include pre-
      senting the report and showing the dashboard(s). Include the link to the recording.

Goals

These are the goals set by the owner for 2024 and 2025. Are there other goals that should be considered?
  · Goal 1: revenue in 2024--$50,000/month. Revenue in 2025--$60,000/month
  · Goal 2: reach six more cities in 2025; use benchmarking and decision-making tools (see Chapter 3)
  · Goal 3: set a minimum sales "target" for salespeople in 2025

                                                                                                                                                   Interactive Dashboards | 255
Questions From the Owner

The owner expects answers to the questions he sent to Matt, but you may form additional questions that he should have
asked.

 1. I want to know how well my salespeople are doing. Which salespeople are selling the most; in what city, state, and
      region; and what are they selling? Are there two or three salespeople who could conduct the training (with pay)?

 2. Are there products that should be dropped?
 3. I want to know if using the summer intern in June and July was worth the cost (about $4,000).
 4. Is every salesperson collecting from their customer by check, cash, or credit?
 5. What is the range of invoices by customer, and who are our best customers? Are there opportunities for upselling?
 6. Are we shipping out within the same day on a consistent basis?
 7. Do we have regional overlap? Are two salespeople selling to the same customer?
 8. I want to increase revenue to $60,000/month in 2025. Can you do some sort of analysis to see the best way to

      reach this goal--perhaps using a gap analysis or something like that?
 9. I want to be able to ask a question and get the answer instantaneously. I think I heard it is called a dashboard. Can

      you set up a dashboard that allows me to analyze the data right along with you?
10. What do you think a survey of our customers will tell us?

SMART, Benchmarks, and Decision-Making Tools

 1. What specific actions and strategies do you suggest (remember to use the tools you've learned [e.g., SWOT,
      Ishikawa])?

 2. Use benchmarking tools (like PESTLE) to explore and expand into four new areas.

General Guidelines

  · Write a professional report (between 3,500 and 5,000 words) that addresses potential solutions for the gap
      between goals for 2024, and goals for 2025. Use a professional report template from Canva or Venngage.

  · Assume you are presenting to the owner of the company, virtually.
  · Feel free to include research to support strategies. Make sure that you use APA and cite everything.
  · Graphs from your dashboard should be included in the report--because that's the way the owner likes it (he is a

      little old school).
  · Infographics like SWOT, PESTLE, and so on are expected.
  · Accompany the gap report with a recording that demonstrates your findings as if you were presenting it to man-

      agement (the owner); please use your webcam.
  · Feel free to use your dashboard(s), your report, and/or a PowerPoint to help your presentation.
  · If you are completing this as a team assignment, follow the guidelines discussed in Chapter 4 for presenting as a

      team.
  · Recording is limited to 20 minutes.
  · The gap report should include in-text citations, correctly labeled figures, and a reference list of your research.

          What Do You Think?
          Kristen found the perfect position (data visualization software specialist) listed on LinkedIn but was sur-
       prised to see several tests for applicants who passed the first phone round. The tests were both virtual and
       face-to-face. After reading through some comments, she realized that the virtual test was based on Gestalt
       Principles. The face-to-face test included putting together a jigsaw puzzle and one was called the coffee
       cup challenge.
          Kristen called her friend in Zoom and immediately asked, "Diana, I am considering applying for a job
       posted on LinkedIn, but I will be required to take a few tests--one virtually and two on their campus. Do you
       know what the Gestalt principal test might include?"
          Diana quickly performs a search and finds an article (also on LinkedIn), by Vikas Joshi called, Gestalt Prin­
       ciples in Software Testing. Diana responds excitedly, "I found something. I'm texting the link to an article
       about Gestalt Principles. It looks like you need to apply Gestalt Principles to recognize patterns and orga-
       nize visual information."
          Kristen reviews the article, and says to Diana, "It makes sense based on some of the job duties for this
       position. It even makes sense for completing a jigsaw puzzle. I think they want to see if I can recognize pat-
       terns. But I have no idea what the coffee cup challenge is for."
          Diana leans in on their Zoom call, "I know that one, or at least I think I do. I saw it in someone's post. The
       company will offer you a drink like coffee from their conference kitchen and when you are done with the
       interview, they hope you will wash and put away your coffee cup (or glass)!"
          Kristen starts laughing, "Glad you told me this. I might have asked if I could keep the cup as a souvenir!"
          Diana joins Kristen in laughing and holds up her coffee cup. "Well, I'm keeping an eye on my coffee cups
       next time you are at my house! But seriously Kristen, you better get busy and do more research on Gestalt
       Principles!"

          Question to the readers: Do you know any Gestalt Principles?

Introduction

To harness the full potential of data visualization, it is crucial to understand not only the technical aspects of chart selec-
tion and design but also the fundamental cognitive principles that underpin human perception and memory retention.

   This chapter delves deep into the world of data visualization, exploring the Gestalt Principles that underlie our
perceptual processes, reviewing the best charts suited for specific data types, and dissecting the mechanisms of

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 259
attentive and preattentive attribute processing. The pivotal roles of color, text, chunking, and images can enhance
short-term memory retention. But the journey doesn't end there. Strategies that optimize long-term memory encoding
and retrieval will help make your data-driven insights stand the test of time.

   In the pages that follow, you continue your journey on a comprehensive exploration of the interplay between human
cognition and data visualization by unlocking the strategies for effective communication and memory preservation.
Whether you are a data analyst, a designer, or a decision-maker seeking to extract meaningful and insightful knowledge
from a plethora of data, this chapter will equip you with the tools and knowledge to create a visualization that leaves a
lasting imprint on the minds of your audience.

   Chapter 5 addresses the following learning objectives.

     Learning Objectives

        At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
         1. LO 1: Apply Gestalt Principles to convey meaningful information.
        2. LO 2: Discern how the brain remembers information (iconic memory, strategies for short-term and

             long-term memory).
        3. LO 3: Analyze and develop annual reports by leveraging tools like the CASS template, Gestalt Principles,

             and best practices.
        Key Terms: annual reports, attentive processing and preattentive attribute processing, flipbook annual
     reports, iconic memory, living annual reports, snapshot or impact annual reports

5.1 Gestalt Principles

       The storyteller doesn't decide which chart type to use. The data decides.
          --Sejal Vora

Before you continue designing data visualizations, you need to learn about Gestalt Principles. The authors are not
designers of art, but visualizing data will require you to consider some artistic principles of how the brain processes
visual clues. Gestalt is German and stands for a pattern, figure, form, or structure that is unified. You may have heard
marketing or web developers talk about the Gestalt Principles when they were designing logos or social media compo-
nents. You may have experienced them when you've looked at a design or visualization and said, "Something doesn't look
right but I can't tell you exactly why I don't like it." Or maybe you were frustrated because there was a blue line under
some text, but it was not a link like you expected. Understanding Gestalt Principles helps you understand why certain
data visualization techniques work better than others. Understanding pattern perceptions helps you understand how
the brain functions to support memory.

   Puzzle this: What do you see when you look at the image in Exhibit 5.1? Do you see a triangle? Or do you see three
Pac-Men?

   Exhibit 5.1--Triangle or Pac-Men?
                                            Note: Author Illustration
                                            (2025)

This is because our brains take ambiguous visual information and organize it into something that makes sense--"some-
thing familiar, orderly, symmetrical and that we understand" (User Testing, 2020, para. 12).

   Gestalt principles will help you understand how our brains process data visualizations. The principles include prox-
imity, similarity, enclosure, connection, continuation, closure, symmetry, and figure/ground. Look at the principles and
see how we can apply these to data visualization and communication.

Gestalt Principle of Proximity

We can leverage the way people see table design simply by using careful spacing. Notice in the first arrangement of
Exhibit 5.2, your eyes are drawn down the columns and across the rows in the second case. We see column groups and
row groups (Chang, Nesbitt, & Wilkins, 2007). In dashboards, placing the visuals together helps the user group them
together. You just need the white space to do it.

Your dashboard may pull from multiple datasets, so for example, you might group customer demographics, and the
nearer the objects are to each other, the more logically these objects belong in the same group.

   In the realm of data dashboard design, it's crucial to acknowledge that a common region is a more robust organizing
principle than simple proximity. This concept is powerfully exemplified by Venn-Euler diagrams because they intuitively
convey the interrelation or intersection. In a sales dashboard, using Venn diagrams to illustrate customer demographics
overlapping product categories instantly shows which products are popular among specific customer segments. If you
have used a Venn-Euler diagram, you will see that it is a good visualization for displaying associations among datasets.

                                                                                                                                                          More Than Charts! | 261
Gestalt Principle of Similarity

Objects similar in color, shape, size, or orientation are perceived as related or belonging to the same group. Your eye is
drawn vertically in Exhibit 5.3 because you see two groups--circles and squares. Color is the strongest way to suggest
relationships, but even in this black-and-white illustration, you see the groups.

   By leveraging this principle, data visualization can effectively convey relationships or categories. For instance, in a
scatterplot displaying customer data, you can use the similarity principle to group customers who share common char-
acteristics, such as high-value customers marked with circles and low-value customers marked with squares. The visual
grouping aids in identifying clusters and patterns and makes it easier for the audience to understand the significance of
these distinctions. When you think about this principle and the use of color, note that some assumptions already exist in
the business world--red for loss, green for profit, yellow for caution. Remember, this principle can manifest itself using
color or shape, and that brings us to some recent literature on how dissimilarity can be used.

   Exhibit 5.3--Gestalt Principle of Similarity
                                                 Note: Author Illustration
                                                 (2025)

If one circle is shown as dissimilar (as shown in Exhibit 5.4), what does it mean? Is this customer the lowest of all high-
end values? According to Pinna et al. (2022), "Limits and incompleteness of the similarity principle have suggested the
basic, more general and stronger role of dissimilarity in perceptual grouping under a large variety of conditions" (p. 39).
Although these authors used the basis of dissimilarity, make sure to review the Gestalt Principle of figure/ground (which
seems to format the same thing).

                                                               Note: Author Illustration

Gestalt Principle of Enclosure

When we see objects that are physically enclosed together, we see them as belonging to the same group. This principle
shows that objects within boundaries are perceived as a unified whole and can significantly enhance data visualization

262 | More Than Charts!
and data storytelling. Enclosure can be employed through framing within boxes, and within shading (as shown in Exhibit
5.5). This aids in highlighting relationships and patterns so the viewer grasps the message and contributes to a more
intuitive and compelling data storytelling experience. A key component of a dashboard is to be consistent in color rep-
resentation of a category, with the approach that green represents revenue across various graphs that are related (order
count, invoice size, etc.)

   Exhibit 5.5--Example of Gestalt Principle of Enclosure
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                                          (2025)

Imagine you are tasked with visualizing the performance of a company's various product lines over the past year. Think
of the circles as data points. To apply the Gestalt Principle of enclosure, you could create a bar chart with each product
category that is visually enclosed within a distinct rectangular boundary. Separate enclosures visually separate the data
and emphasize the individual performance of each product line. The audience will immediately discern how different
product categories are performing in relation to one another and will simplify the interpretation as well as enhance the
data storytelling impact.

   Exhibit 5.6--Revenue by Categories--XCaliber Foods 2024

   The Gestalt Principle of connection is an asset in the realm of data visualization and data storytelling. Elements con-
nected by lines, parts, or other visual links are perceived as related or forming a coherent whole. Adding lines to data
points is a great way to understand this principle (as illustrated in Exhibit 5.7). Without the lines to help us, we would
not realize that we should see these data points in a trend line.

   Exhibit 5.7--Example of Gestalt Principle of Connection

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 263
   Besides representing revenue data points, this same principle supports flowcharts, network diagrams, and sequential
timelines that visually link data points or events. An example of this would be a project connecting tasks in a Gantt chart
as seen in Exhibit 5.8. This approach helps the audience understand the logical progression of the project and how each
task relates to the overall project timeline. This adds clarity to the data storytelling.

   Exhibit 5.8--Example Gantt Chart
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration

The example Gantt chart shows the use of color representing tasks associated with specific categories, under assigned
teams. It shows connection, and this is nonquantitative data!

Gestalt Principle of Continuation

The Gestalt Principle of continuation shows an intersection between two or more objects where a viewer tends to per-
ceive a continuous flow or connection. We tend to perceive each line as a single uninterrupted line (or object) so in
Exhibit 5.9, our eyes on the left illustration would follow the blue circles and on the right illustration, our eyes will follow
the red circles. Our eyes will instinctively follow the path of least resistance.

                                                                                                                                                          (2024)

Gestalt Principle of Closure

In Microsoft Excel, we can produce a line graph complete with background, data points, and chart borders. But a viewer
only needs an idea that this is a graph, and they will still clearly see the trend. The Gestalt Principle of closure suggests
that when viewers are presented with fragmented elements, they tend to mentally complete the missing parts to per-
ceive a recognizable shape. In Exhibit 5.10, we might need to add the context, but the viewer can clearly see an increase!
You could strip everything away, except the line, and the viewer would understand. Exhibit 11 shows a bear head, but
one of the most famous examples of Gestalt's principle of closure is the World Wildlife Fund Logo (the Panda).

In data visualization, closure can be employed to engage the audience's problem-solving abilities and create a more
memorable impact. For instance, a word cloud that visualizes the most frequently mentioned words in customer feed-
back might use the principle of closure to transform disconnected text fragments into a cohesive representation. Keep
in mind, the viewer's mind naturally connects the fragments to form complete words or concepts, supporting quick
comprehension and making the data's storytelling experience more interactive and engaging. Even more compelling is
when you see an animated gif that uses the Gestalt Principle of closure. Exhibit 5.12 is a simple design with no outline,
but everyone would know what it is.

                 along. This animated gif uses the Gestalt Principle of closure. https://par.nellruby.agnesscott.org/teach-

Gestalt Principle of Symmetry

In this case, the object appears symmetrical and forms around the center. The Gestalt Principle of symmetry plays a
valuable role because it fosters balance and order. You have seen examples of symmetry everywhere. It's in the golden
arches of McDonald's logo. It's interesting that we associate symmetric objects with stability, consistency, and har-
mony while asymmetric objects are associated with negative feelings or impressions (Califf et al., 2012). In data visu-
alization, symmetry can be utilized to emphasize the relationship between two or more components or datasets. For
example, using XCaliber Foods, create a radar chart to compare the performance of different departments in an organi-
zation, using symmetrical axes and lines to draw the viewer's attention to the equanimity of performance across various
aspects. Or create a radar chart to show which categories have the best performance (beverages, sauces, jams, dairy
products, high-end canned meat, candy, baked goods, pasta, high-end soups, condiments, oil, fruit and vegetables, and
grains). As seen in Exhibit 5.13, beverages are a clear winner!

Gestalt Law of Prägnanz

Prägnanz is a German word that means "pithiness." When we combine this concept with the idea of data visualization,
your brain loves simplicity and tends to process simple patterns. As an example, in the previous chapter, we learned how
important it is to sort the graph's information from highest to lowest sales (see Exhibit 5.14).

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 267
   As an aside, Western culture looks for the most important piece of information in the top left corner or centered in
the middle of the dashboard. That is because Western cultures read from left to right and top to bottom. But what is
important to one audience might not be as important to a different audience--so make sure to take that into account.

   Exhibit 5.14--Example of Gestalt Law of Prägnanz

Gestalt Principle of Figure/Ground (and Other Principles)

This illustration (Exhibit 5.15) uses similarity, continuation, closure, proximity, and figure/ground. The orange figure
represents the figure/ground because our eye differentiates this object from the surrounding area. The mind must
decide which elements to focus on. As you can see, color in the design in Exhibit 5.15 was used well.

                                                                                                                                Note: Author Illustration

Another example of how the Gestalt Principle of figure-ground can enhance data visualization is in the context of
heatmaps (Wagemans, 2012). In a heatmap representing website traffic patterns, the data points indicating high user
engagement can be considered the "figures," while the less active ones are the "ground." By utilizing color gradients,
these figures can be made to stand out prominently. Heatmaps were discussed earlier to show a correlation between
CEOs (administrators) and staff on where they align in answering the survey questions. Heatmaps are more powerful if
you can display the information within context. Assume you are a pitcher for your college baseball team, and you want
to improve your throw. Several companies now offer a special system with membership. Once you set up a membership,
you receive a baseball wired internally with Bluetooth, download the app, pair the ball with the app, and start throwing.
As you throw the ball, the app will map out a heat map of your throws.

       "Although pitchLogic can provide many numerical metrics, our users tell us they get a big benefit from visual
       feedback. A graphic like the Heat Map gives a coach or a pitcher an immediate intuitive feel for the data, which
       allows them to take action without spending as much time on analysis" (S. Cukiemik, personal communication,
       June 10, 2025).

Now let's look at two designs to see how well you can identify elements that have the appropriate visual signals (the
information we want to communicate), which are noise (clutter), and which items violate Gestalt Principles. The survey
data in Figure 5.1 is fictional.

This design is NOT horrible--the graph is ordered from largest to smallest. The two key observations are tied visually
(through a line) to what you are meant to observe (the hypothesis). But that's where the good stuff ends.

   Here are the issues:
 1. The title is too large--some of the information could be included in the introduction to the graph.
2. Several things are repeated--the percentage at the end of the bar and in the axis, the choice of three options.
3. Lines go through the percentages or lines don't connect.
4. Grid lines are used and are not needed.
5. The legend isn't informative, it's not needed.
6. No date found--when was this survey completed?
 7. Clutter and key observations overwhelm the graph.
8. The format with borders is somewhat distracting.
These eight items don't even consider the Gestalt Principles!
   How could we revise this visual? Let's look at the revised illustration in Figure 5.2 while taking into consideration the
Gestalt Principles included in the new design.

                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration

Compared to the original visualization, this illustration follows a cleaner design, better alignment, conscious use of white
space, and removal of repetitive or unnecessary items. It uses some of the Gestalt Principles too. Even if you aren't quite
sure about your comfort level with the Gestalt Principles, you should find the second illustration more appealing. In ret-
rospect, the second paragraph could be written, "Administrators thought students would pick quick pace and hybrid/
online program availability as most important." Adding this sentence would clarify that administrators had predicted a
different outcome. Now compare the two images in Figure 5.3 and see if you can name all the changes and the corre-
sponding Gestalt Principles.

   As mentioned in previous chapters, understanding the data types will help you choose a suitable graphical display.
This will be discussed in a later chapter in greater detail, but let's consider the charts we've used.

Show Relationship

If you want to show a relationship between two variables--choose a scatterplot chart or review Exhibit 5.17 where there
is a positive relationship between tannin and perceived astringency. By adding a trendline, we enhance the ability for a
user to see a better sense of relationship.

   This is called the Gestalt Principles of Common Fate. This principle is normally explained using a flock of birds as an
example. If a viewer sees the birds flying in the same direction, we assume they belong to the same group. Exhibit 5.18
shows a positive relationship.

   When elements are commonly seen together (flags and countries, capitals and states), the audience will expect these
to be included in one group. This is referred to as the Gestalt Law of Past Experience. In Exhibit 5.17, a wine connoisseur
or sommelier would expect tannin and astringency to go together; however, to those of us less-refined wine experts,
not so much! Keep this in mind when using this principle.

Exhibit 5.18 shows two variables (events and revenue) in a scatterplot, but it is when you add closure (using Gestalt Prin-
ciples) that you start to make sense of the data. Each type of event clusters together, so the relationship is conveyed
more clearly using the Gestalt Principle of closure. This requires setting up the scatterplot in Microsoft Excel but then
using a graphing program to add the closures. We used scatterplots to show the visuals of Ashcombe's quartet, and sev-
eral other situations. The main point is you may need to do additional refinement to clarify the story.

5.2 The Brain and How It Remembers Information

       We see with our brains, not with our eyes.
          --Norman Doidge, The Brain That Changes Itself

During a thesis presentation, a graduate student provided a complete introduction to memory theory. In her career,
she has trained thousands of trainers. Essentially, her point was "If you understand how memory theory works, you can
leverage this understanding to make training more effective" (Emily Phelps, MLD'18).

   So let's start with the basics of memory. There are three types of memory we need to understand before designing
visualizations.

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 273
Iconic Memory

                                                                  Iconic memory is fast and deeply rooted in survival

                                                                  mechanisms. Think of a near-miss car accident where

                                                                  quick thinking on your part prevented a catastrophe! Your

                                                                  without thought. That's why iconic memory is often tied

                                                                  to preattentive attributes. Preattentive attributes are

                                                                  visual properties that we notice without using conscious

and adapted by the author                                         Four of the preattentive visual properties include: color,

                                                                  form, movement, and spatial positioning.

Let's look at attentive processing versus preattentive processing. Cover up the preattentive processing in Figure 5.5.

Now look at Figure 5.4--How many 5s do you see? Then look at Exhibit 5.5. Notice how quickly your eyes were drawn to

the 5s almost without thought. See how this connects to the Gestalt Principles?

Knaflic says it best: "If we use preattentive attributes strategically, they can help us enable our audience to see what we
want them to see before they even know they're seeing it" (Knaflic, 2015, p. 99).

Demonstration of Preattentive Attributes

Let's assume that you want to show a very small graph for the statistic: Less than 5% of adults exercise 30 minutes a day
(HHS: President's Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition, 2020). BTW, this statistic is sad but true!

   Let's look at some of the examples and how you might use preattentive attributes in Figure 5.6.
   Figure 5.6--Six Visuals With Preattentive Attributes

274 | More Than Charts!
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                                          (2024)

There are several other preattentive attributes but they didn't work for this information. They include (1) line length, (2)
line width, (3) intensity (we could have done this one but felt hue was better), (4) spatial position, and (5) motion. Of the
six shown, it appears "enclosure" is the easiest to see, because it appears to "pop out," but all illustrations show 5 adults
out of 100.

Text Preattentive Attributes

You can also use the concept of preattentive attributes in text. We used them in this book:
  · bold, italics, color, size
  · separate spatially (like extra space around one sentence)
  · underlines
         · outline or enclosure (like textboxes)

Understanding preattentive attributes is very important if we want to create visual hierarchy. If you violate the rules
(like typing an entire text in bold), you could easily lose your audience's attention because nothing stands out.

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 275
Members of the Audience Who Are Color-Blind

One other point should be made: Design with color-blindness in mind. About 8% of males are color-blind versus less
than 0.5% of females (Colour Blind Awareness, 2020). The general rule is to avoid using shades of red and shades of
green. (That's scary when you think about the traffic light metaphor, right?)

   Some strategies to ensure inclusivity in your visualizations include the following:

 1. Use high contrast.
2. Clearly label data points, lines, or sections (like bars).
3. Rely on other strategies--in addition to color, use patterns or textures.
4. Use color-blind friendly colors.
5. Use a tool that will simulate what a color-blind individual will see BEFORE you present. (This is discussed in Chap-

      ter 8, including several resources.)

If you are presenting to an international audience, you may want to review a book written by David McCandless where
he considers the importance of colors in other cultures. For example, western cultures associate white with purity,
cleanliness, and innocence (e.g., at a wedding, where brides commonly wear white dresses). In contrast, eastern cultures
often associate white with death and funerals. Understanding these nuances is important when creating content that
resonates appropriately with a diverse audience.

                 Title: Colours in Culture--at the Information Is Beautiful site. Make sure to review if you are presenting to
              an international audience! By: David McCandless. Link: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/
              colours-in-cultures/

                                 Something to think about: According to Knaflic, "We have about 3-8 seconds with our audience,
                              during which they decide to continue to look at what we've put in front of them or direct their
                              attention to something else" (2015, p. 102).
   At least if we've leveraged preattentive attributes well, we've given a signal of what is most important. In order to make
the leap from theory to practice, we first need to look at other memory types.

Short-Term Memory

This one is important for graph visualizers! People can only keep about four chunks of visual information in their short-
term memory at a time. So in Figure 5.7, we're making our audience go from legend, to component, to comparison of the
different bands of color. In doing so, we are straining our audience by giving them a cognitive burden and we risk them
giving up.

                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                                          (2024)

In this particular situation, the solution was to add two slicers, which limited the information to one salesperson and
one category. That made the graph more manageable--but using slicers is not the answer for large room presentations.
It's more useful for small team meetings where you are investigating by using a multiple number of slicers to "slice and
dice" the data.

   Power BI lets you slice everything. Click on a chart of any kind and it filters data for all other visuals! And the great
thing about Power BI is that most corporations with a subscription to Office 365 already have Power BI. "Power BI is
a cloud-based suite of business analytics tools that lets everyone connect to visualize, and analyze data with greater
speed, efficiency, and understanding" (Microsoft, 2020). Power BI is covered in chapter seven. It is worth discussing it in
this section, especially if you face questions in a meeting that require you to go back to the data to find answers.

   The point here is that we should show limited chunks of visual information. As a presenter, if your presentation only
contains four chunks of visual information, you have to provide "triggers" to connect them. And this works both ways.
Triggers help the presenter remember too.

Train Your Brain--Move From Short-Term to Long-Term Memory

As a presenter, the transformative potential of repetition in converting short-term memories into lasting impressions
is found in the words of Squire et al. (2015), who posit, "Short-term memory can become a long-term memory through
repetition" (para 14). This simple yet powerful concept not only holds relevance for the audience but also serves as a
strategic tool for presenters aiming to enhance memory retention. The triggers work for both you and the audience. As
a presenter, repeat the "trigger phrase" several different ways to increase memory retention (Squire et al., 2015). Write
notes when you practice and work from your outline (even add trigger phrases to your PowerPoint outline).

Example of a Trigger and Repetition

Sunshine, Inc. has experienced some difficulty launching a new line of acrylics due to limited creation idea development
for the users of acrylics. This has undermined a potential healthy profit. Additionally, since the line has limited products,
production line issues in combination with slow delivery issues have plagued the product. The CEO announced in frus-
tration, "The profit of our new acrylic product line hinges on a team approach during its creation, production, and deliv-
ery." What can the CEO do to get his company back on track? Let's explore a potential presentation.

   Example trigger phrase: "Synergizing for Success"

                                                                                                                                                          More Than Charts! | 277
   How can we seamlessly integrate and emphasize this trigger throughout a presentation?

  · Emphasizing for repetition: "Profitability isn't just about the product; it's about how we synergize as a team for
      success."

  · Analogical variation: "Think of it as a winning sports team. Each player contributes uniquely, but it's the synergy,
      the `Synergizing for Success' that leads to victory."

  · Illustration: "Consider our recent product launch. The numbers speak for themselves, highlighting the direct
      impact of Synergizing for Success on our profit margins."

  · Audience engagement: "Pause and reflect on your own experiences. When have you witnessed the power of team-
      work contributing to success? That is the essence of `Synergizing for Success.'"

By weaving the trigger phrase into various aspects of the presentation, the CEO reinforces the importance of teamwork
in product profitability, and engages the audience in a way that enhances comprehension and retention. These repeti-
tions would be paired with specific data visualizations for a cohesive and impactful delivery.

How Long Should You Practice an Important Presentation?

One of the most effective ways to rehearse is by recording yourself. Watch the video to judge your memory and improve
your presentation. And by the way, practicing the night before you present doesn't work. You need time to develop your
tone and body language.

   Although Dr. Jill Bolte-Taylor practiced her TED Talk 200 times, the normal rule of thumb is to practice 10 times. Other
presentation gurus suggest that a 15-minute presentation should be practiced for 15 hours. According to Gallo's (2019)
article, Why You Should Practice Your Presentation 10 Times Before Taking the Stage, you need time to develop your tone
and body language. And that means, you need to have your presentation memorized, so you can concentrate on good
body language. Different venues will require different skills. A virtual presentation is different from a face-to-face pre-
sentation.

   If you are presenting, you should practice recording your presentation using a tool like ScreenPal. This allows you to
record yourself using your webcam and see the slides within the presentation. As long as your presentation is less than
15 minutes, it is free--both to record and to store in the cloud. Although this type of practice allows you to critique your-
self quickly, remember that with ScreenPal, you are sitting before a computer and without a crowd.

                 ScreenPal: Formerly Screencast-o-matic. Link: https://screenpal.com. This app records both your webcam
              and your screen (you can have your PowerPoint on the screen). The free version allows 15 minutes of record-
              ing and a place to store it in the cloud.

Long-Term Memory

Does our audience leave with our main points lodged in long-term memory, or does our presentation get dumped out
of short-term memory to oblivion? According to Vora (2019), "Information processed through visuals and images is
believed to enter the brain's long-term memory . . . thus increasing the brain's power to recall and retain information
that was absorbed through visuals" (p. 150).

278 | More Than Charts!
According to Knaflic (2015), "Long-term memory is the aggregate of visual and verbal memory,

which act differently. Verbal memory is accessed by a neural net, where the path becomes important

for being able to recognize recall. Visual memory, on the other hand, functions with specialized

structures" (p. 97). It's all about the triggers.

For example, one of the authors took a wonderful trip to France and Italy in 2019. If you were pre-

senting and you included a picture of the Eiffel Tower, author Mitchell would be flooded with feel-

ings, and get the concept of how the lighting of the tower at night makes it magical. So as a presenter,

you've combined visual and verbal cues, and this combination will trigger the formation of long-term Note: Author

memories.                                                                                                 Photograph

At this point, you may be struggling and asking--which visual should I use? Vora (2019) states, "The

storyteller doesn't decide which chart type to use . . . the data decides" (p. 152). And this doesn't just apply to charts. It

applies to any type of visual we use. Which visual tells the story the best?

5.3 Infographics Used in Annual Reports

       The stronger your annual report, the more you can increase your visibility with the community who supports
       you.

          --Katy French, Column Five

In the contemporary landscape of corporate communication and stakeholder engagement, the role of annual reports
extends beyond traditional financial disclosure to embrace dynamic visual storytelling. The utilization of infographics
has emerged as a powerful tool for conveying key messages with clarity and impact. This is true for both for-profit and
not-for-profit entities, where the annual report serves as a crucial vehicle for transparent communication, fostering
investor confidence, and demonstrating accountability.

   In this section, we review annual reports, dissecting their effectiveness in enhancing comprehension and engagement
across different organizational sectors. Students will learn to recognize the nuances and unique considerations that
shape the use of infographics within diverse industries.

   For-profit organizations use the annual report to articulate the company's value proposition and market positioning,
and they lay a strategic direction. These organizations integrate infographics to distill complex financial data into visu-
ally digestible formats, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance. In
addition, infographics can be tailored to highlight key performance indicators, market trends, and competitive advan-
tages.

   Conversely, not-for-profit organizations face a unique set of challenges in annual reporting since their objectives cen-
ter on social impact and community engagement rather than profit margins. In this context, infographics can illustrate
the organization's mission, showcase tangible outcomes, and convey the value generated for the community. Visual rep-
resentation of impact metrics, program outcomes, and success stories (video infographics) can effectively communi-
cate the not-for-profit's achievements and foster donor trust. Charity Watchdog (charitywatch.org) goes so far as to tell
charities to rebrand their annual report as "Impact" reports (Styron, 2022).

Annual Report for For-Profit Organizations

All public U.S. companies must file regular financial reports to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports
include the annual report (i.e., the 10-K), quarterly reports (10-Q), and several other reports. The data are filed in the

280 | More Than Charts!
SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, affectionately known as EDGAR. Other countries have
similar processes. In the past few years, stakeholders have wanted more than just the annual report with financial infor-
mation and performance. Specifically, investors want a report that encompasses environmental, social, and governance
reporting. The expanse of stakeholders includes investors, creditors, regulators, government (compliance), customers,
suppliers, and so on. The components of corporate reporting have grown because the technology is available to support
it.

   Let's look at some of the components in a for-profit annual report as filed through a 10-K:

  · Letter from chief executive: Expect to see a letter from the President or Chief Executive Officer (CEO). This letter
      provides insight from upper management on major issues and directions of the company.

  · Investor relations section: Expect to see forward-looking information in the investor relations section. (Some-
      times the environmental, social, and governance impacts [ESG reports] are included in the investor relations sec-
      tion.)

  · Financial information: This section is driven as a requirement for public companies (public companies just means
      that they are listed on the stock exchange). This includes interim financial reports (usually quarterly) but also the
      annual financial statements. Note that with the support of technology, interim reporting takes less time and is
      more up to date.

  · Performance measures: Useful measures like earnings per share but note that an increasing number of companies
      are listing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and other measures that do not meet generally accepted
      accounting principles (GAAP).

  · Management discussion and analysis reports (MD&A): This section includes an extensive narrative of the man-
      agement's analysis of the company's performance. It normally includes a discussion of core businesses, objectives
      and strategies, capability, compliance, performance, risks, and outlook.

  · ESG reports: These reports include a discussion of the environmental footprint, but can also include talent man-
      agement, product safety, data security, and even matters like board diversity, executive pay, and business ethics.

This next fact may surprise you. Reports are voluminous, and reports like the 10-K and 10-Q are not user-friendly. They
lack graphics, pictures, and do not easily tell a story. For example, Amazon.com, Inc's Form 10-K for the fiscal year that
ended on December 31, 2022, is 88 pages long. It includes a table of contents (partial image shown in Exhibit 5.19).

In the 10-K report, the Amazon shareholder letter from Andy Jassy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Amazon is
seven pages long and what is interesting is that the 2020 Annual report includes a shareholder letter reprinted from the
1997 annual report; intentionally telling shareholders what was true in 1997 is still true in 2022.

   As you can imagine, companies have faced regulatory overload and duplication until XBRL (Extensible Business
Reporting Language) was required by the SEC and other major regulators around the world. This is because XBRL can be
read by any recipient regardless of the system they are using. XBRL did not reduce the size of annual reports. So while
XBRL reduced regulatory overload, the increased size of reports has led to information overload.

   If you look at the investor relations (IR) section of the Amazon website, you will find the same 10-K report, but many
more items, including innovation, job creation and investment, our communities, supporting small business, and work-
ing at Amazon.

   Amazon's IR website has more of a barebones approach but look at some examples of top-rated IR websites. One such
example is Zurich Insurance Group. Zurich's 2022 annual report is 392 pages long and full of images. Use Exhibit 5.20

A New Trend in Virtual Conferences for Investors

Besides the use of digital reports, a growing trend is the hosting of a virtual conference for analysts and investors. For
example, BASF (a German company with a portfolio of chemicals, plastics, to oil and gas) has an annual report that is 296
pages long and is full of images, infographics, graphs, and key performance indicators (KPIs) in relation to the UN's Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs). But BASF also held a virtual conference on February 24, 2023, to explain the impact
of rising uncertainties, rising energy prices, and inflation with widespread economic distortions. BASF is the second
largest chemical producer in the world, so it is strongly impacted by world events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
No wonder that BASF wanted to use a virtual conference in addition to a PDF report to explain the impact.

   BASF used a graph during the virtual conference to explain that five of the nine divisions had a loss in 2022. However,
it did not show a common axis--you must notice the negative numbers to realize there was a loss. At least least they
were shown in red!

   Make sure to investigate the different aspects of the virtual conference presentation!

Drilling Down Into the Data

One of the newer trends is the interaction available for users to drill down into data. One such example (shown in Exhibit
5.21) is by Repligen, a company involved in the bioprocessing and production of biologic drugs.

   Exhibit 5.21--Repligen Interactive Analyst Center

   What is interesting is that it includes images, infographics, and charts in front of the standard 10-K structure, so you
might not realize how much Repligen has done in other areas. In addition to the interactive analyst center, there are
other interactive components available to the investor.

The Use of Social Media to Push Annual Report Information

According to Jung et al. (2018) in the article "Do Firms Strategically Disseminate?--Evidence from Corporate Use of Social
Media," the most frequently adopted social media platforms by S&P 1500 companies was Twitter and then Facebook (p.
229). The types of announcements include everything from earnings, executive turnover, to new customers.

   In a separate article, "Corporate Use of Social Media," the authors found "companies are less likely to disseminate
earnings news through Twitter when the earnings miss the consensus forecast and the magnitude of the miss is larger"
(Tonello, 2016, para 13). This same bias might be a potential issue for annual reports in general.

What Are Investor Relations (IR)?

Investor relations is the effective two-way communication to provide relevant and necessary information between the
issuer and the financial markets. The IR team aims to provide information that is sufficient and timely. It is not public
relations, but they do share similar aspects.

   Shareholders do not take an active part in the day-to-day management of the company; however, they want to know
the issues, objectives, strategies, operating environment, and financial information to ensure that their investment is
healthy and growing. A growing number of investors are expressing interest in nonfinancial factors like ESG, diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI), sustainability, and other nonfinancial factors, but may still impact the bottom line.

Nonprofit Annual Reports

Annual reports for nonprofits highlight the mission and vision statement, the community impact, financial statements,
and most importantly, a "thank you" to donors. They can contain more depending on the size and goals of the nonprofit.
Nonprofit annual reports are typically smaller than their for-profit counterparts (average of 15-30 pages, but larger non-
profits can be 200 pages). It really depends on the audience, the stakeholders, and the story you need to tell.

   An overall guide to the number of pages for a full annual report and the broader work include:

 1. letter from executive/leader: 1 page
2. mission and metrics: 2-4 pages
3. program overview: 4 + pages
4. impact story: 2 pages
5. financials: 2 pages
6. testimonial: 1+ pages
 7. leadership: 1-2 pages
8. recognition of donors: 1-6 pages
9. looking forward to: 1 page

286 | More Than Charts!
Keep in mind that the purpose should drive the report--some nonprofits do a full annual report but use a one-page
"snapshot" for social media sharing, while some nonprofits build their annual report on their website.

   Many nonprofit organizations publish their annual reports, which includes financials, at the same time they file their
Form 990, since a Form 990 contains the financial information of the nonprofit. Nonprofits do not have an oversight
regulator like the SEC requiring that specific items be included in an annual report.

   There is no corresponding 10-K for nonprofits, but many nonprofits consider an annual report as part of the trans-
parency requirement for charity watchdog organizations. Nonprofit annual reports are full of infographics, images, and
stories that relate to community impact. Let's look at some of the best practices for nonprofit annual reports.

Best Practices to Communicate to Donors and Stakeholders

There are several fundraising and donor management tools that can be used to discover information about a nonprofit's
donors. The annual report gives an organization an opportunity to understand their own organization better. What
questions do you need answered about your donors, about your programs, and what questions come from your com-
munity? Understanding donors is crucial to the success of a nonprofit organization and foundational to how you should
build your annual report.

   By gathering information about your donors, you can significantly enhance the nonprofit organization's annual report.
With this insight the annual report becomes more than a "report."

The Annual Report From a Donor's Perspective

  · Personalization of messaging--How do your donors prefer to be recognized?
      Incorporate personalized recognition in the annual report based on donors' preferences (i.e., acknowledgment of
      their preferred causes or programs).
        Draft a letter from a board member or leadership to set the tone and introduce the annual report.
        Share strategic goals for the future of the nonprofit.

  · Tailoring content--What do your donors want to see about your programs?
      Highlight specific initiatives or projects within the annual report that align with donors' interest, demonstrating
      the direct impact of their contributions.
        Clearly articulate the organization's mission and show how activities align with core values.
        Emphasize the impact.
        If the report is built for donors, determine if they would prefer printed, infographic, living report, animated,
            snapshot, PDF, or flipbook. (This will be discussed in the next section.)
        Thank you can be said in multiple ways. For example, "This was only possible. . . ."
        If your annual report is large, include a table of contents.

  · Highlighting impact--What motivates your donors to give? What are your accomplishments?
      Share compelling stories and testimonials that highlight your accomplishments and resonate with donor's motiva-
      tions for supporting the organization. Make their donation tangible.
        Weave a compelling narrative that combines quantitative data with qualitative stories.
        Utilize visualizations to illustrate the nonprofit's achievements, measurable outcomes, and program effective-
            ness.
        Incorporate infographics, charts, and graphs in people-first language.
        Consider a separate summarized page with infographics that you can send to board members only (not all of

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 287
            them will read a full report).
        Use social media to announce the annual report. Divide up some content to spread out announcements.
        It is easier to tell a story about one person than a group. Choose a beneficiary whose life has changed because

            of your work (or a story of an inspired volunteer).
        Consider video or use quotes and first-person narratives.
        Use the CASS template (Context, Audience, Story, and Situation) to assess the storytelling. This framework

            combines several of the models and is a great template to evaluate existing data storytelling or build your own
            storytelling with data when you have a large dataset with several insights to share. This template was intro-
            duced in Chapter 2. Use the 10 key criteria to assess this section.
  · Encourage engagement--What influences your donors to volunteer or take part in events?
      Showcase future opportunities for involvement and events and encourage donors to engage with the organization
      beyond their financial contribution. Showcase past successful events and activities and emphasize the types of
      events that resonate with donors.

        Weave compelling images of the events and show how the activities impact the program(s).
        Include a call to action.
  · Recognition and gratitude--How do donors wish to be recognized?
      Express gratitude in the annual report in a manner that aligns with donors' preferences for recognition. Donors
      need to feel sincerely appreciated. Invite feedback from your donors.

        The annual report is only in one place. Make sure to incorporate your annual report into a larger strategy.
            Donors, corporate partners, and volunteers should be thanked more than once per year. However, make sure
            you have permission to post your donor's names!

        Think of your board members--how do you recognize them in your annual report?
  · Building relationships--Will your donors help you expand your network? Does your organization support matching

      donations or sponsor volunteers for the nonprofit organization?
      Leverage donor networks by strategically highlighting connections and donor testimonials and/or joint testimoni-
      als with a recipient and donor/volunteer. Leverage information about donors' affiliations and networks.

        Request permission to share logos of corporate sponsors and ask for quotes that can be highlighted.
        Build a virtual donor recognition wall.
        Use well-designed, compelling videos.
  · Stewardship strategies--What do donors wish to see about financials?
      Donors wish to see how their contribution impacted the programs and that nonprofit financials show good stew-
      ard practices. Many donors want to see how much of a dollar contributed goes directly to support programs. If
      there are concerns, demonstrate the organization's commitment to transparency and responsiveness. If the non-
      profit has long-range planning (bequests, estates, etc.), share the plan.

        Your annual report can include traditional financial statements, or you can use infographics and charts to tell
            your financial story. If you choose the latter option, make sure to include the traditional financials on your
            website and indicate they are available.

        Use data visualization and data storytelling techniques to meet the needs of your annual report reader.
        Consider charity watchdog ratings and consider posting your Form 990 at the same time you post your annual

            report.
        Consider creating a dashboard for project-based fundraisers and share the link in the report (and your web-

            site), so donors can track your progress and feel included.
  · Grants--How will donors want to see grant income?

      Many nonprofits rely heavily on grants for program services. Grants should not drive your programming; instead,
      they should support your mission. Donors do not appreciate mission creep.

        Use infographics to show how grant income supports the mission.

       Use design principles (remember Gestalt!) that keep it simple and design with a theme (like colored circles
       that tie the entire report together). Emphasize people using rich images or videos that focus on people. All
       design apps that aid in creating infographics will have annual report templates. This following video is a great
       common-sensical video especially if this is your first time developing a nonprofit annual report.

5.4 Technology Available for Annual Reports

       The biggest mistake nonprofits make is that they don't see their report as an opportunity for engagement.
          --Jitasa: Numbers for Good (2023)

In the realm of nonprofit communication, the annual report serves as a vital tool for showcasing achievements, impact,
and transparency. As organizations strive to present their stories in innovative and engaging ways, the traditional static
format of printed annual reports has been replaced by digital reports in a variety of formats. Anything from creating a
living annual report, an animated annual report, a flipbook annual report, an impact snapshot annual report, or an info-
graphic annual report is possible. There are various technologies and tools that support this change. Here's an overview
for each type.

Living Annual Report

A living annual report is where the organization shares an up-to-date report. Tableau Foundation has created such a
report where data are updated weekly. Tableau Public allows an organization to use the Tableau Public software for
free. This is not a scaled-down version of the software, but the catch is that anything you create is public. Make sure to
visit the Tableau Living Annual Report to see how you can interact with the data.

This video is 57 minutes long, but it is worth it. Just make sure you get past the "cheesy introduction" (their words!).
   Another product that has the same capability to produce a living annual report, is Power Business Intelligence (BI)

from Microsoft. Power BI's tutorials and videos mostly use examples from a for-profit organization, called Contoso.
However, you can find a nonprofit dataset for Power BI using Contoso for Good (see Power BI Data Visualization for
Nonprofits from Microsoft).

                 Microsoft--Power BI Data Visualization for Nonprofits. Link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprof­

                                The image shown in Figure 5.9, is an example dashboard that is built on Contoso for Good. This
                             page is about the availability of Volunteers, but the nonprofit template has a page for Case Manage-
ment, Case Management: Wellness Survey, Deployed Field Resources, and Donation Management. The image in Figure
5.9 shows Power BI in edit mode--see the visualizations and the data columns on the right. However, if your organization
holds the right type of license, you could publish the data so that your users could interact with it on your website.
Although this is not an example of a living annual report, it does show some of the benefits of information organized in
a dashboard.

One of the key features of a Power BI dashboard is that every chart works as a "slicer" allowing the user to drill down
into the data. This dashboard would not be a public facing dashboard but would serve a great function internally to the
nonprofit executive team and board members. Please review Section 3.9 to find other products that can provide data
visualizations for the living annual report.

Animated Annual Report

Nonprofits are seeking innovative ways to engage their stakeholders and convey the impact of their work effectively.
One such method gaining popularity is the integration of animated gifs in nonprofit annual reports. Animated gifs are
visually compelling and engage the audience. The question arises--is an animated report the right mode of communica-
tion for an annual report. It all goes back to meeting the needs of your stakeholders (audience). An animated report can
be built online by multiple types of hosting platforms (including Word Press). It only requires the user to scroll down,
and various infographics will show animation. Here are a couple examples:

Flipbook Annual Report

Nonprofit organizations strive to present their stories in innovative and engaging ways. One such trend is the adoption
of digital flipbooks that offer a dynamic and interactive platform. A flipbook recreates the experience of flipping through
pages, akin to a traditional printed report. However, it can go much further since some platforms allow multimedia ele-
ments and interactive features. Before your nonprofit uses this feature, you have to be prepared to pay an annual fee to
gain the URL that houses your flipbook. But the good news is that this fee is reasonable.

Features Needed to Create a Flipbook

  · flipbook software that supports HTML5; older tools that use Adobe Flash won't work well with iPhones and iPads,
      since they don't support Flash

  · ability to remove advertising
  · ability to offer searches on keywords
  · ability to allow embedded videos

Examples of Flipbook Software

  · ISSUU--ISSUU is easy to use, full-featured, and the purchased version allows the ability to remove ads and cus-
      tomize embedment. It is a hosted web service from $0 to $299/month. ISSUU has Canva and InDesign integration.

          Sample Use of ISSUU:
             2022 UNICEF: https://www.unicef.org/reports/unicef-annual-report-2022

  · Flipping Book--Flipping Book creates HTML5 interactive documents that can be hosted on your own platform
      from $44 to $179/month.

An Impact Snapshot or an Infographic Snapshot Annual Report

Organizations may want to share key performance metrics as a snapshot in time that will highlight the impact that the
nonprofit can share with donors or stakeholders. Snapshot Annual reports can be digital, print, or both. The goal is to
showcase the organization's successes, challenges, and strategic adaptations. It tells a compelling story, but with more
focus on the organization's journey. It can be a snapshot of infographics with images. Review the following examples to
see potential snapshot designs.

                                Impact Snapshot reports include lots of graphics and large font numbers, and some snapshots
                             are videos. The nonprofit Repair the World (2022) created a video (a little over a minute long) that
is a "2021-2022 Annual Report Snapshot." The report looks something like a slide show, but with music and data. For
example, the first slide has a great image with the text, "95% of volunteers said serving with Repair the World made
them feel a sense of purpose" (Repair the World, 2022, para 1). Take the minute and watch this short YouTube video.

What Apps Are Available for Video Creation and Editing?

In the contemporary landscape of snapshot annual reports, the integration of multimedia elements has become a
dynamic way to convey impactful narratives. Selecting the right video software becomes a critical decision in the annual
report process. The good news!--there is a plethora of free video editing apps, and most phones can generate fabulous
video. Let's look at a few video editing contenders that include a free version.

                                                                                                                                                         More Than Charts! | 293
ScreenPal (Formerly Screencast-o-matic)

Strengths: Simple to use screen recording tool to capture screen (like PowerPoint slides) to later add music.
   Weaknesses: Although ScreenPal has basic editing features, it does not have extensive transitions or effects when

compared to its competitors.

Capcut (Developed by Bytedance)

Strengths: User-friendly interface. Very intuitive--drag and drop. Easy to cut, trim and add music.
   Weaknesses: Lacks some advanced features. Bytedance is the creator of TikTok and banned in some countries.

Canva

Strengths: Versatile graph design platform and many users will recognize the interface. Lots of potential templates. Sev-
eral add-ins can be used to tell good data stories (like Flourish).

   Weaknesses: Lacks depth of video editing features. Better suited to simple edits.

DaVinci Resolve

Strengths: Multitrack editing, professional grade color correction, audio postproduction capabilities, and many
advanced features. This app makes both the free lists and the purchased list. It is also used by Hollywood!

   Weaknesses: May overwhelm beginners and it requires a robust computer with a good video card. Older computers
won't be able to perform well.

Camtasia (Paid Version)

Strengths: Comprehensive screen recording and video editing software. Multitrack editing, animations, royalty-free
assets with more available by a year subscription. Fairly intuitive.

   Weaknesses: There is a cost (although educators and students get a steep price break) and the free version has limi-
tations.

Other Resources

If you consider a narrated video for your annual report, make sure to write a script that matches your images. All video
editing software has a way to add an audio track (and even edit it and change effects). However, it might be difficult
to capture a board member's remarks. One way to remove this obstacle is to send your board member to Online Voice
Recorder at 123Apps. Just click the button to start and follow the on-screen directions. The software saves the file as an
MP3 file, and you can add it into your video editing mix.

Chapter 5 Summary

In summary, this chapter explored the Gestalt Principles and the intricacies of how the human brain remembers infor-
mation. The art and science behind effective communication was taken into a new realm of annual reports for both for-
profit companies and nonprofits. Different purposes drive how the data are presented but both types of organizations
realize the importance of conveying complex data in a way that connects with the stakeholder.

   As technology continues its rapid evolution, the landscape of annual reporting has expanded into the digital realm.
The emergence of digital annual reports, nonprofit living annual reports, interactive flipbooks, and potential reports
built on Tableau or Power BI represents a paradigm shift in how organizations share their narratives. Living annual
reports leverage innovative technologies and give the nonprofit an ability to create a dynamic, engaging, and real-time
experience that captivates stakeholders and fosters a deeper connection with their mission.

   In fact, video is transforming the nonprofit sector's annual reporting endeavors and can be used to share impact with
stakeholders in a way that transcends traditional storytelling. The visual and emotional depth conveyed through video
has the power to immerse audiences in the mission and impact of nonprofits, providing a visceral and authentic expe-
rience and many video editing software programs have a reasonable cost. Imagine testimonials that accompany docu-
mentation of a mission project and leave a lasting impression.

   In this chapter, you were introduced to the evolution of annual reports from static printed documents to dynamic
immersive experiences. The fusion of Gestalt Principles, cognitive science, innovative technology, and reasonable costs
for multimedia development software are all fundamental in forging lasting connections with stakeholders. Every orga-
nization should see the value in creating a dynamic annual report.

Chapter 5 Case: The Power of Annual Reports

                    In this culminating project, apply the knowledge and skills acquired in this chapter to compare several
                    nonprofits that provide the same services. Assume you are a member of the board for a nonprofit and
                    want to compare your organization to other similar-sized nonprofits. For this case, assume that you are
                    looking at four symphony orchestras.

      organizations.
        Did the organization earn at least gold on Guidestar and 4 stars on Charity Navigator?
        What do these rating systems mean?
        Are there areas that need to be completed, updated, or revised?
        Explain why charity watchdog criteria should be used for annual report best practices.

  · Find the most recent Form 990 (found in Guidestar), but make sure to identify years and use the same years to
      compare organizations.
        What was the total revenue from the previous year to the current year?
        What is the executive director's salary? This is found on page 7 of Form 990--Part VII.
        What similarities do you find in the organization's mission? (p. 2, Form 990--Part III)
        What infographics could you use to explain the financial statements? Share some examples.

  · Summarize websites for transparency.
        Does the organization post their Form 990 on their website?
        Does the organization have an annual report linked on the website?
        Why is this important for donors and stakeholders?

  · Review the annual reports.
        What type of annual report is used for each organization? (PDF, flipbook, interactive, etc.)
        Compare the similarities and differences of each annual report.
        If an organization does not have an annual report, what strategies would you recommend to them for develop-
            ing their own annual report? What key pieces of information should be included?
        Use the CASS template to improve storytelling for one of the organizations that had an annual report.
        Review potential templates available for annual reports in Venngage or Canva.

6. Visualize Data With Purpose

       Stories change people while statistics give them something to argue about.
          --Bernie Siegel, author and surgeon

          What Do You Think?
          Michelle Goodwin was the president and CEO of a drop-shipping company, named Bridges. The name
       "Bridges" fit since the software bridged a connection between vendor (seller) and buyer through their man-
       ufacturing plants. The company's success hinged on her software app, but each new medium added to the
       catalog brought its own set of problems to the code. The company was expanding rapidly into various mar-
       kets including jewelry, blankets, and acrylic and the manufacturing plants could provide any of the cus-
       tomized options and ship it out within 48 hours.
          Michelle was at her limit. She understood coding but interpreting financial statements, financial reports,
       or general manufacturing reports now took up 80% of her time. She wanted to spend her time dreaming up
       the next medium for the catalog, not sifting through reports or asking questions that led to asking another
       and another. Each question left her feeling as if her executive team expected her to know the answer.
          She cringed when she recalled her outburst at the last executive meeting. But could they blame her when
       the finance executive Thomas Perry announced a $40,000 penalty for late payments on the VAT? And what
       was VAT anyway?
          Although the penalty was eventually waived, Michelle asked Thomas to discover how this happened.
       Thomas quickly answered, "I can tell you exactly why it happened. We have such a high turnover rate in my
       department; I've been using contract help. When we expanded our sales into Europe, none of my contrac-
       tors had experience or even knew this was a `Europe' thing. This value-added tax (VAT) is assessed at each
       production stage, and we just didn't know about it."
          Michelle was good at reading body language and tried to keep her tone calm and friendly. She could tell
       that Thomas blamed himself for the problem. Michelle leaned in and placed her elbows on the table,
       "Thomas, I didn't know your department was so shorthanded. What can we do to fix this and more impor-
       tantly, how can we develop a reporting setup that alerts me to staffing issues?"
          Michelle picked up the coffeepot and topped her cup, asking, "More coffee, Thomas?" Michelle could see
       that Thomas was giving this some thought. "Michelle, I've been giving you mostly raw reports with some
       graphs on the financial information. What if we brainstorm with the other executives and find out what
       issues should `hit' our weekly reports?"
          Michelle smiled, "Go on--what else?"
          Thomas hesitated, "I know the manufacturing reports come in daily to you. Are you aware that the ship-
       ping is delayed, and most items aren't shipped within the 24-hour guideline?"
          "What? How is that possible?" Michelle squeaked and reached for the 25-page report and flipped to the
       last page. She knew the shipping data in hours was summarized there. As she examined it thoroughly, she
       realized it had the data of only one of the plants, and not all three.

          Michelle could feel her face growing hot, but looked directly at Thomas, "It's clear that we are growing so
       fast that we need to consider how we give proper oversight and make good decisions."

          "I agree, Michelle. We need to visualize the data with purpose and figure out a way to manage and not
       become overwhelmed. I think we almost need a retreat, but I don't think we have time!"

          Michelle laughed, "Let's keep our retreats for the team-building events. How about we look through our
       current reports and see what has purpose and what is missing."

          Thomas, showing some excitement, turned his laptop so they could both see it, "I've been looking at a KPI
       dashboard in my own area. What if we modified your dashboard to the key pieces of information you need?"

          Michelle started laughing, "This is why you were hired, Thomas--you have a knack for anticipating what I
       need. I think I needed the threat of a $40k penalty to make me realize the importance of purpose!"

Introduction

In the realm of data analysis, the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights is a skill that sets apart the adept
from the novice. In this chapter, we look at visualizing data with purpose, recognizing that the manner in which infor-
mation is presented can profoundly influence our understanding of complex datasets. Effective data visualization goes
beyond creating aesthetically pleasing charts; it is a strategic process that aligns with the specific nature and objective
of the data at hand.

   We already know the power of visualizations. For example, illustrations are 83% more effective than text for long-term
memory and a study by the University of Minnesota indicated that the human brain processes visual information 60,000
times faster than text (Verma, 2023, para. 5, 7). The symbiotic relationship between data types and visualization tech-
niques emphasizes the importance of tailoring visualization to the inherent characteristics of the dataset. Essentially, a
line chart may not reveal the same insight as a bar chart. Or even worse--the presenter tries to show everything, and
insight is lost in the clutter.

   This chapter also looks at qualitative data visualizations and the pivotal role in uncovering patterns and trends from
an academic setting. In previous chapters, the authors demonstrated outliers and correlations. This chapter looks at
guidelines and standards, particularly those engaged in academic pursuits such as writing theses and dissertations, and
how the APA 7th edition style guide is used. The chapter will cover best practices for incorporating visualizations into
scholarly works, ensuring that the clarity and integrity of the data are preserved while meeting the stringent require-
ments of academic standards.

   Purpose should drive the use of key performance indicators (KPI) for dashboards to provide a snapshot of the way
things are now. An example of an operational KPI dashboard might be tracking severe weather and accidents to help
local governments assign utility vehicles and first responders. In a corporate setting, KPIs should align with the orga-
nizational objectives and can include sales targets, production output, shipping goals, and more nonfinancial data like
customer satisfaction scores, or employee turnover and/or overtime hours. And KPIs that are aligned with other frame-
works like a Balanced Scorecard approach can be powerful in reaching strategic objectives.

   This chapter serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone seeking to visualize data with purpose. Aligning visualization
techniques with data types, unraveling qualitative intricacies, aligning strategies and KPIs, or navigating academic
reporting, require a presenter to use the tools necessary to extract meaningful insight.

   Chapter 6 addresses the following learning objectives.

6.1 Best Graphical Visualizations Based on Data Type and Purpose

       Often the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarize a set of numbers--even a very large set--is to
       look at pictures of those numbers.

          --Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information
Understanding your data type will help you choose a suitable graph or infographic, but understanding your purpose in
conjunction with the data type helps you reach your audience and present your insights.

   In any setting (but especially an academic setting), understanding your data types will help you choose a suitable sum-
mary statistic and analysis, and the best graph or data visualization. In an academic setting, students tend to leap to
hypothesis testing. In a corporate setting, the typical KPIs are used, when it might be better to investigate the data with
summary statistics and summary charts. Get in the habit of sorting your data with filters to determine issues like out-
liers, missing data, and trends. Use quick summary and aggregations like SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT. With the growing
application of artificial intelligence, upload data and ask the AI "What does this data tell me?" Remember, charts don't
need to be in statistical software (although they can). You can create most of the charts in Excel or a more advanced
Power BI.

   Perhaps you have seen these terms in an undergraduate statistics course, but how many of these types of data can
you explain as listed in Exhibit 6.1?

                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                                          (2025)

In the realm of data analysis, understanding the two primary types plays a crucial role: scale and categorical data. Scale
data are also known as quantitative or numerical data whereas categorical data are often termed qualitative or nominal
data representing distinct categories without inherent numerical significance. Scales can be either continuous or dis-
crete and the types of summary statistics will depend on if the data are normally distributed or skewed. For categorical
data type, you look at either ordinal or nominal. Make sure to look at the examples with each data type.

   Now look at the ways to describe and visualize the data when we have nominal data, ordinal data, interval data, and
ratio data.

   Nominal scale describes the variable with categories. "If you were to assign a numerical value to a category; a higher
score would not necessarily mean that there was more of some quality" (Adams & McGuire, 2022, p. 66)

   Examples of nominal variables: zip code, eye color, political party, gender.
  · Calculations: frequency distribution, percentages, mode, describing ranking
  · Visualizations: bar charts, pie charts. Nominal data represents categories with no inherent order, so visual repre-

      sentations focus on the distribution of categories.
"Ordinal scales represent rankings that have magnitude, but we do not assume that the intervals between the rankings
are equal. Because we do not assume equal intervals with ordinal data, we do not calculate the mean and standard devi-
ation" (Adams & McGuire, 2022, p. 154).

   Examples of ordinal variables: socioeconomic status (low, middle, and high income), survey responses like a satisfac-
tion rating (extremely dislike, dislike, neutral, like, extremely like).

  · Calculations: frequencies, percentages, median.
  · Visualizations: bar charts, stacked bar charts, line charts. Since ordinal data has a meaningful order, display the

                                                                                                                                            Visualize Data With Purpose | 301
      rank order of categories.
"Interval scales are ratings in which we assume there are equal intervals between scores . . . , do not have a true zero"
(Adams & McGuire, 2022, p. 154).

   Examples of interval variables: SAT score (200-800), credit score (300-850).
  · Calculations: frequencies, percentages (*mean if normally distributed, median if not), standard deviation.
  · Visualizations: histograms, line charts, box plots. Interval data allows for meaningful differences between values,

      so you can use more advanced statistics like mean and standard deviation.
"Ratio scales measure quantity and have both equal intervals and a true zero" (Adams & McGuire, p. 154).

   Examples of ratio variables: pulse, weight, dose amount, income, age.
  · Calculations: frequencies, percentages, mean (if normally distributed), median (if not normally distributed), stan-

      dard deviation, range.
  · Visualizations: histograms, line charts, box plots, scatterplots. Ratio data, like interval data, allow for more

      advanced calculations. In addition to the mean and standard deviation, you can also calculate the range. Scatter-
      plots are useful for exploring Power BI Desktop to Power BIing relationships between two ratio variables.
A word of caution: Specific analyses and graphs (or infographics) can vary depending on your purpose (like the research
question), the characteristics of the data, and the audience you are communicating with. Always consider the context
and purpose. And always see if your data are normally distributed. It will impact what statistic you report (mean or
median) and will impact the type of statistical test (parametric or nonparametric).
   * A big difference between the mean and the median indicates skewed data or influential outliers.
   Table 6.1 presents a quick view of the type of graphical display that matches the variable type and data type and what
purpose it can serve.

The purpose of most of these graphical displays is to understand the distribution--keep that thought in mind as we move
through the examples.

   Let's review some of the terms. Here is a quick overview of some types of variables:

  · univariate dataset: consists of observations on a single variable made on individuals in a sample (e.g., height).
  · bivariate dataset: where two different characteristics are measured simultaneously (for example--swimming pool

      attendance and temperature). Usually, the researcher is trying to find out the relationship, causes and explana-
      tions. These variables are often plotted on x- and y-axes on various graphs. One variable is dependent, and one is
      independent.
  · multivariate dataset: when the data involve three or more variables (e.g., a marketing researcher wants to com-
      pare three different social media ads using the click-through rate for both men and women).

                                                                                                                  Visualize Data With Purpose | 303
Graphs and Charts in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)

Most researchers underestimate the possible graphics in statistical software programs like SPSS. You aren't expected to
create graphs and charts in SPSS (most of us prefer Excel); it is important to at least know what is available.

   Let's look at some of the features using a public dataset. SPSS offers chart builder, Graphboard template chooser, and
legacy dialogues. Figure 6.1 shows the Chart Builder in SPSS.

                                                                                                                                                          interface © IBM

The Graphboard Template chooser (Figures 6.1 and 6.2) includes Basic, Detailed, Title, and Options. When you click on
a nominal category (i.e., country), it will give you specific charts that are appropriate for the data, but a word of caution.
Even if it shows an appropriate chart type for the data, make sure you think about what to expect. For example, if the
dataset had 49 countries; imagine what a pie sliced 49 times would look like!

   SPSS manages statistical procedures and graphical analysis in an integrated manner. But the biggest reason to use
SPSS might be the preferences of the research community and the requirements of your discipline. But for most of us,
we are much better working with Excel, because it is what we know. Although we don't delve into all the capabilities of
SPSS in this textbook, it is still a good idea to know what you can do in it.

   There are some similarities--for example in the Graphboard template chooser, you see the type of charts SPSS rec-
ommends based on the data type (Figure 6.2).

All statistical software packages have graphing capability, and most are fairly intuitive. And Excel will meet most of your
requirements. But let's look at some of the known issues in Excel as well as some tips and tricks to help you tell your
data story better.

Consider Purpose

Label data point or axis: Consider your purpose when deciding on either axis label or labeling the data points directly.
For big picture trends, use the axis. If specific values are important, label the data point. So if you label the data point,
eliminate the axis.

   Font size and type: Another important aspect is font type and font size. Keep it simple and choose fonts that are easy
to read. A study conducted by Song and Schwarz (2008) gave students instructions on exercising. Half the students were
given written instructions in an easy-to-read Arial font. The other half were given instructions using a brushstroke font.
The results? Students with the script font (brushstroke) expected the exercise routine to be difficult and indicated they
were less likely to try it. So if your chart looks complicated, the message may get lost.

   Default settings: Unfortunately, Excel's default settings for graphs will include gridlines, two decimal places, tick
marks, and its own interpretation for colors. Excel will also include a legend that you might not need as well as a poor
title name and field buttons. Some experts refer to these as "visual noise." If you have a specific chart style preference,
the ideal step is to create a chart template, rather than customizing each chart.

   Emphasize purpose: Many data storytellers use arrows to draw the audience's attention. However, you can also use
images with annotations. For example, assume you are looking at the history of online users from the time your organi-
zation launched their website until today. You noticed specific surges in online users as you look at the trendline. As you
dive into the data, you discover that there was an increase in online users after your organization launched Facebook,
and then another surge when you launched Twitter. Adding a graph with an explanation works well, but you could also
use the Facebook logo and Twitter logo along with the text, like an annotation.

   Prechunk: Most people can only process four to seven pieces of information, so it makes sense to evaluate the data
and think of how best to show it. Suppose your main point is to show the largest sale category for each region with a
sense of the variety of products sold. In Figure 6.3, you can figure it out with some effort, but you have lots of distrac-
tions or noise.

   Figure 6.3--Showing Sales by Region and Category in One Chart

                                                                                                                                            Visualize Data With Purpose | 305
   Instead of one large chart for XCaliber Foods, you can use multiple charts, one for each region, highlighting the largest
category with a distinct color and use an overlay or animated text to show sale details in the East, West, North, and
South areas of the United States.

   In addition, annotating with text could show the percentage of the largest category to the overall category in the
region as well as the percentage of this category overall. The annotations can be brought in as an overlay (like adding
animation in a PowerPoint presentation). But let's look at the insights (Figure 6.4) from this prechunk approach with no
overlay.

   Insight #1: In the multiple charts, it is obvious that three out of four regions have beverages as the largest sales cate-
gory.

   Insight #2: In multiple charts in the West region, the variety of products is larger than all other regions.
   Insight #3: Pasta has the highest sales in the East, but pasta is barely represented in the other regions. What insight
could a presenter bring for this finding?

previous dataset, Campus Travel Ticket Sales, so the only new thing you are learning is saving a chart as a template.

          1. Open the Excel file, "Campus Travel Ticket Sales." (This is in Chapter 4 files.)
             2. Create a chart using the column for salesperson and the column indicating the number of tickets sold. The

          default looks like the following (notice the gridlines, the axis, the large gaps, the color blue, and the visible field
          buttons).

             3. Now customize the chart so it looks like the chart on the right.

                                                                                                                                            Visualize Data With Purpose | 307

                                                                                                                                                          Versus Customized
                                                                                                                                                          Charts

          4. Right-click the customized chart and Save as Template, and for file name, use "Green_Dashboard."
             5. Now click in the raw data and insert a PivotTable. Pull destination to rows and tickets sold to values. It

          should look like Figure 6.6.
                                                                                                                                   Figure 6.6--Destination
                                                                                                                                   Sum of Tickets Sold

          6. Now select a cell in the PivotTable and click Insert and then recommended charts.
             7. Click the Templates folder and choose the customized "Green_Dashboard chart." It should look like the fol-

          lowing. Notice that the only thing you need to change is the title and that this format works with your other
          graph (see Figure 6.7).

6.2 Visualize Key Performance Indicators

       If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
          --Peter Drucker

If you do a search in this textbook, you will discover that key performance indicators (KPIs) have been discussed in sev-
eral chapters. This section is devoted to a unique use of KPIs. The application of KPIs in unconventional contexts reflects

                                                                                                                                           Visualize Data With Purpose | 309
a paradigm shift in how we assess progress and tackle global challenges. The visualization of KPIs in these diverse set-
tings goes beyond data representation; it serves as a catalyst for informed decision-making, public engagement, and the
pursuit of a more sustainable and equitable future. Look at some of the unique ways KPIs are visualized.

European Commission Use Qlik and Narrate Storytelling to Show Progress

The European Union is the EU's politically independent executive arm. It draws up proposals for new European legisla-
tion, helps shape the EU's overall strategy and monitors the EU budget. KPIs play a pivotal role in tracking the progress
of each goal, providing a quantifiable framework for assessing impact. "Since its launch in 2015, data.europa.eu has been
the main point of access at the EU level to public sector information published across Europe . . . with aims to improve
access to open data, as well as foster both high-quality open data publication and the reuse of open data to create
impact" (Measuring Open Data Maturity, 2023, para 3). To that end, the European Commission supports Single Elec-
tronic Data Interchange Area (SEDIA) on their Horizon Dashboard. But even more interesting is the EC's use of Qlik. The
European Union uses Qlik to add a "Narrative Storytelling" feature (see Exhibit 6.2) so a user can take snapshots of cur-
rent graphics and create their own story.

Essentially, you add the graphs that provide insight to the Qlik library and place them in the order that supports a good
story with related insights. As you can see, Qlik allows a viewer to look at the R&I Proposals in European countries to
narrate a story. To better understand this process, watch "Building Your Story," which was produced in 2022 by Qlik
Help.

United Nations and the 17 SDGs

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent an ambitious agenda aimed at addressing global
challenges, ranging from climate action to social equality. KPIs play a pivotal role in tracking the progress of each goal,
providing a quantifiable framework for assessing impact. The point to make here is the use of icons that drive every
report. This short video gives a quick introduction to the SDGs.

Look at how thoroughly the United Nations carries out the icon and even the icon color. For example, Goal 1 is "No
Poverty" with a bright red background. If you click on Goal 1 at https://sdgs.un.org/goals, and scroll down, the info-
graphic is a white background with red lettering with the title "End poverty in all forms everywhere." Try visiting the
website to notice how well the United Nations uses color and icons to keep a wealth of data organized. Visualization of
KPIs often takes the form of interactive dashboards, heatmaps, and thematic charts.

Key Performance Indicator--What Is Important?

Organizations will have different KPI visualizations depending on the purpose, the stakeholders, and the time available
to look at them, but there are some specific components to consider when you are organizing the KPIs for your orga-
nization. According to Kerzner, there are six attributes to KPIs: predictive, measurable, actionable, relevant, automated,
and few in number (2017, pp. 210-211).

   Think about what we mean when using the words "key," "performance," and "indicator."

  · key = major contribution to success or failure
  · performance = provides measurable, quantifiable, and controllable elements
  · indicator = valid representation of present performance

If you start looking at KPIs for your organization type, you will find that many organizations have KPI creep. This may
mean that stakeholders are asking for information that may not necessarily have a specific target. For example, Univer-
sity KPIs often have the location of students as part of their reporting and insights. Board of trustee members want to

                                                                                                                                             Visualize Data With Purpose | 311
know where the students are coming from (which state), the international student's location, and other interesting fac-
tors. Some organizations split up entire dashboards by an overall topic (not necessarily tied to KPIs). See the following
example from the University of Tennessee. You will see several dashboards: Graduate Blueprint, Enrollment Manage-
ment, Human Resource, Academic Unit Stats, Student Success, Academic Reporting Portal, Faculty Reporting Database,
and others. Maine's Public Universities provides a one-page summary with a three-year trend key letting you quickly
see either meeting goal, neutral, or not meeting goal. (This site uses Tableau public.)

                        Outline the main KPIs for your organization. Next, determine how they follow what is called

                     SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound). Set it up as follows and
                     show how the KPI meets the SMART goals:

        Discussion Question #1
                        Research your industry for common KPIs. Be ready to discuss how they contribute to the success
                     of the organization.
                        Discussion Question #2
                        Examine the features of Qlik that make it a suitable platform for visualizing KPIs. How does Qlik
                     (or Qlik Sense) enhance the presentation and interpretation of complex data, and what advantages
                     does it offer compared to other data visualization tools?

6.3 Academic Reporting Standards to Accompany Visualizations

       Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other.
          --William Zinsser, Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction

Most graduate programs require a specific style and grammar guideline for all theses and dissertations, and the style
guides can vary by discipline. This text will show examples following APA 7th edition for the more common statistical
tests. Don't worry if you struggle a little to understand the statistical terms. The point here is to become familiar with
the type of standards required by APA 7th edition style guide.

   Many students have questioned, "Why so strict?" The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes guidelines
to ensure consistency and clarity in scholarly writing. They are standardized so readers can quickly locate and interpret
information. The APA also wants consistency across publications, so it aligns with the formatting standards of a broader
academic community. Part of the strict requirements is to ensure clarity and interpretability. While the guidelines may
seem strict, they serve the broader goals of enhancing communication and maintaining a high professional standard in
academic writing.

APA 7th Edition Format for Figures (Charts and Other Visuals)

The APA style guidelines consider graphs and other visuals as "figures." There are specific guidelines for sample bar
graphs, line graphs, flowcharts, sample maps, and a variety of infographics that clarify the text. In order to help with
this, the APA Style website offers examples as well as a downloadable Word file.

APA 7th Edition Table Format for t-test

For this example, let's look at a subset from Larson & Morris's (2008) study "Sex and Salary." A survey of purchasing and
supply professionals, answering the age-old question, "Are women still paid less than men for comparable work?"

                                                                                                                                            Visualize Data With Purpose | 313

Please note that the APA 7th edition manual Section 6.36 suggests that standard deviations should be one decimal, but
the APA Sample Tables show several t-test tables with three decimal places! So please be consistent as well as discuss
this with your thesis or dissertation committee. Keep in mind that you could have a narrative or a table but not both.

Independent t-test Sample Write-Up

An independent t-test sample was conducted to compare annual salaries for male purchasing managers and female pur-
chasing managers. Levene's Test for equality of variance (showed no violations, p = .174). Results indicate that males (M =
74.60, SD = 5.40) earned significantly more than females (M = 64.40 and SD = 8.618).

   t (18) = 3.11, p < .001, Glass's delta = 1.160
   The effect size is high; the difference between the two means is more than one standard deviation.

The second table assumes that you will add other statements. For example, you may have conducted a survey with the
training that may be relevant. Again, the confidence interval would be placed in narrative if not included in the table.

Sample study: Your company has timber yards in all four regions of the United States, and you've received complaints
about your COVID-19 policies, but you don't know if the complaints are mostly in one region or not. You randomly
choose five stores in each region to collect the number of complaints (mainly guests who do not want to wear a mask)
from their store in the last month. You want to see if there is a difference between regions before you make any changes
to the COVID-19 policies. The raw data are shown in Figure 6.9.

ANOVA Test Sample Write-Up

There was significant difference among the four regions on COVID-19 mask complaints, F(3, 16) = 9.951, p < .001, 2p =
.65. Post hoc testing revealed significant differences between pairs of regions with North (M = 1.0, SD = 1.23) and South
(M = 1.60, SD = .89) having fewer complaints than East (M = 3.40, SD = 1.14) and West (M = 4.00, SD = 0.71). These findings
indicate that there are more complaints in the East and West regions.

APA 7th Edition Table Format for Mixed Methods

Many researchers approach a question using two different methods (qualitative and quantitative), which is then called a
mixed methods study. The two methods often entail a survey that has both qualitative open-ended questions and Lik-
ert scale questions about perceptions. This helps the research gain a deeper understanding of the issue as well as more
confidence in the findings. This process is triangulation. Keep in mind that data collection could include interviews, sur-
veys, focus group interviews, and data captured that is factual and related to the project.

   Let's look at the following example:
   #1--The table is bold, no italics, no period ending.
   #2--The title is in italics.
   #3--The Mixed Methods table shows Quantitative results, Qualitative results, and Example quote. The actual APA
manual shows a hanging indent, but most dissertations and theses appear to have no indents.
   #4--It is possible to have notes if the table cannot be understood from the table title or the narrative.

Chapter 6 Summary

This chapter underscores the fundamental "purpose" behind visualizing data, elucidating how specific data types align
more effectively with chart formats. Data types were presented to show that certain charts fit data better than others.
"Exhibit 6.1--Types of Data" organized the different types of data into nominal, categorical, ordinal, interval, and ratio
scales with example calculations and visualizations. "Table 6.1: Which Graphical Display Fits the Purpose?" takes the
decision-making process to a more sophisticated level by amalgamating the intended purpose with the most suitable
visualization type.

   This chapter imparted insights on refining visualizations, encompassing techniques such as noise reduction and
the significance of appropriate labeling, including font choices. Notably, default settings in Microsoft Excel lack alerts
regarding the suitability of a chart for the given data. Consequently, the recommendation is to craft a personalized set of
chart templates so your organization can ensure consistency in appearance. All of this section leads to the importance
of chunking. An exploration of "chunking" considers the cognitive strategy that involves grouping pieces of information
to enhance user retention and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of collective insights. Chunking is a method of
grouping individual pieces of information, so the user remembers the point and sees the collective insight.

   Key performance indicators were discussed in a new light to show how nonprofits and governmental units are engag-
ing the public to choose insights that fit their story. Organizations like the European Commission are using tools like
Qlik and Qlik Sense to support narrate storytelling with open data and data insights. A user can choose the data insights
to support the story that has meaning to them. This is a powerful trend that supports transparency.

   The subsequent section delves into academic reporting standards to accompany visualizations, underscoring the sig-
nificance of adhering to style guidelines specific to one's discipline. Many students in the early stages of writing a thesis
or a dissertation may be unaware of guidelines dictating how data should be presented in tables or the appropriate for-
mat for charts like histograms. Statistical output was explored to determine the appropriate way to present that data
according to APA 7th edition guidelines. It is not necessary to know how to use SPSS; instead, it is working with the out-
put to recognize the patterns of how the data should be presented.

                You currently work as a data analyst for an online retailer (Walmart) in the United States and your
                boss just asked you to create charts to show the revenue and growth of Walmart, as well as high-
                light the fastest-growing market segmentation in the sector. Your boss gave you the sector market
                segmentation data (Table 6.7) and Walmart's revenue from MarketLine (Table 6.8) to get you started.
                KPI Targets: Growth of 5% from 2021 to 2022 across all categories.

7. The Power of Business Intelligence

       You don't need a title to be a leader!
          --Mark Sanborn

   What Do You Think?

   John was just boarding a return flight from a confer-
ence and could not wait to share things he had learned
while attending a three-hour session on Power BI sto-
rytelling. On his return plane trip, he outlined key
points he had learned. As he scrutinized his session
notes, he noticed his first note was "What is it?" and
then he noticed that he had highlighted "your app" in
his note. John was amazed that he had learned how to
create a storytelling dashboard and an app.

   He started pulling a list of questions from his notes.

1. What type of account do we need, and do we

already have Power BI with our Microsoft 365

account?

2. How are we presenting quarterly sales now?

     How are we telling the story of our sales now?        Note: Author Illustration (2025)
3. Can we create a dashboard that is interactive

and uses visuals (like maps for geographical dis-

tribution of sales) and drill-down techniques?

4. Who else in my department knows about Power BI?

Consider--What other questions should be part of the planning stage to launch the Power BI suite?

Introduction

In the era of data-driven decision-making, organizations are embracing robust tools to weave compelling narratives
from raw data. Microsoft Power BI stands out as a game changer, offering a dynamic platform to transform raw data into
actionable insights. This chapter serves as a gateway to a variety of topics ranging from when to use Power BI to apply-
ing techniques and features that support storytelling. Examples of how Power BI is used in different industries illustrate
how diverse sectors leverage this tool to gain a competitive edge and drive innovation. Power BI building blocks, robust
visualizations, and quick insights are some of the features covered in this chapter. When you complete this chapter, you
will be able to create your own Power BI reports, and dashboards, and see how an app would benefit communication
within your organization. The authors will also share the abundance of training resources available (for free!). Whether

                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 323
you are a novice or an experienced storyteller, the insights and knowledge gained in this chapter will lay the ground-
work for a successful journey into the world of Power BI storytelling.

   Before we get started, let's determine the parts that are free. Power BI Desktop is free and users can develop dash-
boards, create apps, or use the "quick insight" feature. Power BI Desktop is a great place to clean data, analyze data, and
create reports. However, Power BI Desktop does not work on a Mac. Power BI Services Online provides the ability to
create dashboards (often from the reports created in Power BI Desktop), create apps, and share content. Power BI Ser-
vices Online works on either Macs or PCs. It makes sense to learn both Power BI Desktop and Power BI Services (Online).
Mac users are encouraged to follow the reading during the Power BI Desktop and apply what they learn from the Power
BI Services (Online). In this chapter, both the Power BI Desktop and Power BI Services (Online) will be demonstrated.

       "Power BI Desktop unifies the former Excel Power Tools (Power Pivot, Power Query and Power View) into one
       vastly improved, stand-alone, data discovery desktop application built on a modernized HTML5 visualization
       framework."

          --Edward Price, Applied Microsoft Power BI: Bring your data to life!

Chapter 7 addresses the following learning objectives.

7.1 Features of the Power BI Suite

       Storytelling is our obligation to the next generation. If all we are doing is marketing, we are doing a disservice,
       and not only to our profession, but to our children, and their children. Give something of meaning to your audi-
       ence by inspiring, engaging, and educating them with story. Stop marketing. Start storytelling.

          --Laura Holloway, founder in chief of The Storyteller Agency

In the previous chapter, you created dashboards in Excel with slicers. For some of you, this may have been your first
experience creating a dashboard. If so, keep in mind that old phrase from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, "You Ain't Seen
Nothing Yet!" If you are familiar with data from your organization, you can probably list the potential uses for build-
ing interactive dashboards and reports. But you haven't encountered the "Quick Insights" available in Power BI Services
(Online) or seen the ability to create an app for your organization.

Licensing:

Power BI Services (Online): There are three kinds of Power BI Services (Online) per-user licenses: Free, Pro, and Pre-
mium. Power BI in Microsoft Fabric is a free account, and no credit card is required to use it. Both PC and Mac users can
use Power BI Services (Online). The online service is bundled with Microsoft 365 and is a free license. With a free license
of Power BI Services Online, you can use it for personal data analysis and visualization in "My Workspace." The Power
BI Service Online is a cloud-based service where users view and interact with reports and dashboards. The Power BI
Services (Online) Pro license has built-in collaboration capabilities and costs $10 per user/month. The Pro license opens
a way to strategically communicate within your organization.

   Power BI Desktop: Power BI Desktop can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store and is always free. Use the
Microsoft store since Windows will automatically update your Power BI Desktop. You can download Power BI Desktop
at Microsoft IF you have a PC. There is no Mac version at this time.

   A Power BI Desktop license allows you to publish reports to My Workspace if you are using the free version of Power
BI Online. If you have a Pro license in Power BI Services Online, you can also publish from the Power BI Desktop to
Workspaces in Power BI Services Online. You need a Microsoft Power BI Services (Online) Pro to publish to the web
from Workspaces. I know this sounds confusing, so please feel free to explore Publish to Web from Power BI or Power
BI service per-user and capacity-based licenses from Microsoft Learn. The authors will show features of the Pro option,
but any assignment expectations will use only the free license.

   Please review the Power BI Suite Process shown in Exhibit 7.1, and notice the process is very similar whether you have
a free license or a Pro license. The biggest difference is collaboration within the Workspace and the ability to create a
Power BI app for consumer consumption. The Pro license unlocks more advanced AI capabilities as well (although we
will not be working with AI in this context). The Power BI Desktop accepts hundreds of file types. Once you upload an
Excel file to Power BI Desktop and save it, the new extension for the file is .pbix. Both Power BI Desktop and Power BI
Services can upload and use .pbix files.

          Power BI (see #1 in Figure 7.2), and several Explore this data story (see #2). If this is your first time working with
          Power BI Services Online, make sure to explore these. Keep in mind, your experience will be slightly different

          since the examples change. Also, you will not see anything in the My Workspace tile since you have not added
          anything to your My Workspace yet. But the most important component is Learn (see #3).

Before demonstrating how to upload files, let's define some of the terms used by Power BI. Don't worry; take one step at
a time to understand how the suite of Power BI works together. This chapter will use Microsoft datasets and templates,
public datasets, and the XCaliber Foods dataset to demonstrate many principles. So let's start with the foundational
components.

What Is Power BI?

"Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data
into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights" that can be shared (Microsoft--Power BI Introduction, 2023,
para 1). You can upload an Excel file, a SalesForce file, a Mailchimp file, a web page, a database, and hundreds of other

                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 327
sources into Power BI Desktop. Multiple sources are possible. Just as a car is built of metal, fabric, glass, and rubber, a
dataset potentially pulls from unrelated, even third-party sources.

   The best Power BI experience is on a PC. You can only use Power BI Desktop on a PC unless the Mac is running soft-
ware to simulate the Windows experience. However, it is possible to do most of the same things in Power BI Services
(Online). Let's look at a comparison of Power BI Desktop and Power BI Services (Online). Make sure to notice the main
points in the visual. There may be terms you don't understand yet, and that's OK. We will cover them shortly.

   Exhibit 7.2--Comparison of Power BI Desktop and Power BI Services (Online)
                                                                                                                                             Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                             (2024)

A note on sharing in Exhibit 7.2. When you use the share button in Power BI Desktop, it is a unique experience depend-
ing on whether you use the Pro or Free version of Power BI Services Online. Evidently, Power BI Desktop knows which
version you have. Sharing in a Pro environment gives you a way to directly connect with others. Sharing in the Free
version means the sharing comes about because you are saving it to a shared folder. Look at Figure 7.4 for some of the
differences.

   Figure 7.4--Pro Versus Free Sharing Feature

Compare Power BI Desktop to Power BI Services (Online)

The Power BI suite has two main components plus an App Creation Tool that work together to give your users the best
experience. The first component is the Power BI Desktop.

Power BI Desktop

This is an app that you download to your computer (but it is only for PCs). You can download and install it for free. You
can upload files from many different sources and connect them through modeling. You can design a report on the Power
BI Desktop and publish it to Power BI Services Online. If you have the free version of Power BI Services Online, your
only option in Power BI Desktop is to publish to My Workspace. As shown in Exhibit 7.3, when you first open the Power
BI Desktop app, you see a pop-up window to get started with helpful videos to guide you.

   Exhibit 7.3--Power BI Desktop App--Opening Screen

   To close the pop-up window, just click the X in the upper right-hand corner. You will now see an Untitled--Power BI
Desktop container. The main sections include the ribbon, the views, the filters, visualizations, and fields.

   According to Devin Knight, a Microsoft Data Platform MVP and president of Pragmatic Works, there are four main
                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 329
steps to reach the report process: (1) data discovery/data shaping, (2) data modeling (like creating relationships, DAX:
Data Analysis eXpression), (3) data visualization (building reports, custom visuals), and (4) data sharing--publishing the
reports to Power BI Services Online to share with others (2023, 14:37-15:29). Does it surprise you that data visualization
is the third step?

   Figure 7.5--Main Sections of Navigation in Power BI Desktop

   Ribbon--The ribbon has a similar look and feel to other Microsoft products. At this early stage, one of the key com-
ponents is the Get Data or alternatively Excel Workbook. One of the key differences of Power BI Desktop when com-
pared to Power BI Services (Online) is the ability to "get data" from multiple sources. Besides Excel, some of the file types
accepted by Power BI Desktop include text/CSV, XML, and PDF, as well as several databases like SQL Server database.
There are hundreds of other files that can be used with Power BI Desktop. This is a significant difference since Power BI
Services Online accepts very few file types and Power BI Desktop accepts over a hundred file types. Also on the ribbon
is the ability to transform data (essentially clean it up).

   Note that Power BI Desktop has a Publish button on the ribbon. You can only publish to My Workspace (if free version
of Power BI Services Online). If you are using a Pro version of Power BI Services Online, Power BI Desktop will publish
to either My Workspace or Workspace. Power BI Desktop will know which version of Power BI Services Online that you
have (free or pro).

   Views--These three icons provide views: Report view, data view, or model view. The data view shows your dataset (like
opening Excel). The report view shows the canvas and any visualizations you have started. The model view is where
you can create relationships, build hierarchies, or perform calculations through DAX (Data Analysis eXpression). DAX is
a formula expression language that allows users to create more complex measures, calculated columns, and tables. It is
specifically tailored for business intelligence.

   Filters--This is somewhat explanatory. You can add filters to "filter the data." An example for using the filter could be
if your company is dropping a service or product line and you want to filter it out from anything you create.

   Visualizations--Although you see a robust number of visuals, if you click on the three dots (ellipsis) you can get more
visuals. Exhibit 7.4 shows only the first page of visualizations. It might surprise you, but there are over 400 visuals avail­
able! As a word of caution, download visuals that have been tested and approved by Microsoft.

   Data shows the tables and fields of the dataset.
   Canvas is where you build the report with visualizations and context.

   Take a minute to explore the Power BI Desktop as shown in Figure 7.6. Try out the samples so you get a sense of what
is available.

   The next component of the Power BI suite is Power BI Services (Online). You can determine your license by selecting
your avatar. The authors have a Power BI Services (Online) Pro license and a student account that has a Free license. We
have tried to make sure to point out the differences.

Power BI Services (Online)

This is available by logging into Office.com using your organization's credentials (shown in the next section). This Power
BI Services Online works on either Mac or PC. Power BI services can Upload some data sources including .pbix files and
Power BI Services Online is used to create dashboards and analyze the data through quick insights. If you have the Pro
version, you can create and share a Power BI app. There's much more, but let's take it one step at a time. The report you

build in Power BI Desktop is published to Power BI Services Online. If you have the free account, you can publish to "My
Workspace," or if you have a Pro license, you can publish to "My Workspace" and "Workspace" assuming you have first
created a Workspace! In Figure 7.7, you should note the Upload feature. You can upload a .pbix or .rdl file here, but NOT
an Excel file. Read on to discover how you can upload your Excel File to Power BI Services Online.

Home, Create, Browse, and OneLake Data Hub in Power BI Services Online

                  Home is what you would expect--It shows your files based on how recently accessed. It also has a "New
               report" button that you can use to start creating reports.

                  Create allows you to add data to start building a report. You have a few choices--(a) Excel (Preview), which
               means you link your Excel file from OneDrive; (b) link a CSV file from OneDrive; (c) paste or manually enter
               data (looks like a spreadsheet); or (d) select a published semantic model. If you recall, "Power BI semantic
               models represent a source of data that's ready for reporting and visualization" (Microsoft Learn, 2023, para 1).

                  Browse includes a list of files in order of the most recent use.
                  OneLake Data Hub is a centralized data hub for your entire organization. It allows members of the organi-
               zation to use Fabric data items if they are given access. When you click on OneLake Data Hub, you will see a
list of your data (My data). If you select, "Endorsed in your org," you will see a list of datasets available to you from your
organization. Since you are visiting this as a student, this selection will not show any files. You can learn more about this
at Microsoft Learn: Discover data items in the OneLake data hub.

A Word to Mac Users

Although you can't use Power BI Desktop to "get data," you can still get your data into Power BI Services Online. Once
you have the data in Power BI Services Online, you should be able to create dashboards and reports.
332 | The Power of Business Intelligence
   Here are two options:

Option #1--Link an Excel File to Power BI Services Online

Mac users should be able to use Excel Preview to link their Excel file to Power BI Services Online. Two things are impor-
tant.

  · First: The Excel file must live in a OneDrive space. According to Microsoft (as of Sept 29, 2023), "Upload of local
      workbooks to Power BI Workspaces will no longer be allowed" (Microsoft Learn, 2023, para 2).

  · Second: Use the link to file option, not the upload option. Start with Create, then Excel (Preview), and Link to the
      Excel file (as shown in Figure 7.8).

Figure 7.8--Link to Excel File

   There is another way to get your Excel file to Power BI Services Online right from the Excel file itself.

Option #2--Publish Excel File Power BI Services Online

Note: Screenshots of Excel interface © Microsoft Corporation. Used with attribution for instructional and illustrative pur­
poses. Annotations added by the author.

  · First, go to Office.com and log in. Find the apps, search for Power BI Services Online, and have it open.
  · Second, open the Excel file you want to use. Make sure it is in table format.
  · Third, go to File and scroll down to Publish. Select Publish, and a pop-up screen will show up. Choose Export (as

      seen in Figure 7.9) so you can create reports and dashboards.
                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 333
Figure 7.9--Publish Excel File Directly to Power BI Services Online

  · Fourth, you will see a note that the workbook was exported successfully. Select the Go to Power BI button, and the
      following pop-up window will appear. Type in your email (use your college email account).

Figure 7.10--Select Button and Follow On-Screen Directions

   Visit the Power BI Services Online, and the file you published should show Semantic Model as the type. This means
you will be able to build reports and dashboards with this dataset!

   Now that we have the Mac file issue solved, let's review more of the Power BI Services Online features.
   The section of interest is the Power BI components: Reports, Paginated Reports, Scorecards, and Dashboards. The
other components (i.e., Data Factory, Data Science, Data Warehouse, and Real-Time Analytics) are beyond what the
authors plan to cover.
   In order to have a more logical understanding of how things work, let's look at Workspaces and My Workspace next
and come back to Apps and Metrics.

Workspaces in Power BI Services (Online)

Note: Screenshots of Power BI interface © Microsoft Corporation. Used with attribution for instructional and illustrative
purposes. Annotations added by the author.

   Power BI Services (Online) Pro version provides two workspace types (or containers) and an ability to construct an
app. Everyone has "My Workspace," but only Pro accounts will be able to use Workspaces. If you have the Pro version,
you can have multiple Workspaces.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 335
                     Workspaces are containers for dashboards, reports, and semantic models. Workspaces can provide a
                  team environment to collaborate with your coworkers. You can add coworkers to your Workspace if they
                  also have a Power BI Pro license and are part of your organization. If you only have a Free license, you will
                  not be able to create a Workspace. And you can only create an app in a Workspace.

                     My Workspace is your personal space for content. Only you have access to your "My Workspace"; how-
                  ever, you can share individual dashboards and reports in the Pro version. If you have a Free license, plan to
                  share from Power BI Desktop to a OneDrive shared folder. If you try sharing a file directly in Power BI Ser-
vices Online, you will see a pop-up to upgrade your license.

What Is a Semantic Model?

  · In Power BI, a semantic model is a way to organize and represent the data; it's like creating a common language for
      understanding. You can create semantic models to create relationships, create measures, build hierarchies, and
      create visualizations. For example, you might have a table on quality control and a table on product manufacturing
      codes. If you want to connect them, you create a relationship. For example, when creating measures, you may
      always want data shown a certain way (like year-to-date last year) compared to (year-to-date this year). Creating a
      model that has this measure can then be used by all. For now, it is enough for you to know what they are and their
      purpose.

  · Semantic models are available in either Power BI Desktop or Power BI Services Online. Here is an example in Fig-
      ure 7.11.

Figure 7.11--Semantic Model in Power BI Services Online

336 | The Power of Business Intelligence
Workspace Options Seem Available

If you have a Free Power BI Services (Online) license, you will still see a button to create a Workspace. However, once
you start setting up the Workspace, you won't be able to move forward unless you update your account from Free to Pro
or sign up for a free trial. The arrows in Figure 7.12 show this limitation.

   Figure 7.12--Limitation of Power BI Services (Online) Free Account

                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 337
   To see information about Power BI apps, let's switch to a Pro license in Figure 7.12. In this illustration, the Workspace
is named "Textbook Creation" since the dashboards, reports, and the app were created for this textbook. You can only
create a Power BI app with a Pro license and only one app per Workspace. Creating an app is one of the more powerful
aspects of Power BI Services Online.

So What's a Power BI App and How Is It Used?

Workspaces are considered a staging area. You can create an "app" from the content. "An app is a collection of dash-
boards and reports built to deliver key metrics to the Power BI consumers in your organization. Apps are interactive,
but consumers cannot edit them" (Microsoft, 2023, para 3).

   Create an App. "In Power BI, you can create `official' packaged content, then distribute it to a broad audi-
ence as an app" (Microsoft, 2023, para 1). Apps are created in Workspaces and not "My Workspace." That
might sound odd, but think of My Workspace as your personal space, whereas the intent of an app is to
publish it for a large group of people. And note that free account users cannot create a Power BI app because they can't
create a Workspace!

   As shown in Figure 7.13, there are four parts to creating an app: (1) setup, (2) content, (3) audiences, and (4) publishing
the app. This means you can develop one app that will work for more than one audience. For example, the audience
might be the entire organization, and the app would limit the content they would see. Through the app, managers might
see most content; whereas VPs might see all reports and dashboards contained in the app. As a consumer, you can filter,
highlight, and interact with the content on the app. For example, organization-wide users can't modify the contents of
the app. Licensing is important for how this works.

What Is Metrics?

                     In Power BI Services (Online) you have an option to build metrics to hold your organization accountable
                  by tracking them against key business objectives. The fundamental value of the scorecard is that others in
                  your organization are interested in the targets set. In earlier versions of Power BI Services (Online), this
was called "Goals."

Metric Example Using XCaliber Food Distribution Company

As an illustration, XCaliber Foods opened its business in 2024 intending to sell $50,000 each month. XCaliber planned to
hire nine salespeople, which meant that each salesperson would sell approximately $5,500 per month. Instead of wait-
ing until year-end to see if you are on target, you may want to set up the scorecard so that it looks at a monthly target
($600k total sales divided by 12 = $50k per month). Targets for salespeople also make sense to set up monthly. Then if
you don't make a target, you can investigate why. More likely, you may want to set targets for products, targets for sales-
persons, and targets for cultivating new customers.

   In Exhibit 7.7, the sales metric is set up for January (goal of $50,000) and individual salespeople have a monthly sales
target of $5,500. Here is the preliminary metric setup.

   Exhibit 7.7--Setting Up Metrics for XCaliber Foods for 2024 Goals

   Metrics can be manual, use submetrics (like average and sum), or connect to data.
   In a previous section, we discussed the Balanced Scorecard Framework. The following Balanced Scorecard Framework
helps us see how metrics might be used to set it up. Some of the metrics would be set up manually, and some could
connect to data. Metrics in Power BI Services (Online) would use both the measures (goals) and targets (like KPIs).

Balanced Scorecard Framework + Power BI Services (Online) Metrics

Financial: To succeed financially, how should we appear to our stakeholders?
             Objectives: increase sales
             Measures: KPIs for sales overall, KPIs for sales by salesperson,
             Targets: sales = $600k or $50k per month, salesperson target = $5.5k per month, customer sales (since only 15

          customers) = $40k per year
             Initiatives: use drop-shipping software program

   Customer: connect to vision--How should we appear to our customers?
             Objectives: deliver products as promised (within 24 hours, or as we advertise, "same-day shipping")
             Measures: KPIs for average delivery time = 1 day from order-to-ship date
             Targets: from order-to-ship date, 24 hours or less
             Initiatives: complete customer satisfaction interviews by email/phone

   Internal Business: To satisfy our stakeholders and customers, what business processes must we exceed at?
             Objectives: cost control (use correct pricing), introduce new products, word of mouth marketing
             Measures: KPIs for new products as % of sales, KPIs for new grocers

                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 341
             Targets: increase number of grocers to 25, Increase new products 15% per year
             Initiatives: incentive program for grocers, Expand to more neighboring states.
   Learning and Growth: To achieve our vision, how will we sustain our ability to change and improve?
             Objectives: able to sell to new customers
             Measures: KPIs for employee development and onboarding for upselling and consistent sales, KPIs for drop-
          shipping software exam score, customer satisfaction survey
             Targets: survey score at four out of five, drop-shipping exam score 90%
             Initiatives: buddy program, online training for remote salespeople, review and investigate customer surveys

                                To gain meaningful use for the scorecard system, users need Power BI Pro. As a student, you can
                             still create scorecards; however, they won't mean much if you can't collaborate with a team. Still, it
is worth looking at the examples provided in Figure 7.15.

What Is the Monitoring Hub in Power BI Services Online?

   Monitoring hub won't be too important to you as a new user, but as you add datasets and create more
Power BI content, you will appreciate this feature. The monitoring hub enables you to monitor your
Microsoft Fabric activities. If you have reports and dashboards connected to data that is being updated,
you will want to see that the status shows "completed" and not "failed." If you see "failed," it normally means that there
are connectivity issues!

342 | The Power of Business Intelligence
What Is a Deployment Pipeline?

                      A deployment pipeline provides "content creators with a production environment where they can col-
                   laborate to manage the lifecycle of organizational content" (Microsoft Learn, 2023, para 1). By default, there
                   are three typical stages: Development, Test, and Production. For example, software developers could use
                   the process to write, build, test, and deploy code. You may not see the deployment pipelines icon in the
menu. In My Workspace, click New, and More Options, to see the Data Pipeline in the Data Factory section. But how
would you use it?
   For an example that is easier to understand, let's look at XCaliber Food Distribution Company. Assume that a small
team is working on creating Power BI visualizations for sales data across different states and regions. The report under-
goes many changes, including new visuals and calculations, and is reorganized to improve the user experience. Dur-
ing this stage, the team uses the deployment pipeline to work collaboratively in a Workspace called development-XCal.
Once the development stage is complete, the team moves the report to the test stage. In this stage, the process allows
the team to validate the report against test data. This Workspace is called test-XCal. Once the report passes the testing
and validation process, the report is moved from the test environment to the production environment. In the produc­
tion-XCal Workspace, the report is available for consumption by end-users.
   You may be saying to yourself, "We can do all of this from the first Workspace, and you would be correct, so why use
it?" This pipeline deployment process reduces manual work, which can contain errors. Also, organizations can build in
validation that includes consistency and maintains content quality. The bad news is that you need to be a premium user!

Other Sharing Differences Between the "Free" License and the "Pro" License

When teams work together in a Workspace, it helps if collaboration is easy and intuitive. Workspaces provide roles and
allow co-ownership of content but there are some limitations. "You need a Power BI Pro license to share . . . and the
people you share it with do too" (Microsoft Learn, 2024, para 6). One of the keyways to collaborate is to embed your
Power BI report(s) in Microsoft Teams. You can use the tabs in Microsoft Teams for each Power BI report so that the
chat conversation is tied to the report. Figure 7.14 shows several sharing options: share to email, Microsoft Teams, or
PowerPoint. If you click the Teams file, you can share it with a person, group, or channel, or create an assignment. If you
click the PowerPoint file, you will see that you can embed live data in PowerPoint.

7.2 Transform (Clean) Data in Power BI Desktop

       But when is a given data set clean enough? Like a kitchen countertop, it can always be cleaner. We hit a point of
                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 345
       diminishing returns in our preparation of any data set, though, where more elbow grease and scrubbing doesn't
       yield sufficient incremental benefit to warrant the time and effort.

          --Ben Jones, Avoiding Data Pitfalls
Data produced by systems can be inconsistent, creating challenges for the analyst. Inconsistent naming conventions,
missing data points, human error at the data collection point, and the need to correct format (like a number instead
of currency) are just a few of the challenges for analysis and visualization. Power BI Desktop has the best process for
data transformation because it offers a variety of functionalities to streamline the process. This section will introduce
students to basic cleaning of data, creating a calculated column and transforming the format to a number. This step
should always be preceded by a thorough understanding of the data in table format. Every column should be investi-
gated through filtering before you "Get data" in Power BI Desktop. By mastering data transformation (cleaning) in Power
BI Desktop, you unlock the full potential of the data.

Know the Data

For this section, we will use the XCaliber Foods Excel file in Power BI Desktop and show you step-by-step how we work
through this.

   Screenshots of Power BI interface © Microsoft Corporation. Used with attribution for instructional and illustrative pur­
poses. Annotations added by the author.

   Step 1--Download the "XCaliber Foods 7.2" file. Review the XCaliber Foods Data. Don't make any changes to the Excel
file; instead, plan to do all cleaning work in Power BI Desktop. When you are done reviewing, close the Excel file.

   Did you notice the following issues in "XCaliber Foods 7.2"?

  · The column for Country has USA for every line of data.
  · The payment type should include check, cash, or credit card, but there are several blanks. You may want to keep

      these until you investigate what happened. It could be an error in entering the data, bad checks, or potential fraud.
  · There is a need to calculate delivery time. This can be done by looking at the difference between the order date

      and the ship date. This is important since XCaliber Food Distribution Company promotes same-day shipping.

Step 2--Open Power BI Desktop and Get Data
             a. From the menu, choose Get data then Excel workbook. Find the XCaliber Foods 7.2 and choose Open.

   Step 3--Clean Data
             a. The Navigator pane will open and show two tables, one named XCaliber_Foods and one called Data. It shows

          this because it was already formatted as a table. Since the table XCaliber_Foods has everything, you can just
          check this one box. Then select Transform Data. See Figure 7.18 to see this step.

b. The Power Query Editor will pop up on the screen. Every step we take in this setting will show up in the
Applied Steps box (see Figure 7.19). The first step is to remove the Country column. When you find it, highlight
this column, right-click the column, and choose Remove. Notice that the Applied Steps shows this action and
gives you the ability to cancel it.

                                                                                                                       The Power of Business Intelligence | 347

          c. The next step is to click on the main menu to Add Column in the main menu and choose Custom Column as
          shown in Figure 7.20.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.20--Add a

          d. Fill out the pop-up according to Figure 7.21. The formula starts with an equal sign and double-click the available
          columns. Essentially the formula = Shipped Date minus the Order Date will tell you the length of time. That's
          why the new column's name is Delivery.

Let's look at some examples of where you should transform data using a maxim (rule or principle) well accepted in Power
BI circles, called Roche's Maxim of Data Transformation.

What Is Roche's Maxim of Data Transformation?

Matthew Roche is a member of Power BI Customer Advisory Team (CAT) at Microsoft and a frequent speaker. He has
coined the phrase, "Data should be transformed as far upstream as possible and as far downstream as necessary" (Guy
in a Cube, 2022, 1:42).

Scenario #1--Small Company Expanding Local Locations

XYZ Rentals company purchased three retail locations that have a different point-of-sale (POS) system. XYZ's point of
sale collects data differently from the customer. XYZ's data has a column for first name and a column for last name. The
three retail locations use an older POS system that collects the entire name in one column. See Exhibit 7.9.

   Exhibit 7.9--Naming Convention Between XYZ Rentals and New Locations

   To get a full report, this inconsistency should be addressed, but where and how? According to Roche's Maxim of Data
Transformation, you should transform the data as close to the source as possible using Power Query (what was demon-
strated in this section). According to Roche's Maxim, you should implement the transformation (or calculation) in Power
Query instead of DAX. According to Matthew Roche and Patrick (Guy in a Cube), this approach means that "calculations
are applied universally, transformations remain even after a refresh of the data, refresh times are reduced, and the data
model gets simplified" (Guy in a Cube, 2022, 2:50).

                                                                                                                                                          (2024)

But what happens if you have many more data components?

Scenario #2--Large Merger With up to 1,000 Locations Across the Americas

When thousands of datasets are coming in, it doesn't make sense to change them in Power Query. Instead, clean the
datasets in the data warehouse. It is less costly than transforming it for every report or app.

Scenario #3--Large Number of Locations (Like 5,000)

In this scenario, you have a large number of datasets coming in but because the point-of-sale systems are different, you
need a solution. Although it could be handled in the data warehouse, some corporations will decide to replace the point-
of-sale system so that every location uses the same system. And some companies will decide to replace the systems in
all stores, an even costlier investment.

7.3 Create a Report in Power BI Desktop With Storytelling Techniques

       Data storytelling is about connecting the dots between data and human emotions.
          --Brent Dykes and Eric Schmidt, executive chairmen at Google

Storytelling techniques along with interactive visuals provide an environment to communicate data rather than just
inform. Multipage reports allow the developer to break up content into smaller digestible insights. Although insights and
change go together; not all audience members want change. Worse, if the visual is misunderstood or isn't compelling, it
can't overcome resistance to change.

   Some audience members may see insights as criticisms. For example, assume that the visuals include sales patterns,
and managers notice a pattern they didn't expect (i.e., inconsistent sales, no new products sold, and shipping delays).
Depending on how the insights are shared, salespeople may feel criticized.

   For the past few decades, "data has primarily been entrusted to only two privileged groups . . . an executive who
required data to manage the business; [and] a data specialist . . . who gathered, analyzed and reported the numbers for
management" (Dykes, 2019, p. 5). Data savviness is no longer confined to the privileged. Small organizations are taking
advantage of intense data analysis and finding ways to use data to communicate additional services.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 353
An Example: A Competitive Edge

An Indiana-based lawn care company arms their field employees with a full truck of products and wi-fi enabled and
connected iPads, allowing them to do more than service the lawns. With the iPad connected to company software, field
agents give estimates with a click of a button, share new procedures for a better lawn (upsell), and bill them electron-
ically. The field agent can connect to the square footage data for any lawn (even neighbors) and immediately send an
estimate to the homeowner's email. If the neighbor wants the work completed, the field agent can immediately comply,
and his schedule is adjusted automatically through the GPS on the truck. The owner receives live updates in a dashboard
containing completed jobs, square footage, new estimates, new customers, and even a product usage report for all field
agents. Compare this to an inefficient paper-based process where the lawn is serviced, but the field agent doesn't inter-
act with the homeowner, can't give an immediate bill, can't upsell existing customers with an estimate, or reach new
customers (neighbors) with an estimate.

   "In today's dynamic, fast-paced business environment, limiting information to a narrow set of executives and data
specialists no longer makes sense" (Dykes, 2022, p. 5).

   So let's talk about very specific storytelling techniques that can be used in a multipage report on Power BI Desktop.

What Is the Purpose of the Report?

To Revisit XCaliber Foods and consider the purpose of a report and how it will be shared with the organization. XCaliber
Food Distribution Company was first introduced in Chapter 4. For the initial Power BI Report, the specific purpose is to
tell a story to salespeople about sales in 2024 including XCaliber's successes and challenges for its first year of operation
and strategies to meet the current challenges to focus on future goals. But how do we tell XCaliber employees (specif-
ically the salespeople) a story to compel them to improve/change? Or should the story improve/change management
communication and leadership? A compelling story connects the way we feel, the way we think, the way we act, and the
way we behave (Gonzalez, 2023).

   The story needs to engage the audience, and the key is to develop the story and visuals through the lens of the sales-
people. Review what a good story can do to your brain. In general, good storytelling can do the following:

 1. enhance memory (dopamine),
2. synchronize experience (mirroring),
3. motivate the listener to turn the story into their own ideas (neural coupling),
4. light up the brain (cortex activity), and
5. engage the listener emotionally (narrative transport).

Use the CASS template to flush out the context. See Exhibit 7.11 for more details.
   Question 1: What should the story accomplish?
   Question 2: What do your salespeople need to know?
   Question 3: What do you want your salespeople to do?
   Question 4: What is the call to action?

Note: Author illustration (2025)
When you have a specific purpose in mind, but the report or dashboard isn't clear to the end user, you must add context!
You especially need to provide context for areas that require user interaction. Adding context is a key component of
data storytelling. Here is a partial list of data storytelling techniques. Look at Figure 7.25 to see the first page of the
multipage report.

   Figure 7.25--Page 1 of XCaliber Food Distributions Company Report

                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 355
   Note: The explanations below correspond to numbered examples in Figure 7.25.
             1. A clear title on each page that conveys the general purpose. The first page of the report is titled "XCaliber

          Sales Summary" since this page shows the revenue by month, revenue by salesperson, and revenue by state using
          a consistent theme.

             2. Navigation can be in the form of buttons that represent page navigation or bookmark navigation. Bookmark
          navigation can show a certain view in Power BI and can be tied to images or buttons. But you can also use it like
          a bookmark slideshow.

             3. High-level insights should be tied to what you want your users to focus on. In this case, the purpose is to
          reveal the highest sales by salesperson, so all the "insights" connect the salesperson to the level of sales. This step
          is completed through "smart narrative" or "narrative." It is "smart" because as you use select bars of the chart, the
          narrative will change to match the displayed chart.

             More about smart narrative: Smart narrative creates a block of text. You can choose the visual icon from the
          visualization pane, or you can right-click the visual and select "Summarize." You can add static titles to this block
          of text. This is especially helpful to support the user's understanding.

             Customize the narrative: The visual will create its own narrative, but you can customize it as well. Type a
          statement in the text box, click "Add Value" and Power BI Desktop will suggest values. Management may appre-
          ciate the aesthetic value of good visualization but may prefer you just "get to the point" and that is what a smart
          narrative can do (especially when using KPIs).

             Updates as data changes: Although focused on Power BI Desktop, the smart narrative reminds me of quick
          insights available in Power BI Services (Online). Smart narrative is dynamic; as your data updates, so does the
          narrative.

             4. Drill through and analyze are great interactive tools for the user. The user is required to right-click on the
          visual to drill through or analyze the data as shown in Figure 7.26 and 7.27.

                                                                                                                                         Smart Narrative

5. Customize Tooltips is a terrific way to provide additional information beyond the default tooltips. Look at a
customized tooltip using XCaliber Foods. XCaliber Food's Tooltip comes up when you hover over the revenue by
salesperson or revenue by state. The tooltip shows the total, but also a map (city and state) of where the salesper-
son sold the product. As you can see in this pop-up tooltip, the salesperson Nicole Pottinger sold in three states:

                                                                                                                       The Power of Business Intelligence | 357
          Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Custom tooltips can even include drill-through options! Just keep in mind that
          you would not want a pop-up that covered the entire page!

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.28--Customized

          6. Play axis is a dynamic slicer, animating other Power BI Visuals to show data or categories over time. The exam-
          ple shown on page 1 of the XCaliber Report is based on the salesperson as the driver, but shows the revenue,
          insights, and revenue by state over time by just clicking the Play button.

                                                                                     Figure 7.29--Play Axis

          7. Multipage Report is a way to organize the information to support the story. Think of it as chunking the infor-
          mation into sections.

358 | The Power of Business Intelligence
Organizing a Multipage Report in Power BI Desktop

The preliminary report is organized into five pages: an overview, product revenue, revenue trend, decomp tree, and KPI
and goals. The report is designed with key navigation so the storyteller can quickly move from one page to another.

   Page 1--XCaliber Foods: Includes a sales summary and includes navigation, revenue by month, revenue by salesper-
sons, revenue by state, smart narrative, and a play axis that animates all components through time dynamically. Figure
7.30 shows the tabs for each page.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.30--Multipage
                                                                                                                                                          Report Tabs for XCaliber
                                                                                                                                                          Foods

In Figure 7.30, you see the Tool Tip Page. This page is custom sized to provide a small pop-up effect. This page will only
be seen in edit mode. Once an app is developed and you check the box to hide this page, the audience will not see it.

   Page 2--Product Revenue: Includes navigation, revenue by product, revenue by customer, and smart narrative. As
seen in Figure 7.31, the salespeople will quickly see the top products and the smart narrative will help put the information
into perspective (for example, coffee accounts for 17.02% of sales revenue!). This allows the presenter to concentrate on
popular products and to see what customers are purchasing.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.31--Page 2 of

Page 3--Revenue Trend: Includes navigation, includes a slicer by customer name to investigate revenue by month and
revenue by state, with a map showing sales by state. As shown in Figure 7.32, the user can choose the slicer to see what
products are popular as well as know what months they were sold in. This will allow the user to see the inconsistencies
in sales. For example, if you select Corner Market in the slicer, you quickly see that although the average sales for Corner
Market are $2k, sales fluctuate a lot.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 359

Page 4--Decomp tree includes navigation and a decomp example, from the North region, to the highest category (bev-
erages), to the highest product within that category (coffee). As shown in Figure 7.33, users can investigate by changing
the filters. Users can easily see the limited categories that are leading sales. The presenter can use the decomposition
tree to break this into metrics. When the presenter is demonstrating the key metrics of sales, they can show dimensions
through the region, product categories, product name, and even add salespeople to the mix. If the presenter wants to
demonstrate supply chain data, the dimensions could be shippers, shipping methods, and delivery time (the time from
order to shipped).

You may also note that no customer survey data are visualized here. Management decided to focus on 2024 and create
a separate dashboard for survey data.

Connecting the Story to the Visuals and Data

If you go back to the CASS template (Exhibit 7.11), you will see that the main character in the story is Joe, a new sales-
person at XCaliber. Joe's early journey shows his struggle to learn the distribution software system, experiencing a lack
of motivation even though he is on commission. The less motivated he feels, the more isolated he feels. Joe's journey
changes to success when he starts participating in the weekly discussions. Experienced salespeople attend the weekly
meetings. Through these discussions, Joe learns how to sell products to his new customers. His confidence increases as
he delivers sales orders on time. He listens to his customers, and he benefits from their growing trust. Joe bonds with his
mentor and continues to participate in weekly discussions with all the salespeople. Joe feels comfortable contributing
ideas to management and confident that they will be implemented. He is invested in XCaliber and wants to contribute
to the overall goals of the company.

   Now that we have started to see how to connect a story to the data, let's take a step-by-step approach to building the
report in Power BI Desktop.

   Before we show the how, let's talk about the "why" of navigation buttons in a Power BI Report (that we can ultimately
publish from Power BI Desktop to Power BI Services [Online]). Navigation buttons work well for a presenter who wants
to visit several pages (views) in a report and may want some flexibility in how it is presented.

Mac Users Can Create Their Report Using Power BI Services Online

If you recall, Power BI Desktop only works with PCs; however, Power BI Services Online works for either system, PC or
                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 361
Mac. Recently, Microsoft has added the ability to use the Data Model, which means Mac users (or even PC users) can
create their reports directly in Power BI Services Online! The trick is to set up your Excel file within your OneDrive and
link that file instead of uploading the file. Instead of linking, Mac users can publish the Excel file directly from Excel to
Power BI. Both steps are in Section 7.1, A Word to Mac Users.

   Reminder to Open Power BI Services Online: Go to http://office.com and log in. In the main Microsoft 365 page,
choose Apps, and look for Power BI. Open it.

   Next, make sure to have your Excel file in OneDrive regardless of which method you use: the Excel Publish method or
the linking method.

The Excel Publish Method

Step 1--Open the Excel file. Use the Chapter 7 file, XCaliber Foods 7.3 Includes Delivery.
   Step 2--In Excel, choose File, Publish, and Export workbook data to Power BI.
   Step 3--Excel will show an active bar publishing. It will give a message at the top of the Excel menu that says "Work-

book exported successfully."
   Step 4--Choose Go to Power BI.
   Step 5--Type in your email address (the same one you use for your college credentials), and then click submit.
   Step 6--In the My Workspace in Power BI Services Online, see if the file is there and that the type is Semantic Model.

If you see this type as Semantic Model, you will be able to create reports and dashboards.
   Note: If you do not see the type as Semantic Model, try the Linking Method.

Linking Method

Step 1--In Power BI Services Online, choose the Create button (under Home), and then select Excel (Preview). See Figure
7.35 for details.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.35--Create,

                                                                                                                                                          (Preview) in Power BI
                                                                                                                                                          Services Online

Step 2--Choose Link to file and browse your OneDrive to find the Excel file. Use the Chapter 7 file, XCaliber Foods 7.3
Includes Delivery, and select Next.

Don't be surprised if you are required to login (again) to Office.com.
   Step 3--A pop-up Power Query window (as seen in Figure 7.37) will appear. Under the Excel Workbook folder, make

sure XCaliber_Foods and Data are both collected, and then choose Create.

You will see a screen that shows your data loading.
   Step 4--You will now see the canvas area (Figure 7.38) where you can build your five-page report. You should see the

Visualization pane and the Data pane. Use the XCaliber Foods (they both have the same data, but the data one contains
meta data).

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 363

   Now the good thing is this--the Step-by-Step instructions
given next work for either the Power BI Services Online or
the Desktop. Mac users should be able to create pages in the
Power BI Services Online. As you work on adding information
to the report. When saving the report, indicate in some way
that it was created in Power BI Services Online. For example,
we used XCaliber Using BIService as a name (see Figure 7.39).

Step 1--Open Power BI Desktop and Load File (Mac users:
skip to Step 2)

             a. Open the file you cleaned in Section 7.2. My file is called "XCaliber Foods Storytelling--Draft 2" (you may have
          given it a different name).

             b. If you didn't complete the cleaning in Section 7.2 follow these steps.
                       i. Choose File and New. You will see the Add data to your report as shown in Figure 7.40.

ii. Select Import data from Excel
   iii. Choose the file called "XCaliber Foods 7.3 includes delivery.xlsx"
   iv. Choose both tables (the red bubble number 1) as shown in Figure 7.41.

                                                                              Figure

It may be confusing to see two tables when there is only one dataset from an Excel workbook that has one sheet. The
second table is automatically generated by Power BI and represents the metadata associated with the Excel file.

                       v. Click Load as shown in Figure 7.42 (#2). You will now see the Data pane showing two tables. You can
                    ignore the metadata table. The metadata table is the one called "Data" because it shows the worksheet
                    name.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 365

Step 2--Create pages. Make tabs.
             a. At the bottom of the canvas, find the Page 1 tab. Double-click it and rename it as shown in Figure 7.43. Then

          click the + key to add a new page (tab).
                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.43--Name Pages

          b. Right-click the Tool Tip Page and choose Hide. You will see a crossed-out eye symbol.
   Step 3--Create Navigation Buttons

             a. On the main menu, choose Insert, Buttons, Navigator, then Page navigator. Power BI Desktop by default

          7.44.

          b. In the Format navigator pane, go to Pages. Toggle "Show hidden pages" to Off. See Figure 7.45 to see where the
          Format navigator pane is located.

c. The buttons are in a horizontal state (by default), and we want vertical buttons. In the Format navigator,
choose Grid layout and change orientation to vertical. Don't be alarmed when you see only slim bars with no
text. With your mouse, click the handler (#1) around the buttons and resize. Push the right side (of the 4 bars;
#2) to the left, and then pull the bars down (#3) until you see the text (see the next two figures).

                                                                                                                                            Figure 7.46--Adjust

d. Now let's add the title to this page, XCaliber Sales Summary as shown in Figure 7.48. Note, the font is Segoe UI,
size is 20, bold, and left aligned. The buttons look generic, so let's work on them next.

                                                                                                                                              Figure 7.48--Adding the

          e. Users expect certain behaviors from buttons. If we get them designed on this page, we can copy them to the
          other pages. Buttons have four states: default, hover, press, and selected. It adds a lot to the report if the buttons
          work as expected by your users. There are dozens of designs that can be used for the shape of the button. For
          now, select the button set. The handlers will be around all five buttons. In Format Navigator, go to Shape, and
          change to Pill (see Figure 7.49).

                                                                                                                                            Figure 7.49--Using
                                                                                                                                            Format Navigator to
                                                                                                                                            Change Button Shape

          f. To set the behavior of the buttons, we need to set the different states. Here are the states (default, hover, and
          selected) and what they will look like. You can change the "press" default; however, it is so quick that most users
          don't notice any effect. See Figure 7.50.

In the Format Navigator pane, do the Default state first. The items bolded in Table 7.1 represent subcategories under the
main category Visual under the Format Navigator.

   Apply all these settings to the buttons--you can do the entire button set at one time by reviewing the settings in Table
7.1.

g. Remember, Power BI shows the first button as selected as default. Now copy the button set to the Product
Revenue page, the Revenue Trend page, the Decomp Tree page, and the KPI & Goals page. You do not want to
copy it to the Tool Tip Page--we are using that page to house our pop-ups.

   Don't worry though--all the states are incorporated in this full set of buttons. If you add another page, the cor-
responding button will use the established settings.

   h. Now that we have the navigation set, let's start building the visuals and graphs for each page. It is also a suit-
able time to Save your work. Save it to your OneDrive space.

Bookmarks, Themes, and Mobile Layout Overview

Before we start the next section, review the difference between navigation buttons and bookmark navigators. A book­
mark captures a specific state of a report page. Bookmarks save the current filters and slicers, cross-highlighted visuals,
sort order, or my favorite bookmark, which clears all the filters so I'm back to my default dashboard. If you have a collec-
tion of bookmarks, you can even set up a slide show. There are all kinds of things you can do with bookmarks, including
a visual table of contents, and bookmarks to turn on a color palette that works for people who are color-blind. You can
even set up an overlay to add more commentary, although this is a more advanced skill. If your story needs commentary,
try the overlay trick featured in the YouTube video from Sweatpants BI (2022).

        Step-by-Step to Add Visuals to Page 1 of a Power BI Desktop Report

Step 1--Start with page one (see Figure 7.52 for the completed design). This page has six components: (1) Revenue by
Month, (2) Revenue by Salesperson, (3) Revenue by State, (4) the pop-up that comes up when hovering over either Rev-
enue by State or Revenue by Salesperson, (5) the Insights, and (6) the Play axis.

          c. In the Visualization pane, choose Format (paint brush), then General, then Title. Remove "Sum of" so the title
          of the chart will be Revenue by Month.

             d. Next, let's format the y-axis. In the Visualization pane, choose Format (paint brush), then Visual, then
          choose the y-axis and expand it. Choose Title, and type in Revenue (you just type right over the "Auto" in the text
          box). Now the y-axis says Revenue and not Sum of Revenue. Make any other format changes you desire (bold,
          font size, etc.)

             e. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,
          and in Visual border, select On, then change the color to blue.
   Make sure to click out of the chart before you select the next visualization.

          For the Revenue by Salesperson
             a. Click on the blank canvas. In the Visualization pane, choose the stacked bar chart. Reposition as needed.
             b. In the Data pane, choose Salesperson for the y-axis and Revenue for the x-axis.
             c. Let's remove "Sum of Revenue" in the X-Axis Title by turning off the Title, or you can just choose to say Rev­

          enue.
             d. Instead of Sum of Revenue by Salesperson, let's just use Revenue by Salesperson. In the Visualization pane,

          choose General, then Title and remove the "Sum of."
             e. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,

          and in Visual border, select on, then change the color to blue.

          For the Revenue by State
             a. Click on the blank canvas. In the visualization pane, choose the stacked bar chart. Reposition as needed but

          have it on the far right.
             b. In the Data pane, choose State for the y-axis and Revenue for the x-axis.
             c. Let's remove "Sum of Revenue" in the X-Axis Title, by turning off the Title or you can just choose to say Rev­

          enue.
             d. Instead of Sum of Revenue by Salesperson, let's just use Revenue by Salesperson. In the Visualization pane,

          choose General, then Title and remove the "Sum of."
             e. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,

          and in Visual border, select on, then change the color to blue.

               For the Pop-Up Custom Tool Tip
   Power BI Desktop visualization has tool tips turned on by default; however, the default tool tips don't add much value
since they replicate the data. Custom tool tips can add value and context as well as support better storytelling.

             a. First of all, we already have a separate page in our report that we named Tool Tip Page, and we hid it from
          view. Go to this page. In the main menu, choose View, in Page View, choose Actual size.

                                                                                                                                            Figure 7.55--Custom

       b. Next, in the Visualization pane, click the Format (paint brush). Expand the Page infor­
       mation. You should see "Tool Tip Page" since we have already named the page. Toggle the
       button to On for Allow use as tooltip (see below). Next, expand Canvas Settings, Choose
       Tooltip, and customize the height to 240 px and width to 320 px with vertical alignment
       set at top. Next, in the Visualization pane, with the tooltip already selected, choose a card
       visualization, and in the Data pane, choose Revenue. The card might be too large, so use the Format (paint brush),
       choose values, and adjust the size. Figure 7.56 shows the results. But we still need some additional features to
       add context.

          We have a way to go to make this worthy of being called customized!
          c. Next, let's remove the "Sum of Revenue." Click on the handlers around the 510.33k and choose Format (paint-

       brush). Under Visual, turn the Category label Off.
          d. Let's add some context by adding a map. In the Visualization pane, choose the Filled Map, then on the Data

       pane, choose Revenue and State. You may need to adjust the map, so it shows only the United States. It should
       look like Figure 7.57.

          products. And if you hover over Revenue by State bars, you will see which city and state. The dollar amount will
          automatically change too!

               Insights
   Insights can be customized but it is a great feature using the default visualization.

             a. Make sure you are in a blank spot on the canvas of the XCaliber Foods page. On the
          Visualization pane, select Smart narrative. The component may take up more space than
          you expected, but you can use the handlers to resize it. Just FYI, you can set up the smart
          narrative as a tool tip!

             Once resized, add a title to the top. I called this INSIGHTS. The insights shown are based
          on the chart showing Revenue by Month. But we can add insights to Revenue by Salesper-
          son. Feel free to add a border and change the size of the font.

             b. Select the Revenue by Salesperson chart. Then in the Format (paintbrush), choose
          General, Header Icons, then expand Icons. In Icons, toggle the Smart narrative to On. You
          will now see a Smart Narrative icon in the top right of the chart (see the red arrow in Figure 7.58).

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.58--XCaliber

            Add a Play Axis for Time Series Analysis
   A play axis is a fairly new visualization available in Power BI (at least new to me). It reminds me of audio controls.

             a. Find a blank spot in the canvas, and in the Visualization pane, choose the Play Axis visualization. It will
          show up in an unexpected space ready for a field (shown in Figure 7.59). Drag it down to the spot we have under
          Insights and resize it as needed.

             b. Next, it requires a field to make this work. In this case, drag the field Salesperson. You can add a border. For-
          mat (paintbrush), General, and then Effects. Expand effects, and in Visual border, select On, and change color to
          blue.

          c. Try the speed--push the play button. To slow down the speed, Format (paintbrush), Visual, Animation Set­
          tings, and change the time to 2000 ms. (As an aside, we are not convinced that this is practical for every dash-
          board, but it might have a place if your eyes were focused on only one component.)

      Revenue by Product Name
             a. Note, you should see the navigation buttons and the Product Revenue will be in the selected state.
             b. Start by clicking in the middle of the canvas, and then the clustered bar chart in the Visualization pane.

          Reposition as necessary.
             c. In the Data pane, drag the Product Name to the y-axis and drag the Revenue to the x-axis.
             d. In the Visualization pane, choose Format (paintbrush), then General, then Title. Remove the "Sum of" so the

          title of the chart will be Revenue by Month.
             e. Next, let's format the x-axis. In the Visualization pane, choose Format (paintbrush), then Visual, then choose

          the X-Axis and expand it. Choose Title, and type in Revenue (you just type right over the "Auto" in the text box).
          Now the x-axis says Revenue and not Sum of Revenue. Make any other format changes you desire (bold, font size,
          etc.)

             f. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,
          and in Visual border, select On, then change the color to blue.

             g. Add a title to this page, by adding a text box. We used the title: XCaliber Sales Summary, at 20-point font
          and bold. However, you might want to name this page XCaliber Product and Customers if it fits your storytelling
          better.
   Make sure to click out of the chart before you select the next visualization.
          Smart Narrative Based on Revenue by Product Name

376 | The Power of Business Intelligence
   Insights can be customized but we are demonstrating the default visualization.
             a. Make sure you are in a blank spot on the canvas of Product Revenue page 2. On the

          Visualization pane, select Smart narrative. The component may take up more space than
          you expected, but you can use the handlers to resize it. Once resized, feel free to add a title
          to the top, like the word INSIGHTS. The insights shown are based on the chart showing
          Revenue by Product Name. Feel free to add a border and change the size of the font.
          Revenue by Customer Name

             a. Click on the blank canvas. In the Visualization pane, choose the stacked column chart.
          Reposition as needed.

             b. In the Data pane, choose Customer Name for the x-axis and Revenue for the y-axis.
             c. Let's remove "Sum of Revenue" in the Y-Axis Title; by turning off the Title (we need the room, so removing
          the title is the best option).
             d. Instead of "Sum of Revenue by Customer Name," let's just use "Revenue by Customer Name." In the Visual­
          ization pane, choose General, then Title and remove the "Sum of."
             e. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,
          and in Visual border, select On, then change the color to blue.

   This same graph is used on page 1--please review the steps--they are the same until we add the average goal line, cen-
ter the graph heading, and add some data labels.

             a. In the Visualization pane, right of the Format (paintbrush), choose the magnifying glass as seen in Figure
          7.62.

                                                                                 Figure 7.62--Add Further

                                               Average Sales

          b. Once you select the magnifying glass, look for the average line. Note all the types of lines we could use here:
          constant line, min line, max line, average line, median line, percentile line, and error bars. Expand the average
          line and add a line. We named it Average Sales. Notice you can add multiple lines.

             c. Next, change the color of the line. In the line feature, change the color to red.
             d. Because it was somewhat crowded, we turned on data labels, turned off the y-axis title, and turned off values
          on the y-axis.
             e. To make the data label stand out, under Value, change the font to size 10 and bold.
   Just as a note: The average sales line is calculated as $42,527 ($510,326/12 months) and this line makes sense when
your chart shows total sales. This line will not change even if you choose revenue by product name; however, it does
reinforce the trend of inconsistent sales. It also gives the user some insight into the inconsistency of even the best sales
product, coffee, as shown in Figure 7.64. Notice that it tells the user to "Right-click to drill through," adding another layer
of analysis.

       Revenue by Product Name
   This is the exact same chart as the one shown on Product Revenue but using a stacked column chart instead of a
clustered bar chart.
   Other differences: added data label and made font large and bold. Turned off values for the y-axis and removed the
title, Sum of Revenue, by toggling the Title to Off.

          Slicer Based on Customer Name
   The slicer is based on the15 customers. One of the goals of the owner is to expand the number of customers and
expand the number of states where the product is shipped. This slicer makes it easy to see where the customer is located
and one what product they are purchasing. The slicer can work for a single customer or multiple customers. Here is an
example of how well you can get to know your customers.

             a. Click in a blank space on the Canvas. Then in the Visualization pane, choose the Slicer and reposition the
          slicer to the right of the Revenue by Month chart.

             b. Drag the Customer Name to the Slicer.
             c. Resize so that all the customers show in the slicer. Add a blue visual border.
   In Figure 7.65, the customer, Corner Market purchased three products: beer, fruit cocktail, and chocolate. If you look
at the revenue by month the revenue by month is quite inconsistent. In fact, there are no sales in February.

To interpret the Decomposition Tree, notice it shows the highest sales for the region (the North), shows the highest
sales categories (beverages, sauces, dairy products, and so on), and the specific product names under the categories. If
you click on the bar for the East region, you will see the highest sales categories and products.

          a. Note, you should see the navigation buttons, but you may need to add the title, XCaliber Sales Summary. If you
          need to add a title, click Insert, Text Box, and type the title with a 20 bold point font.

             b. Next, click in the middle of the canvas, then choose Decomposition Tree in the Visualization pane.
             c. Resize so the container takes up most of the space.
             d. In the Data pane, select Revenue and Region. Note that a bar appears with a plus at the right side of the bar
          as shown in Figure 7.67. You have choices of high value, low value, category, or region.

      Revenue by Month
             a. Start by clicking in the middle of the canvas, and then the line chart in the Visualization pane. Reposition as

          necessary.
             b. In the Data pane, drag the Order Date to the x-axis keeping only the Month. Then drag Revenue to the y-

          axis.
             c. In the Visualization pane, choose Format (paint brush), then General, then Title. Remove the "Sum of" so

          the title of the chart will be Revenue by Month. If you prefer, feel free to center the title.
             d. Next, let's format the y-axis. In the Visualization pane, choose Format (paint brush), then Visual, then

          choose the Y-Axis and expand it. Choose Title, and type in Revenue (you just type right over the "Auto" in the
          text box). Now the y-axis says Revenue and not Sum of Revenue. Make any other format changes you desire (bold,
          font size, etc.)

             e. To add an average line, the Visualization pane, then the magnifying glass. Go to the Average line, add a
          line, and name it Average Sales. If you desire, choose Data label, turn it On, and Choose the name to show (you
          can show both the name and the amount). We chose a different color to represent the average sales as shown in
          Figure 7.70.

                                                                                                                                                          Revenue by Month Chart

The average sales line is a good indicator for the food business. We expect revenue trends to be influenced by season-
ality, economic conditions, and availability of fresh produce. An average line ($510,326/12 = $42,527) will directly show
when sales are above or below average. In 2024, the sales goal was $600,000 for the year (or $50,000 per month). As you
can see, XCaliber did not reach that goal in most months.

   Some users will want to see a trend line, but not all charts will allow a trend line. If you don't see a Trend line selection
when you select the magnifying glass, it may be because you have the wrong chart, or you have your date hierarchy set
up incorrectly.

             f. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,
          and in Visual border, select On, then change the color to blue.

             g. While on this page, add the title, XCaliber Sales Summary. Or you may prefer a different title.
   Make sure to click out of the chart before you select the next visualization.

          Revenue by Customer
   This same graph was used on page two, but we want to keep some of the axis titles.

             a. Click on the blank canvas. In the Visualization pane, choose the stacked column chart. Reposition as
          needed.

             b. In the Data pane, choose Customer Name for the x-axis and Revenue for the y-axis.
             c. Let's remove "Sum of Revenue" in the Y-Axis Title, by typing Revenue in the Title section.
             d. Instead of Sum of Revenue by Customer Name, let's just use Revenue by Customer Name. In the Visualiza­
          tion pane, choose General, then Title and remove the "Sum of."
             e. To add a blue border, in the Visualization pane, choose Format, General, and then Effects. Expand effects,
          and in Visual border, select On, then change the color to blue.
   Make sure to click out of the chart before you select the next visualization.

          Revenue by Payment Type
   This chart shows how customers paid for their orders. What is interesting is that we have credit cards, checks, and
cash, as expected. However, we also see a small portion of sales that don't show payment of any kind--they are just blank.
Are these uncollected, bad checks, or overlooked?

             a. Click in a blank space on the canvas. Then in the Visualization pane, choose the pie chart. Resize as
          needed--this should fit nicely under the Revenue by Customer Name.

             b. In the Data pane, choose Payment and Revenue.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 385

             d. To add a border, choose Format (paintbrush), General, Effects, toggle Visual Border on, and choose a blue
          color.
   Make sure to click out of the chart before you select the next visualization.

               KPI Card--Actual Revenue Compared to Target
             a. Click on a blank space of the canvas. In the Visualization pane, choose the KPI card. Reposition so it is to
          the right of the Revenue by Payment Type.
             b. Next, we will write a little DAX code. Don't worry--we will take it step-by-step. In the main menu ribbon, go
          to the Home tab and choose New measure (see Figure 7.71).

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.71--New

          c. A pop-up (see Figure 7.72) will show a place to type. You will see 1 Measure = but type over the Measure and
          type Year_Target = 600000 and complete the format to currency. The Name should be Year_Target. The home
          table is XCaliber Foods.

          You are setting up your KPI to show the target sales for 2024, which were $600,000.
             Once you are done, select the checkbox to commit to this expression. It should look like Figure 7.73.

e. Add a title: Choose Format (paintbrush), General, Title, and type this text: 2024 Actual Revenue Compared to
Target. Make it a heading two and bold and change the font size to 16. This replaces "Sum of Revenue by Year."

   Figure 7.75 shows the default look. We want the title text to be on two lines, and the 510.33k to be in orange
instead of red. Also, the colored block is distracting. Before we get rid of the red block, change the "bad color" to
orange.

   f. To do this, go to Format (paintbrush), Visual, and expand the Trend axis. Replace the current "bad color" of
red with orange. This should change the text color to orange and even the color block has a paler color of orange.

   g. Now toggle the Trend axis to Off. It will keep the orange text, but the color block is gone!
   h. The Goal of $600k should be bold and larger. Go to Format (paintbrush), Visual expand Target Label, choose
Values, and change the font size to 15, Bold.
   i. The only thing left is to add a blue border. To do this Format (paintbrush), General, Effects, Visual Border,
and change the color to blue.

             a. Click on a blank space on the canvas. In the Visualization pane, choose the card (not the KPI card, just card).
          Reposition so it is under the navigation buttons.

             b. Next, we will write a little DAX code. Don't worry--we will take it step-by-step. We want a KPI that shows
          what the goal would be for 15 customers in order to reach $600k per year: ($600,000/15) = $40k. In the main
          menu ribbon, go to the Home tab and choose New measure.

             c. In the pop-up menu, replace Measures with "Customer_Target = 40000". It will look like Figure 7.76. Make
          sure you have Currency in the Format and that the Home table is XCaliber_Foods. Once you feel you have it
          completed, click the check mark to "commit." Verify that you see it in your Data pane.

          Figure 7.77.

                                                                     Figure 7.77--Using a
                                                                     Card to Emphasize
                                                                     Information

          e. To turn the text color to orange, go to Format (paintbrush), Visual, and expand Callout Value. Change the color
          to orange. In the Category label, bold the text Customer_Target.

             f. To add a title, Format (paintbrush), General, and Title. Toggle the Title to On. Expand the Title and type
          "2024 Goal per Customer." Align the title for the center.

             g. The only thing left is to add a blue border. To do this Format (paintbrush), General, Effects, Visual Border,
          and change the color to blue.

               Gauge Visual of 2024 Sales Goal
   This visual is somewhat of a duplicate of the 2024 target revenue of $600,000. It does give a slightly different perspec-
tive.

             a. Click on a blank space on the Canvas. Then in the Visualization pane, choose the gauge visual. Reposition as
          needed.

             b. In the Data pane, select Revenue for the Value and Year_Target (this is the DAX expression that you wrote
          earlier) as the Target Value. It should look like Figure 7.78.

          c. We have two things left to do on this visual. We want a title, 2024 Revenue and Year Target (remove Sum of)
          to be centered. Go to Format (paintbrush), General, expand Title. In the text box, type 2024 Revenue and Year
          Target, and center it.

             d. We also want a blue border. To do this Format (paintbrush), General, Effects, Visual Border, and change the
          color to blue.
   Now that you have KPI & Goals page completed, work to reposition the visuals to use the space well.
   Note: If you have been working along with your Mac, you do not need to publish to Power BI Services Online (because
you've been working live in it). Just make sure to save your report.

7.4 Publish to Power BI Services Online

       Data is a tool for enhancing intuition.
          --Hilary Mason, data scientist and founder of Fast Forward Labs

In the last section, you created a five-page report in Power BI Desktop. And it truly looks great! Mac users created their
report directly in Power BI Services Online. Mac users can skip this part and go to the next section, Get Quick Insights.
But how do PC users using Power BI Desktop get their report to Power BI Services Online? Some of what you can expe-
rience is limited if you have a free Power BI Services Online account and not a Pro account.

   Power BI Services Online provides an array of features for data visualization, exploration, and collaboration. One par-
ticularly powerful feature is Quick Insights, which allows users to uncover hidden gems within their data effortlessly. By
simply interacting with dashboard tiles, analysts can access automatic analyses that reveal correlations, outliers, trends,
seasonality, change points, and major factors. Only Power BI Services Online has Quick Insights; Power BI Desktop does
not.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 389

Notice that Power BI Services Online is already reminding you to Get Quick Insights!

Get Quick Insights

In My Workspace, two files are published from Power BI Desktop: a Report, and a Semantic model. If you click on the
ellipses [the 3 dots] beside the name, lots of features are available. Note that one of the features is "Quick Insights."

   The quick insights come in the form of charts. Just for this assignment, Power BI Services (Online) generated over 40
charts. Let's define some of the terms used, and then we will look at an example of different types of insights from the
XCaliber Food Distribution Company dataset.

   Some Quick Insights Categories:
   Category outliers: "Highlights cases where one or two categories have larger values than other categories" (Microsoft
Learn, 2024, para. 10).
   Change points in a time series: "Highlights when there are significant changes in trends in a time series of data"
(Microsoft Learn, 2024, para. 11).
   Correlation: "Detects cases where multiple measures show a similar pattern or trend when plotted against a category
or value in the semantic model" (Microsoft Learn, 2024, para. 12).
   Low Variance: "Detects cases where data points for a dimension aren't far from the mean, so the variance is low"
(Microsoft, 2024, para. 13).
   Majority (Major factors): "Finds cases where most of a total value can be attributed to a single factor when broken
down by another" (Microsoft Learn, 2024, para. 14).
   Outliers: "Outliers detect when there are specific categories with values significantly different than the other cate-
gories" (Microsoft Learn, 2024, para. 15).
   Time Series (Overall trends or seasonality): These detect patterns in a time series.
   We can also View insights on a single dashboard tile. But we first need to get you to create a dashboard!
   Category Outlier: One of the quick insights (see Figure 7.84) shows the category "Beverages," as the highest category
sold in the North. Beverages count for the top selling category in the North Region ($65k), South Region ($35k), and West
Region (30k). But beverages come in last in the East Region, selling only $2k total.
   Figure 7.84--Category Outlier: From Quick Insights

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 393
   Correlation: Shows a similar pattern or trend.
   Figure 7.85 shows that there is a correlation between average sales by customer for the product shipped to Milwaukee.
In other words, the grocers tend to place the same order over and over with little to no fluctuation in unit price charged
for the product.
   Figure 7.85--Correlation: From Quick Insights

394 | The Power of Business Intelligence
   Low Variance: Detects when variance is low. But what does that mean? Look at an example. In Figure 7.86, we see that
salespeople Thomas Webster, Naomi Shopker, and Nicole Pottinger use the same (or nearly the same) unit price for dairy
products. This is a good thing as long as the unit price for the dairy reflects what it should be charged to customers. If
XCaliber's unit price for dairy went up, but the sales agents used an old price, it will impact XCaliber's profits.

   Figure 7.86--Low Variance: From Quick Insights

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 395
   Majority: Provides insights that we might not even be looking for.
   Figure 7.87 shows a majority from the XCaliber Food Distribution Company dataset. This chart tells us that the majority
of shipping in the East region is done by shipper, Urban Grocer. Why is it important to know who is shipping your prod-
uct? There can be several reasons to know members of your supply chain. Shipping Urban may be a consistent and
reliable shipping company. They also might be a good place to see if they are delivering to other grocers to potentially
recruit a new customer!
   Figure 7.87--Majority: From Quick Insights

396 | The Power of Business Intelligence
   Outliers: What does it mean?
   Figure 7.88 shows one of the outliers noted in quick insights. We can click on the orange dots (outliers) for more infor-
mation. After digging into the orders on March 4, June 4, and December 4, we discover Tony Clear (ranked third in sales)
is responsible for all three of these anomalies as seen in Figure 7.86. Tony sold some very expensive products, driving up
the average unit sales for the order to his customer, Neighborhood Grocery. This is truly an example of upselling!
   Figure 7.88--Outliers: From Quick Insights

                                                                                                                                   The Power of Business Intelligence | 397
Pin Quick Insights to a Dashboard

If you look at the visuals shown here, notice that each one has a pushpin image in the upper right-hand corner. This
is how you pin the visual to a dashboard. Let's create a dashboard that shows only the quick insights and set up a few
"tiles" to see if Power BI Services (Online) detects additional insights. So far, we have worked with a five-page report. A
dashboard is a single page where we can pin items from our five-page report or pin items from the quick insights. Tiles
refer to a single visualization snapshot of your data. Tiles can come from reports, but also the Q&A box. Dashboards can
only be created in Power BI Services (Online) and not Power BI Desktop.

        Step-by-Step to Pin Quick Insights to a Dashboard

Step 1--Open Power BI Services (Online) (as a reminder, go to Office.com and log in, choose apps, find Power BI)
   Step 2--Get quick insights (go to your My Workspace), find the report and semantic model that you published to

Power BI Services Online, click on the three dots (ellipses), and choose Quick insights.
   Step 3--Find the category outlier shared earlier in Figure 7.86 and click the pushpin in the upper right-hand corner.

In the pop-up, choose New dashboard, and name it XCaliber Quick Insights and then click Pin. The pop-up is shown in
Figure 7.89.

Step 4--Pin all five of the quick insights shown in this section. Instead of a new dashboard, choose the existing dash-
board, and XCaliber Quick Insights. Figure 7.90 shows how this will look once you have an existing dashboard.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.90--Pinning to
                                                                                                                                                          an Existing Dashboard

Step 5--Choose My Workspace and look for your dashboard, and then open it by selecting the name, XCaliber Quick
Insights. Notice in the type, it indicates a "Dashboard."

   Step 6--When you open the dashboard, notice that the visuals are not organized well, with no context or title. You
should also notice that by default, Power BI Services Online has added a Q&A component. This is what it should look like
as shown in Figure 7.91. Note that you can edit the dashboard but let's do some exploring.

                                                                                                                                  The Power of Business Intelligence | 399

                                                                                                                                  Quick Insights Pinned to
                                                                                                                                  Dashboard

Step 7--Explore the Q&A by clicking "Ask a question about your data," and Power BI Services Online will provide some
examples to get started, or you can choose to type your own question. Note in Exhibit 7.14 that the textbox will try to
anticipate your question.

                                                                                                                                                          Exhibit 7.14--Q&A, Write
                                                                                                                                                          Your Questions

Step 8--Edit the Dashboard, by clicking the edit button. You have a choice of (1) Add a tile, (2) Create a dashboard theme,
or (3) Develop a mobile layout.

             a. Choose Dashboard Theme and choose Dark and then save. We want to make sure when we build a dashboard
          from our report, that we differentiate it from the quick insights. Figure 7.92 shows the Dark theme.

   Next, we'll highlight the difference between reports and dashboards.

7.5 Dashboards Versus Reports in Power BI Services Online

       Dashboard: "A single page, sometimes referred to as a canvas, that tells a narrative using visuals. A well-designed
       dashboard simply includes the story's highlights on one page so that readers may explore related reports for
       further information."

          --Microsoft, "A Power BI Dashboard--What Is It?"
Power BI Services Online can have both dashboards and reports. Power BI Desktop can only create reports. In January
2024, Microsoft added Copilot, a smart narrative feature that is Microsoft's new Artificial Intelligence. To work, Copilot
requires you to connect your Power BI Desktop to a live connection in Power BI Services and connect to a semantic
model in Workspace. Those holding Free accounts or Pro accounts won't be able to use Copilot (at least at this time).

   If you plan to upgrade from a Free account to Premium, you may want to check this out. If you follow the steps to be
able to use Copilot within Power BI Desktop, you will see something different when you choose Smart Narrative; you
will see a button for Copilot and a pane that includes a place to chat. Based on your prompts, it can create a bulleted
list of insights, summarize the visuals on the page, but my favorite is an executive summary of the report. Even more
fascinating is that you can ask it to suggest content for the report. Although the following video is a sales pitch, it does
show the Copilot potential (this video is less than two minutes in length).

   There are fundamental differences between dashboards and reports as outlined in Table 7.2. Dashboards give an
overview of key metrics for real-time (or nearly real-time) monitoring. Reports are comprehensive and support interac-
tive analysis capabilities for exploration.

   Both the story and the type of user drive whether you use a dashboard or a report. For example, the owner of XCaliber
Food Distribution Company will want a report. The report will be much more effective for the owner because he is still
struggling to know what questions he should ask. One analogy is this: A dashboard supplies a headline and key metrics
to monitor. A report provides details with the ability to dive deeper into the data.

   "The bigger the insight is, the more disruptive it will be to the status quo" (Dykes, 2020, p. 3). Apply the seven principles
for better visual storytelling by asking yourself these questions.

 1. Is this the right data?
2. Are these visuals the right ones?
3. Are they visuals in the right configuration?
4. Did you remove the noise or distraction?
5. Does your design focus the audience's attention?
6. Does your design make it more approachable?
 7. Does your design instill trust? (Dykes, 2020)

If it helps, deconstruct your story and review the data storytelling arc. And remember to use what works well for you!
So dashboard or report? Answer: It depends!

   Table 7.2: Dashboard or Report?

Dashboards                                         Reports

Consolidated view (one single page) emphasizing    Comprehensive Analysis offering in-depth analysis and insights with multiple
key metrics and high-level insights.               pages (remember the tabs?)

Real-time or nearly real-time monitoring and       Real-time interactivity with drill-through, filtering, and highlighting (through
limited interactivity                              focus)

Visuals are primarily charts, graphs, gauges, and  Visuals can include charts, graphs, gauges, and cards. Also, smart narrative,
cards.                                             focus, and customized tooltips are used to bring context.

High overview of business performance.             Structured so the user can customize visualization and peel back layers of
                                                   complexity.

An XCaliber salesperson might prefer a dashboard that is focused on their sales (against goals), their products, customer
trends, and delivery metrics. Let's create a dashboard for Anny Kolb. Keep in mind that you can pin to this dashboard
from more than one report as long as the reports are within the same Workspace. The Kolb dashboard as shown in Fig-
ure 7.94, has five components. Let's look at what Anny Kolb, top salesperson for XCaliber Food Distribution Company
will see.

         The first chart is revenue by month for Anny Kolb, which includes Anny's average sales line. Fluctuation is
expected since produce availability can vary; however, the owner might want to see if all sales patterns vary in the same
way.

          The second tile is a map showing that Anny sells in Tennessee and Florida. If Anny is considering expanding to
other states, it makes sense that she should recruit new customers from adjoining states.

404 | The Power of Business Intelligence
          The next chart features the products sold by Anny. Anny's number one product is coffee, followed by crabmeat,
and curry sauce. Interesting that we see a category called Blank. That might be a talking point with Anny.

            The fourth tiles are both gauges. One tile shows the overall sales for 2024 against the $600k goal. The second
one shows Anny selling $114.39k in total. What target sales should we expect from Anny?

            The fifth set of tiles shows Anny's three customers: Quick Stop Grocery, Friendly Foods, and Sunny Market. This
is interesting that Anny sells to three customers since XCaliber only sells to 15 customers in total from nine sales agents.
It is also interesting that Anny does not sell coffee to Sunny Market. That might be a second talking point with Anny.

   Keep in mind that there are several other key components we might want to add. For example, what is her average
delivery time between the order date and shipped date?

        Step-by-Step to Create a Dashboard for a Sales Representative From XCaliber
Reports

Once you create your report in Power BI Desktop and publish it to Power BI Services Online, you are ready to "pin" com-
ponents to a dashboard for Anny. The same is true for Mac users who created the report directly in Power BI Services
Online.

   Step 1--Open the report that you published. My most recent one is called XCaliber Foods Storytelling--Draft 2 or if on
a Mac, you may have saved the report as XCaliber Using BIService. You will notice that the report in Power BI Services
Online has added the tabs to the left side or you can use the buttons you created to navigate.

                                                                                                                                                          Exhibit 7.18--XCaliber
                                                                                                                                                          Foods
                                                                                                                                                          Storytelling--Draft 2
                                                                                                                                                          Report in Power BI
                                                                                                                                                          Services Online

When you published the five-page report from Power BI Desktop to Power BI Services online, it created two files: the
report and the semantic model. The XCaliber Foods Storytelling--Draft 2 was published from the Power BI Desktop. The
XCaliber Using BIService was created directly in Power BI Services Online.

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.95--Semantic
                                                                                                                                                          Model and Report Files

406 | The Power of Business Intelligence
It's important to know this because you may want to add a sixth page to your report that focuses more on salespeople.
If you open the Semantic model, when you go to Edit, you will have access to the Visualization pane, and the Data pane,
and you will be able to create new measures writing DAX. This means you can use Power BI Services Online much like
you did Power BI Desktop. You can pin items from your report.

   Step 2--Pin Information about Anny Kolb to a New Dashboard. In page one, click Anny Kolb in Revenue by Salesper­
son to filter so her sales show up in the Revenue by Month (as shown in Figure 7.96).

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.96--XCaliber
                                                                                                                                                          Page One: Filtering to
                                                                                                                                                          Anny Kolb

Step 3--In the Revenue by Month, click on the pushpin in the upper right-hand side of the graphic. A pop-up will ask
you where you want to pin the visual. Create a new dashboard called Anny Kolb and choose Pin (see Figure 7.97).

                                                                                                                                                          Figure 7.97--Pin the
                                                                                                                                                          Revenue by Month
                                                                                                                                                          (Filtered) to Anny's
                                                                                                                                                          Dashboard

Step 4--Go to Revenue Trend tab, and in the Customer Name Slicer, choose Friendly Foods, Quick Stop Grocery, and
Sunny Market (hold the control key down to choose multiple customers). These are Anny's customers. Notice this Rev-
enue by Month chart with the average sales line. Pin, Revenue by Month, Revenue by Product Name and Revenue by
State once they are filtered with Anny's customers. Don't worry that we have already pinned a Revenue by Month. You
can delete the one you don't like.

   Step 5--Go to Anny's Dashboard in your MySpace and open it. Notice that you can move and resize the tiles.
   Step 6--If you click on Edit, you can add a tile (web content, image, text box, or video, and real-time data streaming).
You can change the dashboard theme. And you can see and modify the mobile layout.
   Exhibit 7.19 shows the Anny Kolb Dashboard in mobile layout. You can edit the mobile layout by unpinning tiles, chang-
ing the order of the tiles, and resizing images.

7.6 Finding Datasets to Use in Power BI Desktop

       There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much infor­
       mation is now created every two days.

          --Eric Schmidt, executive chairman at Google
According to a report by Markets and Markets, the "big data market will be worth $229.4 billion in 2025" (PR Newswire,
2020, Mar 13, para 1). In addition to the market of data, we expect to see governments, nonprofits, NPOs, and for-
profit institutions share a greater access to data especially in the health field. In Microsoft's blog, A Cloud for Global
Good, Microsoft recommends policy, noting a lack of international framework. Cross-border cooperation in the cloud
is needed to protect public safety, yet a fine line exists between law enforcement and public trust. Part of the push
for increased governmental public datasets is a push for transparency. As of Jan 2024, 280,601 datasets are available at
Data.gov!

Chapter 7 Summary

This chapter explored the dynamic landscape of data visualizations and analysis through the lens of Power BI Suite (both
Power BI Desktop and Power BI Services Online). The chapter begins by outlining the key features offered through the
Power BI Suite by transforming raw data into insightful visualizations that use data storytelling techniques to support
informed decision-making.

   This chapter included the process of downloading Power BI Desktop for PC users, and alternative instructions for Mac
users. Power BI Desktop serves as a central hub for data transformation and visualization; however, Mac users can get
a similar experience working with the Power BI Services Online. Care was taken to show the examples as seen by read-
ers who only have a free license option, with additional demonstrations for readers who have the Pro license In Power
BI Services online, Workspaces and the personal workspace (My Workspace) were introduced and explained. Central to
the Power BI experience is the comprehension of semantic models, which establish the framework for organizing and
understanding data relationships.

   The chapter demonstrated a step-by-step development of a five-page report, showcasing techniques for seamless
navigation and the integration of storytelling elements. From interactive visuals to smart narratives, readers learn how
to leverage a variety of tools including decomp trees, slicers, and quick insights.

   In the realm of dashboard creation, the distinction between a report and a dashboard was introduced along with how
key metrics can be included to support decision-making. Users are directed to pin charts and visuals to dashboards and
to personalize the display tailored to specific audiences. Through comprehensive exploration and hands-on practice,

Chapter 7 Case: Power BI Report and Dashboards

                    XCaliber Foods was established late in 2023 although the business started in 2024. The company distrib-
                    utes food items to 12 states. In 2024, the company sold $510,326 worth of products (if you recall, you used
                    XCaliber Foods in Chapter 4 working with Excel Dashboards).

                       Use the following Excel file: "XCaliber
                    Foods 7.3 includes delivery.xlsx"
   XCaliber Food Distribution company includes the follow-
ing key points:

· all employees are remote

· nine salespeople

· operated in 12 states

· actual sales were $510,326, and the sales goal for 2024

was $600,000

· goal for 2025 is $720,000 (or $60k per month)

· 15 customers in 2024; need more customers to suc-

ceed                                                       Note: Author illustration (2025)

· issues with delivery (should be 24 hours or less

between order placed and order sent to shipping)

· 14 categories of product (24 total products)

· top five products: coffee, curry sauce, marmalade, mozzarella, and crabmeat

· top three salespeople: Anny Kolb, Nicole Pottinger, and Tony Clear

· There is a concern that not all items were paid for (review revenue by payment type and you will see products not

paid--it shows blank).

· A survey was conducted that showed customers wanted more frequent contact, adherence to delivery promise of

one-day order to shipping, and an expanded product line, specifically more craft beer.

8. Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate
Across Gaps

       One of the criticisms I've faced over the years is that I'm not aggressive enough or assertive enough or maybe
       somehow, because I'm empathetic, it means I'm weak. I totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you can-
       not be both compassionate and strong.

          --Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand

          What Do You Think?
          Emilee just joined the conference session entitled A Trio of Perspectives in Data Visualization. She was
       surprised when the presenter announced that the first task was to join her assigned team based on a pre-
       conference survey. As Emilee found her team, the conference presenter gave them additional instruc-
       tions--to share how their organizations publish information about diversity, equity, and inclusion along with
       other related issues.
          Emilee joined her assigned teammates, Barbara and Tonya. After introducing herself, she discovered that
       Barbara works at a multinational corporation with a diverse workforce spanning multiple continents. Bar-
       bara, beaming with pride, said, "My organization creates visually stunning dashboards showcasing our
       diversity metrics to represent a comprehensive snapshot of my organization's demographics to especially
       highlight and promote gender and ethnic diversity." As Barbara opens her laptop to share the website, Tonya
       offers, "I'm not sure I'm in the right team! I'm in sports."
          Tonya works for a sports consulting corporation where she works with different organizations to increase
       their fan base by reaching diverse cultures, generations, and gender. Tonya offered, "The world of sports
       faces unique challenges in conveying their commitment to diversity and inclusion. They request specific
       data visualizations that convey unity and empowerment. I do my best work where I can feature individual
       stories and collective triumphs."
          Emilee looks at Barbara's laptop and compliments the aesthetics of her organization's dashboard. Emilee
       feels somewhat intimidated. Taking a breath, she says, "I work for a nonprofit and we operate on a shoe-
       string budget. We rely on simple impactful visuals that convey the lived experiences of the communities we
       serve. We don't have a metric of our organization; in fact, we only have 12 employees. Instead, our metric is
       based on the number of clients we help. Most of our clients are from marginalized groups. We provide free-
       legal counsel."
          Barbara looks perplexed and asks, "What kind of cases?"
          Emilee is quick to respond, "Well things like gender pay gap, diversity issues, and inclusion issues. We use
       minimalist, community-centric visuals. Nothing as fancy as Barbara's organization!"
          Discussion: What do you think?

414 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
Introduction

In the era of an increasingly interconnected world, diversity reigns as both a challenge and an opportunity. Effective
communication bridges the gaps among diverse populations to foster collaboration, understanding, and progress. Hiring
a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) officer can be a significant step for any organization, but thinking about the sce-
nario in the "What Do You Think?" section, how would a nonprofit that has 12 employees justify this action?

   One topic DEI officers address is the gender wage gap. According to Elise Gould at the Economic Policy Institute, the
gender wage gap in the United States still persists across all levels (low, middle, and high income) and women are paid
less than men at every education level (2024). In 2023, "women were paid 21.8% less on average than men in 2023, after
controlling for race and ethnicity, education, age, and geographic division" (Gouse, 2024, para. 1). It's an even bleaker
picture if you dive into the data on Black and Hispanic women.

   At its core, this chapter focuses on communication for diverse audiences. Topics to consider for diverse populations
include gender, culture, generation, equity, and inclusion. This chapter includes DEI best practices including people-
first labeling, purposeful order labels, consideration of missing groups, awareness of stereotyping, and mindful use of
icons and shapes. It also includes leadership and communication strategies in relation to the relative burnout that mar-
ginalized populations are facing.

   As you embark on this journey, it is imperative to recognize that effective communication is not a one-size-fits-all
endeavor. It requires an understanding of audience dynamics, cultural nuances, and cognitive biases. It is hoped that
this chapter will equip you to harness the power of data visualizations as a catalyst for change, driving meaningful dia-
logue, and fostering a more inclusive society.

   Chapter 8 addresses the following learning objectives.

8.1 Gender Communication Issues

       The hope is that laying out what we understand about essential differences in the minds of men and women may
       lead to greater acceptance and respect of differences.

          --Simon Baren-Cohen

Gender communication issues are a complex phenomenon that reaches various aspects of society, from workforce
dynamics to decades of gender disparity and stereotyping. To begin, let's look at gender tendencies. Gender tendencies
refer to a pattern or inclination commonly associated with a particular gender based on social norms, cultural expec-
tations, and stereotypes. Examples of gender tendencies include (a) communication style, (b) occupational choices, (c)
emotional expression, and (d) leadership style. A critical examination of gender tendencies can help challenge stereo-
types and foster a greater understanding of inclusivity across diverse gender identities. It is important to note that gen-
der tendencies are not a fixed characteristic of individuals; instead, they are socially constructed and can vary across
different cultures and contexts.

So What Are Gender Tendencies?

   Before we start, we must deal with an important caveat.
The communication expectations are based on the ten-
dencies of men and women as a group. Individuals may
exhibit any combination of "male" and "female" behaviors.
For example, when I am in a meeting, I tend to nest and
take up a lot of room. I have my laptop and iPad, my note-
book always turned to a new blank page, a few mechanical
pencils, a couple of pens, and always a cup of coffee.
Women normally take less room at a conference table, Note: Author Photograph
even pulling in their elbows. Not me. I'm crowding my
neighbors and that is a typical male tendency. So let's look at these male and female tendencies to understand the envi-
ronment and the audience. Remember, understanding your environment and your audience is the first step to success-
ful communication.

   Let's start with a comparison of tendencies: According to Winstok et al. (2018), "according to gender motivation theory,
men are driven by a desire to enhance their status; whereas women are motivated by a desire to reduce risk" (p. 276).
Leonard, Beauvais, and Scholls (1999) introduced sources of motivation from three attributes: traits ("repeated behav-
ioral patterns"), competencies ("skills, abilities, talents, knowledge"), and values ("beliefs about desirable outcomes") (pp.
974-975). Just as one has a dominant hand (either left-handed or right-handed), individuals have a dominant source of
motivation. But how did we develop these tendencies through motivation and conflict? And what does that have to do
with communication?

Gender Tendency #1-Motivation and Conflict

Male: Childhood games taught him that competition is fun, winning is good, performing aggressively is acceptable, and
boasting of your success is normal (Shaffer, D. & Kipp, K., 2013). And these social cues learned in childhood are the foun-

416 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
dation of why a male views conflict as impersonal. He may even consider conflict a necessary part of a working rela-
tionship!

   Female: Childhood games taught her to compromise and collaborate. She competes primarily with herself and tends
to be modest about accomplishments. She is motivated by connections and causes. She takes conflict personally (Doyle,
2022).

   In a study by Eagly et al. (1994) the Miner Sentence Completion Scale (MSCS) showed that men scored higher than
women on competitive games, competitive situations, assertive roles, imposing issues and standing out from the group.
Women scored higher on authority figures and routine administrative functions. It is no surprise that male managers
are often perceived as autocratic leaders. However, a newer study, using the same MSCS, discovered there was no sig-
nificant difference between men and women for "competitive situations" or "standing out in a group" (Thorton et al.,
1997).

   The most common workforce conflicts include employment conditions, supervisor decisions, personality conflicts,
and uncivil behavior. According to Van Gramberg et al. (2020), only 21% of conflicts are fully resolved. No wonder orga-
nizations are experiencing high turnover!

   As an aside, conflict resolution in the workplace must start with both parties recognizing that a problem exists with
the intent of reaching a mutual agreement. Changes in attitudes or behaviors can lessen negative feelings. However,
understanding what triggers the episodes of conflict can often lead to someone saying, "I didn't know that bothered you."
Using "active listening" is a communication technique for conflict resolution. It requires the listener to restate or para-
phrase what they just heard to confirm their understanding. Instead of mentally preparing a response, listen to points
being made (Chastain, 2013)!

What Data Visualization Strategies Help With Communicating?

Effective data visualization strategies that cater to different genders should aim to be inclusive, engaging, and relatable.
Let's look through some of these strategies.

  · Use gender-neutral language, imagery, and color. Create data visualizations that use language and imagery that
      are inclusive and gender neutral. Avoid stereotypes. If you know you have a diverse audience, opt for visuals and
      language that resonates with all members of the audience.
        Example #1: Avoid using pink for girls and blue for boys as part of the color palette.
        Example #2: In a survey, several participants did not answer the gender question (male or female). As a visual-
            ization designer, do not introduce the gender synthetically. Instead, just indicate "identity not listed" instead
            of "other." To most, other feels like a catchall category.

  · Balance visuals and textual information to tell a story: Strive for a balance between visual elements and textual
      annotations in your data visualizations. Provide clear, concise explanations alongside visual representations to
      ensure comprehension.
        Example #1: Use people-first language. So "people with disabilities" or "communities of color."

Gender Tendency #2--"I" Versus "We"

Male: Males have traditionally been afforded attention-getting roles and have no trouble using the word I. According to
Sarah Carmichael (2014) in The Perils of Self-Promotion, a routine use of "I did this" or "I did that" is a symptom of self-
promotion. And this tendency is tied to what males typically value: power, ability, and achievement. Carmichael shares,
"People do not value confidence unless it is accompanied by competence" (para 8).

   Female: Females have traditionally been afforded attention-giving roles attached to an affiliation or the wider needs
of a corporate community. She uses the word we. She is impressed by personal transparency and professional courage.

   Teddy Roosevelt was often teased at his overuse of "I." In fact, the "New York World put a running score on its front
page that year at 563,877,207 to record the number of times Roosevelt used `I' in his public addresses" (Dalton, 2007, p.
361). TR was quite the character; we especially enjoyed his attempt to legislate a change in the spelling of 300 words. He
failed then, but now we use them (check instead of cheque, or color instead of colour, etc.).

   Currently, most leadership programs talk about the use of "We" instead of "me." A Harvard Business Review article, "If
You Want to be the Boss, Say `We' Not `I,'" has some relevant insight. Changing to "we" language can help "shift your per-
spective from self-focused to others-focused, make you more aware of the needs of others . . . [and] make you a better
leader" (Burkus, D., 2015, para. 8). It is worth fighting the tendency to say "I" if you wish to lead a team!

What Examples of Using "We" Can Help With Data Storytelling?

  · Use inclusive framing through shared goals and experiences using "we/us" to emphasize common goals and a
      common purpose.
        Example #1: Use phrases like "Together, we can address this challenge."

  · Use collaboration techniques. Engage the audience to contribute problem-solving strategies.
        Example #1: Use phrasing like, "Let's work together to find innovative solutions to this problem."

  · Share power techniques. Empowerment grows exponentially when you build your narrative around shared values
      and aspirations.
        Example #1: Use phrasing like, "Together, we have the power to make a difference in our communities."
        Example #2: When you need the audience to share responsibility and accountability and to take ownership of
            the issue, you can use phrasing like, "It's up to all of us to ensure we . . ."

Gender Tendency #3--Cognitive Preference Instead of Brain Dominance

Male: Early literature associated males with left-brain orientation, which "produces problem-solving skills that are logi-
cal, analytical, factual, and hierarchical" (American Management Association International Presentation Skills Workshop,
2015, p. 131).

   Females: Early literature associated females with right-brain orientation, which "produces problem-solving skills that
are creative, sensitive, and nonhierarchical" (American Management Association International Presentation Skills Work-
shop, 2015, p. 132).

   Females are great creative problem-solvers, but you find this same ability in males. A study conducted by Hardy &
Gibson discovered that there was a gender difference in the approach to problem-solving in two of four samples, so
the results are somewhat inconclusive. However, this same study indicated, "on average, females were found to produce
higher quality creative problem solutions in all four samples" (Hardy & Gibson, 2015, p. 101). Creative problem-solving is

defined as the production of elegant solutions in response to complex, novel, and ill-defined problems (Hardy & Gibson,
2015).

   The dialogue surrounding left-brain versus right-brain orientation has taken place over the last decade. It's almost
like comparing left-handed and right-handed people. Over 85% of the population is right-handed. Which hand you use
does not cause much of an impact (except the early stigma several decades ago where children were forced to write
with their right hand). Mostly, you hear about left-handed people when you watch baseball (or bowling!). So the left-
brain versus right-brain arguments sound familiar. That's why the "whole brain thinking" introduced by Herrmann is so
interesting.

   According to the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument, a four-quadrant model of cognitive preferences is more
applicable. Herrmann's theory was for either gender to develop "whole brain thinking" to lead to creative problem-solv-
ing (Faust, 2019, para. 20). The quadrant reminds us of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and you can find research
that makes a comparison. But for now, let's look at the Herrmann model. As you review Table 8.1 keep in mind that this is
a framework for understanding cognitive preferences. Each person's brain operates across these dimensions and indi-
vidual strengths can exceed specific quadrants. According to LEADx, the organization that carries on the work of Her-
rmann, the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument helps you determine your dominance in how you think. But even
more interesting is the ability to recognize your team's quadrants.

What Examples of Leveraging Our Understanding of Brain Dominance Can Help With
Data Storytelling?

  · When presenting: Make sure you provide data visualizations or narrative that resonates with each quadrant.
        Example #1: Quadrant A will want to see facts. Quadrant B will want to see an organized approach, Quadrant
            C will want to see the value of solving the issue, Quadrant D will want to see how the solution fits in the big
            picture.

   As you can tell from Table 8.1, you don't see gender in the mix, but you may recognize the quadrant you resonate with
just by looking at the preferred activities. Let's look at nonverbal cues next.

Gender Tendency #4--Nonverbal Cues

Male: Males are likely to hear your literal words and miss your underlying emotion or see your nonverbal cues. He is "not
likely to express his feelings through facial expressions" (American Management Association International Presentation
Skills Workshop, 2015, p. 131).

   Female: Females are very proficient at decoding nonverbal meaning and "nonverbal messages carry over four times
the weight of verbal messages" (National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity, 2020, p. 2). Additionally, females are likely
to display feelings through facial expression or body language. But males are likely to miss it!

   As an aside, in most "two-person conversations, nonverbal messages convey more than 65% of meaning" (National
Alliance for Partnerships in Equity, 2020, p. 2). That's no surprise when you realize our "faces can demonstrate more
than 10,000 facial expressions!" (Point Park University--Online, 2017).

   Even more interesting is the 7-38-55 rule by Mehrabian, Wiener, & Ferris (1967) that shared this formula but with some
caution. The rule states that 7% of meaning is communicated through spoken word, 38% through tone of voice, and 55%
through body language. The authors urge caution because the formula does not apply to every situation. Note that 55%
is nonverbal! Even the way you stand can have an influence on your audience and impact you as well.

   For example, because someone crosses their arms over their chest doesn't always mean they are closed to your pre-
sentation; it may just mean they are cold!

   Just remember, nonverbal cues can contradict or negate verbal messages. An interaction where words say one thing
and nonverbal cues say another is called a double message, and everyone finds this confusing.

What Examples of Leveraging Our Understanding of Our Audience and Looking for
Nonverbal Cues Can Help With Data Storytelling?

  · When presenting: Make sure you pay particular attention to your nonverbal cues.
        Example #1: If you stand with your hands clasped down low in front of you, it may look like you are trying to
            make yourself small. Audiences won't react to that as well (Weiss, 2015).
        Example #2: Know your audience. In the book Presentation Skills: Educate, Inspire, and Engage Your Audience
            (2015), Michael Weiss points out four personalities that should influence how you present (pp. 46-56). These
            four personalities are the Driver, the Amiable, the Analytical, and the Expressive, and each type has prefer-
            ences in how you present to them.
              Presenting to the Driver: Use brief, short-term options, and keep things focused on the present. Let the
                  driver take control if they request it. The best data visualization is a dashboard to provide options, which
                  should be up to date. Nonverbal cues of the Driver include leaning forward, putting elbows on the table,
                  and giving a firm handshake.
              Presenting to the Amiable: The presentation should be traditional and inclusive of the entire team. Per-
                  sonal sharing is OK; the Amiable appreciates a safe, comfortable environment and doesn't like to feel
                  rushed or confronted. They will get back to you. If Drivers are in the same room, emphasize "This is a safe
                  environment." Nonverbal cues of the Amiable include palms open and welcoming, great eye contact, and
                  animated hands, face, and eyes.
              Presenting to the Analytical: The Analytical wants all data (past, present, and future). They are detail ori-

420 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
                  ented, want to see the plan, need time to verify data analysis, and have an obsession with being right.
                  Nonverbal cues of the Analytical include the following: sits up very straight, is somewhat rigid but tends to
                  lean back, and gives limited eye contact.
              Presenting to the Expressive: The Expressive wants to hear how the story will end. Painting a picture
                  with your narrative will engage the Expressive. The Expressive wants to be asked what they think, appre-
                  ciates compliments, and feels comfortable and engaged if they can contribute their ideas and tell their
                  stories. Nonverbal cues of the Expressive include leaning forward to make eye contact and being animated
                  in posture (restless).

cially helpful if you struggle with getting nervous before a presentation!

Gender Tendency #5--Interruptions

Male: Males are more likely to interrupt women than interrupt other men and they mean nothing personal by the inter-
ruption. "According to world-renowned gender communication expert Deborah Tannen, men speak to determine and
achieve power and status. Women talk to determine and achieve connection" (Ibarra, Tannen, Williams, & Hewlett, 2019,
p. 80).

   Given that in American society speaking is perceived as a power position, it is no wonder that men interrupt to take
the floor more often. "In using conversation to enhance connection, women are much less likely to interrupt, as it is
seen as disrespectful" (Shore, 2017, p. 37)

   Female: Females are less likely to interrupt men, but when females are interrupted by men, they tend to take it per-
sonally.

What Strategies Can We Use When a Presentation Gets Interrupted?

  · When your presentation is interrupted, determine the reason first.
        Example #1--Is the interruption for clarity? There are strategies for deflecting interruptions (for any reason
            other than clarity). For example, you can ask, "There are a few more essential points I'd like to make. Can you
            delay a moment?"
        Example #2--Is the interruption because they want to support your position? This can happen when men feel
            motivated to support based on your language and word choice. Instead of words like "believe," use "know" or
            instead of "might" use "will." (Shore, 2017, p. 37) and don't use phrases like "I just" or "I think" because these
            phrases limit your authority and conviction.
        Another strategy is to notice body language. When you see men lean away or look away from you, they may be
            ready to interrupt, so "look them in the eye, lean in and take yourself seriously if you want to be heard" (Shore,
            2017, p. 35).

Reflective listening: If you face interruptions from your team, ask your team to practice a version of "reflective listen-
ing." "Anyone interrupting repeats or paraphrases what the speaker was saying and then explains the connection to the
new thought. This prompts teams to be more aware of when and who they're interrupting. This won't work for every
meeting because it slows the pace, though it is a good exercise to default to when excessive interruptions re-emerge"
(Dotter, 2019, para 5).

Gender Tendency #6--Defining a Problem and Situation

Male: Men tend to define a situation in terms of outcome. Males will assume that your presentation of a problem (even
a hypothetical problem used for illustration) is a direct request for a solution.

   Female: Females tend to define the same issue in terms of the people affected by it. Other females will respond to your
presentation of a problem with support and reassurance with a willingness to collaborate, to share experiences, and
to jointly discuss solutions. "Successful collaboration requires a cooperative spirit and mutual respect" (Doyle, Careers,
2020, para. 15). A good collaborator can analyze the problem without assigning blame and women are better at this than
men.

   These observations highlight the different perspectives. While men lean toward analytical solutions, women often
consider the human aspect. These tendencies are generalizations and don't apply to all. Individual variations exist;
expect a blend.

What Strategies Can We Use When Presenting a Problem to a Mixed Audience?

· When you present to a mixed audience, plan to appeal to both genders.

      Example #1--If you are presenting to a mixed audience, what can you do? The strategy is to define the prob-
         lem in a manner that appeals to both genders. Defining the problem is key--paint the picture, show the
         impact, the consequences, and the emotions the problem is creating for those involved (Cooper, 2014). You
         already consider the decision-makers in your audience; this is just considering the additional issues based on
         "gender."

 Example #2--Use analytical tools like PESTLE
    (political, economic, social, technological, legal,
    and environmental) or SWOT (strengths, weak-
    nesses, opportunities, and threats) so males can
    focus on the specific industry competition in
    related industries or organizations. Be direct
    and show results-oriented impact on the orga-
    nization's bottom line. These tools were demon-
    strated in previous chapters.

 Example #3--Share the most important infor-
    mation first. One of our favorite quotes made in
    Storytelling With Data is "If you only had a lim-
    ited amount of time or a single sentence to tell
    your audience what they need to know, what
    would you say?" (Knaflic, 2015, p. 39).

          In this step, please note the information on the lower left (Live data) of the PowerPoint (see Figure 8.5). It should
  identify the name of the Power BI Report (in this case XCaliber Foods Storytelling--Draft 2, KPI & Goals), along with the
  date updated.

             In the lower right of PowerPoint, you will notice several icons. The first icon looks like a three-column chart.
  When you click on it, you see the options filter, data insights, refresh, and reset, as shown in Figure 8.61. Data Insights is
  like what you would expect from Power BI. If you have trouble loading Data Insights, troubleshoot the Power BI add-in
  for PowerPoint. In Figure 8.6, we demonstrate the data insight feature by using the Revenue Trend section of the report.

8.2 Cultural Communication Issues

       Different does not mean deficient, it simply means different.
          --Tatiana Kolovou, teaching professor of management

Making Sense of Cultural Differences in a Communicative World

The rapid rise of global business, combined with the challenges brought on by the pandemic, has made cross-cultural
considerations and planning an urgent priority for even the most indifferent organizational communicators. During the
difficult days of the pandemic, nearly the entire world was forced to remote work, requiring immediate connection with
colleagues across various parts of the globe. In Upwork's Future Workforce Survey, 1,000 U.S. hiring managers were
asked, "Has responding to the pandemic forced you to make changes to the following management practice areas that
will stay with you in the long-run?" (Ozimek, 2021, para. 15). The survey results indicated over 60% changed manage-
ment practices for team meetings (structure and cadence) and over 55% indicated changed management practices for
employee/internal communication.

   At any given moment, countless individuals are connecting instantly with their organization's global offices. This shift
has brought together a diverse array of cross-cultural communicators, who collaborate virtually to solve problems, pre-
sent proposals, and engage in meaningful exchanges through numerous virtual platforms. Despite this reality, not all
participants have received training on the nuances of cross-cultural communication.

   This section seeks to address that gap by discussing key considerations for effectively engaging with diverse audi-
ences and making compelling pitches in our increasingly globalized communication landscape.

Cultural Context Matters

Each culture presents differences, and as highlighted in the quote at the start of this section, these differences should
be celebrated for the diversity they bring rather than viewed as deficiencies. Culture encompasses the customs, arts,
social institutions, and traditions of a particular nation, people, or other social group. Extensive research has been con-
ducted on the differences between cultures, and while entire books could be written on this topic, this section aims to
introduce a few key resources that we believe will be particularly helpful to you.

   Researchers like Geert Hofstede leveraged his practical experience at IBM to develop a framework of six cultural
dimensions that encapsulate common experiences across cultures. These dimensions--power distance, individualism,
motivation toward achievement and success, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence continue to
guide leaders and scholars. Organizations like the Culture Factor Group assist individuals seeking to understand these
cultural differences by providing country comparison tools to help guide those who seek to understand and appreciate
cultural diversity.

The Culture Map

Erin Meyer, author of the Culture Map, helped to further Hofstede's cross-cultural considerations by offering an eight-
scale dimension to guide audiences. These dimensions help global audiences better identify cultural differences from a
highly practical approach. The cultural dimensions of communicating, evaluating, persuading, leading, deciding, trust-
ing, confronting, and scheduling help explain the various approaches that guide leaders as they interact with another
culture. Table 8.2 explains the dimensions while the subsequent illustrations suggest how the dimensions may play out,
interaction by interaction.

   Table 8.2: Dimensions, Scale and Differences Explained

Dimension    Scale                 Differences Explained

Communicating Low to high context  Low context speakers offer all details to others, being very specific and looking for the same
                                   from others. High context speakers let audiences read between the lines to get meaning and
                                   be surprised by low context details.

Evaluating   Direct to indi-       Those giving direct negative feedback are explicit and clear while those providing indirect

                                   such decisions.

Deciding     Consensual            Similarly, consensual decision-makers look to the group to have sign-off while top-down

             ble time              followed. They may see arriving early as actually being on time. Those in flexible time cultures
                                   tend to be approximate on start times, not seeing the need to rush from their timelier coun-
                                   terparts.

Figure 8.9 illustrates how select dimensions relate to how communication may differ, culture-by-culture, in four specific
countries. While audience members are never monolithic, leaders and communicators would be wise to heed these gen-
eral parameters to better understand their audiences when approaching communication in such situations.

   Understanding these cultural differences is just a starting point to recognize the ways in which different people con-
nect. The next key step for any communicator is to identify specific actions to effectively communicate. First, listen to
and observe your surroundings. Even when you are with a familiar work group, observe what they do daily. What are the
spoken and unspoken patterns you observe? How do individuals interact and behave with each other? What is known

430 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
by the in-groups, those that regularly work and interact in these spaces versus the out-group, those who do not. These
key observations can begin to help you understand and see the differences.

                                                                                                                                               Note: Author Illustration
                                                                                                                                               (2024), A comparison of
                                                                                                                                               four countries.

Keeping in mind that differences do not mean deficiencies, a potential next step would be for a group to read resources
like the Culture Map or take the online Cultural Profile available from Harvard Business Review in the next web resource
offered in this chapter. So often, understanding diverse audiences begins by understanding ourselves and this important
resource may help to illustrate key differences between you and other audience members from different cultures.

   Finally, when comfortable, your working group should openly discuss and manage cultural differences. Sometimes this
means acknowledging the cultural differences in daily actions. For instance, a low-context team member may acknowl-
edge that the follow-up email they send after every meeting is simply a product of their cultural experience and not an
assertion that other team members are disorganized, lazy, or not doing their work. Discussing this openly can prevent
hours of unproductive soul-searching and bruised egos every time such a communication occurs. Similarly, the entire
group can better understand that the manager providing very direct feedback may be operating from a cultural dimen-
sion to which they are very accustomed, rather than choosing to be critical. While that understanding alone may not
help the team as they absorb the feedback, it can help everyone understand that the feedback is not personal but simply
the way that manager communicates.

   Considering cross-cultural communication also means examining the ways in which individuals connect routinely and
a reminder of the importance of storytelling. Historical experience has taught us that individuals connect around needs,
experiences, and hopes, which are often shared through story or narrative. Very often, these important discussions take
place when one member connects with another via narrative and shared understanding. Storytelling is a phenomenon
that exists beyond cultural dimensions and as a result, may be the precise way to connect with others via some tried
and true practices depicted in Figure 8.10.

                 One additional consideration is the ways in which persuasion may be different by culture. You will recall
              discussion in chapter one about the need in some cultures, like the United States, to be more upfront with an
argument while following a "cut to the chase" or "time is money" philosophy. This contrasts with other cultures, such as
those in China, who may be more indirect with a persuasive argument. For such speakers, it may be important to pay
particular attention to how they begin their argument, make their points, and reach a decision with audience members.
Table 8.3 offers important considerations for such speakers to consider, depending on the audience.

                you in developing responses to the case:
                   Yuri, a Russian partner in a global company, listened to his American counterpart, Michael, as he

                presented his idea at a pitch session. Yuri found the message from Michael a little off-putting.
Michael had come in and before barely sharing his slide deck, offered that the entire East European division
should be melded into Yuri's portfolio for Central Asia.

   While the idea made good sense and was somewhat expected, Yuri was very surprised that Michael quickly
came to this conclusion without any reasoning or evidence. Yuri would have preferred to see data, consider its
merits, and then revisit after careful thought. It's not that he objected to the idea entirely. Truthfully, he would
likely agree, but it was the way Michael said it. Outside of this interaction, Yuri generally liked Michael. The two
connected very well after discussing their families, experiences in the workforce, and common visions they had

                                                                                          Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 433
     for the company's future. While Michael continued talking, Yuri wondered if there had not been a better way to
     handle all of this . . .

         1. In reaching each other on this important message related to the company, what did Yuri, Michael, or
             both do wrong in connecting cross culturally?

        2. What strategies, if any, could have been used by Michael to reach Yuri on this decision?
        3. In handling this for future situations, do you have a recommendation for the company going forward?

8.3 Multigenerational Communication Issues

       If you get the culture right, most of the other stuff, like great customer service, or passionate employees and
       customers, will happen on its own naturally.

          --Tony Hsieh, former Zappos CEO

Company Culture and Multigenerational Communication Issues

Company culture plays out differently for large companies compared to small companies. In a large company, all leaders
at the executive level are likely from the baby boomer generation. In fact, "roughly 80% of S&P 500 companies have
baby boomer CEOs and approximately one-third of that group is 65 or older" (Potter, 2018, para. 4). As of 2016, the Pew
Research Center indicated that millennials became the largest percentage of the workforce at 35%, and by 2025, 75% of
the global workforce will be millennials (Fry, 2018).

   In small start-up organizations, the owner influences the company culture and Millennials and Gen Z are more likely
to start their own businesses. In a nonprofit, both the director and the executive board or board of trustees influence
the organization's culture. On the board, expect a mix of all generations, but directors and staff are normally not Baby
Boomers. Wong and Main (2023) explained that "company culture is about the shared norms, values, attitudes, and prac-
tices that form the collective identity of your company [shaping] how things are done within your organization" (para.
6). The return on investment (ROI) is long-term. If you've ever worked in a toxic culture where generations don't hold
the same values, you can expect these symptoms: low employee engagement, high turnover, the blaming of politics, fre-
quent use of the phrase "That's not my job," lack of trust, and high absenteeism.

   Adding to the communication complexity of company culture is the multigenerational workforce. A leader's role
is essential in shaping the culture that bridges a multigenerational workforce. Different generations prefer different
communication styles, may have biases (negative stereotypes), and hold different expectations for their employment.
Although you may be well aware of the different generations, let's review them.

The Five Generations of the Workforce

The following information is based on the Pew Research Center.

  · Traditionalists or Silent (1925-1945)

434 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
        Traits: Dependable, straightforward, tactful, and loyal
        Communication style: personal, handwritten notes, not a fan of email, top-down approach
        Pew Research Center: Less than 2% of workforce and 9.8% of the population
  · Baby Boomers (1946-1964)
        Traits: Optimistic, competitive, workaholic, team-oriented
        Communication style: Prioritize personal and formal communication. They appreciate phone calls, meetings,

            and memos. They may print out emails.
        Survey: Close to half (49%) of Baby Boomers are expected to or already are working past the age of 70 (Hicks,

            2023).
  · Generation X (1965-1980)

        Traits: Flexible, informal, skeptical, independent
        Communication style: prefer communication that is efficient, can easily adapt to digital, work hard play hard
        As of 2021, 35% of those employed include Generation X (Kuligowski, 2021).
  · Millennials (1981-1996*)
        Traits: Competitive, civic and open-minded, achievement-oriented, well educated
        Communication style: Digitally adept, which shapes their communication preference, IMs, texts, specific

            internal platforms like Slack, want ample feedback and recognition.
        Less likely to remain at one organization. By 2025, 75% of the global workforce will be millennials (Fry, 2020).
  · Generation Z (1997-2012*)
        Traits: Global, entrepreneurial, progressive, less focused
        Communication style: Digital natives, tech-savvy, quick learners, expect instant communication, but also IMs,

            social media, texts, like self-direction.
        Seek organizations that align with their values, will self-identify as digital addicts.

* Using the new definition period for each generation from the Pew Research Center. These classifications are globally
understood and recognized. More information is coming for Gen Z as they come of age.

   Let's explore the number one issue of low employee engagement--knowing what is expected.
   Low employee engagement: The value of engaged employees is their entrepreneurial spirit. They own their work. And
as owners, they are motivated to drive change and contribute to innovation. Disengaged workers are less productive,
more stressed, and less secure. Gallup's 2023 U.S. survey indicates that 33% of employees were engaged in 2023, which
means that 67% of employees are not engaged. Actively disengaged employees, or loud quitters, are at 16%, which is
down from 2022 (Harter, 2024). "The most fundamental engagement element is knowing what is expected of you," and
the fallout of COVID-19 is that "70% of managers report to Gallup that they have no formal training in how to lead a
hybrid team" (Harter, 2024, para 10).
   If your work involves teams, consider using the CliftonStrengths Assessment from Gallop. This assessment measures
your unique talents and categorizes them into 34 Clifton Strength themes. Knowing your strengths can help you lever-
age them, especially in a team setting. According to CliftonStrengths, it is important to discover the collective talents
of your team. "To successfully manage or lead others, you must individualize your approach. You must understand
what makes each of your team members unique. And you must lead meaningful conversations about performance that
focus on what each person naturally does best" (Gallup, 2024). There is more about CliftonStrengths in Section 8.6. As
a reminder of the 7Cs of communication, good communicators should be clear, concrete, concise, complete, courteous,
and coherent.
   Leaders are expected to be good communicators, so how can we leverage data visualization or communication tools
to support better communication?

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 435
Key Strategies for Communicating Across Generations

Balanced Hybrid Work Model: Bridging cross-generational communication gaps can be done through a balanced hybrid
work model. Everyone has experienced COVID-19, and it certainly changed how we communicated during the pan-
demic's rage across the globe. The lessons we learned impact communication in the present. A Forbes expert panel rec-
ommends a blend of face-to-face meetings and virtual meetings (Uzialko, 2024). Training should be delivered across all
generations to make sure everyone can use the communication and collaboration tools effectively.

   Multichannel approach: Leaders need to utilize a diverse range of communication channels. This need is why you see
so many communication channels: Slack, Google Chat and Google Meet, Chanty, Microsoft Teams, Basecamp, Zoho Cliq,
and dozens more. The point is that leaders need to provide a multichannel approach, perhaps an email to the Tradition-
alists and Boomers and an instant message (through Slack or an alternative) to other generations.

   Tone, jargon-free, inclusive language: Consider the seven Cs of communication: clear, concise, concrete, correct,
coherent, complete, and courteous. Tailor messages to have the right tone and free of jargon. Stay central to the topic.
If your team has global members, communicate to them in their preferred language, avoid slang and colloquialisms, be
conscious of time zones, and be careful of humor.

   Role of AI and automation: AI-powered tools can help with internal communication (personalizing communication),
predict communication patterns to help you anticipate communication needs. For example, have you ever come into a
meeting late and felt like saying, "What did I miss?" Leveraging AI means that now you can ask the AI questions like this
and even a question like "Did my name come up for any projects?"

   Embracing remote communication methods: Use Zoom/Teams/Slack or other virtual meeting software features to
their fullest by adopting interest-based conversations instead of position-based conversations. Choose the whiteboard
before the meeting. Set up your polls (for feedback) before you meet. All virtual meeting software has a long list of white-
boards. In Exhibit 8.1, Zoom has templates ranging from strategy to planning, brainstorming to ideation, mapping, dia-
gramming, meetings, and retrospectives.

Remote Meeting Strategies

Additionally, the whiteboards are visual cues to the members of your team. They will retain important facts like dead-
lines better when they work on it visually in collaboration with the team.

· For multigenerational teams pair partners within the team (one techy and one not) so participants who have fewer
   technology skills (normally Baby Boomers) can participate comfortably.

· For all team members, request a page summary to send out to the team.
· For all team members, record the meeting.
· For all team members, set up a poll using feedback questions to make sure everyone has the opportunity to con-

   tribute.
· For all meetings, identify trends across the generations and support a balance of several communication styles.
· For all meetings, adapt a policy of camera on, so you can facilitate verbal and nonverbal communication.
· For all meetings, work from an agenda, and set a time limit. The majority of employees struggle to get work done

   because of the sheer number of communications they receive.
· For all meetings, meet regularly and ask team members to display availability. Different organizations will have dif-

   ferent needs, but every organization should have communication guidelines.
· For meeting follow-up, have periodic check-ins (either daily or weekly). A list of check-in questions can help you

   determine progress, employee focus, employee concerns, and so on. You can even do a periodic emotional check-
   in to see if your team members are feeling stressed.
· For all meetings, cultivate culture. Share core values and the company's mission and/or visions. Recognize
   employees publicly. Plan team bonding and networking--remote coffee breaks, achievements like employee-of-
   the-week, and use icebreakers to start a meeting. A good icebreaker for building relationships with a global team is
   using a map where individuals can pin their location to answer the question, "where are you from?" This template
   is shown in Exhibit 8.2. Just seeing where your team calls in from can help others understand the challenge of time
   zones, especially if you include that information as part of pinning where you are located!

8.4 Data Visualization Techniques to Fill the Gaps

       Everybody needs data literacy, because data is everywhere. It's the new currency, it's the language of the busi-
       ness. We need to be able to speak it.

          --Piyanka Jain, speaking with MIT Sloan

It is no surprise that organizations face a rapidly changing landscape of contemporary issues. Effective communication
has emerged as a cornerstone for success, partially in the realm of data-driven decision-making. "In a recent survey of
analytics leaders, 67% said organizational culture is the biggest barrier to becoming a data-oriented company" (Mayor,
2021, para 8). A data-oriented organization makes strategic decisions based on data; however, "only 20% of analytics
insights will deliver business outcomes through 2022 according to Gartner research" (Mayor, 2021, para 3). As organi-
zations strive to capture the power of data to drive innovation and communicate through storytelling, the audience is
becoming increasingly diverse. This section delves into the intersection of data visualization and storytelling techniques
as dynamic tools for communication, with a focus on the needs of the diverse composition of modern teams.

   As workplaces become increasingly diverse in terms of gender, culture, and generational backgrounds, the challenge
of effectively communicating data insights to a broad spectrum of team members has become more challenging. Added
to this mix is the necessary recommendation for how data are visualized from a DEI point of view. DEI is discussed more
thoroughly in Section 8.5. This section explores strategies for crafting visual narratives that resonate with multiple gen-
ders, considers cultural barriers, and engages multigenerational cohorts. The point here is to cultivate a climate of tech-
nical data analysis, human-centric storytelling, and collaborative decision-making processes that harness the collective
intelligence of a diverse team.

   Design choice that considers the science behind visual perceptions and cognition is important to communicate effec-
tively. Drawing upon insights from psychology, sociology, and communication theory, this section adopts a user-centric
approach to data visualization and narrative construction.

   Before starting this section, review some of the current population statistics:

  · As of 2020, Baby Boomers are at 18.6%, Generation X is at 34.8%, Millennials are at 38.6%, Generation Z is at 6.1%,
      and the traditionalist or silent generation is at 2% (Purdue Global, 2020).

  · "As of February 2023, women 16 years and over make up 55.4% of all U.S. employees" and "women's wages equal
      83.6 percent of men's wages" (Reiners, 2024, para. 15-17).

  · The 2015 census data show 56% of Millennials are white, whereas 75% of Baby Boomers are white.

438 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
  · "Diverse companies have 2.5 times higher cash flow per employee" (Reiners, 2024, para 22).
  · Companies that are diverse (gender, race, and culture) are more profitable (Reiners, 2024).

Design Strategies

The following strategies are based on working with a diverse team or presenting to a diverse audience.

Strategy #1--PechaKucha: Plan a Beginning, Middle, and End in 7 Minutes

Emphasize the personal benefit in the introduction concisely so you can quickly get to the major point. Plan to reestab-
lish said personal benefit in the conclusion (McMahon, 2016). Just as important, you need to develop techniques, so the
presentation does not drag. A Japanese management style called PechaKucha is an approach where you have 20 slides
timed at 20 seconds each. The slides automatically advance giving you less than seven minutes to tell your story, and
most slides should complement the speaker when vocalizing (Eckfeldt, 2019). Data Visualizations that use charts and
graphs need to focus--so automatic zooming or animation might be required.

   To effectively connect using the PechaKucha, use these techniques:

 1. Personalized introduction: Begin with a brief but impactful introduction. Tailor this introduction to resonate with
      diverse audiences. The introduction does not mean you are introducing yourself. Introduction means sharing per-
      sonal anecdotes, sharing experiences, using images that make sense to your audience, and using metaphors that fit
      your audience. All audiences prefer a visualization in context. Test it out before presenting.

2. Utilize structured storytelling: Ensure each segment flows seamlessly into the next. Use the CASS framework and
      keep your storytelling framework universal in design. Be careful with humor. Illustrate the main point clearly.
      Always show impact on the bottom line.

3. Visual technique: Use techniques that resonate, such as (a) simple and clear charts, (b) color considerations, (c)
      iconography and symbols, (d) infographics, and (e) interactive visualizations for your tech-savvy audience mem-
      bers.

4. Cultural context in imagery: Incorporate culturally relevant imagery and references--that is, if you use images,
      make sure they include diverse backgrounds. Avoid macho sports metaphors.

5. Accessible design: Alt tags, color contrast adjustments
6. Do NOTs: On occasion, you might be tempted to use a data visualization that makes you look like a technology

      wizard. Fight this! The sole purpose for data visualizations is to "help you tell stories by curating data into a form
      easier to understand, highlighting the trends and outliers," . . . and that means . . . "removing the noise from data
      and highlighting the useful information" (Tableau, 2020, para. 8).

              Title: PechaKucha: Visual Storytelling That Celebrates Humanity. Link: https://www.pechakucha.com/

Strategy #2--Get to the Point!

One of my favorite quotes made in the Storytelling With Data book is "If you only had a limited amount of time or a
single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?" (Knaflic, 2015, p. 39). Mitchell and
Deckard have reviewed thesis and final projects for over a decade. Imagine a presenter receives instructions to present

                                                                                               Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 439
for 15-20 minutes. The student has great visuals sharing the background and challenge or issue at an organization. If
you are sitting in the audience still waiting on the recommendation and the presenter is already fifteen minutes into the
presentation, you may be so frustrated that you stop listening. And you may be thinking, "Get to the point!" Even visuals
can suffer from "getting to the point."

   Which is better when you review Figure 8.11? The graphic on the right has a "get-to-the-point" component since the
focus is on 24% in 2022.

   Figure 8.11--Graphic Design Makes a Difference
                                                                                                                                                          Note: Author
                                                                                                                                                          Illustrations (2024)

Regardless of gender, cultural, or generational preferences, everyone prefers clear and concise key points. Now look at
specific data visualizations.

Strategy #3--Use the Appropriate Data Visualizations

Here are some other key points experienced by the authors. These guidelines apply to presenting to either gender. Con-
sider this section the basics of data visualization techniques using Excel and a few references to Power BI. Keep in mind
that previous chapters shared other types of data visualizations (word clouds, infographics, maps, etc.).

   1. Tables: Do not use tables in a presentation unless you have no choice. If you must use a table, get rid of the borders
and grid lines or the audience will focus on the borders and gridlines! The best visual in a large room presentation has
minimal borders. See Figure 8.12.

   Figure 8.12--Minimal Borders Best for Large Venue

   2. Heatmaps: Heatmaps were discussed in earlier chapters but let's consider why this is a good choice for a diverse
audience. The appeal of heat maps can vary based on individual preferences, demographics, and cultural backgrounds.

440 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
In terms of gender, research suggests that males and females may have different cognitive preferences and visual pro-
cessing styles, which could impact how they perceive and interpret heat maps.

             Generational differences: Baby Boomers, who grew up in a different technological era, may have different lev-
          els of familiarity and comfort with data visualization techniques like heat maps compared to millennials, who are
          often more digitally savvy. Again, individual preferences are most likely to drive their understanding of a heat
          map. A heat map can be produced in Excel using conditional formatting. Creating a correlation matrix is available
          in Data Analysis (an add-in to Excel) for the Data table. Then you can set up conditional formatting. Refer back
          to Chapter 3 (Table 3.16: Heatmap Shows That Board Members and CEOs Are Not on the Same Page) to see the
          benefits and how easy it is to see patterns.
   3. Scatterplots: Scatterplots are great for showing the relationship between two things, but they aren't used as much
in business, mostly because perhaps folks are not as familiar with them. Scatterplots are much easier to understand if
you show the average or modify the chart with a band of color (this is shown in Section 3.7). Another way to show a
relationship is with maps (see Section 3.7). Individual preferences and experiences play a significant role in determining
which generations in the workforce prefer scatterplots.

             Generational differences: Younger generations may be more receptive to scatterplots, but factors such as job
          role, industry, and personal interests, may play a part in how well younger generations understand them. You
          would expect the traditionalist generation to be less familiar with scatterplots, but scatterplots with average and
          customized bands of color can add value for all generations.
   4. Line graphs: Line graphs are used to plot continuous data. Adding an average to a graph adds value. Line charts are
great for long-term trends.

             Generational differences: All generations understand a line graph, but not all line graphs are equal. For exam-
          ple, you can create an animated line graph using Flourish. This will appeal to the tech-savvy generations, more
          specifically the Gen X, Millennials and Gen Z cohort.
   5. Slope graphs: A slope graph, introduced by Edward Tufte in 1983, is useful when you have two points of comparison,
and you want to quickly show increases and decreases. An example would be an annual employee satisfaction survey,
and the analyzers want to display the changes quickly between 2023 and 2024.

             Generational differences: Traditionalist and Baby Boomers will like slope graphs because it is an easy way
          to measure change. The tech-savvy cohorts will appreciate the ease of identifying patterns but may feel just as
          comfortable looking for a pattern in a sparkline in Excel.

              excel-slopegraphs

                 6. Bar Charts: A bar chart is familiar to your audience. The audience can easily see the biggest and smallest.
              There is one rule you should never break. Bar charts must have a zero baseline. Although this is discussed in
previous chapters, we want to emphasize the importance of using a zero baseline. If you don't use a zero baseline, you
misrepresent the data by exaggerating differences and losing the trust of your audience. It violates a visualization prin-
ciple. If you want to revisit this, see the figures in Chapter 2.
             Generational differences: Violation of the zero-baseline principle can end up breaking the trust you work so
          hard to build with your audience. This is true regardless of the generation. Use a zero baseline. Otherwise, you
          can introduce significant issues that compromise integrity and effectiveness. Don't lose your credibility!
   7. Column Bar Charts: The column bar (also vertical bar chart) can contain multiple columns, but consider your audi-
ence and what you want them to compare. Too many data series (columns), and it becomes difficult for your audience to
visualize and connect to the "insight" you are trying to convey. Use your spacing appropriately. Figure 8.13 is a grading of
nonprofits in Brazil, Indiana (this is just for illustration purposes). Besides the spacing, the gridlines were removed, and
in the third illustration, the text was increased in size and made bold.
   Figure 8.13--Column Bar Chart Comparison

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 441
             Generational differences: Both Baby Boomers and traditionalists may have been exposed to traditional forms
          of data presentation (printed!) and have seen column bar charts frequently. Tech-savvy cohorts are used to the
          column bar charts and find them intuitive.

             Is there a better chart? As you review your charts, consider changing the vertical bar chart to a horizontal bar
          chart because horizontal bar charts are easy to read. Baby Boomers are more accustomed to viewing information
          in a left-to-right format, making horizontal bar charts more intuitive. Think about how you read--starting at the
          top left and moving across the screen--this means the eyes can read the category names before the data in a
          natural process similar to reading.
   8. Horizontal Bar Charts: As mentioned earlier, a horizontal bar chart is familiar to your audience because the data
are organized from the far left corner and across--very similar to the way we read. Horizontal bar charts can have single
series or multiple series. They are especially good when the information labels are too long to appear clearly on the
x-axis of a vertical bar chart. A second thought is to consider if organizing the chart from biggest category to least cat-
egory will help your audience get the big picture. The reader will see the top horizontal bar first, so this makes sense.
However, if your categories are grouped by age, or donation size, or letter grades, keep the categories in order! Oth-
erwise, as shown in Figure 8.14, the audience may struggle to make sense of it. So the natural order is best.

             Generational difference: Baby Boomers and Traditionalists are accustomed to this format and find it easy to
          read (not Figure 8.14 though!). Individual preferences can vary within each generational cohort. What is most
          important is selecting the appropriate chart type for effective communication.
   9. Multiple Series--Column Bar Charts: Bar charts with multiple series can become crowded. The chart in Figure 8.16
shows an example of a survey where administrators and board members rated the staff and the staff rated themselves.
The survey has eight groupings of three variables each. The ideal number of groupings is a total of 12 bars (or in this
case four groupings) for a presentation, so pick the groupings that are significantly different. For example, there is a
big difference between how the administrators and boards saw the staff's patience compared to how the staff see them-
selves. There is an effective use of colors that is consistent across all groupings. The survey ratings are 0-10, and no
distortion or exaggeration is apparent.
   Figure 8.16--Multiple Series Column Bar Chart

   The Soft Skills Survey Results chart could be better though. It could contain a more descriptive title and a date.
             Generation difference: When you start including multiple series of data, Millennials and Generation Z often

          prefer interactive visualizations. For example, this could be designed so you could compare various combinations
          of the survey. So comparing administrators to staff might be more important than including the board. In this
          chart, administrators and board members rated the staff and the staff rated themselves.
   10. Stacked Vertical Bar Charts: Stacked bar charts are used to show quantity, dollars, or a percentage that adds up to

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 443
100%. The illustration shown here is from a not-for-profit and they've grouped their donations by the size of the dona-
tions. Although they raised a similar amount of money in 2018 and 2019, the makeup of donors has changed. When you
look at this chart, do you think a change in marketing is needed? And when you view Figure 8.17, do you agree with the
question, "are we losing our grass roots donors?"

   This chart has almost too many categories. According to Vora (2019), the maximum number of bars to show trends or
relationships is 12 bars (12 categories). This chart has 11, but you can answer the question by reviewing the chart.

   Figure 8.17--Stacked Vertical Bar Charts: Too Many Categories

   Microsoft Power Business Intelligence (BI), suggests using stacked bar charts if you use slicers. Slicers are a type of
visual filter. Once you see the charts, you will understand why! Figure 8.18 does not have a slicer, and these data are very
difficult to understand. But if you select an item from the legend (e.g., Candy), it will show the revenue for that item for
each month. You can also select multiple products by using the control key to select two or more categories. However,
this may not be intuitive to a new user of Power BI.

   Figure 8.18--Power BI Stacked Bar Chart, Where Every Category Can Be a Slicer

   The next two charts show how adding slicers makes it easier to understand. This is the same dataset as seen in Figure
8.18, but the slicer allows us to filter on the salesperson (in this case, Nancy), and on the category of goods. Slicers are
a wonderful tool for helping understand complex data, and showing them with the charts means even novice users of
Power BI will know what to do to trigger a filter.

Although this section has introduced several charts and the generational preferences, keep in mind that the data and
the story are the key factors when choosing the correct chart. In the Infogram resource (2024), they feature a chart
starter with a central question, "What Would You Like to Show?" (para 5). From this central question, are you trying to
show a relationship, a comparison, a distribution, or a composition that relates to one time period or a composition that
displays the changes over time?

8.5 Why Is It Important to Consider DEI When Developing Data
Visualizations?

       An editorial approach to visualization design requires us to take responsibility to filter out the noise from the sig-
       nals, by identifying the most valuable, most striking or most relevant dimensions of the subject matter in ques-
       tion.

          --Andy Kirk, CoreSignal

In an ever-evolving landscape of data-driven decision-making, one crucial aspect often overlooked is the integration of
DEI principles in data visualizations. As global companies strive to harness the power of data to drive innovation and
support strategic decisions, it becomes essential to ensure that data visualizations are not only accurate and insightful
but also inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.

   The significance of considering DEI can't be overstated. Data visualizations serve as powerful tools for communication.
Data visualizations combined with storytelling techniques can influence perceptions, shape narratives, and drive
actions. However, without careful consideration of DEI principles, data visualizations risk perpetuating biases, reinforc-
ing stereotypes, and excluding marginalized voices.

   This section will focus on best practices for diversity, equity, and inclusion in data visualizations. Although not a
complete list, examples concerning DEI principles include people-first labeling, order labels purposefully, how to treat
datasets that have missing groups, and care in using icons and shapes.

Best Practice #1--Know Your Biases

Preventing bias creep starts with understanding our own biases. First, critically examine where your data come from,
how they were collected, and who benefits / who could potentially be harmed?

   Color-Blindness: For example--audience members who are color-blind might not see the insight in the data visualiza-
tions because they can't see any difference in the two colors (red and green) you are sharing! To understand deutera-
nopia, try taking the Ishihara test. The test consists of 38 plates with different patterns, and your score depends on how
well you detect a pattern.

                 Take the Free Color-Blind Test from ColorMax.org. The test is based on the Ishihara Color Plate Test. Link:
              Color Blind Test | Test Your Color Vision | Ishihara Test for Color Blindness (colormax.org)

                 If you know you have individuals in the audience who struggle with color-blindness, avoid the following
              color combinations since someone with color-blindness will see them as the same color!

Unconscious Biases: There are several unconscious biases that you may experience.
   Unconscious Bias #1: Ageism. In this case, younger employees could consider a person's abilities related to age. An

older generation can make assumptions about a younger generation's work habits.
             How to avoid: Ask older and younger employees to interact, mentor, and develop positive relationships. Some

          examples include a younger person mentoring an older employee that struggles with technology. The older
          employee reciprocates with global experiences related to the organization.
   Unconscious Bias #2: Affinity Bias. One example is common during interviews since there is a tendency to hire can-
didates like you. This unconscious bias can lead to a less diverse workforce.

             How to avoid: Adopt clear policies of inclusion with goals for the hiring process.
   Unconscious Bias #3: Weight Bias. Weight bias impacts people of all backgrounds. Fellow coworkers may think they
work less or assume they are lazy.

             How to avoid: Stress the importance of a person's work ability and how well they contribute to the team.
   Unconscious Bias #4: Name Bias. Name bias happens when a person forms a perception based on the person's name.
For example, an employee in HR may be more willing to interview someone with a name like Thomas Webster than
someone named Chung Jen Sheum.

             How to avoid: If this is something happening in the HR process, redact the name on the application.
   Unconscious Bias #5: People with disabilities. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2024), 22.5% of people
with disabilities were employed (which means 77.5% were not employed). This is an improvement from 2022.

             How to avoid: Train your employees about disability bias and if you haven't hired people with disabilities, revise
          the HR process.

Best Practice #2--Know Your Data Demographics

If your data have marginalized populations, there are several strategies that are considered best practices for DEI data
visualizations.

  · Use people-first language.

          This could mean "people with disabilities" instead of "disabled people" (Schwabish & Feng, 2021, p. 41).

  · Label people, not skin color.

          Use the phrase "black people" instead of "Blacks" (Schwabish & Feng, 2021, p. 41).

  · Consider missing groups.

          What groups are not included? Consider adding an explanation and indicate if the data are not representative.
          Be careful when sorting to see if bias has a way to creep in or cause the audience to interpret a certain way.
          For example, a well-made infographic developed by Eleonora Nazander showed COVID-19 deaths in the United

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 447
          States among African Americans. It showed that 12.9% of the population was made up of black people; however,
          25% of the black people contracted COVID. Although the infographic included facts, it didn't include any lan-
          guage that explained why. This infographic doesn't use people-first language either. It does show that the death
          rate among African Americans is about two times higher compared with that of the overall population in the
          United States, but audience members might be asking "Why?"

                           Nazander, E. (2022). Yes. Tableau Public. http://tiny.cc/ywx2yz

                    · Consider colors carefully.

          In the United States, red and blue represent two political parties. In another country those colors could mean
          something else.

             You are reinforcing stereotypes when you don't consider skin tones. For example, the habit of using baby pink
          for "girl" and baby blue for "boy" (Schwabish & Feng, 2021, p. 41).

             Avoid using incremental color palettes (light to dark) to represent different demographic groups (Schwabish &
          Feng, 2021, p. 14).

  · Don't use "other" as a catchall category.

          Recently, a thesis student conducted a survey where a substantial number of participants left a category blank.
          The student came up with a potential category called "preferred not to answer" as well as "identity not listed in
          the survey." These are both good examples to use instead of "Other" (Schwabish & Feng, 2021).

  · Icons and shapes

          Your audience will appreciate icons and shapes to help emphasize the data, but use them with caution. Avoid
          icons that are stereotypical or discriminatory.

             For more information, consider reading the following 44-page report written by Schwabish & Feng (2021). The
          authors discuss various ways to be more equitable and inclusive with data visualizations. It also includes racial
          equity in data visualization checklist, and dozens of resources.

8.6 Remote Burnout--I'm Zoomed Out!

       On a video call the only way to show we're paying attention is to look at the camera. But, in real life, how often
       do you stand within three feet of a colleague and stare at their face? Probably never.

          --L. Fosslien and M. Duffy, How to Combat Zoom Fatigue

The best way to approach this section is to look at the growing number of hours spent in virtual meetings after COVID-19
and what kind of strategies can help make the meeting more productive and engaging. While remote meetings offer
flexibility and convenience, they present unique challenges that lead to burnout. The novelty wore off years ago; now,
86% of remote full-time employees report burnout. According to Dr. Gleb Tsipursky (2023), "The fundamental root cause
of work from home (WFH) burnout stems from organizations adapting their existing ways of interacting in `office cul-
ture' to remote work" (para. 1). Dr. Tsipursky lists 12 reasons for WFH burnout.

 1. Deprivation of our basic human need for meaning and purpose,
 2. Deprivation of our basic human need for connection,
 3. Deprivation of building trust,
 4. Deprivation of mentoring and informal professional development,
 5. It's not simply "Zoom fatigue,"
 6. Replacing office culture with activities that don't work well (Zoom happy hours, Virtual water cooler),
 7. Lack of virtual technology skills,
 8. Lack of skills in effective virtual communication,
 9. Lack of skills in effective virtual collaboration,
10. Lack of accountability,
11. Poor work-from-home environments,
12. Poor work/life boundaries.

When organizations faced the emergency of COVID, transferring your work model made sense, but now it's time to dis-
cuss the strategies and cultural change needed to make the WFH model work long-term.

Strategy #1--Help Your Team Find Meaning, Purpose, and Connection

It is expected that by 2025, 32.6 million Americans will work from home, "which equates to about 22% of the workforce"
(Haan, 2023, para. 5). Traditional workspaces must be shaped to support WFH employees. Organizations should be will-
ing to provide the necessary equipment, WIFI support, remote helpdesk support, and organizational strategies for doc-
ument sharing. As a leader of a virtual team, you should "establish a new norm for how you will work together virtually"
(American Management Association, 2020, para. 7). There is no one-size-fits-all approach to motivating productive team
interaction. What is (or was) successful for a face-to-face team meeting doesn't always translate well to a virtual meet-
ing. Most organizations used the sink-or-swim model during the COVID-19 pandemic; now it's time to be intentional in
your leadership.

   Job Craft: According to Amy Wrzesniewski (2020), when employees lost their traditional work experience, they lost
their interdependence with others and the relationships that grow as a result of working toward a common purpose.
WFH employees often don't feel they belong as part of a collective. Wrzesniewski did an in-depth study of hospital cus-
todians to uncover how the happiest staff were also the most effective custodians. She coined the term job crafting to
describe how custodial workers would "create the work they wanted to do out of the work they'd been assigned" (Cole-
man, 2017, para. 6). Wrzesniewski shared several examples of job crafting. One custodian rearranged artwork for the

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 449
comatose patient's brain; another custodian researched the chemicals used to clean and figured out which chemicals
caused the least irritation to the patient's condition. Neither of these things were part of the job assignment; instead,
the employees job-crafted their work to find meaning.

   As a virtual team leader, meet individually with your team members and help them to job-craft. Ask questions like:
             What do you miss about working at the office?
             Do you have a workspace at home that is only for work?
             Do you have a morning ritual that you used to enjoy at work (for example, some individuals would gather at

          the coffeepot in an informal setting upon arrival at work). For example, did you listen to an audiobook on your
          commute, or listen to a podcast?

             Do you have a routine that differentiates "work" and "not at work"?
             What part of your work gives you joy or helps you find meaning?
   Connecting: Fostering connections requires routines to support them when you move from an office that you com-
mute to compared to an office at home. Although we laughed at some of the virtual meeting gaffs (getting caught wear-
ing pajama bottoms, being told you're on mute, children, cats and animals stealing the camera), as leaders we need to
find a new norm for the WFH employee. Employees forge connections often cultivating an informal sounding board for
ideas during breaks from a face-to-face meeting. How can individuals grow that connection in a virtual meeting?
   As a virtual team leader, meet individually with your team members and help them find ways to connect. Ask questions
like these:
             What connections do you miss in your WFH office?
             What were the informal communications you enjoyed when you worked at the corporate office?
             Have you kept in communication with another team member?
             Do you connect better in small groups (like breakout rooms)?
             Do you need social interactions before, during or after the meeting?

Strategy #2--Building Trust

Building trust in a virtual setting is more difficult but it is worth it. According to a study in Harvard Business Review,
high-trust companies report "74% less stress, 106% more energy at work, 50% higher productivity, 13% few sick days,
76% more engagement, 29% more satisfaction with their lives, and 40% less burnout" (Zak, 2017, para 2). "Studies have
shown linkages between trust and positive outcomes such as employee satisfaction, performance, collaboration, knowl-
edge sharing, successful negotiation, postmerger integration, and favorable joint venture outcomes" (Mansour & Zeheer,
2021, p. 2).

   Interpersonal trust and trustworthiness are founded on three key characteristics: ability, benevolence, and integrity.
For example, "Leaders who are perceived to be competent are generally viewed as trustworthy" (Mansour & Zeheer,
2021, p. 3). Trust is much more difficult to foster in virtual settings when you collaborate with people (or cultures) you
don't know as well. If you are assigned to work together on a project, you assume you can "trust" your team to fully con-
tribute.

   Trust is a foundational building block to a successful team and is measured differently in different cultures. A mea-
surement of trust is one of the outcomes of the World Values Survey. This survey is conducted in waves (the seventh
wave ended in 2022) and includes 90 countries. The following map is from the seventh wave, and answers the question
from the survey, "Generally speaking, would you say that most people in your country can be trusted or that you need
to be very careful in dealing with people?" (Haerpfer et al., 2020, Dataset WVS Wave).

   In the Our World in Data organization's website, you can find dozens of charts and maps that relate to trust. And the
best part? Since this is a longitudinal study, you can see the change from 1984 to 2022 with a click of a button.

                 In Exhibit 8.3, one of the examples of a change in trust was in Norway. In 1984, Norwegian citizens who
              participated in the study agreed 55.5% with the statement "Most people can be trusted," but by 2022, Norway
agreed with this statement 72.1%. Virtual teams are becoming more global and although that brings a richer perspective,
it can also create new challenges related to culture.
   According to Javidan & Zaheer (2021), it is easier to trust others who share commonalities, are from similar cultural
and ethnic backgrounds, and share common values and beliefs. These authors built a 3D Trust Building Process that has
three steps:

 1. Discovering the national cultural approaches to trust;
2. Discussing similarities and differences in trust building approaches, and
3. Developing a team-based protocol for trust building.

The entire 3D Trust Building Process takes about three hours to complete with your team. The kinds of questions (all
from the 3D Trust Building Process) include the following:

   Discovery:
             How trusting is my national culture?
             What criteria do managers in my culture typically use when deciding whether or not to trust a colleague?
             As an individual, how close am I in my personal approach to trust versus my cultural approach to trust?

   Discuss similarities and differences:
             What are the major similarities and differences among members' national cultural approaches?
             What are the big surprises?
             What are the key learnings?

   Develop a team-based protocol:
             Develop a trust etiquette (protocol).

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 451
             Consider actions that either enhance or violate trust.
             If trust is violated, what is the path to rebuild trust (Javidan & Zaheer, 2021, p. 5)?

Strategy #3--Professional Development: Skills for Effective Communication

Set the right tone for professional development for teams and leaders. Invest in professional development training that
helps the team perform better with higher levels of productivity. If the team suffers from a lack of trust, start with the
3D Trust Building Process.

   How you as a leader can build trust. It starts with a safe environment where your team can express themselves and take
risks. Encourage open communication with anonymous surveys. Leaders should establish clear expectations, be open,
authentic, and transparent. Leaders should provide regular feedback individually. Be constructive and follow through.
The purpose of building trust is for team members to develop tools to prevent premature judgment, miscommunication,
and trust-damaging behaviors.

   "Honesty is paramount!" Have you ever had a leader say "I'll send a follow-up email" but you're still waiting for the fol-
low-up a week later? Or has your team leader promised a short meeting that goes beyond the planned time? As a leader,
if you don't honor your commitments, you lose trust.

   There is no such thing as overcommunicating. Choose your medium carefully. Sometimes a phone call works better
than an email. Watch your tone and make sure your message matches how you say it. A psychology professor, Albert
Mehrabian introduced the 7-38-55 rule where 7% of meaning comes from the spoken word, 38% from voice, and 55%
through body language. In a virtual environment, set your tone to match your facial features to send a consistent mes-
sage. Consider these factors to set the tone--word and sentence stress, the right pace, pauses, pitch, intonation. Addi-
tionally, foster a culture of communication with regular updates and check-ins. Remove ambiguity and outline what kind
of messages should be sent through which mediums.

   Don't multitask. When attending meetings, the sound of somebody's keyboard clicking can be disruptive. When you
see an email pop up on your screen, fight the desire to answer it immediately. Instead turn off email pop-ups and set
your phone to silent.

   Know the technology. Know the technology and make sure any documents are shared appropriately. Learn tips on the
technology you are using. For example, Zoom has an AI component that will gather a summary of the meeting. Always
activate closed captioning. For members of your team--provide professional development to learn how to use the tech-
nology. Don't leave them struggling.

   Keep it professional. Work from an agenda. Ask team members to always start with their name with each comment.
Wear professional clothes and keep good posture (no slouching). Avoid the emoji and funny gifs in your instant messag-
ing platform. Ensure accountability. What is professional for one team may be different for another team.

   Use prereadings and prerecorded videos. If team members are international, what fatigue busting strategies could be
used? Include prereadings or even prerecorded video sections by the team leads that can be disseminated prior to the
meetings to help keep the message on track, and time spent in the meeting "familiarizing" the team with the material
to keep the meetings shorter. For international team members, sharing information to review prior will help those who
need more time to digest the information.

Strategy #4--Collaboration and Accountability

No one likes to work on a team where the leader does not consider time zone differences, address language barriers,
or face tardy or absent team members because they were confused on the time. Policies that indicate the common lan-
guage, the use of translators and closed captioning, and clear guidelines for scheduled meetings are necessary. Provide

452 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
tools like a time zone converter and use meeting reminders. Both collaboration and accountability are necessary for
a productive and engaged team. And teams work better if each individual team member leverages their strengths and
knows they will be held accountable.

   Collaboration benefits from knowing your strengths: One of the ways to increase collaboration is to provide profes-
sional development using CliftonStrengths Assessment to discover individual team member's strengths. The assessment
takes about 45 minutes and has 177 questions in English (you only have 20 seconds to answer each question). If your pro-
ficiency in English is a barrier, you can contact Gallup, and they will turn the timer off. After taking the assessment, Gal-
lop provides a Strengths Insight Guide report. As you review the report, highlight the statements that seem to describe
you.

   The assessment can be followed up by watching the CliftonStrengths Theme Descriptions on YouTube to get a short
(under 2 minutes) message about each strength. For example, assume your top strength is Achiever. What does that
mean for your team? "Having someone with dominant Achiever on your team means you have a natural pacesetter.
They derive joy in doing and can help other people accomplish more" (Clifton Strengths Theme Description--Achiever
Strength, 2020, Video 1). Achievers also like visualization for keeping track of progress. Learning the strengths of your
team is just as important as learning your own strengths. Leveraging your top strength(s) makes you more productive
and you will feel more accomplished.

Accountability: Accountability needs defined for your team. Start by identifying the specific metrics you want to track.
For example, missed deadlines, project completion rates, new products launched, might be some of the areas that you
develop key performance indicators (KPIs). Create SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-
bound) first for your team and then individually for the members of the team.

   Examples of SMART goals for a Dev Opps team could be:
             The team will develop the code to support 10 new products this quarter.
             The team will clear up 50% of the work request (helpdesk) tickets this quarter.
             The team will explore at least two potential partnerships (outlets) to determine if their production facility

          could be used for our company's order overload.
   Now create clear and achievable goals for each employee. A big part of assigning tasks in this case will depend on
coding skills. It will be up to the leader to regularly assess progress toward the goals to gauge individual accountability.
Holding your team accountable should also include regular performance reviews to discuss achievements, challenges,
and areas that need improvement.

Strategy #5--Overcome Zoom Fatigue

Zoom fatigue is a real concern. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers indicated that intense computer usage was
not healthy for employees. Zoom (or any virtual platform) adds a new layer to the complexity.

   Plain Backgrounds: What's the correct number of virtual meetings for you and your team(s) to have each week? An
excess number of virtual team meetings and expect your team to start zoning out. As you meet with a team of 10, it's
like meeting in 10 rooms at once. Your eyes see the furniture, plants, collection of comic books, collection of historical

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 453
figures, and so on. The brain has to process all these cues at once. There are a couple suggestions: (a) turn off the camera
unless you are speaking, and (b) ask everyone to use a plain background.

   Frequent Breaks and length of meeting: Consider shorter meetings and frequent minibreaks with some scheduled
blocks of time between meetings. Require teams to stand up, get a cup of coffee, or cold drink.

   Social Virtual Meetings should be optional: Not all team members will want to socialize virtually after a long day of
required virtual meetings. Keep social meetings optional and feature your best facilitators. A poorly run "gather around
the virtual cooler" doesn't work.

   If you have a budget, try one of these:
             Send your team a s'mores kit (a tea candle, a toothpick, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows) by

          mail and have your best facilitator organize some virtual campfire activities.
             Do a pet event. Send a goodie bag to the pet and pet owners.
             Participate in online games like remote work bingo, a virtual escape room, or web games.
             Learn skills together. Do a creative writing workshop, cooking lesson, coding bootcamp, or even self-defense

          class. You can all become part of a class at Udemy, or find other online classes.
             If your team appreciates music, host a virtual jam session and invite your team members to bring their instru-

          ments. If you have singers, try a karaoke song or two that everyone knows the chorus to (e.g., "I Will Survive" by
          Gloria Gaynor, "Respect" by Aretha Franklin, "Total Eclipse of the Heart" by Bonnie Tyler).

Strategy #6--Visualization Tips for Presenting in Zoom

Part of Zoom burnout can be the distraction of this medium. There are several visualization tips for Zoom that can
reduce Zoom fatigue as well as connect with your audience. Use PowerPoint slides to articulate your insight with a
headline. Use color as a technique so a specific color follows an insight throughout the presentation. Limit the number
of colors so your audience can follow the visual cue. If you want to use images, select images that match your audience's
expertise and set the story's tone. A more technical audience can handle complex visualizations and drilling (or filtering).
A general audience will appreciate simple bar graphs. Even if you meet daily, remember that data without a story lack
impact. And if you are creating the visuals for the Zoom meeting, don't try to show ALL of it.

   Follow these three tips before you even start visualizing the data:

  · Purpose: What am I trying to achieve with the data? Do the data I've chosen move the story forward?
  · Expectations: Who is my audience, and what level of data detail will they expect?
  · Takeaway: What is the key takeaway for my audience? If you had to pick one data point, what would it be?

Follow these Zoom tips to reduce distraction:

  · Have you ever said, "You're muted" in a Zoom meeting? Use the space bar to mute and unmute your microphone.
  · Have you struggled using breakout rooms? Use the answer to a poll question to organize the breakout rooms.
  · Have you wished for an organized summary of the meeting? Try Zoom's new AI Summary feature. You can set it so

      that only meeting hosts receive a summary. Or if you prefer, try the note feature, which can be shared with other
      collaborators while in a meeting.

8.7 Leadership and Communication

       Great leaders communicate and great communicators lead.

454 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
          --Simon Sinek, English American author and inspirational speaker

Putting It All Together Through the Lens of Leadership

This text has thrown a lot your way in the way of data visualization and storytelling. These are powerful communication
tools that help you reach your audience. Remember that reaching the audience with your information, data, pitches,
and ideas remains largely our chief goal as communicators and leaders. To that pursuit, we've given you tips and tech-
niques designed to offer everything from powerful storytelling narratives noted by Christopher Booker to instructions
on Power BI, the powerful tool designed to foster better interaction with data visualization. We've given you a lot.

   It would be fair to admit at this point that you may be tired and struggling a bit to determine how specifically all these
things fit together for your individual or organizational needs. We've discussed information overload in Chapter 1, and
you may be feeling a bit of that, just as charting next steps and pathways seems out of reach. Despite this feeling, good
leadership often means a bit of fatigue as you strategically make decisions about what to include or not include in your
communication, data visualization, and storytelling. It will be up to you to plot the next steps to help your group or
organization. This section is designed to get you thinking about items we've discussed in the text while also helping you
to plot a path forward.

Leadership in Data Visualization Projects

Leaders make complex decisions based on data. Those data can include considerations for what choices are affordable,
available, efficient, or prioritized. If you ask any leader what choices are off the table, very often they will rely on both
data and experience to narrow available choices. Similarly, leaders make choices about communication within data visu-
alization based on what they know regarding their team. That said, there are expectations of the team for their leaders.
What does your team expect from you, the leader? Does your team know you well enough, that they model the story-
telling and data visualizations you expect to make decisions?

   Below is a leadership in data visualization checklist for leaders to consider:
             1. Leadership is responsible for setting the vision and goals for the data visualization project. This involves

          defining what insights the organization aims to gain from the data and how visualization can help achieve those
          objectives. How is your data visualization displaying your vision and goals?

                       Hint: If you struggle to identify the vision and goals from your own knowledge or data visualization, it is
                    likely an ideal time to clarify the message.
             2. Leaders deal with resource allocation, including budget, time, and personnel, to ensure the success of the
          project. They make strategic decisions about which tools, technologies, and talents are needed for effective data
          visualization. What does your project require among resources? What is already available and what is feasible for
          you to manage?

                       Hint: This could be a great opportunity to gather the team and think exhaustively about which
                    resources are needed or could be used. This may expose you to resources you've overlooked or not often
                    considered. Also, we wrote this text to be accessible for teams just like yours. Feel free to distribute and
                    share the wealth of the resources discussed.
             3. Leadership coordinates the efforts of a multitude of teams involved in data visualization projects including
          authors, data analysts, designers, and domain experts. Effective leadership ensures clear communication, collab-
          oration, and alignment of efforts toward project goals. What strategic steps have been taken to align the team?

                       Hint: Many teams consider a team or project charter for these kinds of opportunities. These charters
                    often discuss project scope, objectives, stakeholders, roles and responsibilities by name, timelines and

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 455
                    milestones, budget, resources, risks and assumptions, communication plans, quality standards, and
                    approval.

                       Note: Leaders determine who in the information flow will receive what information/visuals. In a heavily
                    matrixed organization, at times, data can be micromanaged to the point where some roles are excluded
                    from the flow of critical data.
             4. Leaders engage with audiences across the organization, including executives, managers, and end-users, to
          understand their requirements, gather feedback, and ensure that the visualizations meet their needs. When nec-
          essary, leaders help adjust the content to be even more pertinent based on any feedback.

                       Hint: While many authors may contribute to a message, a strong leader doing quality control with their
                    feedback can see a general picture that other contributors may ignore. Even when such duties have been
                    delegated, leaders are responsible for the final product.
             5. Leadership identifies and mitigates risks associated with data visualization projects, such as data quality
          issues, technical challenges, or resistance to change. They develop contingency plans and navigate obstacles to
          keep the project on track.

                       Hint: Does identifying and mitigating risks sound familiar? You likely noticed that the last two items in
                    the checklist seemed quite similar. Many leadership roles are repetitive. Even with all that duplication,
                    mistakes still happen.
             6. Leaders make informed decisions based on data insights derived from visualizations. They use visualizations
          to gain actionable intelligence, drive strategic initiatives, and solve business problems effectively.

                       Hint: This entire book has been devoted to making choices, data, and ideas clearer in communication.
                    As a leader considering your data visualization, consider whether you find it clear enough to decide from
                    your perspective. If you did not have your existing knowledge about the project, would you still under-
                    stand it? Not sure? Go for a second opinion and be sure to listen carefully.
             7. Leadership facilitates change management efforts associated with adopting data-driven decision-making
          processes enabled by visualization. They promote a culture of data literacy, encourage adoption of visualization
          tools, and champion best practices across the organization.

                       Hint: If you are not leaning into making data-driven decisions, why should anyone else? Always remem-
                    ber that the culture you are creating and supporting with your decision-making will be modeled on by
                    your team. If you utilize strong data visualization in your ideas and decision-making, so will they.
             8. Leaders ensure the quality and accuracy of visualizations by establishing standards, conducting reviews,
          and providing guidance to the team. They enforce best practices in data visualization design and storytelling to
          enhance comprehension and usability.

                       Hint: A little quality and accuracy assurance can go a long way to ensure the kind of audience-centered
                    deliverables that are key to your work.
             9. Leadership fosters a culture of continuous improvement and flexibility by monitoring key performance
          indicators (KPIs), soliciting feedback, and iterating on visualizations based on user experiences and evolving busi-
          ness needs.

                       Hint: If you display an attitude that is unwilling to change, it will permeate your organizational culture
                    and not assist you in reaching goals. Keep in mind, data visualization trends today will continue to evolve
                    as practice is influenced by audience and market needs. How will you monitor those trends, make space
                    for learning new best practices, and continuously evolve?
   This is not a one-and-done process. Instead, key parts of the checklist for leading with data visualization may overlap,
be taken out of sequence, or simply exist in whole or part while complementing one another.

insight into traditional leadership positions that don't hold up in tough situations. As you evaluate, consider how these
observations intersect with your own experiences.

Reinforcing a Data-Driven Culture

Managing a data-driven culture involves fostering an environment where data are valued, accessible, and utilized effec-
tively to drive decision-making and innovation. Leadership must champion the importance of data-driven decision-
making, particularly as evidenced in the steps outlined in the leading with data visualization checklist. This involves not
only advocating for the use of data but also demonstrating their value through actions and decisions. It also involves
clearly defining the objectives of becoming data-driven to answer the "So what?" questions that often come from orga-
nizational members. What specific goals do you want to achieve? This could include improving operational efficiency,
enhancing customer satisfaction, or driving innovation.

   The growth in available data has certainly not been matched by our ability to consume this information. This is why
it is important to create key internal policies to help govern decision-making. Establish data governance policies and
procedures to ensure data quality, security, and compliance. This involves defining roles and responsibilities, data stan-
dards, and protocols for data collection, storage, and usage. It also helps to limit constant data pursuits that can some-
times replace organizational decision-making with a cycle of analysis paralysis. More than once, we've all been in a
meeting that seeks to replace actual decisions with a desire to collect just a bit more data. Remember that leadership
means understanding decision-making opportunities and reacting appropriately when prompted, even if not all the
available data have been collected. None of these situations are top-down or embody a one-size fits all approach, but
rather exist in a way that requires key decision-making as appropriate.

   Additionally, to support a data-driven culture, it is important to invest in the necessary infrastructure and technolo-
gies. This may include data warehouses, analytics tools, and data visualization platforms, such as much of the software
and tools we've discussed in this text. It is important to ensure that these tools are accessible and user-friendly for orga-
nizational members at all levels. It may also involve asking for expertise from among those who are knowledgeable about
such things. It may also mean investing in data literacy and other forms of training. This includes teaching employees
how to interpret and analyze data, as well as how to use data tools effectively in their roles. A good leader will encourage
collaboration between data specialists and other teams within the organization. Data-driven decision-making is not just
the responsibility of the data team; it should involve input from stakeholders across the organization.

   Reinforcing a data-driven culture. This helpful article from B Eye at LinkedIn further discusses how to support data-
driven cultures in organizations. It also notes some key metrics happening in the organizational marketplace that make
supporting data-driven cultures so important.

Ethical Considerations While Leading With Data Visualization

As a leader managing data, it is very important to remember that behind every data visualization are humans receiving
information or being represented in the findings. There is much to consider when it comes to managing ethics and data

                                                                                                Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 457
visualization, including data privacy, precision, diversity, and transparency. Figure 8.21 highlights some of those key con-
siderations that leaders should consider, and Section 8.5 can be reviewed for DEI best practices.

                                                                                                                                (2024)

As a leader, it may be helpful to empower a team to regularly evaluate these ethical dimensions. Such teams can meet
periodically and answer key questions:

             1. How is data privacy being protected?
             2. Are data being portrayed accurately and truthfully?
             3. Are messages inclusive and appropriate for the audience?
             4. Are clear explanations available on where data are sourced? Can most audience members locate this key

                  information?
The answers to these questions may not be readily available or easy to identify. Still, the fact that you are thinking
458 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
through these possibilities demonstrates ethical leadership in data visualization and that further supports your overall
credibility.

Communication Action Plans as Part of Your Strategy

Now that you have thought about your leadership and communication overall, along with considering the many tools
within this text, you may find it helpful to develop a strategy in which you seek to put these good ideas and tools to work.
A Communication Action Plan (CAP) is an effective way to do just that. We've seen many communicators implement real
change in their leadership styles by adopting this strategy to implement change.

   A CAP serves as a written plan for an individual, a team, or an organization. CAPs do this by adopting SMART goals.
SMART identifies goals that are strategic, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. Using these SMART goals
through such a strategy as the CAP allows the user to identify potential change, consider how best to implement, and
then hold the process accountable.

   Exhibit 8.4--Communication Action Plan (CAP)

                                                                                               Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 459

                                                                                                                                                          (2024)

Using a CAP is not exclusive to just a one-time implementation. CAPs should be built into your schedule and allow you
to regularly assess how change can be made. If you consider exhaustively the tools in this book, you could go chapter
by chapter and assess what new tools or techniques are most helpful and set several CAPs to commence in the coming
days and months. This regular process of deep consideration for what works well aligns with the checklist of leadership
components discussed at the start of this chapter. It also demonstrates an easy way for leaders to do the heavy lifting of
making change in their individual and organizational communication.

   Another technique is to set aside an hour each week for your team to explore new software (or the nuances of existing
software), new techniques, or research. This type of practice moves you toward a learning culture, which is given credit
for increased employee engagement, setting a foundation for a growth mindset, improving creativity and motivation,
and cultivating leadership and emotional intelligence. Just keeping pace with rapidly changing technology is a challenge.

   Max Roser (2023) shared the change in technology, from the distant past, and into the distant future at Our World in
Data. According to Roser, "In addition to this trend towards increasingly rapid innovation, . . . technology has become
460 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
increasingly powerful. While our ancestors wielded stone tools, we are building globe-spanning AI systems and tech-
nologies that can edit our genes" (para. 20). Follow the link connected to Figure 8.22 to see details of just how much has

                        Bryan leads a team, and he feels like he is not getting results. New to the organization and this

                     particular team, he repeatedly feels disappointed; the meetings appear less than productive, even to
     him and his usual laid-back ways. As he often tells anyone who will listen, the previous organization he led
     operated very differently with productive close-knit meetings. With this current team, Bryan observes disen-
     gaged team members, decisions driven by anecdotes or opinions, and lots of directionless discussions. In the
     last three meetings alone, not one single person had presented any sort of evidence to support the arguments
     they were making, although opinions ran high.

        The start of the meetings usually involves more than a few minutes trying to figure out who set up the Zoom
     link, who will be joining remotely, and where to position the monitor for those in the virtual room to be able to
     see their hybrid teammates. Several accompanying technology issues usually contribute to this process.
     Repeatedly team members complain that they'd like to better understand new technology and software but are
     not sure where to turn next. No training or development dollars have been allocated for such a purpose, and in
     a recent data download, it was revealed that the team had no way to analyze the information they had received
     in a key business quarter. After a frustrating period of outsourcing the information with key customer data, the
     group finally gave up hope of understanding any of it and returned to the default decision-making of anecdote
     and opinion, to which they were most accustomed.

         1. What is Bryan and his team doing wrong, if anything?
        2. What initial steps, based on this chapter or the text, do you think assist them in addressing their man-

             agement of data?
        3. How much responsibility does Bryan have for the present situation faced by the team? What should he

             be doing, specifically?

Chapter 8 Summary

This chapter delves into the multifaceted nature of communication issues, exploring them through the lenses of gender,
culture, multigenerational dynamics, and DEI topics. It underscores the importance of adopting best practices such
as people-first labeling, purposeful ordering of labels, considering missing groups, avoiding stereotyping, and using
appropriate icons and shapes. The authors highlight strategies used by global leaders to foster effective communication
across these diverse groups, emphasizing the role of leadership in mitigating burnout especially in a virtual meeting.

   Effective communication requires a nuanced understanding of audience dynamics, cultural subtleties, and cognitive
biases. By equipping readers with these insights, the authors aim to enable the use of data visualizations as powerful
tools for driving meaningful dialogue and fostering inclusivity.

   Gender communication issues are complex and deeply ingrained in societal norms, influencing aspects like commu-

462 | Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps
nication styles, occupational choices, emotional expression, and leadership styles. Understanding and challenging these
gender tendencies can dismantle stereotypes and promote inclusivity. These tendencies are not fixed, are socially con-
structed, and vary across cultures.

   The rise of global business and the pandemic-induced shift to remote work have heightened the need for cross-cul-
tural communication. Upwork's survey of U.S. hiring managers reveals significant changes in management practices due
to the pandemic, particularly in team meetings and internal communication. This shift underscores the importance of
training in cross-cultural communication to navigate the diverse and globalized work environment effectively.

   Company culture varies significantly between large corporations and smaller organizations. In large established com-
panies, leadership is held by the Baby Boomer generation, whereas Millennials and Gen Z are more prominent in start-
ups. Nonprofits typically feature a mix of generations in their leadership. The authors note that a toxic company culture,
characterized by low engagement and high turnover, often arises when generational values clash. Multigenerational
workforces add another layer of complexity to organizational communication.

   This chapter also explores the challenges and strategies of communicating data insights to a diverse audience.
Effective data visualization and storytelling are crucial in a data-driven organization, but organizational culture often
impedes the full utilization of analytics. The integration of DEI principles in data visualization is essential to avoid per-
petuating biases and to ensure that all voices are represented. Key factors that contribute to burnout stemming from
remote working from home (WFH) are discussed and strategies to address them are provided.

   The authors conclude both the chapter and the textbook by emphasizing the importance of data visualization and
storytelling as communication tools. The authors acknowledge the potential for information overload and encourage
readers to strategically integrate the discussed techniques to enhance your own communication and leadership efforts.

Chapter 8 Case: Cross-Cultural Leadership and Communication in a Global
Tech Firm

Introduction

                    You are Maria, a senior project manager at Global Tech Options (GTO), a leading technology firm with
                    offices in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. GTO has recently embarked on a major initiative to
                    develop a new AI-driven data analytics platform. This project involves collaboration across multiple
                    departments and geographic locations, making effective communication and leadership crucial to its suc-
                    cess. As the project leader, you must navigate gender, cultural, and generational differences while inte-
grating principles of DEI into your communication strategies.
   GTO has always prided itself on innovation and inclusivity. However, recent employee feedback highlighted several
communication challenges, particularly related to cross-cultural and multigenerational interactions. These challenges
include misunderstandings during virtual meetings, stereotyping, and a lack of engagement from younger employees.
There is a growing concern about burnout from work-from-home (WFH) remote workers, especially those from mar-
ginalized groups. WFH workers have expressed concerns that work at the office employees don't seem to trust WFH
workers to complete their work.
   To address these issues, the company's executive board has tasked you with developing a comprehensive communi-
cation strategy that incorporates best practices for gender, cultural, and generational inclusivity. Your strategy should
also include data visualization techniques to enhance understanding and engagement during presentations. They also
want you to research Our World in Data to see if there is a difference in trust as part of a culture from the four locations.
They also want you to create a table using The Culture Factor Group's Country Comparison Tool. Use the Countries tab

                                                                                               Leveraging Data Visualization to Communicate Across Gaps | 463

Personal Observations

You notice that male team members tend to dominate discussions, often interrupting their female colleagues.
   All meetings are set to accommodate time zones in Indianapolis.
   Your team includes Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z employees. Millennials and Gen Z employees

embrace Slack. Baby Boomers don't quite get how it helps, and Gen X employees feel Gen Z makes it too social.
   The data visualizations being used at meetings are based on the premise of red=warning, yellow=monitor, and

green=no issue. Several visualizations don't use people's first language.
   The employee turnover is twice as high for WFH remote employees than for work from office employees.
   Several employees complain about difficulty understanding their Asian and African counterparts in virtual meetings

even though all meetings are conducted in English. Other issues include lack of focus, stereotyping, and lack of engage-
ment from Asian and African counterparts.

   Presentations seem too long, are hard to follow, and the data visualizations are static and disengaging. One Gen Z
employee was overheard saying, "one of the old geezers must have created that slide deck!"
