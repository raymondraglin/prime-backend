                 If you run, you are a runner. It doesn't matter how fast or
                 how far. It doesn't matter if today is your first day or if
                 you've been running for twenty years. There is no test to
                 pass, no license to earn, no membership card to get. You
                 just run. - John Bingham Courage to Start (14)

Hey there, writers. Yes, you. To echo the quotation above by runner and author
John Bingham, if you write, you are a writer.

I joined a running club two years ago, and, for the past two winters, I broke out
my sweatpants and attempted the "Ice Scraper" series. This series of 5-kilometer
(roughly 3.10 mile) races take place in the dead of winter, heedless of rain, sleet,
or snow.

My 5k time is trash to begin with, which is not surprising since I've never been
much of an athlete. My poor coordination skills always guaranteed that I had
been a last-round pick in grade school gym class. However, I wanted to try
running to challenge myself, to become something more than what I already
knew I was.

At the end of one of these frigid 5ks, I was lying face-up on the frozen ground as
flurries started to fall when a fellow writing professor at KU who finished running
the race much earlier came over to say "hi." I had come in nearly last place for
my age group and was utterly exhausted.

Out of breath, I explained, "Well, I'm not a runner."

My wise colleague quickly corrected me by quoting Bingham, and every time
since, those lines have become a mantra when things get tough. If you run, you
are a runner.

I believe that this attitude of belonging is also a key philosophy of college
composition. Developing as a writer takes a good deal of practice, confidence to
try with sincere effort, and-often-embarrassment and frustration when what you
try doesn't work. It's hard. And it's even harder when, all too often, we feel
limited by our skill levels, waiting for some imaginary moment when we will be
good enough to "qualify."

But, if you write, you are a writer.

                                                                      9
I believe that doing things that are outside of our "comfort zone" is part of what
makes us human. Perfection isn't the goal--rather, it's about putting in the
practice time.

It's my hope that you'll take this attitude with you in Composition courses. It
might mean that you take a leap and try a new style of writing that's completely
unfamiliar to you. Or, that you take an extra shot at revising that particularly
frustrating essay. Or, that you speak with your professor about what you need to
do to take your writing skills to the next level.

What this mantra also means is that, as fellow writers, we all belong to a writing
community. This community includes your classmates at Kutztown University, but
also your professors and all the authors you will read and respond to. In this
community, we will also want to hear your voice contributing to the conversation.

And we all start somewhere. The following chapters of this digital textbook are
designed to give you some guidance on improving your writing skills, your
knowledge of academic conventions, and your awareness of writing resources
specific to Kutztown University such as the library and writing center. These
chapters are also written by your own Kutztown University professors and include
examples from current and former Kutztown students to invite you to learn from
their experiences. If you are coming from outside of the Kutztown University
community, you are welcome to use this book as well and may find chapters two
through eight applicable to you.

Your professor might use pieces of this textbook in their course, leave it for you
to reference on your own, or they might follow it straight through depending on
their own course structure. Throughout the book, there are activities, discussion
topics, mini quizzes, links to readings, and more that might be assigned as
homework or completed on your own.

Composition can be approached in many ways, using different topics, writing
styles, and assignments. What unifies the COMP100 courses at KU is that each is
designed to meet the same student learning objectives:

          · Describe and evaluate their own composing processes

          · Write in order to discover and learn

          · Analyze others' writing to identify and assess their audiences, purposes,
            rhetorical strategies, and supporting evidence

          · Write for different audiences and purposes

                                                                     10
          · Apply a range of rhetorical strategies and techniques to their own writing

          · Write in a variety of genres used in academic and public contexts

          · Attribute the work of other writers and creators in appropriate ways

          · Substantially revise their written work for content and form

          · Rewrite in order to have improved control over the grammar, syntax,
            and conventions of the English language

You might notice that none of the above objectives requires perfection. Rather,
they emphasize awareness, adaptability, and advancement. We might even call
these the real "As" over and above any grade achievement. In a nutshell, the
goal is that you become a writer who cultivates an awareness of yourself and
others so that you can adapt to your writing environments and advance your
skills as an effective writer. This textbook is designed to help you achieve these
goals.

Because the writing center at Kutztown University is there for you at any stage of
the writing process, whether you are just beginning to brainstorm or polishing a
revision draft, Chapter 1 of this textbook is "Using the Writing Center at KU." The
writing center tutors have been trained to help you develop awareness of your
own writing processes, so visiting the writing center can help you achieve many
of the goals in the learning objective list above. In this chapter, Writing Center
Director, Dr. Patty Pytleski, will take you through how to sign up for a session and
what to expect when you visit the writing center. The chapter concludes by
offering advice from real writing center tutors to help your visit be a success.

Chapter 2, "The Rhetorical Situation," is all about how to "read the room" to
understand the choices writers make, and how to become an adaptable writer
yourself. Every situation is different, and becoming an effective writer will mean
different things in every situation. This chapter will help you assess audience,
purpose, and genre to become a more effective reader and writer.

Chapter 3, "The Shape of Rhetoric" goes over the rhetorical techniques of ethos,
pathos, and logos to show how authors can deploy these tools in service of the
rhetorical situation. KU Professor Dr. Colleen Clemens contributes a section on
pronouns and Dr. Brian Land from Temple University contributes a section on
logos.

In Chapter 4, "Telling Stories: Narrative Writing Conventions," Professor Julie
King guides you on writing your own story. Professor King introduces the basic

                                                                     11
conventions of non-fiction narratives and demonstrates how to use storytelling
techniques. Narratives are powerful tools that can be used in a variety of
rhetorical situations not limited to a short story, and you might use these
techniques in a persuasive essay, marketing proposal, cover letter, or a research
paper.

Chapter 5, "Generating Ideas and Topic Proposals," by former KU professor Sean
Weaver, addresses one of the hardest challenges we face particularly when
beginning a new writing essay project: coming up with an idea or proposing a
topic. In this chapter, Dr. Weaver introduces various methods writers use to
explore potential writing ideas, considers how to respond to prompts, and shows
methods of broadening or narrowing various topic ideas. By emphasizing the idea
that topics/ideas constantly evolve throughout the writing and research process,
this chapter demonstrates that our writing choices are never finite.

In Chapter 6, "Strategies of Organization," KU professor Dr. Robb Fillman
introduces the basic components of an academic argumentative essay. He
provides some time-tested structures that can serve as models for students to
emulate when writing persuasively. While there is no single, "correct" way to
sequence an essay, this chapter presents some practical approaches to improve
the organization of your drafts. This chapter also explores "process" methods,
which are designed to help you evaluate how well your draft's arrangement of
ideas is working as you revise.

Chapter 7, "Usage and Mechanics," provides strategies to build control over the
grammar of the English language. By revisiting the rhetorical situation, we can
see writing as a series of situation-specific choices with many possible answers
rather than a single right and wrong. Dr. Todd Dodson gives tips in this chapter
on reducing wordiness in your writing.

Chapter 8, "Revision and Peer Review," reframes revision as space for productive
failure, and peer review as conversation. In this chapter, Dr. Amy Lynch-Biniek
takes some of the apprehension out of the writing process by acknowledging that
sharing our work with others can be anxiety-inducing and receiving criticism even
more so. By showing us how to give and receive productive commentary, we
learn how to better revise our work as well as recognize a wider potential for
productive variations in writing.

In Chapter 9, "Using the Rohrbach Library at Kutztown University," KU Librarian
and Assistant Professor Sue Czerny gives an overview of the many services the

                                                                     12
library provides to help with any research and writing projects including using the
new library website.

Chapter 10, "Ethical and Effective Attribution," begins with a discussion of the
purpose of attribution beyond the avoidance of plagiarism. It discusses issues in
ethics-including AI-and the importance of attribution in many genres of writing.
Activities cover paraphrase, summary, quotation, footnoting, and citation in
academic and professional contexts.

Finally, an Afterword, "Writing For and Beyond KU," offers some opportunities and
challenges in sharing your writing with broader audiences.

Throughout each chapter, links in conventional blue with an underline, like this
one to the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC),
might take you to an online resource outside of this text. If you find that any of
these are broken, you can send a quick email to me at sleonard@kutztown.edu.
Other links in bold such as this one to genre, are internal links that will take you
to relevant sections of the textbook that will explain a concept in more detail.

So, writers, wherever you are in your writing journey, it is my hope that this
textbook and your experiences in Composition courses will help you practice and
develop your craft. As members in the writing community, we may be at different
places in our development, but we are in it together.

                                           plagiarism. She also has a scholarly and personal
                                           interest in table-top rpgs and video games. She has
                                           many other interests including playing French horn
                                           and roller derby. She is a bad runner, but a runner
                                           nonetheless.

The Kutztown University Writing Center (KUWC) is dedicated to supporting
scholarship, creativity, and composition on campus. Since its inception in 2000,
the KUWC has been helping undergraduate and graduate student writers from
various disciplines across campus improve their compositions for classes as well
as their own private work. Originally housed in Old Main, KUWC now resides in
Rohrbach Library Room 100c on the main level, conveniently located near the
library's main computer bank.

The KUWC's mission is to reach undergraduate and graduate student writers
through the medium they prefer (online or in person) and to offer informational
and educational sessions to faculty teaching any and all disciplines across
campus. Additionally, the KUWC's undergraduate and graduate tutors receive
continuous training and professional development through campus resources,
fostering best practices in Composition and Rhetoric in order to meet the needs
of a diverse population of student writers. Tutors share their advice and
pedagogical knowledge during writing sessions at the yearly Kutztown University
Composition Conference, and with faculty and the students within their classes.

Originally only an in-person center, the KUWC now offers one-on-one writing
sessions both in-person in RL 100c and online via the platform WCOnline. The
online center opened during KU's closing in 2020 during the pandemic and has
remained a useful supplement to the in-person center, allowing students to have

                                                                     14

one-on-one when away
from campus or when it
is more comfortable
and/or convenient in
their own chosen
setting. WCOnline also
caters to different
learning styles; some
students not only prefer
online sessions for time
management but also
feel they learn best this
way.

To make an in-person 30-minute writing session appointment, call 610-683-4733
or email wrcenter@kutztown.edu. Additionally, you can walk into the center to
make appointments or make an appointment on the signup sheet located outside
the RL100c KUWC door when the center is closed.

                             Students are invited to bring ideas and drafts of

                             their work for any class and from any stage of the

                             writing process. KUWC tutors welcome students

                             literary analyses, research papers in the sciences,

teaching philosophies, social science case studies, business plans, and creative

writing.

The main goal of the KUWC is to aid students in exploring the writing process,
considering purpose, audience, organization, and genre. Through friendly
conversation, students and tutors collaborate and discuss the improvement of the
student's writing and methods to develop the students' skills for future writing
endeavors.

The KUWC's writing tutors can also help you with any citation questions you
might have. Knowledgeable about APA, MLA, Chicago, CSE, and other less used
citation styles, tutors help students confidently use reference materials as they

                                     16
ethically document the sources of their citations. While the KUWC offers advice
about citation styles based on major, discipline, and concentration, tutors will
encourage students to speak to their professors and look to assignment sheets
for guidance about required citation styles.
The KUWC website provides an abundance of helpful material on citation needs,
as well as instruction and guidance about the writing process, navigating
research, writer's block, thesis statements, topic sentences, transitions, and
clarity in writing. The KUWC YouTube channel also provides helpful general
information about the KUWC, using library databases, quotation marks, and
navigating Purdue OWL.

When coming to a writing session (online or in-person), you are asked to bring
your assignment and the work you have already produced (in hard copy or on
your computer), professor assignment sheets, and references and sources used
while writing. You will be asked to share your course name/number and your
professor's name with the writing tutor, but you can decide whether or not you
would like the tutor to email your professor with brief confirmation that you
visited the center and what was generally discussed. Some professors encourage
students to have this email sent, but ultimately confidentiality is left in your
hands.
During writing sessions, KUWC staff does not proofread or "fix" papers. Rather,
whether in-person or online, they will sit down with you one-on-one and discuss
the writing, determine possible needs and improvements, and provide advice and
information on revising and growing a writer. Tutors encourage students to direct

                                                                     17
the conversation about their writing and concerns while gently guiding students
to look at additional aspects. The tutors ask friendly questions about the
assignments, the student writers' priorities, and their thinking and voice. In this
way, the KUWC aims to help students understand their writing and improve it in
the context of their courses and assignments, as well as for potential future
writing endeavors.

The KUWC's undergraduate and graduate assistant tutors are well-vetted and
trained, working with undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students and
sharing their support, guidance, and knowledge. Tutors receive training in
content, mechanics, and citations but student writers also benefit from the
tutors' professional development in the following: Disability Services Office
training to help with diverse learners, Safe Space training to ensure all students
feel welcome and safe in the KUWC, and mental health and self-care training and
sharing of counseling and crisis resources.

A free and readily accessible resource, the Kutztown University Writing Center
hopes to help undergraduate and graduate student writers with their writing,
personal and academic, from any subject matter or discipline, and it works with
them to improve their writing for future writing endeavors. Welcoming,
comfortable, student-led, and confidential writing sessions guide students to use
the writing process as they edit and revise their work. The KUWC is designed to
help students connect with their writing, letting them best express their ideas
and share their voices.

Chapter 2: The Rhetorical Situation

                 "...What are you reading?"

                 He glanced down and turned the book upward. It was The Dice
                 Man by Luke Rhinehart, a novel I had not heard of at the
                 time, but which I have since read roughly thirty times. "Is
                 it good?"

                 "All books are good," he said.

                 "That's not true, I said. "I've read some really bad
                 books." I was thinking specifically of Anne of Green
                 Gables, which we'd been forced to read the term before and
                 which was the most stupid, annoying book I'd ever
                 encountered.

                 "They weren't bad books," Phin countered patiently. "They
                 were books that you didn't enjoy. It's not the same thing
                 at all. The only bad books are books that are so badly
                 written that no one will publish them. Any book that has
                 been published is going to be a `good book' for someone."

                 I nodded. I couldn't fault his logic.

                 --The Family Upstairs by Lisa Jewell (93)

What makes any piece of writing "good"? What makes it "bad"? At first glance,
the answers to these questions might seem obvious. After all, throughout our
K-12 education all of us have been tested on our grammar, spelling, and syntax
so that we know how to avoid so-called "bad" writing. And on top of that we all
have been exposed to the very best literature, so that we know what "good"
writing is.

Right?

There's something faulty with this logic, however. If you've ever seen the
uncapitalized poetry of e. e. cummings or the chapter-long sentence in James
Joyce's novel Ulysses, then you know that some of the most well-regarded
writers tend to break the "rules" of writing for greater power or a more
distinctive style. And it's not just the well-established authors of the English
canon who can get away with it. One of the ironies of literature is that over time,
it becomes considered "conventional" and "traditional" writing even though the
reason it was initially valued was that it broke the conventions of traditional
writing of its time.

                                                                     21
But even if we remove "literature" from the equation and consider just how
everyday people ought to write, using textbook-recommended English (often
called "standard English" by linguists with the acknowledgement that it is only
"standard" because it is regarded as such by the majority of speakers and not
because it's the language that the majority of speakers actually use) isn't
appropriate in all circumstances. A text message to a friend won't follow the
same grammatical rules as a cover letter to apply for a job. A business letter
won't be written with the same formatting as an academic essay. An instructional
manual won't have the same tone as a persuasive speech.

As we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on grammar and mechanics,
often even what we generally consider the basic "rules" of grammar are altered
in different settings. Take, for instance, a text message to a friend. It's a
common misconception that texting has fewer grammatical rules than "formal
writing" such as an academic essay. However, this is simply not true. It has
different rules. For example, in a New York Times article entitled "No More
Periods When Texting. Period.," journalist Max Harrison-Caldwell has noted that
periods at the ends of messages convey a seriousness that can be interpreted as
off-putting, angry, or overly formal, so it's often more appropriate to leave them
off friendly messages. The same punctuation that would be expected in an
academic essay or business letter would be inappropriate in the context of a text
as it would convey a different meaning. This is just one example to illustrate that
texting abides by its own grammatical rules--there are emojis that, like dated
slang, can make the speaker seem out of touch, uses of ellipses (...) that are
often interpreted as suggestive, capitalization choices that convey tone, and
many other grammatical rules in texting.

And like all grammatical rules, they are subject to change over time. This is even
more apparent if you see examples of Old, Middle, and Modern English side-by-
side. If one were to use Old or Middle English in any almost context today, it
simply wouldn't be understood. As you can see, the rules of English a thousand,
a hundred, or even ten years ago are different from the rules used right now.
When it comes to language, older isn't necessarily better.

So, if the rules can be broken for artistic reasons, are different in different
contexts, and are always changing, is the quality of writing all in the "eye of the
beholder"? In other words, is there no such thing as "bad books" as Phin
indicates in the passage at the chapter's beginning?

The problem is that the labels of "good" and "bad" have moralistic, aesthetic, and
pragmatic connotations that make these deceptively simplistic terms way too

                                                                     22
loaded to handle this question. So, let's simplify the problem by focusing instead
on what's effective.

In fact, COMP100 at Kutztown University is labeled "Effective Composition" for a
good reason: so that we can acknowledge that different forms of writing are
called for in different circumstances. Because the key to writing effectively is in
fully understanding the situation.

Activity 2.1: Compare "Good" and "Bad" Writing

Pick out one piece of writing that you, personally, think is "bad writing"
and one piece that you think is "good." On your own or with a group of
other students, discuss your basis for your judgment. If you are
comparing your selections with classmates, also compare your
judgements to see where you differ, without attempting to resolve or
agree. If you are working alone, try to pin down what personal tastes
your selections reveal about you.

What Is a "Rhetorical Situation"?

As the introduction indicates, the key to effective composition is in understanding
the situation, which is often called the rhetorical situation. But what is the word
"rhetorical" doing in here?

When people think of the word "rhetoric," usually what comes to mind is the
phrase "rhetorical question"--those sorts of questions that aren't meant to be
answered like normal questions. For example, you might exclaim to a friend,
"What's wrong with you?" when they do something funny, or you might reply to a
request by saying "why not?" Rhetorical questions are called "rhetorical" because
instead of being questions, they are meant to persuade. But this technique is
only one of many possible techniques of persuasion where the practical reality of
what these words do is a bit tricker than we might anticipate.

This complexity has resulted in the fact that the word "rhetoric" also has the poor
reputation of meaning language that is deliberately misleading such as in a
sentence like "please stick to the facts, and spare me the political rhetoric." In
this case, "rhetoric" is synonymous with insincere speech, and, indeed, no one
appreciates being accused of being dishonest or fake.

But, in this regard, rhetoric gets a bad rap. In the field of rhetoric and
composition, "rhetoric" is simply the art of persuasive language. Rhetoric is used
in any persuasive situation from advertisement to argument. It's rhetoric that is

                                                                     23
responsible for the emotion of a fiery speech, the logical presentation of a
scientific claim, and the weight of authority behind a judge's verdict.

In the following sections in this chapter, you will learn how to identify these
"rhetorical methods" as well as the conditions in which these methods are
effective. In essence, all effective composition is rhetorical as it determines how
well your audience will trust, understand, and respond to your writing. And that's
something worth knowing, don't you think?

Reading the Room on the Rhetorical Situation

Have you ever told a joke where no one laughed? Or made a pop culture
reference that the person you were talking to didn't understand at all? Or maybe
you have mentioned a word or concept that the person you were speaking to
didn't know. If any of these things have happened to you, then you have already
learned the hard way about the importance of the rhetorical situation.

The rhetorical situation describes the surrounding social context that can
result in effective (or ineffective) persuasive communication. The rhetorical
situation is all about "reading the room" to perceive the qualities and effects your
language has on a given social situation. The rhetorical situation is generally
broken down into three features:

          · Audience: Whom the author is speaking to.

          · Purpose: What the author is attempting to achieve.

          · Genre: How the author presents their work.

Audience: Whom the Author Is Speaking to.

If you are a proficient speaker of English, it's easy to take for granted your skills
and assume that whatever you are reading is written for a very broad or general
audience. However, applying a label of "general audience" or making the
statement that something is written for "everyone" is almost always incorrect.
First, the language of a text will mean that only speakers of that language can be
reasonably considered to be in the text's audience. Furthermore, the register or
formality with which the text is written often implies a certain class, profession,
or level of education. Finally, references, terminology, and examples included
within the text may be familiar to certain audiences and not to others.

Determining the "audience" of a text is not so much about who can read and
understand a text, but who the author seems to be targeting. This sort of

                                                                     24
analysis requires a good deal of reading between the lines and paying attention
to little details involving the style of writing, often over and above the subject. As
an example, look at the following two passages about fairytales. Are they written
to the same audience?

Passage 1

                 Like folklore, mythology, fables, tall tales, and other
                 classic stories that have been handed down, fairy stories
                 are part of the oral tradition of literature. What makes
                 the fairy tale different from the others is its use of
                 magic and fantasy. Contrary to popular belief, the
                 supernatural characters in fairy stories are not always
                 fairy godmothers or winged sprites like Tinker Bell in
                 Peter Pan. They may be magicians, ogres, dragons, brownies,
                 elves, goblins, gnomes, or leprechauns.

Passage 2

                 Morphologically, a folktale may be termed any development
                 out of villainy (A) or lack (a) through intermediary
                 functions to marriage (Rs), or to other functions used in
                 the capacity of the denouncement. Terminal functions are,
                 at times, a reward (F), the gain or general liquidation of
                 misfortune (*K), a rescue from pursuit (W*), etc. This type
                 of development is termed by us a move. Each new villainy,
                 each new lack, creates a new move. One folktale may have
                 several moves.

Both of these passages are about fairy tales/folktales with the purpose of
defining what this genre of literature really is. The authors of both would include
well-known fairy tales like "Cinderella" and "The Princess and the Frog" as fitting
their definitions.

However, the difference in the way these two passages are written comes down
to the intended audience. The first passage is from Britannica Kids, an online
encyclopedia written specifically for children and students in grade school. You
may have noticed that this first sample uses a specific example of a fairy tale,
"Peter Pan," and a list of standard supernatural characters and creatures
(magicians, ogres, dragons...). These examples would likely be well known to
most English-speaking American youth in grade school, making it easy for this
audience to connect the definition with these examples. Additionally, note how
the sentences, while not overly simplistic, are direct and fairly short. The words
used in this passage should be familiar to most grade school children, but where
there's a word that might be unfamiliar (e.g. brownies) there are plenty of other

                                                                     25
examples or synonyms (e.g., "magic and fantasy") so that even a young reader
can pick up on the context clues the passage refers to.

The second passage is from Vladimir Propp's landmark 1928 structuralist
academic study of Russian fairy tales and folklore, Morphology of the Folktale.
Like the encyclopedia entry, Propp defines the folktale. But, rather than speaking
to children and young students, Propp writes to scholars in the fields of linguistics
and folklore. As such, Propp does not need to use well-known examples to
illustrate his points. He can also use a word like "morphologically" (meaning
basically related to a thing's form and structure) without defining it or providing
context clues because his audience can recognize that term as relating to specific
areas of study in their field. Propp uses some familiar words such as "villainy"
and "lack" but uses them as technical labels in his larger study. Propp, or his
English translator, Laurence Scott, uses also syntax that might trip-up a basic
reader such as the interrupting phrase "at times" and a list that ends with "etc."

Both authors have the intention of being understood by their respective
audiences, and yet they achieve these goals in different ways. And, importantly,
both are effective in appealing to these audiences. Britannica Kids is a popular
encyclopedia used by many children in their first essays and subscribed to by
school library systems. Vladimir Propp has been successful in influencing a whole
field of literary analysis. You might disagree with one or the other, and we might,
of course, debate the finer points of the success of each in appealing to their
audience. For instance, we might question what ages the Britannica Kids article
appeals to and if the word choice is truly designed for that reading level or if
their examples need to be updated to be more culturally inclusive. For Propp, we
might question if he sufficiently engaged with potential critiques from his
contemporary scholarly community in putting forth his own model, which might
have ultimately influenced its reception.

Additionally, it's important to note that there might be more than one audience
for any given piece of writing. While we generally consider the intended audience
of a piece to be most significant, unintended audiences can also have an effect
on the success of a work. For example, The Britannica Kids website will need to
seem sufficiently educational and attractive to parents and school administrators
in order for them to buy the license for the website. This secondary audience can
have a very practical and economic impact on the effectiveness of this work. So,
even an unintended audience can also have an impact on the effectiveness of a
work.

                                                                     26
The bottom line is that subject matter does not necessarily determine audience.
We might automatically assume that a passage written about fairy tales would or
should be for children, but we'd be very wrong. To be sure, people who are
interested in fairy tales are likely to be drawn to related subject matter, but
authors can attempt to reach out to those interested or those who agree with
them or those who do not.

   Is It "Jargon" or Technical Terminology?

   Have you ever read something that you know is in English but have no idea
   what it said? If so, you are not alone. Abbreviations, acronyms, legalese,
   slang, and industry-specific terms can make a piece of writing impossible for
   a general reader to understand and is often termed "jargon" when it is
   misused. Is using such language a bad thing? Yes, if you want to be
   understood by a broad audience. In this case, it's often a good idea to
   provide explanations, add extra examples to illustrate complex ideas, or use
   phrasing and vocabulary that your audience would better understand.

   However, pieces written for a more restricted audience--perhaps a
   professional community--often employ such terminology for a useful
   purpose: specificity. While a general audience of non-experts may not be
   sensitive to the different shades of meaning between one particular term
   and another, a professional audience often finds it essential to make such
   distinctions. For example, a composer might direct musicians to play a
   certain passage of music, "forte," which is a degree of loudness in between
   "mezzo forte" and "fortissimo." While the label "forte" is useful to musicians,
   if speaking to a general audience, the same composer might be better
   understood by simply saying "loud."

   The problem comes when a writer confuses these two audiences and writes
   too broadly for a specific audience or--more commonly--too specifically for a
   broad audience. The answer to this problem is to remain responsive to your
   audience. Peer review is a great strategy for seeing if other readers will
   interpret your work as you do.

   Activity 2.2: "the Curse of Knowledge"

   Read Steven Pinker's 2014 Wall Street Journal essay "The Source of
   Bad Writing," and take a moment to describe a situation where you
   didn't understand what someone else was speaking about. Was it
   due to the "Curse of Knowledge"? What should the speaker have
   done to get you to better understand them?

                                                                     27
So, how do we know who the audience of a piece is? The answer is a combination
of careful research and close reading. With research, you can investigate the
publication, the author, and what others are saying about the piece. This
information can reveal patterns and trends that can act as clues to better
understand the text's target audience, such as if the publication generally deals
with a certain hobby or that the author is known for their humor. As with all
research, employ your own critical thinking skills in determining what details are
most relevant.

As for "close reading," this is a strategy of reading for the little stylistic moves
the author makes. For instance, you might pay attention to the lengths of
sentences in a passage or how complex they are. Using your knowledge of
grammar and mechanics can help you determine not only the education level of a
target audience, but also the nationality of the target audience as spelling,
punctuation, idiom, and colloquial phrasings will differ in the many varieties of
English used throughout the world. The author's grammatical point of view will
often give a good idea about audience. By using second-person plural pronouns
when referring to the audience (e.g. we, us), for instance, they are including the
reader with them in a group. Similarly, if the author considers themselves to be
separate, they might refer to the audience with second-person singular (e.g. you,
Dear reader). Finally, paying close attention to the specific examples the author
uses might give clues as to any number of communities to which they might be
appealing.

These features might be used to imply a readership of any demographic or
identity characteristic that the reader might belong to including (but not limited
to) gender, age, education level, political affiliation, nationality, race, ethnicity,
dis/ability, sexuality, religion, profession, personal interests and more. The more
closely and carefully you read, the more details you will discover about who the
author assumes they are speaking to and what they themselves believe about
this group of people.

Activity 2.3: Determining Audience for Yourself

Analyze the following passage first through close reading, and then find
out more about it by doing some light research. Write three sentences of
very descriptive analysis and then come to a determination of its
audiences, both primary and secondary. KU Should Not Have Shut Down
the Spanish Major by Paula Guarderas.

                                                                     28
Activity 2.4: Writing for Different Audiences

Imagine that you are hosting a big graduation party, and you want all
your friends, family, and even people that you work and go to school
with to come. Pick three very different people that you know and
personally invite them to this party. Write each of them a brief and
sincere invitation that you might send via text message, email, or
another method. Once you have written each, consider any specific ways
that you may have altered your writing to appeal to your audience and
why you might have done so.

Purpose: What the Author Is Attempting To Achieve.

Writing is an action that can have real consequences in the world. Good, bad,
and everything between. Persuasive writing can enlighten minds, sell products,
cause war, and provoke peace. It can entertain, illuminate, explore, inform,
argue, convey, antagonize, activate, prevent, soothe, share, and much more.

In this communication-saturated world, it's often important that we think
critically about not only for whom a piece is intended, but what a writer wants
from that audience. For instance, in the following passage, consider, first, to
whom it is directed, and then consider what they want that audience to do.

The following page is from a December 15, 1928 issue of the magazine, The
Saturday Evening Post, and it is, of course, an advertisement for Hoover
vacuums. It is meant to have an audience of economically aspiring American
households to encourage married men to buy their wives Hoover vacuums for
Christmas.

However, the first few sentences of this ad might not have made this purpose
immediately obvious. The title or tagline "--but I can't say this to my husband" is
designed to catch our attention and make us curious about what this woman,
who is presumably the woman pictured in the top right in an oil painting, cannot
tell her own partner. The line suggests that we might read the confession of
some embarrassing or perhaps even scandalous secret. The first sentence, "My
husband will give me this Christmas...," builds on this expectation by maintaining
a first-person perspective (using "me" and "I"). Asides like "how can I say it"
cultivate a conversational and intimate tone, as if the woman is speaking in close
quarters with the reader.

Both the picture and the mention of the woman's husband buying her "trinkets"
for a holiday should convey the target audience as wealthy, or--more likely--
economically aspirational. This implication is important as it not only helps the ad

                                                                     29
"But I can't say this to my husband" from the Saturday Evening Post in the Public Domain (Read the
                                                               image's full text)

                                                               30
reach households that can afford the product being sold, but it also makes their
economic situation seem enviable to the reader. The woman narrating the ad
inserts subtle boasts about her wealth ("he likes to be extravagant"), their
relationship ("he wants so much to please [her]"), and her body (which she
describes as appearing ("Young and strong and radiant with health"). All these
details are designed to make an audience who presumably desires these things
jealous of this woman, perhaps even to the point of resentment. The ad
concludes with her acting as an envoy, speaking on behalf of married women to
their husbands so that these men can get their wives what they desire.
Ultimately, the woman in the ad does not get what she "really wants." Why? So
that we do.

The woman's confessional tone and apparent snobbery are a clever diction device
to make the audience first judgmental (she must have done something bad that
she can't tell her husband!), then jealous (what a wealthy household and perfect
man whose only flaw is spoiling his wife!), and then vindicated when they can
have the very thing that the woman does not. Though we can boil the purpose of
this ad down to "selling Hoovers," we should also recognize how a writer's
purpose is more complex in the ways that it establishes a relationship with the
audience to make them feel, do, respond, and believe what the writer wants.

This 1928 Hoover ad is very clever. It is also sexist in its assumptions about the
ideal roles, desires, and interests of men and women. Most ads make many such
assumptions and rely on cultural stereotypes about race, gender, sex, ability, and
more to reach a target audience and capitalize on our shared cultural
experiences. And, though the primary purpose of the ad might be to sell a
product, we can often glean deeper messages that work in tandem with its
purpose by helping to guide its audience's reaction.

Activity 2.5: Advertisement Analysis

Choose any advertisement that you encounter in your daily life where
YOU are the target audience. Figure out, first, what the ad is attempting
to sell if this is not immediately obvious. Then, do an analysis like the
one above for the Hoover ad that connects audience and purpose. What
is the ad trying to make you think, feel, and believe about the product
that it's selling, and how is it doing so?

Genre: What Type of Writing It Is

What's your favorite genre of music? Whether it's rock, rap, classical, jazz, pop,
country, or anything else, you know that the different expectations for each

                                                                     31
genre make it what it is. For instance, you wouldn't generally critique a punk
rock song for leaving out violins, but you might critique an orchestral
arrangement for doing so. Of course, that's not to say that punk rock songs
cannot have violins or that every orchestral arrangement must have them--it is
merely that violins are part of the expectations of one genre and not another.

Similarly, different forms of writing have general characteristics that, when taken
together, form the identity of the genre. However, these boundaries are more
guidelines or clues than rigid rules, and sometimes there are influences and
overlaps between writing genres. As with determining audience and purpose,
applying close reading will aid you in determining the genre of a piece.

Consider, for example, the following passage:

                 Whenever practicable, shortly before fires die out, open
                 the cleaning doors in the boiler casings and clean with air
                 or steam lances the tubes, baffles, etc., of accumulated
                 soot. If the soot be allowed to cool down with the tubes it
                 is liable to form a scale which will be difficult to
                 remove. A heavy air pressure will materially assist in the
                 cleaning. An excellent method of partially cleaning the
                 fire side of tubes and casings without using the lances is
                 to put a comparatively heavy air pressure on the firerooms
                 shortly before fires die out, opening boiler dust doors but
                 with ash pit and furnace doors closed. Close all sources of
                 air supply to furnace and keep them closed until boiler is
                 cooled.

Do you know what a steam lance is? What do boiler dust doors look like? Are you
baffled by baffles? Speaking personally, I am. But even if you are basically
familiar with this terminology, this passage removed from its context is likely
difficult to decode. Despite the fact that you may have no idea what this passage
is talking about, the manner in which it is written should give you clues to its
audience, general purpose, and--particularly--genre.

Regarding audience, we've already noted the technical terminology (e.g., baffle)
is without further explanation or definition, which makes it probable that the
audience is a small professional community with a shared lexicon. The fact that
cleaning tubes and removing soot are involved might give us clues that this
profession involves manual labor. The optionality of one of these procedures
seems to establish a relationship of guidance (e.g., "an excellent method of...")
rather than simply giving absolute commands, which suggests that the target
audience is a highly skilled professional capable of making their own judgments.

                                                                     32
While we cannot know the ultimate purpose of this passage without more
context, obviously instruction is involved. We can tell this from the second-
person point of view in sentences like the final one when it tells the reader to
"close all sources of air supply."

To determine genre, we should keep any known attributes of audience and
purpose in mind and look for other stylistic, formatting, and design elements that
might tell us the form of the writing in comparison to forms that we already
know. One very basic genre division is between poetry and prose. Poetry is a
creative and expressive form of writing, such as in sonnets, limericks, free verse,
and most song lyrics. Prose, on the other hand, lacks sustained and deliberate
metrical structure and describes writing that is generally grouped into sentence
structures. The fairly regular sentence structures in the passage should give us a
good idea that, if nothing else, we can tell that it is prose. But, beyond that, we
can see that there does not seem to be any flowery or lengthy descriptive
language, making it likely that this is not a creative genre such as a novel or
short story. Though, note that these factors are just clues rather than
determining or definitional ones.

The grammar of this passage can tell us even more about its genre. Purely
informative texts like encyclopedia articles and non-fiction books more often use
third person to speak about their subjects at a metaphorical remove. With very
rare exceptions, printed fictional texts also do not use second person. Only
certain genres are generally written using second person, and these often have a
specific audience in mind such as letters, emails, and notes. However, it may be
notable that this text, while it uses imperative voice (commands, e.g. "open the
cleaning doors"), it doesn't use the singular "you," which suggests that the target
audience might not be a singular recipient. The fact that it avoids first person
and any personal or friendly asides also suggests that this genre doesn't
generally establish a personal relationship with its audience. The verb tense
(past, present, etc.) can also sometimes give us clues, and the fact that the
passage uses present tense suggests that the audience is meant to read the
imperatives in real time, by following along.

Putting all this together--the technical terminology, professional audience of
skilled manual laborers, impersonal and dry prose, the non-specific second
person, and the present tense--what is it?

A manual! If you thought that this passage seemed like a set of instructions,
directions, or a how-to guidebook, your intuitions were correct. Specifically, the
passage is from Instructions for the Operation, Care, and Repair of Boilers,

                                                                     33
Reprint of Chapter 2 of the Manual of Engineering Instructions written in 1926 by
the US Navy for use aboard large ships.

Other features such as length, citation style, the use of images, and the
formatting including font style, text size, and page design can also convey a good
deal of information about the genre, sometimes at a mere glance.

In many ways, the example of a boiler manual is a straightforward example
whereas many texts will involve several genres in one.

Activity 2.6: Investigate the Genre on Your Own

Investigate the following passage on your own to determine its genre,
and--as a hint--the way it might manipulate that genre. Also, note that
the following is a very brief selection of the longer text.

                 ABSURDITY, n. A statement or belief manifestly inconsistent
                 with one's own opinion.

                 ACADEME, n. An ancient school where morality and philosophy
                 were taught.

                 ACADEMY, n. [from ACADEME] A modern school where football
                 is taught.

                 ALONE, adj. In bad company.

                 BIRTH, n. The first and direst of all disasters.

                 CABBAGE, n. A familiar kitchen-garden vegetable about as
                 large and wise as a man's head.

                 CIRCUS, n. A place where horses, ponies and elephants are
                 permitted to see men, women and children acting the fool.
Once you have attempted to do a close reading and analysis of it and
have determined what you can about its genre, you can check your
assumptions by reading the rest of this work here and finding out more
about it on this Wikipedia page that gives away its title and genre.

Activity 2.7: Manipulating Genre With AI

With your professor's guidance and permission--and not to submit for
any coursework--first, design a prompt for an AI that asks it to do one
writing task with a set topic and purpose. For instance, you might ask it
to complain about the Pennsylvania weather in early Spring. Or you
might ask it to inquire about the price of kidney beans at a farmer's
market. Then, manipulate your prompt to ask the AI to write the same

                                                                     34
output using a different genre that you specify, such as a limerick, lyrics
for musical theater, screenplay, text message, children's story, formal
letter, or business proposal. Do this at least three times and compare
your results. Consider what you might learn about the genre from AI and
also what AI might get wrong about this genre.

Drawing It All Together

Throughout your analysis and these activities, you may have noticed that these
concepts--audience, purpose, and genre--have quite a bit of overlap. Sometimes
the audience is built right into the definition of a genre, such as a children's book
or professional manual. Some purposes may call for one genre and not another,
such as a job requiring a report for quarterly performance rather than a dramatic
screenplay. And some purposes may work with some audiences better than with
others, such as a friend who is willing to hear a ranting personal complaint but
strangers who are not. An important element to consider is that these concepts
work together.

If effective writing has a formula, it is this: Effective writing uses its genre to
fulfill its purpose to its audience.

This "formula" can be a useful guide both to the analysis of texts, as the final
assignment below will demonstrate, and as a writer in your college courses at
Kutztown University going forward. Many college assignments rely on written
assignments. In any assignment, you might ask yourself:

          · Audience: Whom am I writing this assignment for? Will only the
            professor read it? Are my classmates supposed to respond to it? Does
            the professor expect me to write for a hypothetical audience of
            professionals within a certain field or discipline?

          · Purpose: What am I supposed to achieve in this assignment? Should I
            be demonstrating my knowledge of something, putting forth a new idea,
            expressing my own personal beliefs, or something else?

          · Genre: What form and format does my professor expect from my
            writing? Should I be following a certain documentation style? Should my
            writing be a certain length, written in a particular tone or point of view?

Of course, a professor's assignment sheet or instructions are useful in figuring
out these attributes of expected audience, purpose, and genre, but other times it
isn't so clear. Asking your professor directly is a great solution, and visiting the

                                                                     35
writing center for further guidance is another, but in cases where you cannot,
what do you do? Many times--if you have nothing else to go on--professors will
default to the expectations of their own field and finding out the audience,
purpose, and genre expectations for this field can be a useful guide to you. For
example, in the field of English studies, in terms of genre, MLA (Modern
Language Association) documentation style is usually expected for essays, and
essays are generally written mostly in active voice, using frequent quotations
from texts. The purpose of many (but certainly not all) essays in the field of
English studies is to argue for your own original interpretation of a text that is
strongly supported by textual evidence. The assumed audience for student
essays in English studies is usually a fairly broad one, where it's typically
assumed that the reader has some moderate familiarity with the text and will
need only an occasional brief summary of the plot but explicit mentioning of
relevant details. Finally, the relationship to audience is generally a friendly one
where using some amount of personal voice is accepted and even welcomed.

Formal essays, usually termed "papers" in the sciences are written in an entirely
different manner. Not only is there usually a different documentation style and
formatting, but formal essays in many fields in the sciences would find using
personal voice to be inappropriate and might encourage the use of passive voice
to put the topic in greater focus. Additionally, paraphrase and summary are
generally used in greater frequency in these papers than direct quotations. While
audiences and purposes can vary among fields and in more specific genres of
papers in the sciences, the technical nature of these fields can make reporting on
the discoveries and studies of other research more common at the
undergraduate level than the putting forth of a truly original thesis.

There will be many differences in writing for your courses, and as much as your
professors might try to make you aware of the expectations, there's no way that
all of them can be anticipated or covered even in the most comprehensive
assignment instructions. The only way to really become aware of these implicit
expectations is to read other texts carefully and closely with attention to how
they navigate the rhetorical situation. In time, you will draw together these
elements and find your own, original ways of being an effective writer.

                                                                     36
Final Activity 2.8: Create A Rhetorical Précis

A rhetorical précis is a specific genre of summary that focuses on the
rhetorical aspects of a text. Rather than summarizing the content only, a
rhetorical précis connects the aspects of the rhetorical situation that
we've reviewed--audience, purpose, and genre--in a very specific and
compact framework. Writing a rhetorical précis can be a good technique
or starting point to add depth to a summary, annotated bibliography
entries, or an abstract by considering what the text does and how it
works.

To create a rhetorical précis, first read over your chosen text carefully, taking
notes and doing any research you might need to better understand its content
and context. Then, you'll gather your notes in the following manner:

First sentence: Name of author, if known, (or the organization that acts as
author) with a phrase describing their relevance to the subject of the text,
followed by the genre and title of work with the year published in parentheses; a
rhetorically accurate verb that best describes the purpose (e.g. "argues,"
"suggests," "informs," "claims," "expresses," "describes"); and a THAT clause
containing your summary of the author's major assertion or focus of the work.
Think of it this way: WHOM are you talking about? WHAT is their background?
WHAT did they write? WHAT year was it written? WHAT is their point?

                 Example: The advertisement in The Saturday Evening Post, "--
                 but I can't say this to my husband" (1928) persuades its
                 audience that the Christmas present that women really want
                 from their husbands is a Hoover vacuum.

Second sentence: An explanation of the evidence the author uses to develop
and/or support the thesis or main focus. Think of it this way: HOW do they prove
their point? Do they offer interviews? Official data? Other outside sources?
Anecdotes? A certain strategy?

                 Example: The ad uses the narration of a wealthy married
                 woman confessing her unfulfilled desire in a conversational
                 tone that implies intimacy and provokes reader curiosity.

Third sentence: A statement of the author's purpose followed by an "in order"
phrase. Think of it this way: Are they trying to entertain the reader? Persuade
readers to feel a certain way or change their mind about an issue? Are they
trying to inform the reader by sharing information that teaches? WHY is that
their purpose? In order to accomplish what?

                                                                     37
                 Example: The ad's purpose is to make readers feel both
                 envious of and superior to the woman in the ad to encourage
                 them to buy a Hoover vacuum.

Fourth sentence: A description of the intended audience and/or the relationship
the author establishes with the audience. Think of it this way: WHOM is the
author trying to address? For example, are they talking to teachers? Parents?
Senior citizens? Registered voters? Women?

Consider all possible appeals to any demographic as well as potential secondary
audiences.

                 Example: Due to the direct appeal to married men in the
                 conclusion of the ad, it is presumably directed to American
                 men with the economic ability to buy their wives vacuum
                 cleaners; however, a secondary audience of women are also
                 implicit targets for this ad since they are the presumed
                 recipients of this gift.

Once you write each sentence, put them together for a 1-paragraph précis, make
any necessary revisions to avoid overly repetitive language, and add key missing
details in the appropriate places.

Example of Final Product:

                 The advertisement in The Saturday Evening Post, "--but I
                 can't say this to my husband" (1928), attempts to persuade
                 its audience that the gift that women really want from
                 their husbands this Christmas is a Hoover vacuum. The ad
                 uses the narration of a wealthy and enviable married woman
                 confessing her unfulfilled desire for a vacuum in a
                 conversational tone that provokes reader curiosity and
                 implies intimacy. The ad's purpose is to make readers feel
                 both jealous of and superior to the woman in the ad to
                 encourage them to buy a Hoover vacuum. Due to the direct
                 appeal to married men in the conclusion of the ad, it is
                 presumably directed to American men with the economic
                 ability to buy their wives vacuum cleaners; however, a
                 secondary audience of women are also implicit targets for
                 this ad since they are the presumed recipients of this
                 gift.

                                                                     38
Chapter 3: the Shape of Rhetoric

                 ...[T]he triangle is indispensable to thinking about
                 communication. It is a memorable, easily graspable schema,
                 intuitively satisfying, capable of systematic elaboration
                 and almost endless application. - Timothy W. Crusius,
                 Professor Emeritus of English
                 Every triangle is a love triangle, if you love triangles. -
                 Anonymous internet meme
The last chapter was all about understanding the rhetorical situation by breaking
it down into the three factors of audience, purpose, and genre. The hope is that,
by doing so, we can better understand a text's effectiveness and also ways to
think about approaching writing ourselves.
However, knowing what's going on doesn't tell you how it's happening, or how to
do it yourself. A mechanic can show you where the engine is in a car, but that
doesn't tell you how it works. A musician can tell you what song they are playing,
but that doesn't give you the ability to play it. So, this chapter is all about the
"how" of rhetoric. How does a writer appeal to an audience? How does a writer
use genre to their advantage? How does a writer fulfill their purpose?
Many textbooks on rhetoric commonly answer these "how" questions with a
diagram of the "rhetorical triangle," using each angle to demonstrate a technique

                                               One Possible Rendition of the Rhetoric Triangle

                                                                     39
of persuasion and often applying the trio of audience, purpose, and genre to each
angle either instead of these or in addition to them.
This model is certainly a useful device for memory, but, ultimately, it's important
to keep in mind that this model is only a metaphor, and it's not a perfect one. To
better understand this metaphor, we should understand where it comes from and
its potential limitations. Our first stop is ancient Greece.
The art of rhetoric is often said to have started with the famous ancient Greek
student of Plato and tutor of Alexander the Great, Aristotle (384-322 BC). Author
of lengthy treatises on such diverse topics as physics, biology, ethics, poetics,
politics, art, and logic, Aristotle is assuredly one of the most influential voices of
Western thought. While many fields have certainly undergone dramatic
development and change, today's philosophers, logicians, linguists, and some
scientists are still engaged in using or responding to many of the basic concepts
that he originated or disseminated through his writing. So, it's no surprise that if
you ask ChatGPT or most other artificial intelligences (A.I.s) who invented the
famous concept of the "rhetorical triangle," you might get something like this:

                                                                     Google Screenshot

However, Google AI in the image above is not quite correct. In one of his
treatises, The Rhetoric, Aristotle lays out three techniques of persuasion, but he
never uses the word or concept of a "triangle" when he does so. It was only later
rhetoricians and recent compositionists that applied Aristotle's techniques to
what they would call a "communication triangle."

                                                                     40
Additionally, though Aristotle's terminology is still used today and will be used in
this chapter, our own understanding of exactly what is persuasive and why has
shifted in significant ways. Some professors might teach rhetoric using these
traditional understandings--and doing so can certainly be useful from a historical
standpoint--but most modern compositionists take some liberties with Aristotle's
terms.

Finally, though Aristotle is the most recognizable name associated with rhetoric,
he did not invent it. In the very first sentence of The Rhetoric, Aristotle
acknowledges that--even in 300BC--this art had been already "within the
cognizance" of all, and so his main goal was to examine an art that is already in
vibrant practice. As books such as Carol Lipson and Roberta Binkley's Rhetoric
Before and Beyond the Greeks demonstrate, non-Western cultures have their
own models of rhetoric, some of which precede ancient Greece.

In a nutshell, Aristotle's model is useful, but it should not be treated as
sacrosanct or doctrinal. The important thing isn't a cookie-cutter model or shape
that we assign to rhetoric but how we use that model to ask smarter questions.
Accordingly, each of these three sections will prompt you to ask your own
questions, recognizing that answering these questions usually will not be simple
but will require your own critical thought and interpretation.

   Considering Bias, Experience, and Opinion

   Having an opinion is often necessary to present a persuasive argument, and
   presenting one's personal opinions is often useful in establishing credibility
   (ethos). So, where does bias come into play?

   Bias is an unfair or distorted treatment of a topic. Bias often results in
   giving undeserved weight to the opinions of one group over another or
   ignoring inconvenient facts. One oft-cited example of bias is "confirmation
   bias" where a person's perspective of the world would lead them to only pay
   attention to facts that confirm their perspective. For example, let's say that
   Joe believes that his own diet is the best there is--for everyone. On social
   media, Joe follows and reposts celebrities who follow his diet and ignores all
   accounts that don't. In doing so, Joe is surrounding himself only with people
   and information that confirm his own positions, which could mean that he
   would miss out on new discoveries or information that would dispute his
   position.

                                                                     41
Because bias is often prejudicial, unfair, and misleading, it's considered a
detriment to arguments, particularly in academic settings. Good researchers
and journalists often try to avoid confirmation bias by engaging with
research that counters their own positions.

Though bias often originates from our personal experiences and backgrounds
--elements that are often good to embrace in our own writing--we can and
should avoid writing with overt bias, and we can do so even while holding
our own strong opinions. The trick is in respecting the opinions and
experiences of other people. Respecting others means that you are willing to
listen to them and take their positions seriously, even if they entirely
disagree with your own. In composition, this "listening" might take the form
of acknowledging difficult ideas and engaging with truths that do not fit
comfortably into our own arguments. A key part of being a critical thinker in
an academic setting is grappling with new or divergent ideas and
perspectives. Listening to others might change our opinions and it might
not; however, it should always teach us that the world is bigger than
ourselves.

Activity 3.1: Listening and Writing About Beliefs
Spend a few minutes writing about one belief that you hold about
education based on your own experiences in school. This belief
might be about the way people or children learn, what they ought to
learn, how much they should learn, what ages they should learn
things, the use of teachers or technology in school, or anything else
related to school and education. Then, share your belief with another
person and take some time to explain where that belief comes from.
Listen to the other person's belief and attempt to understand them
fully. After you are finished, write about that person's belief. What
do you understand about it, and where are they coming from? What
would you still like to learn about it and them?

                                                                 42
Rhetorical Techniques

Aristotle deliberately referred to the discipline of rhetoric using the Greek word
technê, meaning "craft." In doing so, he distinguishes rhetoric as a skill that is
learned through practiced moves rather than artistic genius, morals, wisdom, or
even knowledge. This word might look familiar to you since it is the origin of the
English words "technique," "technical," and "technology." This label of "technique"
should give us some encouragement as writers-- rhetoric is a skill that anyone
can learn! But it should also give us some pause. It is a skill that anyone can
learn, regardless of their intentions. As with most tools and technologies,
effective rhetoric can be used for good or for ill, and we will interact with both
ethical and unethical uses of rhetoric.

To be critical thinkers, we must identify what makes someone or something
persuasive, apart from whether we ourselves personally agree with the position,
and sometimes even when we know that an argument is based on dishonesty or
unethical principles. The act of breaking down arguments by exposing these
techniques is often a good starting point to better understand the reality of the
people, facts, and principles behind them. In fact, ethics takes us to a discussion
of our first technique.

Ethos: Credibility, Not (Necessarily) Ethics

Business cards on heavy cardstock. Brand name clothing. Power poses.
Reputations. Celebrity endorsements. Degrees and titles. Blue checkmarks.
Trophy displays. Being able to rattle off the names of the entire production team
of an obscure video game. Possessing the latest and most expensive gadget.

These are all common appeals to ethos--or credibility--that we might see in our
daily lives.

The ancient Greek word ethos, which Aristotle identified as one of his three
techniques of persuasion, is the origin of our modern word "ethics," and it was
closely connected with the concept of moral goodness in Aristotle's treatise. The
thought was that people more willingly trust a person who has a good character.

However, modern rhetoricians typically do not consider ethos and ethics to be the
same thing. While looking or seeming like a good person does make a difference
in establishing credibility, appearance isn't the same thing as reality, and just
because someone sounds trustworthy, does not make them actually trustworthy.
Similarly, the most ethical person might lack any outward signs to broadcast this
fact.

                                                                     43
Activity 3.2: Whom Do You Trust?

As a freewriting activity, consider any and all people you would trust to
tell you the truth. Is it a friend, family member, community leader, a
certain news organization, website, author, TV channel, or other source?
Be specific and choose one person or source to talk about. Why do you
trust them? What are the limits of that trust and why?

Instead of being about values, ethos is all about what we value--what signals
importance and authority, or the credibility needed to be convincing.

These signs of authority might include:

          · The author's own credentials and reputation

          · The authority of the author's sources

          · The author's first-hand experiences

          · The quality of the writing or speech of the author

          · The author's use of examples to indicate familiarity with the topic or
            audience

          · An even-handed tone or appearance of fairness and reason

Using these devices and others like them can help the author establish ethos in
their writing and seem more convincing and trustworthy. By the same token, an
author can make errors that destroy their ethos or simply fail to establish it.

To see a rather clear example of an appeal to ethos, take a look at the opening
paragraph to John Gatto's "The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher" in his book
Dumbing Us Down. In this republished acceptance speech for the 1991 New York
State Teacher of the Year award, Gatto strongly critiques the K-12 public school
system by arguing that it teaches compliance rather than knowledge. Gatto
begins his speech with a direct appeal to his ethos as a schoolteacher by noting
his role as a teacher and his 30 years of experience and then dropping in
mention of his teaching license. As he moves to his argument by saying that he
teaches "school" rather than "English," he reminds his audience that he "win[s]
awards doing it."

                 Call me Mr. Gatto, please. Twenty-six years ago, having
                 nothing better to do at the time, I tried my hand at
                 schoolteaching. The license I hold certifies that I am an
                 instructor of English language and English literature, but

                                                                     44
                 that isn't what I do at all. I don't teach English, I teach
                 school--and I win awards doing it.

Gatto isn't simply bragging in this passage--he is establishing his ethos on the
topic in order to present a believable argument about it. Whom do we assume
would know best about the failures of the public school system? Most likely,
those who have the most experience working in it, which is why Gatto mentions
that he's been doing it for twenty-six years. Furthermore, he strengthens his
authority on public school education by reminding his audience that he is winning
an award. The fact that he speaks from this position of authority on public school
education makes his critique of it surprising but all the more believable since he
has this credibility.

But beyond his credentials, Gatto is establishing his ethos in a complex fashion
using his audience, purpose, and genre. Did you notice how Gatto speaks in a
seemingly off-handed manner about his achievements? In the same sentence
where he mentions his years of experience, he also says that he went into
teaching because he had "nothing better to do at the time." He also downplays
his effort in doing so by saying, "I tried my hand at schoolteaching," which slights
the very profession from which he derives his authority. If you read further in the
speech, it will become more apparent this implication fits into his argument, but
here it serves a complicated purpose to position Gatto as superior to his awards
ceremony audience, most of which are educators themselves. In treating his
profession as seemingly easy and unskilled, he is also treating the shared
profession of his audience as such, and his own recognition of this fact serves to
inflate his own importance within the community he is speaking to.

Finally, notice the opening sentence, "Call me Mr. Gatto, please." Though Gatto is
literally speaking to fellow educators and educational administration in an awards
ceremony, does this line sound like he is addressing equals? Rather than seeming
as if he is speaking to colleagues, Gatto addresses his audience as if they are
students in his classroom, which serves to further position him above his
audience.

Gatto's approach is only one strategy in establishing ethos, and it's a fairly
blatant example that might even be read as having a bullying tone. Is it
effective? What do you think?

                                                                     45
Activity 3.3: Discuss the Effectiveness of an Argument

Read the rest of Gatto's speech using the KU library ebook link here and
discuss how effective Gatto's argument is, and what role ethos plays in
his argument. Do you think his argument would have been as effective if
he hadn't mentioned his experience and credentials or had presented
them in a different manner?

Who determines what establishes ethos and how? Well, this is where the
elements of the rhetorical situation from Chapter 2--audience, purpose, and
genre--come into play. Audiences, in particular, will have different definitions of
authority. For instance, an academic audience may respect signs of academic
achievement. These signs might include an author's degrees and the reputation
of the institution they attended, the number and impact of their previous
research publications in their field, what academic mentors they've had, the
number and reputation of their sources, and how well their writing adheres to the
expected style within their field. An audience of professional musicians would
have much different standards and may not care how many degrees someone
has; they might instead pay attention to a musician who entered the practice
room with an expensive and rare instrument or who was reputed for their ability
to play a particularly difficult solo. A group of children will have very different
standards still and might respect the person in the best clown costume over the
research scientist who went to MIT.

While some of the sets of standards for establishing credibility might be wiser
than others, we cannot say that any are "wrong." They are simply societally
based signs and signals that have varying correspondences with reality.
Identifying what establishes this credibility can reveal an audience's values, and
knowing what an audience values will help you in establishing your own
credibility as a writer.

When considering the ethos of any text, you might consider the following
questions:

          · What sorts of sources does the author use, and are they credible? Who
            would these sources be most credible to and why?

          · What are the features or flaws of the author's writing style that establish
            the author as a credible author (or not), and why?

          · Did the author bring their own personal experiences into the text, and
            what effect did this have on ethos?

                                                                     46
          · What did the author do to establish their authority on the subject
            matter?

          · Did the author draw upon their own reputation in any way?
          · How did the author make efforts to avoid bias, or not?
Activity 3.4: Ethos in a Ketchup Ad
Consider this 2018 Heinz Ketchup Ad featuring Ed Sheeran. How does
this ad use ethos as a technique? Write up an analysis such as we did for
Gatto's speech, considering how ethos interfaces with audience,
purpose, and genre. Finally, consider whether these factors make for an
effective ad.

                                                                     47
Logos: Logic

              Dr. Brian Land (he/him) has a PhD in Philosophy
              from Temple University with a concentration in Neo-
              Aristotelian thought and metaethics. Currently, he is
              a teacher of mathematics at the secondary
              education level.

One common error regarding the logos of an argument is to mistake it for a
certain flavor of ethos--that is, to think that the logic of an argument is a matter
of using sophisticated terms or of having fancy statistics or charts. The most
important question about those statistics is not how nice they make a paper look
but instead how accurate they are and how well they actually support the
argument being made. These are exactly the kinds of questions that an
evaluation of logos considers.

In as much as what we are evaluating is an argument, it is endeavoring to
persuade its audience of some idea, and it is endeavoring to do so on some
rational grounds. We'll use the term "conclusion" for what the argument is trying
to convince its audience is true and the term "premise" for those claims that
justify or support drawing that conclusion. So, if I were to argue that "you
shouldn't hire Ben because he's rude and never shows up on time!," the premises
would be as follows:

                 P1: Ben is rude.

                 P2: Ben never shows up on time.

                 And the conclusion would be:

                 C: You shouldn't hire Ben.

Now, I want to notice a few things about this simple argument regarding Ben's
employability. First, sometimes these premises work together to provide good
reason to believe the conclusion, and sometimes they work independently. Here,
for example, even if we found out that P2 was wrong and that Ben was actually

                                                                     48
always on time, his rudeness would still be an independent reason to believe that
we shouldn't hire him.

Activity 3.5: Identifying an Argument's Structure

Identify the premises and conclusion of the following: "I'd really like us
to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem, so we should
switch our buses to electric. Besides, we'll save a ton of money when gas
prices go up and electricity gets cheaper!"

Second, there are a lot of different ways to present what is effectively an
argument of the same logical structure. Returning to the case of Ben, we might
say the following: "Punctuality and being considerate are important to this
company, and Ben displays neither of these virtues. We shouldn't hire him." In
this case, some of the effect is a bit different-- beginning by appealing to the
company's values, but the ultimate logical structure is the same., perhaps with
the exception that the second version makes explicit that rudeness and not being
on time are reasons to not hire a person.

Third, there are two big ways to evaluate this argument: I can ask if those
premises are actually true, or I can ask if those premises actually give a good
enough reason to believe the conclusion. Because determining the truth is often
difficult and arguments are aimed at an audience, I'll use the term
acceptability, which is borrowed from the philosopher Trudy Govier and her
foundational text A Practical Study of Argument, to talk about evaluations of the
premises themselves, and I'll use entailment to talk about just how well those
premises support the conclusion.

The idea of acceptability is often pretty intuitive: I can ask myself questions like
"Is it right or wrong that Ben is rude?" and determine whether I'm willing to
accept Premise 1.

Entailment is a bit trickier, and rightly so as there are a lot of ways to support a
given conclusion. One helpful way to think of it is by means of the question: "Is
there any way that these premises can be correct, but the conclusion can still be
wrong?" In our example of Ben, I might ask, "Is there any way that Ben might be
rude and never show up on time but still be worth hiring?" Indulging our
imaginations on this question might give us answers like "well, maybe Ben's job
is remote and asynchronous, and all he has to do is create some program and
send it in online, and maybe he's really good at that." In such a case, both our
premises might be true, but they wouldn't warrant believing the conclusion, at
least not on their own.

                                                                     49
In the case of Ben, there was nothing really wrong with arguing the two premises
we considered--it just happened that in some cases (which may or may not even
apply here) those reasons might not be sufficient grounds for requiring our
conclusion: if we were choosing between hiring Ben and an equally qualified but
polite and punctual candidate, we probably wouldn't hire Ben.

But there are some big ways in which our minds often want to reason that look
to be much better reasons for a conclusion than they actually are. I'll call these
kinds of arguments fallacies. Sometimes fallacies are given fancy names in
Latin, sometimes not, but in every case, what is notable about these ways of
arguing is that (1) they present a certain appeal to our minds and are often
something like traps that we are prone to fall into and (2) that the premises can
be wholly true without requiring their conclusion. A more complete list can be
found on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, but I provide a few below as
examples. Please note that such fallacies do not require that their conclusion be
false--any bad argument might nonetheless have a true conclusion. Instead,
they simply fail to provide good support for their conclusion.

Hasty Generalization

                 I've met three people from Kutztown University, and every
                 one of them loved chess. I guess everyone at that
                 university really loves chess!

The problem with this type of argument is rather intuitive--of course you cannot
evaluate an entire university, without exception, on the grounds of a sample size
of only three people. One might make the conclusion slightly more palatable by
tempering it away from the strong "everyone," instead opting for a humbler claim
such as "many people at that university love chess." But even then, such a
conclusion isn't well warranted. A sample of only three people is not large
enough to warrant such a conclusion. It could only be useful to fields such as
statistics if we were assured that the sample was randomly taken. However, even
a sample of 90 people would be a poor one if it were, for example, provided by
the speaker visiting the university as part of a chess tournament. As it stands, it
is the case where all the premises might be true and yet the conclusion could
readily be false.

False Dichotomy

                 Some people are against expelling students for cheating on
                 the first offense, but we as a university have to do
                 something about academic dishonesty!

                                                                     50
As before, the difficulty is that one can believe that it is unacceptable for the
university to do nothing to combat academic dishonesty but also believe that the
expulsion is not the right answer--with absolutely no internal contradiction. This
sort of fallacy is called a "false dichotomy" in that it appears to offer a forced
choice between two (or more) positions. In this case, you either support the
policy of first offense expulsion or you support the university doing nothing about
academic dishonesty, when in fact a variety of other positions exist. One might,
for example, believe instead in a warning system, or perhaps a more moderate
punishment such as failing the course, or further education to prevent academic
dishonesty. Even if one maintains that the draconian approach is the better one,
alternatives do exist and should be considered as opposed to simply rejecting a
policy of doing nothing.

Post Hoc

                 After we elected Governor Smith, the economy has gone down
                 the tubes. It must be Governor Smith's fault, and we need
                 to elect someone else!

The Latin phrase post hoc ergo propter hoc translates to "after this therefore
because of this." It is part of a larger class of fallacies in which one falsely
attributes one thing as a cause, just because it happened after the first event.
Now, establishing causation generally is quite tricky, but certainly it is not enough
to show that one thing happened before another to prove that the first caused
the second.

Equivocation

                 My tiny apartment may not look like much, but it's better
                 than nothing. And nothing is better than the Biltmore
                 Estate. So, since nothing is better than Biltmore, and my
                 apartment is better than nothing, my apartment is better
                 than Biltmore!

Here, the problem is that what is meant by "nothing" is not consistent between
the two premises. In the first premise, the presumably agreeable claim is that
the state of having a small apartment is better than the state of having nowhere
to live. In the second, the premise amounts to the claim that of all places to live
none is better than Biltmore Estates. Because "nothing" appears in both claims,
we might be misled into thinking that we have just seen a valid argument.

                                                                     51
Ad Hominem

                 We shouldn't have mandatory attendance at the college
                 level. Just look at Dean Henderson: He keeps arguing for it
                 and he's a far too controlling and aggressive person.

The issue with an ad hominem (meaning `against the person') argument is that it
is irrelevant to the question at hand. Whether or not Dean Henderson is a
controlling person does not affect the truth of the matter at hand. Presumably a
person who was not so controlling might also hold such an opinion.

Crucially, not every attack against a person is so irrelevant--there are many
cases where the matter of an individual's character is very important to a
decision we might make based on that individual. For example, if an argument
was relying on an expert's authority, then attacking the quality of their expertise
or their reputation for honesty would be entirely appropriate. Furthermore, it is
not the case that the issue of personal standing is irrelevant to how persuasive
an argument is, just how willing an audience might be to listen to it.

                                    My Brilliant Argument Essay on Smoking

                 In the course of human history, America has been both the
                 longest established, and--by far--the greatest country known
                 to man. Any nation that has been established for this long
                 will have to reevaluate its laws in order to create a more
                 healthful and harmonious society. Public smoking is a
                 personal freedom that has had its day and should now be
                 prohibited.

                 For one, if you are for public smoking, you are making a
                 deliberate choice to support three-year-olds being exposed
                 to second-hand smoke. There is no middle ground. You are
                 either for three-year-olds smoking a pack a day, or you
                 aren't. Do we want our children to be miniature Cruella De
                 Vils?

                                                                     52
But, aside from mere images, the health effects of smoking
are real. Joe Smith was an average healthy young man until
he started smoking. According to his doctor, who reflected
on Joe's condition in Health Today Magazine, Joe's body was
"destroyed by smoking" as his cigarette habit resulted in
lung cancer and permanent use of a respirator (56).
In addition to health effects, cigarette butts are a major
source of pollution. According to FakeReference.com,
"Effects of pollution on the Earth include environmental
deterioration, impacts on the health of living organisms,
global warming, depletion of the ozone layer and reduced
efficiency or infertility of farmlands and crop fields."
One of the easiest ways to stop the effects of pollution
would be to simply kick the habit. However, as we all know,
tobacco is an addictive substance, which is why it is the
government's responsibility to intervene and save us from
ourselves--by banning all public smoking once and for all.

                                                  53
Pathos: Evoking Emotional Responses

You might have noticed that many of the logical fallacies mentioned in the logos
section are quite common in everyday speech. You will find many ad hominems
in political attack ads, post hoc and other correlation fallacies in literature
promoting the latest health trends, and equivocations in catchy sayings and
slogans. But, if these are examples of faulty logic, why would they be used at all?
One possible reason is that many of these fallacies are designed to appeal to our
emotions--such as to get us angry, generate sympathy, or cause laughter.

Public service announcements (PSAs) provide many good examples of fallacious
logic employed to provoke emotion. Take, for example, the famous 1980 anti-
drug PSA produced by the Partnership for a Drug-free America (Read commercial
transcript). The 13-second advertisement features an egg dropped into a hot
frying pan with the voiceover flatly stating "This is drugs. This is your brain on
drugs. Any questions?" There are many ways that this might be labeled a false
analogy-a faulty comparison between two things. I think we can recognize many
ways that brains are not really like eggs and drugs are not really like frying pans.
Furthermore, the relationship between the two is far more complex than merely
being a negative--and presumably deadly--outcome, which is what the PSA
implies. A false analogy is another logical fallacy that should be avoided in
order to make a logical argument. However, this PSA, and others like it, had been
fairly persuasive in getting people to fear the effects of drugs. Even to this day,
people make both political and personal decisions based on campaigns like these.

And, it's no surprise that these appeals work so well on us--emotional responses
can be very powerful things. Think of the last time that a song moved you to
tears, a video made you chuckle, or a passionate speaker riled up your anger. In
all these cases, the singer, writer, or speaker appealed to your emotions. If they
provoked these emotions deliberately and in accordance with a persuasive
purpose, then they used pathos as a rhetorical technique. To clarify, pathos can
be logical or illogical, just as our emotions can be both reasonable and
unreasonable. Pathos is an appeal to the audience's emotions, whether these
emotions are happy, sad, nostalgic, sympathetic, angry, or even peaceful and
calm. These emotions can--and often do--get fairly complex, and multiple
emotions can come into play at once.

When analyzing an author's use of pathos, you might start by asking yourself
four key questions:

          1. What emotion is the audience supposed to feel?

                                                                     54
          2. How is this emotion conveyed?

          3. For what purpose?

          4. How effective is that emotion in reaching the audience?

When looking for the answers to this section, we should again rely on close
reading strategies to pick out small portions of the language the author uses--
down to word choice and punctuation--that contribute to their purpose. To get
you started, you can look for things like the following:

          · Clichés and pop culture references (e.g., "Think outside of the box,"
            "Don't judge a book by its cover," [Arnold Schwarzenegger voice] "I'll be
            `bach'") As silly and overplayed as clichés, pop culture references, and
            memes can be, they are used as cultural touchstones that can form a
            friendly relationship with the audience or easily convey particular
            emotional attitudes to smooth the way to accepting more difficult or
            complex ideas.

          · Humor/jokes/puns (e.g., Knock, knock. Who's there? Dishes. Dishes
            who? "Dishes" a really bad joke.) Jokes get us laughing and potentially
            in a better disposition to accept whatever argument the author makes
            next as we often culturally interpret laughter as a form of agreement or
            sympathy with the author. However, jokes are not always innocent (as
            discussed in the following section) and might be used to alienate others.

          · Insults/negative labels or bullying (e.g., The only people who
            believe that idea are fascists; you are either with us or against us.)
            These can exert social pressure on the audience to ally themselves with
            the author out of fear, guilt, anger, or self-consciousness.

          · Praises/positive labels (e.g., What a great crowd we have out today!
            I just know that smart students are reading this textbook!) These can
            "butter up" the audience and feed their feelings of pride and self-worth,
            which in turn can make an audience more agreeable to the author's
            position.

          · Metaphorical language/symbols (e.g. It's a grand old flag, the white
            dove of peace, you are my guiding star): Like clichés, metaphors can
            make more complex ideas and emotions more relatable, forging an
            emotional connection to the author as well as the situation.

                                                                     55
          · Scare Statistics (e.g. 9.4 million American adults do not know that
            they already have diabetes, 89% of college students say that they don't
            need alcohol to have a good time): Statistics are often used as an
            attention-grabbing technique, which may or may not contribute to an
            argument as logical evidence. Statistics can be used to cause fear or
            self-doubt, or to encourage the audience to conform to a certain
            standard.

          · Personal Anecdotes (e.g., It happened to me...) Personal stories can
            often hit the audience harder than broad statements of fact. For that
            reason, these anecdotes are often used to garner sympathy not just for
            the individual but for others in a similar circumstance.

          · Grand Narratives (e.g., We are all standing on the shoulders of giants.
            The American Dream means that we can all get ahead if we work hard
            enough. Money cannot buy happiness.) Sometimes distilled into clichés,
            grand narratives are values and philosophies that underpin smaller
            messages. Speakers that appeal to these often do so to forge common
            ground with an audience and appeal to shared values. However, these
            grand narratives are often problematic because they are taken as
            truisms without question but do not describe individual experiences.

          · Calls to Action (e.g., "What do we want?" "Justice!" "When do we want
            it?" "Now!") Sometimes direct passionate pleas for action have the truest
            ring of authenticity and can be effective in making the audience as
            passionate or as angry as the speaker.

The above list is, of course, not a comprehensive one. Once you begin to look for
ways the author attempts to appeal to the emotion of the audience, you might
notice pathos being used in much more subtle ways to get the audience nodding
their heads in agreement. We often notice pathos in fiery rhetoric that gets
people shouting or crying. In fact, the word pathos seems to suggest high
degrees of violent emotion since it is related to our modern words "pathetic" and
"passion." However, a good rhetorician can also use pathos to build consensus
and unity. Take, for example, this brief portion of the 2009 inaugural address
spoken by 44th President Barack Obama, which is driven by pathos but was
presented in a more understated fashion:

                 America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter
                 of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With
                 hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents,
                 and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our

                                                                     56
                 children's children that when we were tested, we refused to
                 let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we
                 falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace
                 upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and
                 delivered it safely to future generations.
Obama's rhetoric uses a good deal of metaphor and cliché including referencing
life as a difficult journey and America's common challenges as elemental forces
of nature that could be endured. Through these metaphors, Obama sought to
make his audience feel both unified and hopeful that they too might get through
any present challenges they were facing. In doing so, he appeals to several
grand narratives of endurance (If we endure difficult situations we will eventually
succeed) and legacy (our children's children). He further unifies his audience by
using the plural first-person pronouns "we" and "us" to group his audience in one
community. Can you find more ways that Obama's speech attempts to build unity
among people with different political ideologies? Political speeches on all sides
are typically full of such rhetoric, and these speakers use pathos as a tool to
garner popular support for their positions.
Activity 3.7: Analyze Pathos in a Poster
Analyze the following World War II era poster for pathos techniques,
answering all four of the key questions above. Make sure to not only
analyze the language but the visual aspects of the poster.

                                                                     57
In a sense, the humor in

the poster above relies of

turning the rhetorical tools

of fascism against itself.

One particularly powerful

pathos technique is

"othering," or setting up a

"them versus us"

relationship with the

audience and speaker as

the "good guy" and some

"other" person, ideology,

nation, or group as the

enemy. There are very real

ethical questions that

should be asked when this

rhetorical strategy is used.

Othering is often presented

as a harmless joke or even

consensus-building among

a group of insiders, and it is

not always intentional.

However, othering is often

responsible for stereotyping

and condemning others and

be aware of ways a speaker

can use emotions to dehumanize or ridicule others including any language that:

· Distances one group of people or presents their views as alien

· Uses the existence of others as the punchline to a joke

· Uses dehumanizing metaphors to describe others such as comparing
  people to animals or insects

· Uses metaphors involving infection, dilution, or impurity to describe the
  influence or existence of others

                                58
          · Uses the language of binary oppositions to exclude those with more
            nuanced positions (us vs. them, good vs. evil, outsider vs. insider)

By pointing out such language, we can further explore the speaker's true
purposes and larger values. Regardless of its effectiveness, in all ethical contexts
and academic settings, such language should be avoided. In fact, it is expected
that academic environments promote inclusive communities of mutual respect.
To that end, a significant way to do this is through the language we use with and
to refer to others.

                                                                     59
The Importance of Pronouns

                                      Colleen Clemens, Ph.D. (she/her) is Professor of
                                      Non-Western Literatures and Director of Women's,
                                      Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Kutztown
                                      University.

When we are writing, we should be as inclusive as we possibly can with our
audience. In academic and professional settings, we are expected to validate
people's gender identities, and a significant part of this consideration of your
audience is to be attentive to their pronouns.

We use pronouns all the time in speech and writing. You really cannot avoid
using them. In fact, in this short blurb alone, I've already used pronouns ten
times up to this point. Simply put, pronouns are words that stand in for
nouns, including words like I, you, they, he, her, it, we, ...and more. We use
these words all the time without thinking about them, but this is exactly why
we need to give them particular attention when addressing or speaking
about other people.

Addressing someone by their correct pronouns is crucial. Doing so shows
basic respect and human decency, much like using the correct spelling or
pronunciation of someone's name. There are a few ways you might find
someone's pronouns: on their email signature, on their social media, or
through interactions with them. Whatever the case, it's important that you
do not simply assume that you know someone's pronouns by looking at a
photo or name since these are not always reliable indicators.

Also, it's a good idea to make information about your pronouns easy to find
so other writers can address you correctly, whether you are cisgender,
transgender, non-binary or any other gender. Consider putting your preferred
pronouns in an email signature in your KU Outlook email by going to
Settings Compose and Reply, Email Signature. And if you use
neopronouns, consider linking to a chart explaining them so that your
audience can learn more about gender identities and pronouns.

                                                                 60
Using Rhetorical Techniques To Shape Your Reading and Writing

Many graphic depictions of the rhetorical triangle such as the one at the
beginning of this chapter use an equilateral triangle--one with three equal sides.
This might imply that each rhetorical technique should be used in equal measure
or that each is of equal importance at all times. However, different audiences,
purposes, and genres will have different expectations regarding ethos, pathos,
and logos. One generally wouldn't expect airtight logic in a poem or comedy
routine, but a judicial option or business proposal without logic would be absurd.
Some audiences will respond differently to heavy-handed appeals to sympathy
based on cultural experiences: The sad music behind a documentary might drive
one audience to tears while provoking laughter in another. Ethos is also context
dependent; anyone who is a hotshot in one field but tries something new in a
different context knows this very well. Thus, the rhetorical situation should result
in different weight being given to and strategies in using ethos, pathos, and
logos.

What is important to get out of this is chapter is that we become more astute
readers of the rhetoric that underlies all our communication. My own students
often say that they simply don't believe anything they read or see on the
Internet. But that's no way to live. We cannot go through life simply not believing
anything--how would you know where to get any facts, what to buy, or whom to
date? And it is not enough to merely have a constantly skeptical attitude towards
our media. In fact, ironically, those who are the most untrusting, tend to be the
ones most taken in by conspiracy theories and fake news according to a recent
study Joshua Hart and Molly Graether. Instead of wholly withholding our trust, we
should be able to "read the room," as Chapter 2 puts it, and figure out what the
speaker is really doing with their words. Are they trying to tug at your
heartstrings? Are they making logical sense? Do they have the credibility to
speak in this field? These are crucial questions to evaluate whom and what we
actually trust in the everything that we consume.

Furthermore, as the old adage states, knowledge is power. Now that you are
familiar with ethos, pathos, and logos, you can use them as reminders on
possible ways to develop your own writing. Are there sources you could add to
better establish your credibility in that research paper? Have you developed a
logical and persuasive argument devoid of fallacies in that essay? Is there a way
to make your narrative appeal to your reader's emotions? Asking yourself
questions about ethos, pathos, and logos can help you shape your own writing by
looking at the larger picture of what you are achieving in your writing and why.

                                                                     61
Final Activity 3.8: the Rhetorical Analysis of an Advertisement
Find an advertisement for any product, service, or place that you use
regularly. Consider what you already know about the product and the
target audience (who is likely yourself). How does this advertisement
succeed or fail in using ethos, pathos, and logos to fulfill its purpose?
Are there any ways that the ad might have been more effective?

Chapter 4: Telling Stories With Narrative
Writing Conventions

                                           Julie King (she/her) is an adjunct professor of
                                           English at Kutztown University. She teaches Effective
                                           Composition to first-year students and Nordic

                                           teaching in higher ed., Julie taught secondary
                                           education. Julie King holds a degree in English and

In my favorite pastime podcast, The Great Stories, host Trev Downey reads
masterpieces aloud to his listeners. In a soothing Irish accent, he begins every
episode with a reminder of the importance of the storytelling tradition: "Humans
have been telling each other yarns as long as language itself has existed." Now,
long as language itself has existed." Now, there is a reason for this longevity: a
good story is something that we remember. Stories leave a lasting impression on
us; they inspire us, connect us, and teach us valuable lessons about ourselves
and the world around us.

Being able to tell a compelling story is an extremely useful skill, and when you
master it, you will find there are few rhetorical situations in which you cannot use
your storytelling abilities. As a teacher, I use storytelling all the time, and and so
do a wide range of other professions from coaching to business administration
communication to PR, counseling to entrepreneurship.

How to effectively tell a story is a skill you can apply throughout your time as a
student at KU and as you progress in your life and career. As a student, you can
use storytelling in academic writing to engage your reader and illustrate points
you are making. Storytelling is also used to great effect in speeches,
presentations, cover letters, business plans, podcasts, TED Talks, stand-up
comedy, advertisements, films, documentaries, and countless other visual and
audio-based genres.

                                                                     63
Telling Your Story: Personal Narratives

One of the first assignments you are likely to write as a student at KU is the
Personal Narrative. You might be completely new to this genre, but I can assure
you that it can be both powerful and, dare I say, fun to write.
What type of text is a Personal Narrative, exactly? The name gives it away:
narrative is simply a fancy word for story, and personal means that it's a story
about you, told from your perspective, with your original thoughts and reflections
about an experience and how it affected you.
When you choose an experience to write about, make sure you consider your
purpose. Have you learned something about yourself or the world around you
that you want to convey to your reader? We call this the theme of your
narrative. Your narrative should go beyond your own unique experience and
speak to a universal theme your audience can relate to. In your personal
narrative, you want to reflect on this theme and what you learned through your
experience. In this way, telling your own story can be a powerful experience for
yourself and your reader. When you claim your story and share it, others might
learn from it, be inspired by it, or simply see things from a new perspective.

Keeping It Interesting: Narrative Structure

When writing a narrative, you want to keep it interesting, and structuring your
narrative around a conflict will ensure just that. Conflicts can be both internal or
external factors or struggles that you face. It can be anything from teenage
insecurities to getting caught lying to your parents, from losing a loved one to
moving across the country, from coming to college to finding your identity.
Whatever the conflict is, it will be the driving force of your narrative that keeps
readers engaged. We can learn a lot from the basic structure of storytelling called
"Freytag's Pyramid" pictured below.

                                                                     64
Freytag's Pyramid

                                         One Possible Rendition of Freytag's Triangle or Pyramid

Exposition: The exposition traditionally establishes your narrative's characters
and setting. You want to set the stage for your narrative here and hook your
reader. The exposition also often introduces or at least alludes to the conflict, but
make sure you don't give everything away just yet.
Inciting Incident: Did something happen that kickstarted the main conflict in
your narrative? If so, that would be considered your inciting incident. In her
narrative essay "My Two-House, Duffel-Bag Life" fifteen-year-old Natalie Muñoz
has the moment when her parents told her of their divorce as the inciting
incident that leads to the main conflict in her narrative, namely her grief and
inner struggle to accept her new "two-house, duffel-bag" life.
Rising Action: In this part, you can paint a clearer picture of the narrative's
setting and characters and expand on the conflict. Rising action typically includes
a sequence of events, though not necessarily everything that has happened in
real life. It is important that this part continuously builds tension that propels
your narrative towards its climax.
Climax: This is the point of greatest tension in your narrative, AKA, when things
come to a head. It should also be a turning point for the narrator in that sense

                                                                     65
that you make a choice, a discovery, or a decisive action to address the external
or internal conflict you are facing.
Falling Action: Let your reader know what the aftermath of the narrative's
climax was. Was the conflict resolved and which significant changes did the
experience bring about for you? Again, only include the most interesting aspects
of the aftermath here to keep the narrative moving forward.
Resolution: Finally, you can present your reader with a resolution and reflect on
what you've learned from the experience. This step concludes your narrative and
should tie it together with the exposition. Keep in mind that a conflict does not
necessarily have to be completely solved in order for you to share your story. You
might still be waiting for a final resolution. That's okay. Check out "My Two-
House, Duffle-Bag Life" for a good example of a personal narrative without a fully
conclusive resolution.
Activity 4.1: Filling In the Blanks of Your Story
Take a moment to consider the structure of your own story. You can use
the pyramid below to play around with your narrative's structure.

                                                        Blank Freytag's Triangle or Pyramid

Keep in mind that while this might help you organize your writing, variations in
structure--like telling the story out of chronological order, beginning in medias
res (in the middle of the action), or using flashbacks, foreshadowing, and other
narrative devices--can be great ways to keep your narrative interesting. In the

                                                                     66
student sample provided later, for example, Ian Beck begins his narrative by
revealing a glimpse of the narrative's point of greatest tension. In that way, he
catches the reader's attention and foreshadows the conflict before he sets the
stage with more traditional exposition.

Bringing Your Story to Life

A personal narrative is non-fiction because it is based on real-life events, but the
genre has several elements you might recognize from fictional storytelling such
as characters, setting, dialogue and description.

Description is crucial to bringing your story to life for your reader. Similarly, to
make your characters come alive, dialogue is key. Sometimes, what is said
between two people can tell your reader more about who the characters are than
a description could convey.

Setting

When and where does your story take place? When establishing the setting, use
detailed descriptions to paint a clear picture of when and where the narrative
takes place. Your reader was not there with you, so they will only have your
words to guide them. Let your words paint a clear picture of the scenario as well
as set the mood for your reader.

In a first draft, a former student of mine started off her narrative in this manner:

                 That summer I worked at a farm. The days were long and
                 tough, and the barn smelled terrible. I thought I would
                 hate it, but I ended up really liking it.

We unfortunately don't have a very clear picture of the "when and where" of this
story after reading these sentences. What's missing? Which details could we add
to give our reader a better understanding of the setting? Which sensory details,
specific information, adjectives, or figurative language could we use to better
describe the farm, the barn, and the summer? After we discussed these options,
the student turned in a revised paragraph:

                 The summer I graduated from high school, I worked on my
                 uncle's dairy farm. I remember stumbling out of bed before
                 dawn and driving through the dark to get to his farm in
                 time for the first milking. Stepping into the big red barn,
                 the intense smell of one hundred cows in a crowded space
                 overpowered my senses. I will never forget how the smell of
                 fresh manure and wet cattle mixed with the humid air in the
                 barn. I know my uncle had taken me on as a favor to my mom,

                                                                     67
                 but I like to think that by the end of the summer, I had
                 earned my place by his side in the barn.

This time, we know what type of farm she worked at and why she was there. We
also have a clearer picture of what she meant by "long days." The "terrible smell"
in the barn is described more vividly, using sensory details, so that those of us
who have never been in a barn can picture the setting. What else do you think
she might have added?

Activity 4.2: Adding Descriptive Details

Consider which descriptive details you can add to make the following
scenario more engaging.

                 I went to the store to buy milk for my mom. The store was
                 located near our house, but a few blocks seemed like a long
                 way to me.

Then draft a paragraph based on these lines with an added, extra layer
of description. What kind of milk did the mom need? What store did the
narrator go to? How old is he/she/they? Why do a few blocks seem "like
a long way"? Was it raining?

Don't worry about exaggerating; just add as much description as you
possibly can and have fun with it. If you're doing this in class, compare
your own result to that of a classmate's. Consider the different
descriptive and stylistic choices you have made and the effects they
have.

Characters

A personal narrative typically only includes a few characters, yourself included.
These are often people that are important to you, but don't forget that your
reader does not know them or understand their significance to you unless you
convey this on the page.

It is not an easy task. How do we make a person seem real and alive to our
reader? A good place to start is considering what you always think of when you
think of this person--think of two or three defining features, character traits, or
behaviors that stand out to you about the person. If you're writing about your
grandmother, you might think of her soft hands and mild eyes, the way she
makes sure you have clean sheets when you sleep over, or makes you double
layered Nutella sandwiches after school. Maybe it's the way she played UNO with
you at kitchen table when you were young that comes to mind. Instead of simply
stating "My grandmother was the nicest person in the world," something many

                                                                     68
people could claim. Use those unique details in your description to bring your
grandmother to life.

Activity 4.3: Describing a Character

Close your eyes and think of a person in your life you want to describe.
Note two or three physical features that come to mind. Then, jot down
two or three character traits and one thing this person would often do.
Use your notes to draft a short paragraph that introduces this person to
someone who does not know them.

Describing body language is also a great way to better show a character to your
reader. In Amy Tan's essay "Fish Cheeks," the narrator uses telling details (or
short, precise descriptions) to convey how one of her characters is feeling.
Instead of directly stating that Robert, a young teenage boy in the narrative, is
embarrassed, Tan writes: "Robert looked down," "Robert's face reddened," and
"Robert grunted and looked away." That's all we get, but it's all we need to fully
understand how Robert is feeling.

Student Samples

Let's look at how these principles are used in a Personal Narrative written by KU
students. The first example below is a personal narrative written by Ian Beck in
the style of a short story using a traditional narrative structure, description, and
dialogue. In the margins, there are comments provided to help draw your
attention to the smart choices that Ian makes in his narrative. The second
example by KU student Jax Lucchese is entitled "Being Trans with an Eating
Disorder" and is a narrative essay, which means that it combines elements of
both narrative storytelling and essay structure. Both examples are provided since
professors can differ on what style they prefer--make sure to check with your
professor or the assignment details so that you follow the style best suited to
your assignment.

In the following personal narrative, Ian Beck is faced with the physical challenge
of climbing a mountain and, at the same time, the inner conflict of letting go of
his pride and accepting help from others. First, Ian hooks his reader with an "in
medias res" introduction. The exposition then establishes the narrative's setting
and characters, provides the reader with the necessary context, and alludes to
the conflict.

                                                                     69
"Climbing a Mountain" by Ian Beck

                                           Ian Beck (he/him) is a student at Kutztown
                                           University, originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
                                           Ian loves spending time outdoors and with friends.
                                           Some of Ian's hobbies include hiking, fencing,
                                           reading, writing, learning, and video games. He's
                                           also a total nerd when it comes to Star Wars.

                 I clutched my stomach, doubling over, and threw up into a
                 scrubby bush, seemingly alone in the sparse forest of New
                 Mexico.

"In medias res" means "in the middle" and it's a device that Ian uses here to get
us right into the middle of the action.

                 Two years prior, not long after my 15th birthday, I signed
                 up to go on a nearly 100-mile trek with a 45-pound backpack
                 through the dry and dusty deserts, dense forests, and the
                 dreaded mountains of the Philmont Scout Ranch with a group
                 of my fellow Scouts.

Notice the use of specific details to establish setting.
                 At the time, I greatly prided myself on my independence, my
                 ability to just grin and bear it through any challenges
                 life threw at me. However, I soon realized that I was a
                 less avid backpacker than my peers.

Here, Ian alludes to both internal and external conflicts.

                 As we took weekend practice trips on Appalachia trails
                 throughout the fall and winter of 2019, eager for the
                 summer of the next year when we were set to take our
                 journey, I consistently fell behind my crew and viewed the
                 training trips as a competition I was losing.

During the rising action, the narrative touches upon a series of events, like
challenges faced while preparing for their trip, while continuing to develop the
conflict of the narrative.

                                                                     70
Ian gives a few specific details, but wisely avoids giving a step-by-step account
of events. Although a personal narrative is based on real life events, you don't
have to cover everything.

                 It was not long until the day we were set to embark on out
                 trek came. The first few days went by without mishap. We
                 had spent two years training our bodies to be able to
                 handle the walking. We passed the evenings by participating
                 in once-in-a lifetime activities like blacksmithing and
                 railroad building in staffed campsites and telling stories
                 around the campfire on nights when we were deep in the
                 wilderness.

Ian gives a few specific details, but wisely avoids giving a step-by-step account
of events. Although a personal narrative is based on real life events, you don't
have to cover everything.

                 On the sixth night of our journey, the halfway point, there
                 was no chatter in our campsite. We sat in silence, all deep
                 in contemplation, gazing upwards at the most beautiful
                 night sky we had ever seen.

Notice the use of "telling details" that reveal the states of mind of the characters.
In this case, silence speaks louder than words.

                 It was only just getting dark, but we went to bed much
                 sooner than usual. We had to be up at four the next
                 morning, and we were too nervous to talk as we finished our
                 MREs of questionable quality.

To build tension, Ian describes the nervous atmosphere in the camp the night
before the steep climb begins.

                 Tomorrow, we would climb a mountain.

Ian continuously reminds us of the challenge ahead.

As the narrative closes in on its climax, tension continues to build. Just like in the
exposition, Ian Beck uses specific details and description to paint a clear picture
of his restless sleep and rough start the next morning.

                 Our camp that night was at the highest elevation we had
                 been at so far, even though we still had over 4,000 feet to
                 go. I shivered in my sleeping bag, fitfully turning over,
                 trying to get warm and let sleep take me. My eyes closed
                 and before I knew it, it was time to move. We rolled out of
                 our sleeping bags, the dry chill of the morning air biting
                 through our clothes as we packed away our campsite.

                                                                     71
Notice specific details and sensory imagery.

                 Breakfast today would be a granola bar and stick of jerky
                 because we needed to move. If we did not leave soon enough,
                 it would be like Hell on Earth, trudging under the blaze of
                 the sun.

Tension continues to build.

                 I could tell something was off as soon as we started to
                 walk. My stomach roiled, and it felt like the jambalaya I
                 had eaten the night before was trying to burn its way out.
                 My knees felt weak and my head light. We had not reached
                 the mountain proper yet, but our climb was all uphill
                 through the foothills. I got so dizzy that I had to stop,
                 but I was still too foolishly stubborn to stop and ask for
                 help, for the others to wait up for me.

While physical challenge in the main focus here, Ian also reminds his reader of
the internal conflict.

As the narrative reaches its climax, it also returns to its opening line. Although
Beck hasn't reached the summit of the mountain yet, this is the point of greatest
tension of his journey.

                 I doubled over, and the jambalaya made its return.

                 "Hold up, everyone. Ian needs our help."

The strategic use of dialogue in this moment slows the narrative as it reaches its
climax.

                 I very much consider myself a team player. When my crew
                 needed help, I was always glad to lend a hand, but I
                 struggled to ask for help in return. One of the adult
                 leaders gave me some nausea medication and made sure I
                 drank water. They took my gear and redistributed about
                 fifteen pounds of my load to the others, just as I had
                 helped when one of the others had been struggling a few
                 days earlier. The medicine and lighter pack helped, as we
                 began to move again soon after, but I felt weak, a drag on
                 the whole team. I remember my cheeks burning with what I
                 felt was shame, although in hindsight it may have been
                 whatever illness I had.

Ian reflects on his inner conflict which exceeds his external one at this moment.

Battling pride and shame is a relatable, universal theme in this narrative.

                                                                     72
In the falling action, Ian fills in his reader on the aftermath of this moment. As
the team pushes forward and the medicine seems to settle his stomach, the
beauty of Mount Baldy helps Ian forgets his initial embarrassment. Though the
summit is now closer than Ian first realized, and his physical symptoms are all
but gone, the narrator still has an important lesson to learn.

                 Without the team, I would not have been able to even make
                 it to the base of the mountain we were supposed to be
                 climbing.

                 After what felt like the longest hour of my life, we came
                 around a corner and saw it for the first time: Mount Baldy,
                 the highest point in Philmont, a whopping 12,441 feet above
                 sea level. It was beautiful. Adrenaline flooded my system.
                 We were going to really do this; my friends and I would
                 climb a mountain. My stomachache seemed to go away as we
                 got closer and closer.

This shift is important because it shows that the experience has significantly
affected him. A new normal is being established in the aftermath of the conflict
he faced.

                 We finally reached the tree line, where the ground turned
                 from grass and dirt to bare, loose rock. I had not realized
                 it, but we had been climbing the mountain the whole time,
                 and we only had the last 2,000 feet of climb left. We had
                 hiked over fifty miles that week, but the last part would
                 be the most grueling by far. We dug our hiking poles in,
                 scrabbling up steep, slick rock. It was hard, but we pushed
                 through with the end in mind.

                 I was mere steps from the end, a particularly steep last
                 stretch, when my friend ahead of me offered me his hand to
                 help pull me across the finish line, "Need a hand, Ian?"

                 I almost brushed him off, like I usually would have, but
                 something in me seemed to have shifted. I took his hand and
                 let him help me pull through and finish our climb.

Now finally at the summit, Beck reflects on what the experience has taught him.
The symbolism of having climbed a mountain and reached the top is a beautiful
backdrop to the realization he makes about himself. Something has shifted inside
our narrator. He is no longer the Ian "who prided himself on independence"; he
now knows how to lean on his friends.

                 As we sat on the summit, nearly three miles in the sky,
                 enjoying the view that stretched for miles, I slowly made
                 the connections about what I had been learning while

                                                                     73
                 climbing a mountain: it does not make us weak to need to
                 lean on those around us, rather it shows the strength of
                 the relationships we have.
Ian chooses to only briefly reflect on the lesson learned. Because of the twofold
nature of the personal narrative, the balance between storytelling and personal
reflection is largely up to you. Next, take a look at Jax Lucchese's "Being Trans
with an Eating Disorder" to see how reflection can play a major role in a personal
narrative.

                                                                     74
"Being Trans With an Eating Disorder" by Jax Lucchese

Jax's narrative is written in the style of a narrative essay, which incorporates
elements of narrative covered in this chapter as well as elements of essay
structure that will be addressed in the following chapter. As an activity, you
might mark up this essay with notes explaining its structure like Ian Beck's
example above.

                                           Jax Lucchese (he/him) is a double major in Social
                                           Work and Entrepreneurship and Case Management
                                           minor who wants to open a nonprofit organization
                                           for transgender people with eating. When writing
                                           this narrative piece for Dr. Clemens' course, he
                                           recalled his personal experiences as a transgender
                                           man with an ED.

                 Growing up as a kid, my relationship with gender was
                 complicated. On top of the other issues in my life at that
                 point in time, I didn't understand how to articulate how I
                 felt in terms of identity. The one way I felt I had control
                 over my life and how I felt towards myself was through my
                 body, and subsequently food. While at the time I was
                 unaware of how this would become a huge issue in my life,
                 it would eventually come to be one of the greatest
                 challenges I have ever faced.

                 When I was in my junior year of high school, I finally
                 realized that something was wrong. I realized that I was
                 transgender, that although I was born a woman I did not
                 identify as one. This was a huge realization for me. It
                 felt like my whole life made sense again, but also made my
                 world come crashing down. Also, during this time is when I
                 was struggling the most with my eating disorder. The one
                 thing that made me feel some sort of control over my life
                 in my early childhood developed into of the most deadly and
                 horrid mental illnesses. While at the time I did not
                 realize it, being trans made my struggles with disordered
                 eating unique.

                 It was a week after my 16th birthday when my parents
                 realized I needed help and needed it as soon as possible. I

                                                                     75
was admitted into an ED residential treatment facility
where I would stay for almost two months. Every day was
horrid. I had a psychiatrist, nutritionist and therapist,
who all had no clue how to help me. I was not complying
with the goals that they had set for me, and eventually had
to go onto a feeding tube for a month. Without that tube, I
would have eventually died.

I was not the picture-perfect client that my treatment team
wanted. I attended all the groups they wanted me to. I
showed up to every meeting and intervention they required
me to go to. I talked with them about how I felt. But I did
not listen to them. They presented me with challenges and,
in the end, deadlines and told me that if I didn't comply,
they would eventually kick me out of the treatment
facility. They took everything away from me as punishment,
like my mentally ill brain was not punishment enough. I
couldn't call anyone from home, I wasn't allowed any
visitors, I couldn't email anyone, and eventually I wasn't
even allowed to have sessions with my therapist. I had no
one to talk to besides the other residents (who were also
struggling with their own disorder).

While on the surface this seems like just punishment, no
one would listen to why I was struggling more than their
other clients. No one on my team would listen to why I did
not agree with what they were telling me, and the benefits
of eating. The truth is, me being a transgender male made
my eating disorder much harder to work with and treat. In
groups, I would be taught that you need to eat in order get
your period back, so eventually you can have a child. They
also would talk about how feminine features (such as
breasts) would get bigger, which made most of the women
happy. While I was glad that some of my friends would be
able to use this as motivation, these reasons did more harm
than good to me. For me, my eating disorder was a way to
make my appearance match what I felt I was on the inside.
When I was ill, my feminine parts (such as my breasts) were
not as apparent and mostly gone. My period was gone, which
made me so happy. I no longer had the monthly reminder of
my birth sex. My body was slowly dying, but I finally felt
that I could see who I really was on the outside. So, how
was I supposed to look at these things coming back as a
positive side of recovery?

A huge factor on why no one on my treatment team at the
residential center was able to help me is because not many
people who have experience working with people with eating
disorders know much about the unique struggles of trans
people with eating disorders. While the trans community is
one of the most affected groups by eating disorders, our

                                                  76
                 struggles are not known. Transgender people have only begun
                 to be accepted into society in some places, while majority
                 of other places are against us even existing. It should not
                 be surprising then that not many people know how to help
                 trans people in their unique struggles with eating
                 disorders.

                 Going through treatment and basically having to being my
                 own therapist impacted me in many ways. I started to
                 realize why my team couldn't help me, and that my struggles
                 were unique compared to others around me. I also realized
                 that I wasn't alone, many other trans people were going
                 through what I was. They also were in a unique situation
                 and felt isolated. I found it in myself to try to recover.
                 I told myself that if I could be the person I needed to
                 hear from when no one else could understand what I was
                 going through. The dream of being able to help and raise
                 awareness for transgender people who struggle with
                 eating disorders rose from this. From that day on, it has
                 been my mission to raise awareness for this cause, and to
                 help as many people as I can in the future.

Final Activity 4.4: Narrative Writing Conventions Checklist

Use this list to see if your own piece checks all the conventions of a
personal narrative:

          · An engaging introduction
          · An exposition that establishes characters, setting, conflict, and

            theme
          · A clear conflict and resolution
          · Description and dialogue that brings the characters and setting

            to life
          · Original thoughts and reflections about the significance of the

            events
          · A resolution that concludes and ties the narrative together

                                                                     77
Chapter 5: Generating Ideas and Writing
Topic Proposals

                                           Sean Weaver, PhD (he/him) is an English/
                                           Literature doctoral graduate from Louisiana State
                                           University with a minor in WGS. He currently works
                                           as an adjunct professor at various colleges in the
                                           Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania teaching introductory
                                           classes in WGS and Composition. His work focuses
                                           on the intersections between queer and postcolonial
                                           theories in literature and fiction.

So, you have been assigned a writing project. Chances are you have already
written something for one of your college courses--for some of us, this is not our
first foray into college-level writing--whether it be a creative piece like a personal
narrative or even a fully researched paper. But, on the off chance you have not,
the thought of writing your first college essay might be daunting.

This intimidation factor is particularly present when we have some freedom on
what to write about. In some college classes, college professors will choose the
topic for us, just as writers in their various fields or careers might be assigned a
specific topic by an editor. However, in other college classes, we are free to
choose topics in relation to our writing projects. At these times we are left with
an important decision, perhaps the most difficult choice to make when beginning
the writing process: Choosing a topic.

If you are anything like me as a writer, even after years of developing my craft,
the hardest part of beginning a new writing project--whatever the genre might
be--is deciding what I want to write about. There are times where ideas come
quite easily to me, and for me this is true when I get to choose from a list of
potential ideas. In other circumstances, I need to think carefully about what it is
I want to write about--especially when I am given no direction. I would guess
that for you, the same might hold true. When we are given freedom to explore
new ideas, we might think, "Whoa... there's so much I want to say, but I don't
even know where to begin."

                                                                     78
This chapter is about choosing those beginnings, and I will guide you through the
process of deciding on a topic. In the pages that follow, I will introduce various
tips and tricks. We will examine different methods writers use to explore
potential writing ideas--whether you are choosing your own topic, choosing from
a list, or are assigned a specific topic. Even if you have been assigned a topic,
there is still room to make choices. This chapter will also show you why it is
important to consider genre and audience when exploring potential topics. This
chapter will also explore how we as writers take broader topics and narrow them
down as we develop our ideas. Writing topics constantly evolve throughout the
writing and research process. Thus, our writing choices are never finite but,
instead, guide us to developing original topic ideas and making them take fuller
shape as we write.

A Beginning, but Not the Only Beginning

Fantasy author Robert Jordan begins every one of his Wheel of Time novels with
a statement that, I think, really captures the essence of "topics":

                 The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving
                 memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even
                 myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth
                 comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an
                 Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose above the
                 great mountainous island of Tremalking. The wind was not
                 the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to
                 the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning. (21)

Here, Jordan sets up the plot of his entire series. The Third Age is where all the
action happens; a hero arises, the quintessential dark one wreaks havoc, and we
meet a variety of characters all connected by a single moment in time. In short,
everything that came before and comes after is connected to the Third Age, what
we might call the topic of Jordan's series. However, this isn't a chapter about
fantasy novels. Instead, we might draw a comparison between the final lines of
Jordan's passage above and our goals as writers when deciding on a topic. Let's
tweak it a bit: There are neither beginnings nor endings to topics. But a topic is a
beginning.

As a beginning, topics should provide inspiration and direction for our writing. A
good topic will help us deliver a solid thesis statement (if our writing project is a
research paper with a hypothesis we are trying to prove) or help us develop an
airtight plot for a narrative (if our writing project is a creative piece in which we
tell a story). However, topics should never be finite or, to borrow a familiar
adage, set in stone. Thus...There are neither beginnings nor endings to topics. As

                                                                     79
you write, you will find that the topic you thought you had settled on will evolve
and change according to new research you read, any creative inspirations you
encounter, conversations with other writers reading your drafts, and your own
thought process. Each of these moments, as you work through the writing
process, will influence the way you understand the topic you have chosen as well
as your feelings regarding it. Simply put, topics can and will change as you draft
your writing, so do not be afraid of making any changes.

So, what exactly is a topic? Depending on the genre of writing you are doing,
what shape your topic will take might vary greatly. But, the most straight forward
definition of a topic I can give you is this: a topic is what you are writing about.
Sometimes the topic of a paper might be the answer to a question. Other times
the topic might be the plot of story. In some cases, your topic might be very
broad, like sports, or narrow--like the funding of women's professional athletics.
Irrespective of genre, a topic that you have researched and thought about in
advance will provide a beginning, an onramp to the wheel of time that will
become your writing process. Now let us think about how we might choose that
topic.

Starting With a List

Whether you are writing a creative piece or an academic research essay, we need
to think through our ideas to find a suitable topic. One way we might begin
thinking about an idea to write about is by making a list. A prolific spoken word
poet from New York, Sara Kay explains in a TED Talk titled "If I Should Have a
Daughter" that one way she unlocks the creative process of deciding on a topic is
"to make a list of at least three things" she knows to be true. We can use Kay's
process to generate our own topics; in fact, I do just that whenever I am writing.
For example, if I were assigned a literacy narrative, a common assignment in
COMP100 courses to reflect on our personal experiences in reading and writing, I
might list the following:

      1. I learned to read before I learned to write.

      2. I was not always the writer I am today.

      3. Several English teachers changed my life as educators.

From this list, I have three potential topics that might become plots about which
I could shape a literacy narrative. I could write a story about how reading made
me a writer. I could write about how most of my experiences with writing were
often negative and how this changed when I gained more confidence in myself.

                                                                     80
Or finally, I could write a literacy narrative about how English teachers changed
my life. But we can develop these topics or potential plots further by extending
the ideas expressed in our original list, a practice commonly known as looping,
returning to an idea you have already written down. For example, let's extend
some of the ideas that I presented in my first list:

          1. The first book I ever read was Little Bear by Maurice Sendak. I was five
              years old.

          2. I failed at least one composition class as an undergraduate at Kutztown
              University.

          3. I teach composition now because of my English educators in high
              school, particularly my 12th-grade AP English teacher.

Any of the examples I have written down on both lists are acceptable topics for
me to pursue in a literacy narrative. There is room to explore each of the ideas
and room for me to grow my topic. You might have noticed in each of these lists
that my ideas are my personal experiences. As writers, choosing topics that we
are personally invested in will make writing significantly easier. You will find that
writing on a topic you know often lends a sense of confidence.

   Research Your Passions

   John Stanley (he/him), Professor of History at Kutztown University

   One issue that I always try to empathize to students is that they should find
   something they are passionate about when starting a writing assignment,
   particularly for my research writing class. I usually have them start with the
   general essay prompts and provide them with a worksheet on developing the
   topic until it is truly theirs. In addition, I have them share their ideas on how
   they are developing the topic with the rest of the class once they have
   grappled with the idea a bit themselves.

   I believe the best way to think through a topic is to talk about it with others.
   I do this in my own research and encourage students to do the same in their
   own work.

                                                                     81
Activity 5.1: Listing and Looping

Now you try it. List three things you know to be true. Then, loop back
and give more specific details on each, expanding on how you know it to
be true. Notice which of the three was easiest to expand on and consider
using this for a future writing topic.

          1.

Reflecting on What You Know and Don't Know

Sometimes choosing to write on topics "we know" may present us with a
problem. According to Booth et. al., "You may be tempted to rely too heavily on
what feels familiar... falling back on that kind of certainty will just keep you from
doing your best thinking.... When some beginning researchers succeed at making
one kind of argument, they just keep making it over and over" (121). Thus,
writers must be careful of relying too heavily on topics in which they are
personally invested or topics they know a lot about.

There are many examples of writers circulating the same ideas over and over. In
fact, sometimes as writers we forget that our writing does not exist in isolation--
we write to share our ideas and thoughts with others and to challenge other
perspectives. Sometimes our expertise deprives us of pursuing new ideas or
arguments, new stories, or even just learning a new field of study. You should
not be deterred from writing about topics within your field or writing from
personal experiences. It is always great to begin with what you know, but just be
careful that you do not cut yourself off from exploring new ideas, too.

Kay echoes the sentiment of being open to exploring new ideas in her formerly
mentioned TED talk: "...it is tempting to keep writing the same poem, or keep
telling the same story, over and over...you have to grow and explore and take
risks and challenge yourself" (13:07). Take risks when it comes to choosing a
topic; you never know what you might learn about yourself or what you are
capable of writing. It is worth mentioning again--topics are not permanent. If
you choose to explore a topic you are unfamiliar with and are having a difficult
time coming up with something to write or research, then you can always fall
back on what you know and feels comfortable. I think, though, that you will find
that writing is most fun when we combine what we know with what we do not,
perhaps taking an aspect of what we are already familiar with and then

                                                                     82
expanding into new territory or taking something unfamiliar and relating it to our
own experiences.
Activity 5.2: Listing "What I Know" and "What I Don't Know"
Make two lists, one labeled "What I know" and one labeled "What I
don't know, but am curious about." In brief bullet points, make each list
to contain as many items as you can. Don't limit yourself to traditional
research topics; make sure to also consider your own personal interests
and everyday experiences.

Creating a Word Web of Your Topic

Creating lists is only one way of generating potential ideas that might turn into
topics. There are plenty of ways to generate ideas, so let us examine a few other
examples. Some writers like to create a map of their ideas in relation to a topic
known as a word web. You can sketch out a word web by hand in a composition
notebook or you can use the worksheet that follows this chapter. The following
example from student Chase Marbot, majoring in social media at Kutztown,
shows how to explore a topic using a word web. Here, Chase explores the topic
"brand" and associated words related to it.By listing associated words, Chase can
develop and expand his topic further by making clearer connections between the
words. For example, two interesting words that stand out to me in the word web
are "iconic" and "social media." Let's connect them and ask a question--how does
one make their brand iconic using social media? Word webs are all about making
potential connections as a means of developing topics. Ask questions, branch
out, and create a word web with as many ideas around the topic as possible.

                                                         Chase Marbot's Sample Word Web

                                                                     83
Activity 5.3: Create a Word Web
Use the following diagram, or one like it of your own creation, to build a
word web to generate related ideas around your main topic idea.

                                                                     Fillable Word Web

                                                                     84
Just Write!

Some writers skip ahead and begin writing. Freewriting is a great exercise when
it comes to unblocking writers who are blocked in picking a topic. To free write,
pick a word or an idea associated with your topic and then write anything that
comes to mind for a set amount of time. Once the time is up, read over what you
wrote and pick out a sentence or idea that really sticks out to you. Then, write
for another five minutes, responding to what you wrote down the first time. Let's
look at a free write from Kutztown Student Gigi Doklan, majoring in professional
writing.

                 Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the fifth mainline
                 installment in the Animal Crossing franchise and was
                 released on March 20, 2020. Animal Crossing is a series of
                 real-time life simulation games, where the player-character
                 lives in a town inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.
                 Differentiating between the style of gameplay presented in
                 Animal Crossing versus The Sims is important because The
                 Sims allows players to be an omniscient force, while in
                 Animal Crossing, the player only has control over
                 themselves. Animal Crossing appeals to players through an
                 interactive world and characters, and lets players develop
                 an island in real-time by completing daily tasks.

In this example, Gigi writes on the topic of the video game Animal Crossing
without having a particular purpose in mind. What stands out in Gigi's free write
is the connection she makes in the different levels of character control the video-
game player has when playing The Sims and Animal Crossing. A potential topic
Gigi might explore more in depth is the importance of character control in video
games. When you are finished, look at the last sentence or paragraph you wrote.
Having spent all that time writing, your final thoughts are likely the most
cohesive, which makes this a great place to find your topic!

Activity 5.4: Freewriting for Topic Ideas

Set a timer for three to five minutes and make sure to have a reliable pen/pencil
or word processor handy. No need for research or internet access. Once you
begin the timer, you should write for the entire length of the time. Don't worry
about mistakes or repeating words or even writing nonsense. The purpose of this
activity is to just let your ideas flow. When the timer stops, reread what you have
written and then take some time to respond to it and develop or rework any
parts that you find promising.

                                                                     85
Other Ways To Generate Ideas

The prewriting exercises to generate ideas listed here are not exclusive; there
are lots of ways to think through ideas regarding a potential topic. In fact, a lot
of exercises exist that can help you--too many to include here. If you are looking
for more ways to spark a topic idea, check out this TED Talk playlist: Simple
Ways to Spark Your Creativity. Each of the TED Talk presenters on this list
outlines potential ways to unlock your own creativity--especially Tim Harford's
talk, "How Frustration Can Make Us More Creative." Harford explains that
sometimes our best ideas come from those moments that are most challenging
to us. So go ahead: Experience that writing block. Frustration is part of the
creative process.

Talk to Your Classmates or Meet With Your Professor

Speaking of frustration, sometimes generating ideas on our own can prove
unproductive. If there comes a time in your process of working through topic
ideas and you have exhausted all you can think of, it is best to talk it out with
others, especially your professor. One primary challenge we might face in
deciding on a topic is that we get "stuck" in our own heads. There have been
times where I have worked on generating an idea--going through all the various
exercises from listing, to mapping, to freewriting, but still couldn't find a topic I
was happy with. When this has happened, I have taken a step back to gain a
new perspective. Sometimes it is important and productive to simply step away
from our thoughts when choosing a topic, and doing so can help us when
encountering writer's block. After stepping back, I have then talked with my
friends about the ideas I had. Speaking with others and getting feedback are
perhaps two of the most crucial steps in being able to formulate topics that just
will not otherwise appear on the page.

If, for some reason, your friends or writing partners cannot help you think
through the topic/topics you are thinking about, meet with your professor. I
recommend that you do not just email your professor to ask them to look over
the ideas you are exploring. Instead, make time to meet with them one-on-one
either during office hours--or make an appointment. Do not be afraid to talk with
your professor, who is often the best person to offer advice for a topic on an
assignment they have asked you to write.

Once you have worked through any of the exercises outlined above and settled
on a topic, it is time to work through the next step of choosing your topic--
conducting preliminary research.

                                                                     86
Researching Your Topic

Depending on the type of writing you are doing and your purpose for writing, you
will conduct preliminary research in different ways--especially later in the
process for more formal academic assignments compared to more creative
assignments. Whatever genre you are writing in, it's best to cast a wide net and
broadly search your topic in the beginning stages since you will need to gather as
much research as possible in order to narrow down your topic idea. Remember
what I said at the beginning of this chapter? When we begin the writing process,
topics are not finite. Instead, they should evolve as we write and work through
the conversation, or scholarship, that exists regarding our subject. That means
broadly reading what has been said or is being said on the topic. Let's look at
different ways to research and narrow down topics.

If you are unsure of how you want to approach your potential topic, one of the
best places to start research is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias can often give
extensive background on subjects. While other types of sources exist (like
newspapers, journal articles, etc...) I find that when trying to narrow down a
topic, encyclopedias offer a great place to explore the topic in full--especially
given that encyclopedias are written with the intent to inform. It is important to
read all there is to read, but the initial goal when researching a topic is to narrow
our focus. We can read journal articles, books, and newspapers once we have
narrowed down the topic by reading through encyclopedias. With that said, there
are two specific types of encyclopedias: general encyclopedias and subject
specific encyclopedias. Encyclopedias are excellent resources to use to use when
we are looking for background information on our subject, the key experts on our
subjects, and or any scholarship that has already been done on our subject.

Using General Encyclopedias To Narrow Down Your Topic

A general subject encyclopedia has articles on almost anything you can think of
or search for. You might be familiar with Wikipedia, which is an online general
subject encyclopedia. Entries are the result of collaborative efforts of often many
writers, editors, and moderators. Wikipedia as a resource for research has grown
more reliable over time through moderation efforts. However, many students are
still warned against its use by their teachers because anyone can write or
contribute ideas to the main pages of any article. Thus, we might find a more
reliable general subject encyclopedia to pursue searches beyond initial Wikipedia
searches. Let us look at one together and practice narrowing down a potential
topic.

                                                                     87
                                              Carman, "Drag Queen," Encyclopedia Britannica

Encyclopedia Britannica is a reputable general subject encyclopedia where we can
start by doing a general search on a specific subject. First, use relevant keywords
to look up your topic in the search bar. For example, say you are interested in
writing a research paper on drag queens. Start with typing the word "drag
queen" in the search bar and hit enter, which will take you to the entry pictured
above.

This picture is only a snapshot of the full entry, but we have a lot to work with
here. The first part of this entry lists news articles on drag queens from within
the past month. The entry itself begins with a clear-cut definition of a drag
queen: "a man who dresses in women's clothes and performs before an
audience." In the same section it goes on to list contemporary examples like
RuPaul. Next, on the right-hand side, the encyclopedia lists related topics and
key figures. And finally, the middle part of this entry lists some problematic
terms associated with drag queens. From each of these parts of the entry I could
explore the topic of drag queens in more detail. For example, I could explore the
following from the last passage: what differentiates a drag queen from a cross-
dresser and what differentiates their performances? Alternatively, I could look up
the name RuPaul and explore his contributions to the "subcultural phenomenon"
of drag.

                                                                     88
Do not be overwhelmed by all the ideas that might pop up should you read a
general encyclopedia article--you might get caught up in the various ideas and
go down various rabbit holes. However, in our preliminary research we simply
want to read and learn more about our topic and potentially find inspiration that
might help us expand our own understanding of it. Thus, general encyclopedias
are a great place to start whenever topics are rather broad, and you can use
them to narrow down your topic further and help you find what sources have
been created by others or have been cited on your topic.

Subject Specific Encyclopedias

If your topic has a well-defined subject area to draw from, I suggest beginning
your research with a subject specific encyclopedia. Subject specific encyclopedias
are often written by experts within the field. One of the subject specific
encyclopedias I use in my field of study is Post-Colonial Studies: The Key
Concepts. While not formally named an encyclopedia, it is like an encyclopedia in
that it includes all the key terms one might need to know regarding postcolonial
studies as well as a list of suggested readings by experts on that topic or term.
For example, one significant term relevant to the field of postcolonial studies
covered in this reference book is "allegory," a story of symbolic significance. On
pages 11 and 12 of the handbook, the author provides the definition of the term
as well as all the relevant background regarding its usage. Let us take a look at
the specific entry.

                                  "Allegory," Post-Colonial Studies: The Key Concepts, Ashcroft et
                                                                           al., 10-11.

                                                                     89
The entry here from Post-Colonial Studies: The Key Concepts consists of several
parts. First, the author/expert defines the key term "allegory." Then, the author
gives a general overview of its background and usage. Next, the author cites two
significant experts on the term. Finally, the author ends the entry with further
suggested readings associated with the term. However, let us take a moment to
reflect on how to develop a topic using this encyclopedia entry.

In the second paragraph, the author specifies that Frederic Jameson (a well-
known literary critic) "made a controversial" statement. If I were writing a paper
on the topic of allegory in postcolonial literatures, I would definitely want to use
the library to consult anything Jameson has written on the topic. Next, the entry
specifies the controversial statement he made: "all third world literatures are
national allegories." And here, we have a great starting point to develop the topic
of an "allegory." I might then ask, "Are all `third world' literatures--that is, those
of developing countries--national allegories?" and pursue that question further--
that is how we develop potential topics. We locate the experts on that subject,
think about the statements they have made, and then ask our own questions.
Thus, encyclopedias or handbooks are excellent places to locate the experts on
our topics as well as the various conversations surrounding our potential topics.

While not all subject specific encyclopedias may provide such detailed entries
regarding a field of study, I can use the handbook above to understand the
ongoing conversation regarding the postcolonial term "allegory" and develop it.
You may want to verify who wrote the encyclopedia, who published it, and who
sponsored its publication especially if the work was found on the greater internet
outside of the library database. Whether you are using a subject specific or
general encyclopedia, both are great places to start narrowing down our topics/
ideas.

One final note: encyclopedias are not the only means of researching a topic.
They are just one of the best resources to help us develop our topics more
clearly. As a reminder, to narrow down your topic, locate all necessary
background research, understand who the experts are and the questions they
ask, and then determine the question you want to ask on the topic.

Activity 5.5: Using a Subject Specific Encyclopedia To Research Your
Topic

Using the KU Library's Gale Reference Database, do a basic word or
phrase search on your topic. Notice what different subject-specific
encyclopedias have to say on your topic and how they might differ in
their focus and coverage of your topic. If you cannot find your topic at

                                                                     90
first, check your spelling and try to vary or broaden your search terms to
find related entries which can give you good context on your idea, even
if its not an exact match.

Researching With Creativity

Most of the research I do is centered within academic writing. However, one of
my favorite authors, David Sedaris--who writes from his own experiences in the
form of memoir writing--offers several pieces of excellent advice for creative
research on the online learning community Master Class. While Sedaris is a
creative writer, his advice can be applied to academic research as well:

          1. Take great notes. Your memory isn't perfect--so getting in the habit of
              being an observant writer and writing everything down will help you
              keep track of all of your story inspiration. Keeping a diary where you
              write down things that happen to you, things you find funny or
              interesting, dialogue you overhear and love, and character traits, will
              help you see the world differently[...]

          2. Meet a variety of people. When was the last time you asked someone
              for directions? Forcing yourself to rely on other people is a great way to
              create built-in encounters with strangers[...]

          3. Be present in the moment. Once you're in the habit of writing
              everything down, you might be tempted to whip out your notebook in
              the middle of a particularly juicy conversation. But resist the urge. "You
              don't want to end it," David says (of "the moment" in question).

Overall, Sedaris gives solid advice for both creative and academic research. The
best way to do creative research is to live in the moment and explore
experiences outside of our comfort zones.

I would also like to add to Sedaris' list of suggestions by advising that you read
the genres of writing that most often deal with the topic you are interested in
writing about. If you are interested in writing an academic paper about zombies,
for instance, you might investigate horror novels, stories, and movies that
feature zombies. This sort of preliminary research can eventually become
primary source material for your work. See the types of topics/stories that
exist within a given genre and you will become a better expert in deciding on the
topics you should be writing on in that genre.

                                                                     91
Writing a Topic Proposal

Now that we have discussed different types of research and how to brainstorm
and narrow it down, we need to consider how to propose your topics to teachers,
especially if a topic proposal has been assigned or if the professor has specified
that they must approve topics first. A research proposal is an important piece of
writing--particularly in higher education if you decide to pursue a master's or
doctoral degree. Many post-graduation professional settings also feature their
versions of topic proposals. Topic proposals can take many shapes and forms and
might include conference proposals, journal article proposals, book proposals,
and the like. Some professors might even assign a research proposal in your
Composition or First-Year-Seminar courses at Kutztown. In some cases, your
professor may ask for only a paragraph that reflects on your topic and why you
are choosing to write on it. More involved projects might require a detailed plan
and lengthy source list or annotated bibliography. Always consult the assignment
and what your professor is asking for in your topic proposal first.

Next let's discuss what you might include in a topic proposal. I will not detail how
to write and structure each and every type of proposal and different professors
may structure proposals in different ways; Purdue OWL is one resource that
effectively overviews how to write and structure many types of proposals. Below,
I will review the basics of what you can include in a topic proposal as a basic
guide. The three primary content sections in a topic proposal are an introduction,
background, and a conclusion. You can use the following sections to understand
each part of the topic proposal while considering the appropriate length
depending on your professor's requirements for your topic proposal assignment.

Introduction

In terms of writing the topic proposal introduction, I should highlight one specific
part of the rhetorical situation: your purpose for writing. As you learned from
previous chapters, you should always consider your audience and purpose when
beginning the writing process. This is especially true when it comes to the topic
proposal. Thus, once you have a topic idea, think about what you want your
audience to know, think, or feel about your topic, centered around your purpose
for writing. Your purpose for writing is intricately connected to your topic; use the
introduction of your topic proposal to explore it in a clear and concise manner.

                                                                     92
Here are some questions to consider when thinking about purpose:

          · Are you writing to inform?

          · Are you writing to solve a problem?

          · Are you writing to answer a question?

          · Are you writing to express an opinion?

          · Are you writing to tell a story?

          · Are you writing within a specific genre? (Booth et al.)

Once you have answered one of these questions as a "yes," you can use your
introduction to explain how your topic relates to your purpose.

Background

In every field or discipline, there are significant voices and writers who must be
acknowledged, especially when exploring how their ideas coincide with or differ
from your approach. Thus, the second section of topic proposals should include
this sort of background information. While a massive amount of background
information might exist on your topic, use this section of your topic proposal to
summarize a few main arguments, showing that you have done your research
and are qualified to speak on the topic. Furthermore, always look up or consult
authors or names that reappear across multiple essays and or research.

Conclusion

Conclusions are often the most difficult part of writing, but in topic proposals, I
find them rather easy to write. In concluding a topic proposal, you are simply
making the case as to why your idea/topic is important. You might also
acknowledge audiences who might be interested in your work/topic here. Point to
other writers who might want to read your work and why they might be
interested in your approach to the topic. Secondly, reinforce how valuable and
exciting your research is. Do not dread writing the conclusion; instead, think
about how conclusions can show your excitement about your topic to your
potential audiences.

Keep Exploring; Topics Are Just a Beginning

In this chapter, we explored the various steps of thinking through potential topics
for both formal research and creative assignments. In the first part of this

                                                                     93
chapter, I introduced various techniques that might help us discover and explore
potential topics. Then, we examined how to do both creative and formal
research. Finally, we looked at the basics of writing a topic proposal. Topics are
the most foundational aspect of any writing project, and we should spend time
shaping, exploring, and developing them. However, I want to return to the most
important part of this chapter and leave you with this final piece of advice: Topics
will evolve and change as you write, research, and discuss your work with others.
For example, in the final section of this chapter I shared bits and pieces of my
dissertation prospectus--the academic proposal that I had to write to justify my
research to my academic advisor during the final phases of my PhD. What I did
not realize at the time that I wrote my prospectus is how much my ideas
regarding my topic would shift and change. Two years later, when I completed
my dissertation, I had moved significantly away from the topic I proposed in my
prospectus. Always remember, topics are just a beginning...not the only
beginning.

Final Activity 5.6: Supplemental Brainstorm Questions
Use the questions below to help you explore your interests and possible
topic ideas. You may choose one of the questions and answer through
freewriting in a separate Word or Google document.

          · What is your major and what topics within your major are you

Many composition theorists believe that writing inherently involves making an
argument. With any deliberate act of communication, we are trying to convey
information in a certain way to elicit a desired response from an audience. We
want to change someone's mind about an issue. We want to influence a person's
thinking. We want to help someone make a more informed choice or decision. We
want to propose a particular solution to a problem. We want to motivate people
to take some course of action.

If you think about it, so much formal writing that students do in school involves
taking a position on a topic. For example, writing a literary analysis or film review
both involve making a well-reasoned argument to an imagined audience about
how we should interpret a text. Likewise, drafting a topic proposal requires some
persuasive elements in order to convince your professor that the topic will make
for a good paper. Even writing a personal reflection involves presenting an
argument about your own self-perception. Because writing is invariably guided by
purpose, which is the reason we want to communicate in the first place, the way
that we organize a text, including the order in which ideas are presented, should
be optimized to achieve this purpose. In academic settings, the genre of
argument (e.g., persuasive essay, argument paper, position paper) often entails

                                                                     95
very specific and formal expectations, particularly in organization. The purpose of
this chapter is to illuminate those expectations so that you can present your
ideas in an explicit, unified, and coherent manner.

Core Components of Persuasive Academic Essays

To write a successful academic essay, writers will perform a variety of "moves."
They will make clearly defined claims. They will situate their views within some
larger context or conversation of existing ideas. They will rely on sound
reasoning and evidence for support. They will address potential
counterarguments or anticipated criticisms of their views. While writing
conventions are not necessarily rigid, academic essays tend to follow similar
patterns of organization. Because of these similarities, we can acknowledge a set
of core components that reliably show up (in one way or another) when drafting
a persuasive academic essay. Over time, these parts and their arrangement
become intuitive, and structuring an essay becomes almost second nature.

The form of an essay might vary slightly depending on the academic field, but in
general, academic papers are written in a clear and straightforward manner. For
this reason, professors will ask that your claims be stated explicitly and that the
ideas presented are logically connected across sections. And while there are
many possible ways to write an argument, academic essays written in the English
language tend to draw from models established by Greek and Roman rhetoricians
thousands of years ago.

I will be the first to admit that, despite majoring in English as an undergraduate,
I was still learning how to organize an essay effectively even as a graduate
student. It was through immersing myself in academic writing and receiving
guidance from dedicated teachers that I gained more confidence in this genre. I
was in the first year of my master's degree program when a professor introduced
me to the Classical Schema of Argumentation, which has served my writing well
ever since.[1] In classical times, Greek and Roman orators regularly relied upon a
structure that essentially contains six "core" components. Although these
components have Latin names (Exordium, Narratio, Divisio, Confirmatio,
Confutatio, and Conclusio), I have renamed them in this chapter, so they make
sense to modern readers. In fact, you may already be familiar with many of
them!

In the sections below, I explain some of the typical "core" components of a
persuasive essay, which derive from the teachings of Classical rhetoric.

                                                                     96
Introduction

Your introduction is the place to win your readers over. Typically, in academic
writing, writers do not plunge directly into an argument. Instead, they establish a
rapport with their audience by engaging readers gradually. In the introduction,
writers lead into the subject (often indirectly) and guide the reader to the stance
that will be taken, establishing an authorial point of view and tone of voice.

As you have probably been told by past English instructors, the introductory
paragraph offers writers a chance to be creative. You might begin with an
analogy, a brief anecdote, the description of a recent event or trend connected to
the topic, or an eye-catching statement or statistic. Any of these techniques,
sometimes referred to as "hooks," can pique the reader's interest and help to
connect them to the topic. In any case, a strong introduction will build trust with
your readers by appealing to their feelings while simultaneously gesturing toward
your perspective on the topic.

Contextual Background

You should plan to describe the issue, problem, or controversy at hand early on
in your essay. You can do this as part of your introductory paragraph, or you can
begin a new paragraph. (See? Already we can tell that some of these
"components" are flexible.) In the "Contextual Background" section, writers
establish the events and ideas that are driving them to write about their topics
for their audience. This section might include personal circumstances or
anecdotes that justify a writer's interest in the subject. It could also include a
summation of views provided by other writers: What have people been saying
about the topic? What ideas are circulating? How has recent conversation been
shaped by other thinkers and writers? This section can include a brief historical
gloss of events that establishes a common way for audiences to understand the
topic. One way to think about these opening components is that the introduction
gains the readers' interest about the topic while the contextual background
brings them up to speed on it.

   The contextual background can sometimes function as part of the
   introduction, or "hook," particularly if it is a compelling personal story. The
   thing to remember is that an essay's introductory sections should attempt to
   connect you (the writer) to the topic and to the audience while also
   establishing your tone, stance, and style.

                                                                     97
Activity 6.1: Introduction Brainstorm Freewrite

Take a moment to think of what exactly got you interested in pursuing
the topic of your argument. This can be a personal experience, an article
you found, a particular fact that you learned, something a friend said to
you, or anything else that drew your attention to the topic you are
developing. Then, set a timer to 3 minutes. Without stopping to think
about it or looking anything up, recount exactly what it was that caught
your attention and what makes it so fascinating. When the timer is up,
pause your writing and consider whether you might be able to
incorporate some of what you wrote into your introduction. Keep in mind
that this is just a start. Revision, research, and further explanation will
be needed to craft a smooth introduction.

Main Claims and Thesis Statements

Academic essays are based on a strong, arguable main claim, which is
traditionally referred to as the thesis statement. (Depending on your instructor,
you may encounter various terms, such as thesis statement, main claim, main
proposition, or main argument. While these terms may differ, they all essentially
refer to the central idea or proposition that forms the backbone of your academic
essay.) Your paper's main claim should clearly convey your stance or position,
and it should lay out what you will argue.

When you are stating a claim, it is important to remember that certain kinds of
statements cannot be argued effectively: statements of fact, which cannot be
disputed and, therefore, yield no potential opposition; statements of personal
belief, taste, or preference, which might not be able to be substantiated by
evidence; and statements that are so obvious, or generally accepted, that no one
would disagree with them. These lead to weak essays.

A strong claim, on the other hand, will be specific, debatable, backed by reasons
and evidence, and promote further discussion. In other words, a strong main
claim invites reasonable people to rethink the issue or concept and hopefully be
swayed to adopt the writer's perspective. It is also important to remember that
in the "real world," situations are never static, so a new claim about an event or
issue can help us to rethink an entire field of ideas. This is what we are aiming to
do when we write an academic paper.

Activity 6.2 Selecting an Effective Main Claim

Help these students decide what thesis would be best for an academic
argument essay by deciding which thesis would likely be the most

                                                                     98
effective. Remember that a thesis should be specific, debatable, able to
be backed by reasons and evidence, and promote further discussion.
Then, pick a second-choice thesis and describe how you would revise it
to be more effective.
Tina has the following topic: hip-hop culture

          A. Four key elements make up hip-hop culture: DJing, rapping,
              breakdancing, and graffiti.

          B. Rap music reveals the deep underpinnings of American society.
          C. Rap and elements of hip-hop culture should be incorporated into

              elementary school music education.
          D. Despite some weaknesses in earlier works, Kanye West is the greatest

              rapper of all time.
          E. Rap may just be the one genre of music that will eventually outlast all

              others.
Greg has the following topic: cats

          A. People shouldn't let cats go "in the wild" because they will end up
              becoming strays, capable of spreading disease and breeding
              uncontrollably.

          B. The Burmese Gray is by far the most docile of cat, making the best pet
              of all house cats.

          C. Cats have psychic powers.
          D. In order to discourage cat hoarding, a growing form of animal abuse,

              cat owners in Pennsylvania should be required to obtain a pet license.
          E. Sometimes referred to as "Hemingway cats" due to the author's

              affection for them, cats with polydactylism have a harmless genetic
              variation that results in more than the usual number of toes.

                                                                     99
Body Paragraphs (Support)

Body paragraphs in academic essays prove or support your claim. They might be
thought of as your lines of argument. They substantiate your paper's main claim
and lend authority to the case you are building. Here, writers invent arguments
that support the paper's larger point: What might a reasonable reader find
convincing? What facts and observations will readers respond to most positively?
What might readers find logical and intuitive? What experiences will appeal to an
audience's emotions? What case studies or statistics would convince readers that
you are credible and trustworthy? Body paragraphs will usually rely on a blend of
strong reasons, empirical evidence, relevant historical examples, support from
knowledgeable and credible sources (if a researched essay), and relevant
anecdotal evidence to support the paper's main claim.

Ways To Order Supporting Information in Body
Paragraphs

When you are outlining an academic essay, it is important to consider carefully
the order in which information is presented. The "body" paragraphs form the
central section or "flesh" of an academic essay because it is where you support
your main ideas. Therefore, the "body" tends to be the longest and most
developed section of a paper. Always driving your essay's momentum should be
questions like the following: What influence do you think the information
presented will have on readers? How will it affect their thinking? Their feelings?
Since the goal of all writing is to have the audience better understand the writer's
message and purpose, considerations of audience, like this, can help writers
decide the optimal order of ideas.

While there is no single "correct" way to organize the presentation of evidence in
an academic essay, there are a few common methods to consider. In the section
below, I provide two structures that may aid you in organizing your essay's body
paragraphs.

Order of Importance: Emphatic Order

In this organizational pattern, ideas are arranged in one of two ways: most to
least important, or least to most important.

In persuasive essays, ordering ideas from most to least important is often the
preferred organizational pattern because it emphasizes the strongest, most
convincing supporting information first. Think about when you enter a debate
with family or friends: typically, when trying to make a point, you present your

                                                                    100
best ideas first. Trial lawyers deploy the same approach, focusing the jury's
attention on the most significant and indisputable evidence when making their
case. It's the "lead with your best stuff" mentality.

Conversely, for rhetorical effect, a writer might choose to reverse this order,
presenting the most important point last. The justification for this approach is
that the essay builds in intensity to a climactic moment and leaves the most
important ideas fresh in the mind of the reader toward the essay's end.

   When you are pre-writing to generate material for an essay, it is a good idea
   to create a visual chart or outline that ranks ideas according to their
   significance. That way, you can play out the progression of ideas in your
   mind and even begin to think about how to transition from one argument to
   the next, what arguments might be connected, and where further
   elaboration may be necessary.

Order According to Evidence: Kinds of Support

Understanding the different types of evidence you can use will help you organize
your ideas effectively. Knowing the difference between kinds of evidence can help
you decide what is most relevant (and most persuasive) to an audience based
upon their likely values, interests, and beliefs. Outlining the types of evidence at
your disposal is good practice that can help determine the order of your body
paragraphs.

Evidence could be broken down into categories. For example, there is empirical
data, like facts or statistics; there is textual evidence (common in literary
analysis papers); there are opinions from experts; there are case studies
(common in scientific papers); there are historical or recent events covered by
newspapers; there are series of examples; and there are personal stories,
observations, and anecdotes. Each kind of evidence serves a purpose in
supporting the essay's larger point. Indeed, one organizational tactic writers
employ is to arrange an essay according to evidence that supports the writer's
main claims and to follow that with conflicting evidence that complicates those
claims. Another approach might be to differentiate between logical appeals,
ethical appeals, and emotional appeals, and arrange paragraphs in accordance
with those persuasive approaches.

Not all evidence is equally important or relevant, so when you are outlining
ideas, it is important to be selective. Writers want their evidence to support their

                                                                    101
claims directly, and organizing evidence visually (in an outline form of visual
cluster) can help a writer determine if some of the evidence is off-topic or
extraneous. Personally, I like to consider the progression from the most obvious
to the least obvious issues, as readers will often expect an argument to flow in
this way. In addition, I try to premise groupings along the way so that the logical
structure is clear. I often find that it helps to consider multiple factors
simultaneously. In other words, I do not always know the best way to organize
supporting information until I have experimented with different orders of
evidentiary support.

Counterarguments/Refutation or Alternative Views

A well-written argument not only substantiates the writer's claims; it also
anticipates criticisms and carefully considers reasonable counterarguments,
bringing up alternative views and presenting them fairly. Here, when addressing
possible contentions to your views, you should make concessions when
appropriate if another person's view is reasonable. At the same time, writers
should also note "holes" in a critic's reasoning or demonstrate the limitations or
disadvantages of these views, including how these views may only be applicable
within certain contexts. By taking the potential criticisms of your essay's
argumentation seriously, you can explain why your claims are preferable while
simultaneously showing that you are fair-minded and conscientious of differing
opinions. This is an effective tactic to elevate your ethos.

A great way to brainstorm possible arguments that can be made against your
views is to play the "Believing and Doubting Game," a technique created by
writing theorist Peter Elbow. In this exercise, you try to believe everything that
you have written, coming up with as much additional evidence or as many
supporting ideas as you can to expand upon your views. You then, conversely, try
to doubt every idea that you have presented. You play the role of an adversary,
or "devil's advocate," whose job is to poke holes in your own ideas, to come up
with every reason why you are wrong. It's fun to play this game with a partner.

Activity 6.3: Playing the Believing/Doubting Game

Try this out: think of a debate that you've recently heard or taken part
in, maybe on topics like the banning of plastic straws, the passing of
student debt relief legislation, or the realignment of conferences in
college sports. Pick a side and write down all the ideas you have in
support of that viewpoint. Be exhaustive! Then, switch your stance to
doubt. Challenge all the beliefs and ideas that you just presented by
raising questions, identifying possible counterarguments, and

                                                                    102
expressing skepticism. Keep doing this until you feel you have identified
the strongest arguments for both perspectives.

Conclusion

The conclusion is your chance to leave a strong and memorable impression on
the reader. Here, writers typically summarize a paper's main points in a couple
sentences. But that is not quite enough. Indeed, many rhetoricians believe that a
conclusion should be the most passionate, stylistically beautiful part of a paper.
In this important paragraph, you can draw inferences from what you have
already said. You can make recommendations about how to address the problem
or issue. You can present the limitations of what you have proposed and put forth
a call for more work or research to be done. You can speculate on the future--
where you believe the issue is headed--and the implications of adopting (or not
adopting) your views. You can reinforce what is at stake for those to whom this
issue especially matters. You can even tell readers what you want them to do
next now that they are more informed on the issue. In effect, the conclusion
should open outward and encourage the reader to keep thinking about the ideas
presented and inviting them to move the conversation forward.

Activity 6.4: Writing Your Conclusion as a Letter

As practice for writing your essay's conclusion, write a short letter or
email to a real or imagined person whom you would want your argument
to convince. Advise that person on a new course of action they should
take. After you are done, consider if you might want retool this letter as
part of your conclusion.

Activity 6.5: Revisiting the Hook

Take a look at the opening "hook" or introductory element you employed
at the beginning of your essay. Write down as many ways as you can
think of to revisit or reframe that introductory element in your
conclusion. What imagery or phrases can you strategically bring back to
your audience's mind? What is the main point you want your readers to
remember about your starting point now that they have the context of
the entire essay?

Each of these six components has a home in academic writing, so basic
familiarity with them will, at the very least, provide you with the building blocks
of a persuasive academic essay. As we can see, these components can move in
lockstep, arousing curiosity in the reader, establishing the topic and larger stakes
of the discussion, presenting arguable claims and substantiating them,

                                                                    103
addressing potential counterclaims, and finally motivating the reader to some
intellectual response or action.

One great strength of defining these components is that it forces you to think in
terms of logical structure. For example, having these core components, which
derive from Classical rhetoric, in mind is especially useful when outlining ideas in
the early stages of the drafting process. If you take the time to generate ideas
for each component, you can be sure that, at a minimum, the basic expectations
of the academic audience are being addressed. That being said, there are other
organizational schemas that writers can use when writing persuasively--and,
luckily, many use some arrangement or variation of the "core" essay components
already discussed in this section.

One Alternative Organizing Principle: the Rogerian Structure

Based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers, a "Rogerian" structure uses
strategies deployed in conflict resolution to persuade audiences toward adopting
a reasonable solution. (Keep in mind that academic writers contribute to the
advancement of knowledge in their fields by using reason, thoughtfulness,
attention to detail, and caring for their audience's well-being.) Whereas the
schema described in the previous section supposes that the author's position
takes priority, and that the writer's primary aim is to refute or disarm opposition,
the Rogerian organizational structure aims to find compromise and mutual
understanding among multiple parties from the outset.

The Rogerian structure can be broken down into the following basic components:

          · Introduction: Establishes the occasion for writing by describing the issue
            or problem that the essay will address.

          · Presentation of Alternative Views: Provides multiple points of view about
            the specific topic in a fair-minded way.

          · Demonstration of Your Position on the Topic: States the writer's specific
            claim in relation to the conflicting views that have already been
            established.

          · Finding of Common Ground: Support the claims through non-adversarial
            argumentation, with a particular aim to find common ground instead of
            using confrontational means. On what can you and other interlocutors
            agree? Where are there shared concerns? Supply reasons that all
            interested parties will find acceptable.

                                                                    104
          · Conclusion: Expresses how the writer's stance offers a fair resolution to
            the issue.

As we can see, a Rogerian structure relies on some of the same "core"
components of argumentative academic writing: an introduction and conclusion,
making a clearly defined claim, and representing counterarguments or alternative
views fairly. Where a Rogerian structure differs from structures derived from
Classical rhetoric is that, here, the writer does not "prove" a position but,
instead, builds an argument through cooperation, aiming to find a resolution with
which reasonable audiences would agree. We might say that the Rogerian
structure assumes that finding a compromise and reaching an agreement that
satisfies all parties, or at least leaves them content, is the ideal approach.

The Rogerian structure educates readers on the issue early on by presenting a
collage of competing ways of understanding the topic, inviting readers to
recognize the validity of many potential solutions or arguments, not just one,
before settling into the writer's claim. Because it is non-adversarial and
audience-centered, the Rogerian approach is likely most effective when the topic
is polarizing or controversial--hot-button social issues like abortion rights, gun
legislation, and a centralized National healthcare, for example. Since writers wish
to connect with audiences and relate to them, it makes sense, then, that
presenting a range of ideas on a topic - and doing so generously - can garner
goodwill between writers and readers. Beginning in neutral territory also elevates
the writer's authorial ethos, making the writer appear more like a collaborator in
the pursuit of knowledge.

Of course, there are other possible structures and sub-genres that academic
writers use to convey their ideas. The organizing principles presented in this
chapter are simply two that work particularly well in academic, persuasive
writing. In addition, just having these structures in mind might help you think
beyond the "five-paragraph essay," which tends to be limiting and can
unintentionally lead to stale, unimaginative prose. While the "five-paragraph
essay" is an invented "school" genre often viewed as a kind of "training wheels"
or rudimentary gradable exercise for novice writers, the Classical rhetoric schema
and Rogerian formats extend beyond the walls of the classroom into various
arenas of "real world" communication--including academic journal articles,
speeches, political manifestoes, and policy proposals. One of the benefits of using
one of these essay arrangements is their flexibility, as each "core" component
can be expanded, customized, or adjusted to suit the writer's topic, audience,
and purpose, making them versatile choices in academic writing. Moreover, these
formats enable you to construct more complex arguments better suited to the

                                                                    105
expectations of university assignments, professional communications, and civic
participation.

Methods To Check an Essay's Arrangement

Most successful writers will admit that you often do not know what you wish to
say until after you have already said it. The expressions "writing to learn" or
"writing as discovery" attempt to articulate this intuition. In fact, veteran writers
know that generating ideas, planning out an essay, and even writing a first draft
represent early stages in a much longer writing process. The first draft, in other
words, is merely the writer's initial attempt at making a point. Before you can
determine a draft's success, you must first see if your ideas withstand your own
scrutiny, make logical sense, and develop and flow in an organized, intuitive
fashion. Only then can you move forward and revise the essay with purpose.

Successful writers do a lot of writing outside of their essays, too. In fact, writers
often manufacture an abundance of material without any intention of ever
showing it to their readers. This occurs early on in a draft, in the "idea
generation" stage, through techniques like brainstorming, clustering, outlining,
free-writing, essay mapping, and other kinds of informal writing. But it routinely
occurs during the revision process as well. And because of this, writers often
discover that they must cut sections, rewrite ideas, and reorganize their essay to
produce a stronger final product. Outlined in the sections below are forms of
analytical "process writing" that can help determine if an academic essay's
organization is working after an initial first draft has been written.

Drafting a "Reverse Outline"

Composition instructors often tell students to outline their ideas before they draft
a paper. This is sound advice, and it can help writers to stay focused on a topic
without too much wandering from point to point or inadvertently introducing
extraneous material. Seasoned writers know, however, that outlining can take
place at any stage of the drafting process. Indeed, one way to check an essay's
organization is to draft a "Reverse Outline," an outline created by the writer after
they have written an entire first draft of the essay.

Drafting a "Reverse Outline" is a pretty straightforward process. The writer reads
the essay draft, paragraph by paragraph, and (on a separate document or sheet
of paper) outlines what they have written. This outline states the main idea of
each paragraph succinctly and highlights the paragraph's key points. By drafting
this "skeleton" of the paper, and by keying in on what you have composed, you

                                                                    106
can often recognize jumps in logic, unconnected points between paragraphs,
sections that may need bridging or transitional material, and, even, areas to
develop within single paragraphs.

Once the "Reverse Outline" is written, writers often use this document as the
basis for revision. They make notes to themselves about what to add or remove.
They also sometimes recognize that the essay might need to be rearranged, as
paragraphs or entire sections appear to make more sense in a different order. In
other words, you can use the "Reverse Outline" as another opportunity for
generating and refining ideas, as well as checking to ensure that the ideas are
presented in the best possible order.

Reverse Outline Example

                 Paragraph 1: I begin my essay with a personal anecdote
                 about my experience with arts education as a student. I
                 highlight the disconnect between arts and "core" subjects.
                 This sets up the importance of integrating arts education
                 in a well-rounded curriculum.

                 Paragraph 2: I invoke the conversation about arts education
                 by introducing perspectives from parents, school guidance
                 counselors, and teachers. I discuss the ways in which these
                 groups sometimes characterize the "arts" as a peripheral
                 pursuit or hobby and the negative affect this perception
                 can have.

                 Paragraph 3: I state my claim clearly. I argue cutting
                 funding to the arts in public schools is a mistake. I
                 advocate instead for the integrating of arts into all
                 classes, which emphasizes experiential learning and fosters
                 creativity.

                 Paragraph 4: I argue that the arts are linked to higher
                 cognitive development. I employ a logos appeal by citing
                 two scientific studies that highlight how music studies can
                 enhance mathematical abilities.

                 Paragraph 5: I refer to scholar and professor bell hooks'
                 views on critical thinking and creativity, and how these
                 two intellectual pursuits are related. I connect hooks'
                 ideas to personal experiences, such as a piano class
                 incorporating algebra. This functions as both a logos and
                 pathos appeal.

                 Paragraph 6: I provide an example from eleventh grade as an
                 interdisciplinary case study, a time when I was asked to
                 compose a piece of music that mimicked a physics principle.

                                                                    107
                 Here, I emphasize the intermingling of arts and learning,
                 highlighting the excitement I had for the project and the
                 personal growth that followed.

                 Paragraph 7: I discuss some of my education classes in
                 college, and how my instructor included creative components
                 in projects. I use the example of creating a board game to
                 teach logical fallacies.

                 Paragraph 8: I address the counterargument that there is a
                 limited budget for arts programs in most school districts.
                 In response, I argue that creativity does not require
                 significant funding. I showcase here how teachers often
                 must "be creative" to thrive despite limited resources.

                 Paragraph 9: I conclude by engaging readers. I prompt them
                 to recall their own vivid school memories. I encourage them
                 to reflect on the role of the arts played in shaping their
                 most memorable educational experiences.

Drafting a "Thought" or "Feeling Map"

Some composition instructors suggest that one way to check the organization of
an essay is to see it through the perspective of the audience. One analogy is to
think about your essay as if it were a movie, and your job as the director is to
make sure that the images brought to the minds of viewers make sense, that
they can follow the plot. By looking at your essay through the lens of readers,
you can imagine how they might respond at any given moment. A "Thought" or
"Feeling Map" invites writers to specify what they believe their readers are likely
thinking or feeling as the text unfolds.

Like the "Reverse Outline," a "Thought" or "Feeling Map" is written as a separate
document. The writer reads their essay draft and, working paragraph by
paragraph, writes down the main point of each paragraph, followed by what they
anticipate the reader's emotional reaction will be. Is the introduction meant to be
satirical? Do you expect the reader to laugh or groan at that opening pun? When
readers encounter the main claim of the essay, will they be incredulous or
resistant to it? Is the anecdote presented at the bottom of page six about the
time you lost a beloved family pet supposed to garner sympathy and
identification? What do you imagine your readers will think about your
conclusion's call to action?

Writing a "Thought" or "Feeling Map," which forces the writer to envision how
their audiences are responding, can be an extremely effective way of deciding if
the ideas presented will connect with an audience. It can also help writers to

                                                                    108
determine shifts in tone. This technique can inspire writers to think about their
writing as more than merely words on a page. If a writer cannot chart anticipated
reactions, that writer might not know how a reader will respond to the
information, and they will probably have to go back and refine their ideas until
they do.

Sample Thought/Feelings Map

                 Paragraph 1: I begin my essay by introducing the phrase:
                 "beauty is pain." I suspect that my audience will be
                 familiar with it since it is fairly common. I then delve
                 into society's expectations of beauty, particularly for
                 women, highlighting how certain media outlets like film,
                 television, advertisements, and social media normalize
                 specific characteristics of feminine appearance. I think my
                 readers will agree with the notion that our perception of
                 beauty is largely shaped by society.

                 Paragraph 2: I want to establish a personal connection with
                 readers, so I share my motivation for exploring the topic.
                 I reflect on Natasha Trethewey's poem "Hot Combs," which I
                 encountered during a high school English class. The poem
                 has many sensory details about pain the poet's mother
                 endures while straightening her hair each morning. I
                 explain how this got me to think about societal
                 expectations of beauty, and how these can be ingrained in
                 the minds of women from an early age. I think my audience
                 will feel empathy for the characters in the poem, as well
                 as towards me. I think they will want to hear more about
                 the relationship between physical attractiveness and the
                 sacrifices often involved.

                 Paragraph 3: I describe common things that women do to
                 achieve beauty, such as skin care routines, makeup
                 application, dieting, fitness regimens, uncomfortable
                 footwear, and cosmetic procedures. I think that providing
                 this long list of beauty practices will help readers to
                 visualize the amount of time and effort it takes for some
                 people to feel as though they look "presentable." I think
                 my readers will begin to question their own efforts. They
                 might feel angry about this, or they might feel as though
                 these efforts are completely acceptable. I know I will have
                 to appeal to both mindsets.

Dismantling the Essay Into Paragraph Units

Another tactic writers often use is to physically test new patterns of organization.
To do this, writers print out a copy of their essay and then literally cut it up into
paragraphs. The writer lays these individual paragraph units in front of them and

                                                                    109
begins to shift them around to see if the paragraphs make sense in a different
order. When writers allow themselves to imagine the essay in different forms,
such as separate sections or units, they can more easily visualize the structure
and identify what works and what doesn't. For example, if a writer can rearrange
the paragraphs into any order and the essay still makes sense, perhaps the
writer has not adequately thought about the progression of ideas and the order
that would be most effective. Breaking down the essay into units can also help
writers to see where topic sentences can be strengthened and where transitional
phrases may need to be added.

Writing an Abstract or Summary

Another method to check an essay's arrangement is write a brief abstract, which
is a one-to-two paragraph summary that captures the contents of the draft. To
do this, writers attempt to state the paper's main claim in a single opening
sentence. Afterwards, they summarize the most important items of support:
facts, observations, and logical arguments. Writers might also use the abstract to
comment on their methodology, or how they reached their conclusions. Finally,
writers attempt to convey how their ideas are changing the conversation about
the issue at hand--and what readers might stand to discover or gain from
reading the entire essay.

If you can successfully write an abstract for your academic paper that addresses
the aspects mentioned above in a way that makes sense to someone unfamiliar
with the longer work, it can boost your confidence in the effectiveness of your
paper's organization. If you find it challenging to clearly express your position on
the topic or provide the necessary information, reasoning, arguments, or
supporting evidence that led you to your conclusions, it indicates the need for
revisions to include that information. Likewise, if you attempt to write an abstract
and realize that a crucial supporting point does not occur until the end of the
paper, it can prompt you to rearrange the components of your text, ensuring that
your paper makes more sense and presents a more compelling argument. While
these techniques may appear to require additional effort, they can actually save
time and help you craft a draft that is more cohesive, comprehensive, and well-
organized.

Final Activity 6.6: Abstract Freewrite

Imagine that the paper you've written is an exciting mystery novel or a
piece of young adult fiction and your job is to draft a one-paragraph
book blurb designed to attract new readers. What would you tell them?
Try to capture the essence of your main claim, key pieces of supporting

                                                                    110
evidence, and your conclusions, leaving the reader desperate to read the
entire paper cover-to-cover. This exercise will challenge you to
summarize your ideas in fresh language while thinking about what your
audience will respond to. Be creative as you sell your ideas!

Conclusion

This chapter offered a few ways to think about organization. It provided basic
components commonly found in an academic essay, which include an
introduction, contextual information, the main claim, body paragraphs that prove
or support the paper's thesis, consideration of counterarguments, and a
conclusion. The chapter also provided possible organizing principles to consider
when you are planning out an academic essay. And finally, it discussed ways to
check if a paper's organization is working through some exploratory, self-
reflective writing and outlining techniques.

Writers often use their intuition, basing their organizational structures on
hunches of what will work most effectively. In many cases, a writer can sense, as
they are writing, when something seems out of place or if more information is
necessary for the reader to understand the larger message of the text. But a
writer's intuition is not always right. That is why successful writers revise their
work. It is also why writers spend time writing analytically during their process.
This approach helps writers to be open to new insights about organization and
possibly uncover elements they may have missed or overlooked early on. If
nothing else, I hope this chapter provided you with some useful tools to adopt as
you organize your next essay project.

[1] I am indebted to Dr. Pradyumna Chauhan, Professor Emeritus at Arcadia
University, whose graduate course on the History and Teaching of Rhetoric
greatly influenced my thinking on the basic components that comprise an
academic argument. Ideas presented in this section are adapted from my old
course notebooks, which I have returned to, again and again, throughout my
teaching career.

                                                                    111
Chapter 7: Grammar & Mechanics

There are so many guidebooks, style guides, textbooks, dictionaries, websites,
and more that claim to be "authorities" on the grammar of the English language.
However, there is actually no book that is the authority on grammar.

Grammar is the mechanism by which language is conveyed-it covers all the
patterns of our language that determine word order in sentences, pronunciation,
the formation of words, the development of definitions and associated meanings,
and even the practical situations that can shape our language use. Grammar is
not the formal rules dictating punctuation marks and spelling, though it does
include these as well.

Even if a book-or website or machine or individual-could hold all that
information, it would still not be the authority on language. Why? Because
language only exists when it is used between people. And people change the
rules of grammar all the time-even mid-sentence-to fit their purposes.

                 Consider this: Your friend shows you a weird object that you've never
                 seen before, but they say that it is a combination megaphone and
                 coffee mug. You want to inspect it, so you tell them, "Hey, hand me
                 that mugaphone."

                 Consider this: You check your text messages and find one from a
                 friend that says, "bagelssss??" You interpret this text as your friend
                 excitedly asking if you will still be meeting with her at your local bagel
                 place.

                 Consider this: A bilingual child is speaking to their parents who speak
                 Spanish as a first language. When working on a project, the child
                 realizes they will need scissors but knows the father wouldn't know
                 the word in English so asks, "Where are the tijeras?"

Each of these examples breaks the prescriptive "rules" you would find in most
authoritative style guides and dictionaries. However, consider if each of these
examples were altered so that they did follow the prescriptive rules of English
grammar that you might have learned in grade school. Would the resulting
language use be more or less effective?

                                                                    112
So, should there be NO rules for grammar?

                                                Does anything go?

                                               does go-any thing?

                                          Any?thing d!o GO, yA.h5,,

Obviously not. There are rules of grammar in play in even the most casual of text
messages, slam poetry, rap, jargon-filled business letters, and any other
successful form of communication. Returning to the examples you engaged with
above, each does, in fact, follow the subtle and much more foundational rules of
the English language in how each utterance is constructed, down to the emphasis
conveyed by the number of question marks in the "bagelssss??" text, and the
way you can mash-up "megaphone" and "coffee mug" into "mugaphone" but not
(in this case anyway) "phoneamug."

Activity 7.1: Create a Word

What word should be recognized in dictionaries but is not yet? Make a
sample dictionary entry for a made-up word that contains information on
the part of speech, sample definition, and a few sample sentences.
Consider, too, what role the word would play in promoting the ethics and
values of your culture or others.

The best judge of linguistic effectiveness is not a static set of prescribed rules
that apply in every situation but instead the guidance provided by the rhetorical
situation:

          · Does the audience understand and respect the author's use of
            language?

          · Does the author use language to fulfill their purpose?

          · Does the genre permit or encourage a certain form of language use?

As addressed in a previous chapter, The Shape of Rhetoric, our use of
language can particularly affect our ethos (credibility), making it so that we can
appear either as authoritative or completely uninformed.

Activity 7.2: Identifying Grammatical Dogma

Many of us have been taught at one time or another to "always" or
"never" do something in our writing that didn't seem to make sense, or
that we see other writers getting away with. For instance, maybe you

                                                                    113
were taught to never use first-person "I" in your writing, but then
wonder how you are supposed to write a personal narrative without it.
Or maybe you were taught never to end a sentence with a preposition
but find many examples where it would be more awkward to avoid doing
so. Make a list of the "grammatical dogma" you've been taught and
share it with your peers or the class to discuss if your experiences were
the same and discover your professor's real expectations for your
writing.

The following three sections address how to make smart decisions about what
grammar rules-or we might say, what styles-to apply in different rhetorical
situations. Each exercise is about giving you, as a writer, more options in your
writing and multiple choices in solving potential problems. Most of their lessons
are a step above learning the very basics of sentence structure, agreement, word
definitions, and punctuation. If you need a refresher on these, you should indeed
refer to dictionaries, guides, exercises, and more to gather sufficient knowledge
in the meanings and uses of language. There's nothing wrong with using such
guides if we treat them as just that-guides rather than authorities-because,
when it comes to writing, the author(ity) should be you.

Active Vs. Passive Voice

Active and passive voice are sentence constructions that writers use to place
emphasis on either the thing/person doing an action or the target of that action.
Both passive and active voice are grammatically "correct" but should be used in
different rhetorical situations.

In active voice, the grammatical subject of the sentence (bolded) is also the
one that does the action.

Sam caught the ball.

(Sam=subject) (caught the ball=predicate).

For more on subject/predicate structure, I recommend the examples and
diagrams on Wikipedia (subject), and (predicate).

Here are a few more examples of active voice with the subject is bolded:

The baker is making a big cake.

I drank a glass of water.

The gristmill churned grain into flour.

                                                                    114
The makeshift umbrella kept the rain off our heads.

The lab assistant adds two milliliters of solution.

In contrast, in passive voice the grammatical subject of the sentence is the
receiver of the action. The following examples bold the grammatical subject, so
you can see how the subject shifted position in the sentence.

The ball was caught by Sam.

(The ball=subject) (was caught by Sam=predicate)

A big cake is being made by the baker.

A glass of water was drunk by me.

The grain was churned into flour by the gristmill.

The rain was kept off our heads by the makeshift umbrella.

Two milliliters of solution is added by the lab assistant.

Do some of the above examples seem awkward to you? Wordy? Clunky? Evasive?
Even snobby? Most rhetorical situations call for the use of active rather than
passive voice, particularly those that value brevity and clarity regarding who or
what is the active party in the situation. Business writing, storytelling, and most
academic writing in the humanities typically favor active voice. In these
situations, active voice often reads as more direct and elegant.

However, passive voice can be a legitimate and useful choice in rhetorical
situations where the doer of the action is not as important as the action being
performed. This is particularly true in genres of writing such as lab reports,
where passive voice is often used to focus on the research, not the researcher.

Passive Voice: The solution was heated to the boiling point, and then it was
reduced in volume by 50 percent.

Active Voice: I heated the solution to the boiling point, and then the lab assistant
Billy reduced it in volume by 50 percent.

Because it's in the subject position, the first example in passive voice places
focus on the solution that's being heated up and we don't give much thought to

                                                                    115
who is doing the heating. In fact, this person is absent from the sentence
altogether. This is possible because passive voice shifts the doer of the action to
a prepositional phrase, so it can be taken out altogether. The second example of
active voice using "I" and "lab assistant Billy" places our focus on the
researchers. In other words, using active voice might be a distraction from the
purpose of the writing.

Passive voice is also often used in textbooks and instructional material where the
writer might be trying to spotlight the topic material. For instance, did you notice
it in the preceding sentence?

To figure out if a sentence is in active or passive voice ask yourself the question
"Who/What is doing the action(verb)?" If the answer to this question is in the
subject of the sentence (usually before the main verb), then it's in active voice.

If the answer is in the predicate or if it's not in the sentence at all, it's in passive
voice.

Here's a demonstration of this thought process:

                 Example Sentence: The kitten ate all the food in the bowl.

                 Who/what ate all the food in the bowl?

                 Answer: The kitten. So, "The kitten" is the subject of the
                 sentence. The sentence is in active voice!

                 How about now: All the food in the bowl has been eaten.

                 Who/what ate all the food in the bowl?

                 Answer: ? The sentence is in passive voice.

Activity 7.3: Identify Whether the Following Sentences Are in Active or
Passive Voice.

          1. Mary had a rough day today.
          2. A terrible secret was revealed to me in a dream.
          3. Nobody likes an unmade bed.
          4. He was swept away by the river's wrath.

Though some science writing favors passive voice and writing within the
humanities often favors active voice, there are many cases where you, the
author, will need to decide for yourself what voice to use to best match your own
rhetorical purpose. For example:

                                                                    116
                 Passive voice: As harvest time approaches, the tobacco
                 plants are sprayed with a chemical to stop the flowering
                 process.

                 Active voice: As harvest time approaches, farm laborers in
                 North Carolina spray tobacco plants with a chemical to stop
                 the flowering process.

Using passive and active voice is a choice on what is most important to your
story. In the first example, it's clear that the tobacco plants and the spraying
process is the focus of the story, so much so that passive voice allows the people
doing the spraying to be taken out of the story entirely. You might find a
sentence like this in an encyclopedia entry on the harvest cycle of these plants,
or even in an article about how such spraying is done. The next sentences might
detail the chemical composition of such sprays or what happens to the plants
next.

The second example in active voice has an entirely different focus because it
contains information on who is doing the spraying. We might wonder about the
condition of this labor and whether these workers are sufficiently protected or
compensated. This sentence might appear in an opinion article on farm labor
rather than an article just on plant harvest cycles.

Both passages can be examples of good writing but would appear in very
different contexts. In a nutshell, good writers should be able to use a tool like
shifting between active and passive voice depending on the rhetorical situation.

Let's try it! The following passage is a story, but it's written in an ineffective
manner using passive voice. Rewrite the passage to change all instances of
passive voice to active voice while not otherwise changing the story (not all
clauses use passive voice).

                 The following scenario should be considered. It was a sunny
                 afternoon on campus, and Jenny was walking to her next
                 class. The sight of her lab partner, Samir, appeared to
                 Jenny out of the corner of her eye as his car was parked by
                 him. How tall, muscular, and stylishly dressed was admired
                 by Jenny. Jenny's eyes did not leave him as he ran to his
                 circle of friends on the green. A pearly white smile was
                 flashed to her as he passed by.

The following lab report passage uses active voice in an ineffective manner. Shift
the style of most sentences to passive voice or otherwise deemphasize the
researcher in your revision.

                                                                    117
I wanted to test the amount of ascorbic acid in spinach
plants, so I first started by testing 20 healthy plants for
iron content. I knew that iron would affect the absorption
of ascorbic acid because it has a role in ascorbic acid
absorption in mammals. To get a testable mixture, I ground
up the plant leaves using a blender. Using iodine in a
burette, I slowly dropped the iodine into the spinach blend
until I saw the mixture turn blue. The blue indicated the
presence of ascorbic acid, and I recorded my results.

Revising Wordiness

                                         Professor Dodson (he/him) has worked at
                                         Kutztown since 2010 teaching composition,
                                         grammar, and creative writing.

One sure way to see marked improvement in your writing is by tightening
wordy sentences. Many textbooks will provide a list of explicit examples and
strategies to follow. Here is a sampling of guidelines you may have seen
before:
· Avoid weak and colorless BE verbs (am, is, are, was, were) as your main

   verbs.
             Wordy: Prof. Dodson is a writer of bad short stories.
             Improved: Prof. Dodson writes bad short stories.

· Also, avoid BE verbs in empty expletive constructions (beginning a
   sentence with It is or There are), which delay the subject or idea of your
   sentence as well as in indirect passive constructions, which tangle the idea
   in the reader's mind.
             Wordy: There are many ways for good writers to tighten
             loose sentences.
             Improved: Good writers know many ways to tighten loose
             sentences.
             Wordy: This sentence was written in the passive voice by
             Prof. Dodson.
             Improved: Prof. Dodson wrote this sentence in the active
             voice.

                                                                119
· Compress clauses to phrases and phrases to words.

For example, relative clauses are easily reduced to participial phrases (note
again the BE verb):

             Wordy: Sentences that are written by Prof. Dodson contain
             too many BE verbs.

             Improved: Sentences written by Prof. Dodson contain too
             many BE verbs.

· Look for redundancies and inflated phrases such as "because of the fact
   that." Instead, just write "because."

             Wordy: I still write wordy sentences in spite of the fact
             that I know better.

             Improved: I still write wordy sentences even though I
             know better.

You don't need comprehensive knowledge of English grammar to tighten
wordy sentences. Instead, when you want to revise a loose sentence, focus
on the content words -- the nouns and verbs, the descriptive adjectives and
adverbs. These are the words that make meaning and images in your
reader's mind, so try to eliminate as many "function" words as possible
between them.

Here is an example taken from the excellent writing resource, the Purdue
Owl:

             In the not too distant future, college freshmen must all
             become aware of the fact that there is a need for them to
             make contact with an academic adviser concerning the
             matter of a major.

This is a grammatically correct, yet very wordy sentence. Let's try to convey
the idea of this sentence more directly and concisely. Underline the content
words that hold meaning. Start with the important nouns. What is this
sentence about? I have bolded the following: the future, college
freshmen, academic adviser, and major. What is the central action that
connects the freshmen and advisors? Contact. Start the sentence over,
linking those phrases with as few words between them as possible. Perhaps:

                                                                120
                 In the near future, college freshmen should contact their
                 academic advisors regarding a major.

   In the near future could be further compressed to soon (as my grammar
   check software suggests) although you might consider that language
   awkward in this context. Given the audience and purpose of the sentence, I
   would use a more specific date and avoid the gendered noun freshmen:

                 Prior to spring break, first-year students should contact
                 their academic advisors regarding a major.

   I leave you now with the hard part: trying this with your own writing.

Activity 7.4: Revising Wordiness in Your Writing

Select one paragraph from your own writing that you think is a bit
wordy. Underline all instances of "to be" verbs (e.g. is, was, were, be,
am, are) and consider whether you might replace this word with an
active verb or compress the clause as demonstrated above. However,
don't try to replace every use of a "to be" verb. Many uses of "to be"
verbs are necessary or helpful to conveying your meaning.

Comma Splices/Fused Sentences

A "comma splice" is a common type of run-on sentence structure that is typically
considered a punctuation error. One reason why comma splices are common
errors is that no such error exists in speech. If you record and accurately
transcribe speech, you'll find that most of us-even in formal situations-often
speak in fragment sentences and run-ons without anyone noticing.

Since print lacks the intonation and pacing (what is sometimes referred to as
prosody) that would convey information about the relationships and emphasis of
ideas in speech, formalized patterns of punctuation partly fill this role in writing.
This is true even of "non-standard" punctuation, such as the use of periods in
text messages to convey seriousness or the use of "all caps" to denote yelling.

Comma splices result from an incomplete attempt to separate ideas into clause
structures according to formal writing standards in English. Consider, for
example, this email:

                                                                    121
                 Dear Professor Leonard,

                 My name is Stew Dent, I am a student in your MWF 9am
                 COMP100 course.

                 I apologize for such late notice, however I am unable to
                 attend your class tomorrow due to a Kutztown University
                 baseball game. Since I am missing class, I will not be able
                 to hand in the homework assignment that will be due. I have
                 the homework with me, I will upload it to D2L today so that
                 it is not late.

                 Thank you so much for your understanding, I will stop in to
                 see you during your office hours when I get back.

                 Thank you,

                 Stew Dent

In many ways the above email is extremely professional and polite, and for my
own composition course syllabus policy, "Stew" seems to be doing everything he
can to fulfill his responsibilities to submit his homework on time and
communicate with me regarding absences. However, Stew's repeated comma
splices throughout the email can make his writing seem jarring and awkward
even though he seems to have taken great care to edit it otherwise.

Comma splices happen when a writer joins two full sentences (also called
"independent clauses") with a comma.

Take, for instance, the first sentence of the email as an example:

                 My name is Stew Dent, I am a student in your MWF 9am
                 COMP100 course.

I put the first clause in the sentence in bold (My name is Stew Dent) and the
second clause (I am a student in your MWF 9am COMP100 course) in italics to
show the two different sentences that are connected here in the one sentence.

There are three basic ways to "fix" comma splices:

          1. Split up the sentences using a period (.).

          2. Use a coordinating conjunction (like "and") after the comma.

          3. Use a semicolon (;).

                                                                    122
Of course, each of these options carry slightly different effects in tone and might
be more or less appropriate for the rhetorical situation. Let's see them in action:

             1. My name is Stew Dent. I am a student in your MWF 9am
                 COMP100 course.

             2. My name is Stew Dent, and I am a student in your MWF 9am
                 COMP100 course.

             3. My name is Stew Dent; I am a student in your MWF 9am
                 COMP100 course.

Which would you choose?

Personally, I would leave the name out of this first line altogether since the name
appears at the end anyway. However, in speaking about revising stylistically, I
would favor either of the first two options. While breaking up the sentences
entirely with periods can seem choppy (particularly so if frequent), professional
writing can often get away with having short sentences more than other genres.
Using too many conjunctions can make writing seem "stringy" or winding, even if
used correctly. However, they also have the advantage of clarifying the
relationship between ideas with the additional information provided by the
coordinating conjunction, e.g., "and" (it's an additional idea), "but" (contrasting
in some way), "so" (causal).

Using a semicolon also conveys a close connection between the ideas in each
clause. While the exact relationship is undefined, it can be clarified when paired
with a conjunctive adverb like "however" or "therefore" at the beginning of the
second independent clause. To take an example from later in the email, the
following sentence could be easily corrected with a semicolon and by placing a
comma after the "however":

                 Original: I apologize for such late notice, however I am
                 unable to attend your class tomorrow due to a Kutztown
                 University baseball game.

                 Revised: I apologize for such late notice; however, I am
                 unable to attend your class tomorrow due to a Kutztown
                 University baseball game.

Use caution, however, when using semicolons as they often have an academic
connotation that doesn't match the genre of business and professional writing.
Even in academic context, using too many can make your writing seem "bogged
down" or even make it difficult to understand.

                                                                    123
Besides these three options, you can also change the structure of the sentence in
different ways adding different sorts of conjunctions (but, because, if, whereas,
so) or rewriting your sentences in an entirely different way.

Activity 7.5: Rewrite an Email.

As an exercise, try to entirely rewrite the "Stew Dent" email above in the
way you would phrase it. Make any changes you wish, but also fix all the
comma splices (hint: there are four).

Using Other Resources and Technologies To Improve
Your Grammar and Mechanics

These were only three lessons in grammar and mechanics, and there are
certainly many, many more facets of style that are important to pay attention to
in your writing. Good writers-even professional writers-don't know everything
and are always improving their craft in small ways. Learning how to write is a
process that takes a lifetime.

To continue this process and get a step beyond correctness and match your style
to the rhetorical situation, you might read one of the classic texts on style,
particularly applicable to academic writing such as Elements of Style by William
Strunk.

Another way to improve your use of grammar and mechanics is in attentive
reading and writing. As Steven King, the author of many famous horror and
fantasy novels including Carrie and IT, puts it, "If you want to be a writer, you
must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There's no way
around these two things that I'm aware of, no shortcut." As an addendum to this
advice, I would add that you should read examples from the same genre you are
attempting to write within. That way, you will pick up on the subtle expectations
that are too numerous, too changeable, and too nuanced for any textbook to
capture.

Finally, in your quest for improvement, doubtlessly, you are already familiar with
Googling the definitions of words and simple grammatical rules, and there are
plenty of online videos that focus on grammatical correctness as well as writing
style. Spellcheck and grammar check programs embedded into your word
processing software, browsers, and subscription services can also alert you to
egregious errors and are increasingly making tailored stylistic suggestions. All
these suggestions should be taken with a "grain of salt," however, since these
programs can make errors too. They are also unlikely to be fully familiar with the

                                                                    124
rhetorical situation, so they may recommend inappropriate style choices. In no
case should a program replace your own judgment as a writer. Again, you are the
author(ity) of your own writing.
Final Activity 7.6: Emulating a Writing Style
Pick out one piece of writing that you admire and closely investigate its
grammar and mechanics. Write down a few notes on the sentence
structure, sentence length, voice, tone, and word choice. Then attempt
to emulate its style as exactly as you can for a few sentences but on a
wholly different topic. While you wouldn't want your whole style to
become just a copy of another author's, doing a brief exercise like this
can open your mind to new possibilities or solidify your own unique
choices.

                                                                    125
Chapter 8: Practicing Better Peer Feedback

                                           Amy Lynch-Biniek, Ph.D. (she/her) is a
                                           professor of Composition in the English Department
                                           at Kutztown University. She researches and writes
                                           about pedagogy and the labor of teaching. When
                                           she's not in the classroom, Dr. Lynch-Biniek plays
                                           tabletop role-Playing games, watercolor paints, and
                                           reads a lot of scifi.

Peer feedback is tough. Sharing our work with others can be anxiety-inducing
and receiving criticism even more so. Yet, research, such as that of Anderson et
al., shows that sharing our work with others, knowing how real readers
understand, misconstrue, or react to our writing, is a reliable tool for improving
our prose. What's more, being asked to revise can sometimes feel like failure--
we put our all into a first draft and feel disappointed, maybe even foolish, when a
professor or classmate points out all of its flaws. In this chapter, I will reframe
peer feedback as a conversation among writers, with a goal of creating space for
play and experimentation. When we take the time to adopt and practice peer
review through this lens, we all might be a little less apprehensive about the
experience.

We have all experienced the useless peer review session. You know the one. You
spent hours writing a draft and are eager to know if any of it makes sense. Is
your argument effective? Did you do that thing you often do, wandering off topic
and exploring tangents? Will readers like the joke you made in the third
paragraph? In class, your peer review partner seems to be reading the draft with
care, taking their time. When it comes back to you, though, the draft has only
one comment: "I liked it, but maybe tell us the color of the hat." Even worse,
they might just write, "Looks good to me!" Your classmate used Track Changes to
copyedit your sentences, fixing some of your commas and correcting your mix-up
of there and their but provided no feedback on the actual content of your draft.
What makes this extra frustrating is that the professor wants you to revise the
content for homework. How are you supposed to do that? What's next?

                                                                    126
On the other hand, in another workshop, a different partner does comment on
your content, but the feedback is dispiriting and overwhelming--your partner
seems to be picking apart every argument, critiquing every word choice. You
may feel too deflated to revise.

Most of us, too, have been on the other side of that review. You've read a
classmate's excellent draft. How, you wonder, are you supposed to tell them what
to fix? You've got to do something, so you copyedit a little, maybe tell them to
add more description. However, this process is just making you feel bad about
your own draft. Is this how you're supposed to be writing? All you can think of is
how wrong your own draft must seem to your partner.

Or, alternatively, you read a classmate's draft, realizing that it needs work. You
try to be honest and helpful, but every comment seems to sound as though it
came from that mean teacher you had in 10th grade. How do you give advice
without sounding like an ogre?

These are very common experiences, ones that can stem, I think, from a
misunderstanding of both peer comments and revision. I'm asking you to adjust
your thinking about these related activities because...

Feedback isn't about pointing out what's wrong, and revising isn't about fixing it.

Writing a first draft isn't about getting as close to perfection as you can in one
shot. Instead, writing in a series of drafts allows you to play, think, experiment,
give yourself permission to be imperfect, and then do all those things some more
as you revise. Writing professor and former journalist Laura Giovanelli puts it this
way: "Revision is not a sign of weakness or inexperienced or poor writing. It is
the writing" (105). Try treating a draft as a practice round that you can play with
some more; then you don't have to apologize to your classmates for its quality or
dread being asked to revise.

How we encourage each other to revise is just as important as how we see our
own drafting. I like to think of peer feedback activities as conversations with
fellow readers and writers. A conversation is an exchange of ideas wherein we
learn from each other. So, your job as a peer reviewer isn't to find errors in
someone's draft but to express how it made you think, feel, react, or wonder. As
a writer, you should aim to read feedback in this spirit: the reader is describing
their own experience, as well as their ideas for what you might do next.

                                                                    127
Specifically, you might construct feedback using one of these four strategies:

          · Productive praise

          · Reader-based critique

          · Forward-looking suggestions

          · Thoughtful questions

Let's look at each of these feedback types a bit more closely. I've included
examples from two of my former students, Kara Galeassi and Jenna Ferguson,
who graciously gave me permission to share the conversations they had via peer
review in my Research and Composition course.

Productive Praise

We often don't think of feedback as purely complimentary, aside from the nice
but unhelpful "I liked it, it was good." Instead, we ask teachers, classmates, and
friends to "tear the paper apart," as if cruelty will help us to improve our prose.
In contrast, some of the most useful feedback we can give and receive is
positive.

I borrow the term productive praise from Ron DePeter, who wrote "How to Write
Meaningful Peer Response Praise" in Writing Spaces: Readings on Writing,
Volume 3. DePeter describes the concept this way: "Meaningful praise ... is
feedback that recognizes something that is working for you as a reader, that
gives you an opportunity to have a dialogue with the author, and that expresses
some sort of appreciation for the work the writer has done, or for the writer
herself" (43). To be productive, DePeter tells us, the praise should be rooted in
something specific about the draft: "Is it the word choice? The arrangement of
sentences? Her use of detail ...? Does it have something to do with the voice or
tone? The way she uses questions? It could be any or all of these things, or
something else altogether" (44-45).

To begin writing productive praise, you might open a comment with any of these
phrases:

                 I really liked how you...

                 This part made me think because...

                 Your use of [insert word or phrase] is really effective
                 because...

                                                                    128
                 I enjoyed...

When I read productive praise of my own writing, I gain two things: a sense of
the good stuff that I should keep and develop (maybe even use in other texts),
and a boost of confidence that keeps me writing. When I give productive praise
to another writer, I am also learning new tools and strategies that I might use in
my own work. For instance, if I notice that the writer's use of an anecdote
worked so well, maybe I'll try using one in my own draft!

In my Research and Composition course, Jenna and Kara were paired up to
provide each other feedback on an assignment that required them to try out a
variety of writing strategies that would help them to connect with a target
audience. The workshops from which all the following examples are taken
focused on the use of these strategies, as well as developing a purpose. Kara
wrote about the challenges of being a commuter student and opened with
several personal examples of her own issues leaving the house on time to make
it to class. In the workshop demonstrated below, Jenna gave Kara some
productive praise, pointing out that these uses of personal examples made her
purpose clearer and helped her audience to relate.

                 Jenna: "This is a solid draft. You explain your purpose
                 well while also working through your own thinking as a
                 commuter. Adding in your personal experiences makes your
                 connection and purpose more impactful."

In her own draft, Jenna was exploring how a classroom's physical environment
affects students. She opened with a story about Lauren, an energetic third
grader, who arrives in a dull, undecorated classroom and begins to feel
disconnected. Kara's productive praise focused on the way that the story engages
her target audience, teachers:

                 Kara: "I really like that you started with this. Is this
                 made up or a real person? Either way, I think it helps the
                 reader dive deeper into the paper because, as a teacher,
                 they would want to read further to understand why Lauren
                 loses her excitement."

These brief but meaningful compliments reassured Kara and Jenna that they
were practicing with the tools we'd been learning about in class. Through using
productive praise with specific points of appreciation, they were able to give each
other a concrete sense of what to keep and develop in their next drafts. Notice,
too, the tone of their feedback: conversational and friendly. Using this strategy
took the angst out of their first feedback activity.

                                                                    129
Activity 8.1: Holding a Productive Praise Session

Read a partner's draft and focus on what they did well and what
interests you in it, but do not write or comment on the draft. Then, have
a conversation with your partner about what works in the draft,
providing meaningful compliments. Make these compliments specific in
why or how they work and go back to the draft if you need to point out
particular passages that are effective or interesting. If you get stuck on
what to say, borrow some of the starter phrases listed above.

Reader-Based Critique

When I offer reader-based critique to my own peers, I describe my reactions as a
reader as opposed to as a teacher or judge. I describe the reactions I have as I
read, which might include the associations I make with the content, experiences
I've had with the topic, moments where I disagree with the writer's claims, and
moments where I felt lost. In these instances, I often literally begin my
comments with "As a reader, I...."

We sometimes think of "critique" as purely negative judgements that can be
intimidating. With practice, however, we can write a productive critique that
opens up our classmates' perspectives instead of shutting them down. For
instance, we can describe personal experiences that could inform the draft or
provide examples that illustrate the writer's ideas. In this way, reader-based
critique is very different from saying that you thought the writing was bad or that
the ideas were wrong.

At the end of Kara's first draft, she described being late to class after getting
stuck in traffic behind a horse and buggy. Then, she began to freewrite, as she
was unsure whether to directly criticize her audience of professors:

                 Kara: "I feel like a majority of professors never really
                 think about your life outside of school. They think you
                 eat, sleep, and poop college. Or something, I don't know.
                 The point is, they need to stop and think about how we are
                 human. We have issues just like they do. I can be
                 understanding, so can they reciprocate? I forget where I
                 was going with this? Never mind."

Jenna's reader-based critique, in which she describes her own experiences, also
acts as productive praise, and she encourages Kara to explore this idea.

                 Jenna: "This is really good! I don't think professors
                 consider themselves to be commuters but if you think about
                 it, they are, so they should understand the struggles. I

                                                                    130
                 think this would be a great jumping off point where you can
                 explain how professors could be more understanding. I can't
                 tell you how many emails I have gotten from professors
                 saying that they were going to be late, like it was no big
                 deal. Why can't they extend the same courtesy to students?"

In her next draft, Kara developed this section, incorporating Jenna's realization
that professors are commuters, too. I think it ended up being one of the best
parts of her project.

Activity 8.2: Writing a Letter to Your Peer

After reading your peer's draft, write them a personal letter. In this
letter, express your own opinion on the topic they are writing about and
what their writing might have sparked in your own mind. Do not
evaluate their writing or even give tips to improve. Instead, use this
letter as an opportunity to share your own thoughts, ideas, and
experiences relevant to their writing. Make sure to sign the letter with
your name at the end and make it personalized.

Forward-Looking Suggestions

Forward-looking suggestions are at the heart of feedback, as they provide us
with concrete ideas for what to do next when we sit down at the keyboard or
with a notebook.

The aim of these comments is not to point out what to fix, but to suggest how
the writer might further think through the writing as they revise. Like productive
praise, forward-looking suggestions are often most effective when they are
grounded in very specific ideas or content the writer might use.

Commenting on another classmate's essay on the daily stressors that college
students experience, Kara offered this forward-looking suggestion:

                 Kara: "To further get the audience's attention (if this is
                 true--I'm just speaking from my own experience), you could
                 mention how students lose sleep and get exhausted, which
                 further affects their mental health."

This advice from Kara is excellent on a few levels. First, it is specific, offering a
new detail that the writer can use when they sit down to revise. Second, she
takes the time to emphasize that this is her opinion; Kara isn't sure if that
experience of exhaustion is widely shared. Rather than letting her classmate
make the mistake of assuming, she's encouraging them to do some research and
find out.

                                                                    131
To get started writing forward-looking suggestions, you might open a comment
with any of these phrases:

                 What if you tried....

                 Have you considered....

                 I'd think about ....

                 How about adding....

                 Consider talking about...

Activity 8.3: Commenting With Forward-Looking Suggestions

First, have a conversation with your peer to see what sorts of suggestions they
are looking for to improve their writing. Then, with your peer's permission, use
the comments feature on Google docs or Word to leave forward-looking
suggestions on their writing. Use the phrases above to begin many of your
comments.

Thoughtful Questions

My favorite type of feedback is the thoughtful question. A question is often most
effective when used in combination with other types of feedback. Questions can
follow up a reader-based critique, such as when a reader first points to a
moment in a text where they were confused and asks for clarification. Questions
can be forward-looking, too, aiming to help the writer consider the possibilities
for exploration and experimentation in the next draft.

In her first draft, Jenna described a challenge teachers face when they do want
to improve the classroom environment:

                 Jenna: "The main concern when it comes to the décor of the
                 classroom is money. The teachers that I have talked to are
                 given an allowance but then the rest of the supplies that
                 they need must be paid out of pocket. One way to fix this
                 is for teachers to ask parents to donate supplies needed
                 for the classroom which will then leave room in their
                 budget for other fun things. The school can also hold
                 fundraisers for the school to raise more money for their
                 teachers."

Kara's feedback uses a question to prompt Jenna to do some forward-looking
thinking, asking her to think about the possibilities for development in the next
draft:

                                                                    132
                 Kara: "Maybe consider how you would respond if a teacher
                 said they never get donations. How can they convince
                 parents to donate?"
I asked the students in my Teaching Writing class why writers might be more
receptive to questions than they are to comments. They posited that questions
suggest their classmate really read, paid attention, and were interested in the
draft. They also liked that questions move writers from passively reading
critiques to actively considering answers.

Final Activity 8.4: Generating Thoughtful Questions in a Small Workshop
Group
Share your draft with a small group of 3-5 students. Students should
read each draft closely and be prepared with some questions they have
about each. Then, hold a discussion about each draft where the goal is to
share these thoughtful questions. As the discussion unfolds, feel free to
employ other techniques of peer review such as making forward-looking
suggestions, reader-based critique, and productive praise. After your
each discussion, give the student author an opportunity to write down a
few ideas that came out of this session.

Conclusion

When we reframe peer feedback as a conversation between reader and writer
rather than a fix-it session, workshops can become much more fruitful. Practice
writing feedback in the forms of productive praise, reader-based critique,
forward-looking suggestions, and thoughtful questions. When you receive
feedback, read it generously, with an open mind and the intent to use it to
experiment in your next draft. Finally, remember that writing effective peer
feedback is a skill--we need to practice it just as much as any other genre in
which we might write. We should be patient with our classmates as they learn
and ask for their patience in return as we provide them with feedback, too.

Chapter 9: Using the Rohrbach Library

                                           Sue Czerny (she/her) is the Digital Initiatives
                                           Librarian and the University Archivist. She has been
                                           a librarian at KU for a long time, and the bright spot
                                           of her day is always helping students find what they
                                           need. You can find Sue in the office next to the big
                                           blue cow on the second floor.

Just as reading and writing go hand-in-hand, the Rohrbach library at Kutztown
University can be a space for your writing to grow and develop. You already know
from Chapter 1 of this textbook that our library houses the writing center, which
can be useful at every stage of the writing process. In addition, the library
provides so many things that can be useful to your writing and research process
including the following:

          · The databases on library websites give you free access to online
            academic peer-reviewed journal articles, newspapers, magazines,
            videos, datasets, and more for your assignments. In the library itself,
            there are actual books, DVDs, and other resources you can borrow.

          · Librarians who are happy to show you how to use the library and its
            website. They can help you build better searches and point out all the
            helpful, time-saving features of the research databases.

          · The library provides study spaces designed for groups and individuals,
            and it is open late Sundays through Thursdays evenings until midnight.
            Use the Study Spaces Icon on the Library Homepage to reserve your
            space!

          · Lastly, the library has a wide variety of technology and equipment to
            make learning and writing easier.

                                                                    134

Library Databases and Online Research

Finding information for your research or projects can be daunting. Just the
amount of information you can find in the research databases can be
overwhelming in the beginning.

The library website gives KU students access to the highest quality research
databases. Library databases contain vetted, credible information that is
licensed and copyrighted. All the material in the library databases have already

                                         been evaluated for you, the information is accurate,
                                         and most of the research journals are peer-reviewed.
                                         All library databases are available wherever there is
                                         an internet connection. You do not need to be on
                                         campus to use them.

Popular Database icon  The Popular Databases icon on the library homepage
                       is a great place to start searching. KU students
                       automatically have a subscription through the library

                                            135
website to tens of thousands of journals, reports, newspapers, magazines,
images, and videos.

   Never, Never Pay for an Article!

   Most every academic library--including KU--has a service called Interlibrary
   Loan (ILL). If the library databases do not have the source you need, the
   library can borrow that book or article for you from a library that does have
   it. If there is a fee, our library will cover that fee for you. It is free to you!
   Articles can be in your inbox in 1 or 2 days, and books take about a week.
   Books are picked up and dropped off at the library.
Research databases are different from public access databases like Google or
Bing. For example, in research databases, you do not search using whole
sentences, just keywords, and library databases often do not correct spelling
errors. On the bright side, many research databases provide you with the
citations you need for your bibliography. It is wise to remember to budget time to
find reliable resources that have the information that fits well with your thesis
statement. Research is just that: It is searching and re-searching until you find
what you are looking for.
WARNING: Searching without going through the library website often results in
a publisher making you pay to download the article, so it is important to
remember the library databases are your key to getting articles for free.

                                                                    136

Other Resources in the Rohrbach Library

If you are on-campus, the library has a diverse collection of books, magazines,
and technologies to use in your projects, from the newest discoveries in your
major to books that have been on the shelves for 100 years or more if you are
doing historical research. Research Help
In seeking resources, you should also know how to find research help when you
need it. The professor teaching your class and grading your project is always an
excellent resource for help with your topic and the details of your assignment.
You can ask a librarian for help with constructing good searches and navigating
your way through the library databases to get the articles you need quickly.
Librarians are specialists in online search techniques. They will show you how to
select keywords, build a great search, and narrow it to just what you need.
Librarians can also show you hacks for the big search engines, like Google or
Google Scholar. They are experts at evaluating sources that are not from library
databases, how to spot deep fakes, or articles filled with misinformation that you
would not want to put in a research paper. Librarians are available to help you;
you can just ask at the library's main desk for a librarian, or you can use the chat
service on the library's website.

                                                                    137
Pro-Tip: Do a search for your topic before you decide to use it for your paper
or project. Test out a few keyword searches using the library databases to
see what kind of information is out there. It is just a quick look; you may not
even use the articles later. How difficult is it to find one or two articles on
that topic? Would it work better if you tweak your topic? Having a topic and
discovering that it is surprisingly difficult to find the information you need
can be frustrating and time consuming. Do not assume that there should be
a lot of information on your topic, especially if it is a recent trend, event, or
person-in-the-news. I am often surprised with how long it takes to find
journal articles for what I thought should be an easy topic to find.

A hard-to-find topic can be a good choice, too, especially if you are looking
to write something that is publishable, original, or is a promising topic to
expand upon in future research projects.

Spaces and Tech in the Library

The library also offers other services to help you succeed with your projects.
There are many different spaces and types of technology in the library to help
you no matter what type of learner you are. Some spaces and labs are designed
for group work, and other spaces are designed for quiet study.

You can reserve study rooms to work in
groups. Several of the study rooms have
large screens or hubs for multiple laptops.
There are laptops, both Apple and Windows,
that you can borrow to use in the library.
The library also provides desktop computers
and printing capabilities in the library
computer labs. The library has phone
chargers, headphones, iPads, and kindles if
you need them. There is even a coffee shop
with snack food if you are hungry!

All this information and more, including the
Chat with a Librarian feature, are available
on the library homepage. Do not be afraid to
ask!

STEAMworks is the place to do all those activities.

Final Activity 9.1: Writing an I-Search Essay

This assignment design was originally developed by Ken Macrorie and
adapted by Kutztown University professor, Moe Folk. An I-Search paper
is designed to teach the writer (and the reader) something valuable
about a chosen topic and the nature of researching and discovery. As
opposed to a standard research paper in which the writer usually adopts
a detached, objective stance, an I-Search paper allows the writer to take
an active role in research, to share the hunt for facts and truths
firsthand, and to provide a step-by-step record of the discovery process
and results in an accessible voice.

First, find a topic that you truly care about and that genuinely piques your
curiosity. Think of this assignment as something that can be a steppingstone to
later work in your major or career. Because of the nature of an I-search paper,
you cannot simply tell readers what you already know, so be prepared to do a
deep dive on new questions and interests you have and to incorporate new
research.

Begin your essay with an introduction and story behind your topic, addressing
what you already knew, assumed, or imagined about the topic.

Then, search for information on this topic using library resources. In the next
section of your essay, describe your research process, including why you picked
your sources and found them credible (or not). Include permalinks to your
sources.

Finally, end your essay with your reflections and discoveries. Explain what you
discovered and what it means to you: Did you answer the initial question(s)
satisfactorily or not? What information did the sources provide? What else would
you need to do?

                                                                    139

Chapter 10: Ethical and Effective Attribution

Writing is never a solitary process. As earlier chapters have addressed, we are
always writing to or for someone, even if that someone is just yourself or your
professor. We also write in response to others, saying what we think about what
they said. And, finally, we learn from others, bringing their knowledge into our
own writing.

And this is where things get tricky.

Even if you read through the MLA handbook and the Purdue OWL guide to
citation, or use EasyBib, NoodleTools, or other citation generators, there are
many "unwritten rules" and questions that don't always have easy answers. For
instance, how do you cite something in a speech or a podcast? How much text
can you borrow before having to use quotation marks? How original does an idea
have to be to warrant a citation? What's the difference between an in-text
citation and textual acknowledgement? And, overall, how do we bring other
voices into our own writing in a way that fairly acknowledges their work but also
highlights our own ideas? This chapter will guide you through these expectations
in academic and other popular genres of writing you are likely to compose in
composition courses, as well as help you to become aware of the "gray areas" in
citation where you may need to piece together general principles of etiquette and
honesty so that you can come to a creative and ethical solution.

                                                                    140
General Principles of Acknowledgement

You may have noticed that this chapter has already used a few different words
that seemingly refer to the same thing: acknowledgement, attribution, and
citation. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but more often they
have a shade of difference in their meanings. This difference in meaning reflects
the different professional and ethical expectations in what writers ought to do to
give credit to their sources, so let's go over them now.

Acknowledgement is the broadest term of these three because it just means to
signal or recognize something or someone. For instance, I might acknowledge
my own limitations in that I don't know something. Or I could acknowledge my
friend with a head nod or fist bump. In composition, I might acknowledge a few
authors that are important to the overall topic I'm writing about even if I don't
use any quotations from these sources. I can also acknowledge that I've had help
on an assignment, such as from a tutor, a librarian, or even a friend. Though
formal acknowledgement of sources like libraries and the writing center aren't
typically expected from students in a paper, authors of books will often write an
Acknowledgements page (or simply "the acknowledgements") that details all the
direct and indirect help the author received throughout the long process of
writing from editors who corrected the phrasing to a favorite pet that helped
them to relax. In ordinary speech, we regularly acknowledge others for their
help, just by saying "thanks" or "I couldn't have done it without you."

Attribution is a type of acknowledgement that communicates the exact source
of something. To attribute something to someone is to point out that they are the
one(s) who created, discovered, wrote, or are otherwise responsible for that
thing. Attribution can be a very formal process as in academic citation,
mentioned below and elaborated on in later sections. However, attribution need
not be in a formal citation or documentation style to be correct. Certain genres
of composition such as a speech might orally attribute an idea to someone simply
by saying "According to..." or "So-and-so said... ." A website might use a link to
attribute a certain source for their information, allowing readers to verify the
truth of their claims. We attribute for many reasons including to give credit, to be
honest with our readers, and to give our readers a way to find the source for
themselves.

Citation is a type of attribution used in formal academic writing. You may have
heard about documentation styles or citation styles such as MLA, APA, or
Chicago. These citation styles use quotation marks to indicate word-for-word
borrowing and in-text citations or footnotes to point to a particular source. Many

                                                                    141
                                                     Acknowledgement, Attribution, Citation

citation styles also use a Works Cited or References page to give more detail
about a source. Citations are designed to be used by the scholarly community -
researchers and students - to communicate the exact source used. Citation is
very formalized, and it can be a painstaking process to cite correctly since even
small punctuation marks often have specific placements. This exactness is meant
to make it easy to know the sources researchers use, but this all relies on
learning how to read what all the elements of a citation mean, which is covered
in detail later in this chapter.

You might have noticed that all three of the above terms are related. Citation is a
type of attribution, and attribution is a type of acknowledgement. These terms go
from general to specific, and this is intentional since, in a related manner, the
genres applicable to these terms also go from general to specific. So, whereas
acknowledgment might apply broadly to gesturing at sources or influences in any
style and genre, attribution points out specific sources in a more specific manner,
and citation pinpoints the placement and degree of source use following specific
academic conventions.

So, how do you know which to use?

Earlier in this book, we went over the importance of paying attention to the
rhetorical situation: the audience, genre, and purpose of your writing, which
should play a big role in determining your writing style. For example, a text
message to a friend might use a "slang" abbreviation that you are both familiar
with and that you would never use in an academic report. Similarly, your
professor's expectations and the genre in which they are asking you to write

                                                                    142
should help you to determine the best course of action in acknowledgement,
attribution, or citation.

Activity 10.1: Explore Scenarios

Scenario 1

Your professor tells you to write an informal reflection letter about the
writing process you used for your narrative essay. Your narrative, "No
Lemons for Lemonade" was all about the time that your brother dared
you to eat a lemon, which resulted in a fight and, ultimately, a better
understanding of your relationship with him. To write your story, you
spoke with your mother about what she remembered about the incident,
you got help from your roommate in brainstorming what to write about,
you met with your professor to talk about how to structure the essay,
and you went to the writing center for some extra help with formatting
dialog. Additionally, you included several direct quotations from your
brother throughout your story.

What style of giving credit is most appropriate in this scenario?

          A. Formal in-text citations for your brother's direct quotations, and
              citations on an MLA-style Works Cited page for your mother,
              roommate, professor, and writing center tutor.

          B. Attribution tags such as "My brother said" within your narrative
              and acknowledgements of the help you received from your
              mother, roommate, professor, and writing center tutor in your
              reflection letter.

          C. No credit is needed at all.

If you chose B, you are correct! Using a formal citation style would be unusual
within the genre of a narrative essay. Unless your professor instructs otherwise,
you likely don't need formal citation methods like in-text citations and a Works
Cited page for this non-academic genre of writing. However, in a story, it is often
important to indicate what people say aloud, so the use of quotation marks and
speaker tags is a form of attribution within the narrative. Also, acknowledging
the people who inspired or helped you in your writing process as part of your
reflection letter is likely appropriate. Your professors know that no one ever
writes alone. Informally crediting the help you received from friends, relatives,
and tutors often shows your professors that you are both respectful and diligent
in your writing process.

                                                                    143
Scenario 2

Your professor gives you the assignment to write a three-page academic
argument essay using at least two sources. For your essay arguing that
zoos should not keep alligators in captivity, you quote from an academic
article that you find in the library's academic database and paraphrase a
point from the National Wildlife Federation website. Finally, you looked
up the difference between alligator and crocodiles on Wikipedia and
used a sentence defining what that difference is.

What style of giving credit is most appropriate in this scenario?

          A. Informal acknowledgement as a note at the end for all of your
              sources.

          B. Some attribution of your sources within the essay.

          C. Formal academic citation using in-text citations and a Works
              Cited page.

If you chose C, you are correct! Unless your professor indicates otherwise (and
they might do this for any number of reasons), the genre of an "academic essay"
generally implies that any sources will use formal citation methods such as in-
text citations and a Works Cited page.

Where this gets tricky is in deciding which citation method to use and when. For
instance, in the above scenario 2, would you have used a citation even for the
sentence you took from Wikipedia? If so, what type? Would you have used
quotation marks and an in-text citation? Would you have done the same for the
paraphrase from the National Wildlife Federation?

If these distinctions are starting to seem both nuanced and exacting, you're
right. Giving credit accurately is often about paying attention to the little details
that convey a whole lot of information. In further sections of this chapter, we will
cover how to clarify the subtle distinction between paraphrase, quotation, and
summary, and how to understand these distinctions in others' writing. In that
way, citation isn't so different from any other feature of writing style. Even a
comma can convey a lot of useful information or be misleading if put in the
wrong place. However, citation opens a whole new can of worms: ethics. So, now
that we know the basic terms, let's discuss why it matters.

The Ethics of Attribution

Do you find writing to be fairly hard work? Do you ever have ideas that you are
proud of? Have you ever created something that you think is truly original?

                                                                    144
Good acknowledgement of content creators often blends into the background,
and we might not even notice it until we are looking for it or trying to do it
ourselves. However, when writers and artists use major portions of others' work
and fail to acknowledge it, the result can be accusations of plagiarism or
copyright violation in a highly publicized scandal.

          · Ex-senator's wife accused of plagiarizing history book from Wikipedia

          · Plagiarism allegations pursue physicist behind stunning
            superconductivity claims

          · Army 3-Star General Loses Rank After War College Plagiarism Revealed

          · Jury rules Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams stole "Blurred Lines."

Scandals like the ones in the headlines above have resulted in dire
consequences: canceled book contracts, million-dollar lawsuits, lost jobs, and
social disgrace. If you read the stories in the articles, you'll find that they all
involve the accusation that someone has taken credit for something that they
didn't fully acknowledge. But also, you might notice that these scandals are at
least partly driven by further complex cultural ideas surrounding the ownership of
intellectual property (sometimes just called I.P.), which is the idea that a
creator's original work grants them certain formal legal rights to control what
happens to it (called copyright), as well as a social attachment to the work that
we might refer to as authorship. Violating intellectual property laws is referred
to as copyright infringement, and violating authorship is often some form of
plagiarism, the misrepresentation of a work or idea as one's own.

Though it might seem like a simple concept not to "steal" work that isn't yours,
the fact is that there are many cultural norms and philosophical assumptions at
play here. For instance, the idea of intellectual property relies on the idea that an
artwork or idea can be truly original; whereas some might argue that every new
idea or work of art comes from a mix of others. Another example of an
underlying assumption might be that an idea can and should be "owned."

Activity 10.2: Discussing Assumptions Surrounding Acknowledgement

Use library databases or Google to find a recent (within the past year)
news article about plagiarism and read the article carefully. Identify any
cultural or philosophical assumptions that the article makes about
originality, intellectual property, fair acknowledgement, and who or
what counts as an author. Then, talk about what you think about the
case.

                                                                    145
One factor important to avoiding both copyright infringement and plagiarism is in
the amount used. There's a legal limitation to US copyright laws called fair use,
which allows reuse of intellectual property under certain conditions, including
that this reuse is noncommercial (you shouldn't resell it), that it has educational,
parody, or commentary purposes, and that it is only a small portion of the work.
Fair use is what allows you to share reaction GIFs drawn from copyrighted films,
include a photo of a copyrighted artwork in a PowerPoint presentation, or quote a
recent novel in a research paper. In these cases, not only is your use
noncommercial, but any clip, image, or quote is only part of the whole.

                                                                    146
   Disclaimer: Of course, this is merely a guideline for avoiding plagiarism and
   does not constitute legal advice on copyright law. The author of this chapter
   is not a lawyer. Read for more specific information on fair use doctrine.

The same dictum against reusing the whole work goes for avoiding plagiarism,
with one extra condition--any single reuse generally shouldn't make up a big
portion of your work. So, if you are assigned a 500-word essay, using a 300-word
quote from a larger work would generally be seen as stepping over the line of
being too derivative, even if you cite it correctly. However, that same 300-word
quote might fit perfectly in a 3,000-word essay. It's all about finding the right
proportion that puts your own ideas at the forefront of your writing and positions
any source material in a secondary role. But this is just a guideline. Plagiarism--
unlike copyright infringement--is an academic and social violation rather than a
crime, so the expectations of the appropriate amount of source material to use
can vary greatly by discipline, genre of writing, and course. For instance, one
professor may assign an essay that draws completely from your own memory,
making no source use acceptable. Another might assign a creative "collage"
poem where each line is drawn from another source, your own input being
limited to the overall design. This is all fair game, and the best rule in these
cases is to follow your professor's expectations.

Beyond issues of credit, ownership, and amount, good acknowledgement is also
about plain old honesty. Acknowledgement tells your reader who and what your
sources are so that they can appreciate what's truly original in your writing as
well as where anything else is from. Specific forms of attribution such as citation
gives your reader even greater tools to find your sources quickly and easily so
they can verify the facts themselves.

Being transparent about sources makes verifying the truth of the information
possible, which is very important in this day and age of deep fakes,
disinformation campaigns, and "fake news." However, as the comic above
suggests, political speech and other sources of everyday media unfortunately
often fall short of this expectation of transparency. Commercials, billboards,
personal blogs, listicles, and self-interested organizations may not give clear or
explicit sources, which should prompt us to be even more suspicious of their
claims.

Evaluating Sources

Edgar Allan Poe, author of famous horror stories such as "The Tell-Tale Heart"
and "The Raven," once wrote "Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that
you see" (194). Poe should know: in addition to his horror stories, Poe was a
journalist who took a particular interest in hoaxes, also known as "fake news." He
wrote several hoaxes himself and was shocked at the gullibility of the public in
their belief of what he wrote, just because it appeared in print. Even in our
"information age," with fact-checking just a Google search away, sadly, this
seems to be true today with many people believing false information that
proliferates online.

One goal of the general education program at Kutztown is to equip our students
to be able to evaluate source materials so that you don't get taken in by hoaxes
and fake news. Evaluating sources with accuracy is also an ethical issue as you
shouldn't be responsible for passing along false information to others in your own
writing.

Often, the best strategy to evaluate sources is simply to read carefully and
closely, using the close reading strategies you have developed to determine a
composition's rhetorical situation. Once you know the audience, the genre, and--
in particular--the purpose of a piece, you can evaluate it accordingly. Close
reading is time-consuming work, but worthwhile even when using other methods
of evaluation to help you.

                                                                    148
Another tactic is to use library databases as a filter to find information that has
been vetted by researchers. Books and articles that have undergone a formal
process of review by other researchers are said to be peer-reviewed. Many
professors ask students to rely on peer-reviewed research for student essays
because these articles are the gold standard of reliability and reputability within
the academic community and, often, beyond. That said, even peer-reviewed
research can be unreliable as it can fall out of date, be misapplied, or--in some
cases--suffer from bias. Keep in mind, too, that the project of knowledge-
generation is never ending. What one researcher discovers, another may refute,
reinforce, or reevaluate.

Finally, you can fact-check the article yourself. Fact-checking, done right, should
involve checking the information against both primary and secondary sources,
evaluating the writing for possible bias or deficiencies, investigating possible
counterclaims, and tracing source material. The last of these tasks, tracing
source material, is one that is particularly useful for you as a student researcher.
Tracing source material can help you to identify potential biases, make you aware
of other research on the topic, and help you to see how information should or
should not be applied. To trace a source, click on any links or investigate any
source lists or citations provided. If there is no acknowledgement of sources
used, you might consider following Poe's advice, and believe none of what you
hear.

Activity 10.3: Tracing Sources in an Article

Find any online article that reports on a recent scientific finding and click
on a few of the links within the article. Notice how the article refers to
others and does (or does not) give you all the tools to trace its sources.

           Why I Recommend Against Citing "Listicles" in Your
                           Professional or Academic Writing

                                               By Dr. Lynch-Biniek

   Listicles are everywhere on the internet, from purely entertaining posts
   --"Five Reasons You Should Watch Rings of Power!"--to more informative,
   edutainment pieces--"Here Are Ten Writing Exercises to Get Your Students
   Fired Up!" (Why do they so frequently end in exclamation points? Who's this
   excited?)

   This internet genre is no doubt engaging, often accompanied by lots of
   images and written in a friendly tone. Most of all, I think, readers appreciate

                                                                    149
   how easily digestible a listicle is--complex ideas are presented in short
   bulleted or numbered lists. What's not to love?

   Sure, I read these on occasion for fun, but I don't use them to educate
   myself on anything important to me, even if I trust the site or the writer.
   Here's why.

   The nuances and complexity of a topic are necessarily lost in any list
   composed to be quickly read. Gone are any discussions of context,
   challenges, and alternative perspectives. The format does not allow the
   writer room to explain how they arrived at their conclusions, or how the
   evidence was assessed (if any evidence is provided, that is). As a result, the
   ideas are often over-simplified, not applicable to many contexts, and, in the
   worst cases, misleading.

   So, I hope you'll take my advice: treat listicles as fun distractions and don't
   use them in your academic or professional project.

Activity 10.4: Investigating Sources in Advertisements

Next time you are scrolling through social media, reading a magazine, or
looking up at a billboard, notice if a commercial makes suspicious factual
claims. Does it cite a source for those claims? Google whether there is
any truth to those claims and consider if the way they presented their
sources is truly transparent and honest, or if there is something
somewhat unethical in the way information is presented.

Attribution and Academic Honesty

Giving clear and accurate attribution in the form of formal citations is one way
that peer-reviewed scholarly research--the type you might find in library
databases--is different from many articles you might find on the web. Because
getting the facts right and crediting other researchers is so important in
academic research, academic contexts have their own attribution and citation
etiquette that is often referred to as academic honesty or "academic integrity."
Kutztown University includes academic honesty in its Student Code of Conduct in
The Key, and you can find the official policy with rules on the penalties and
processes in the policy ACA-027. According to this policy, professors take
academic honesty infractions--which include (but are not limited to) plagiarism,
reusing assignments, using AI technology like ChatGPT on assignments without
permission, paying for assignments, and unsanctioned collaboration--very

                                                                    150
seriously. Keep in mind, though, that what counts as an infraction will depend on
the course; for instance, collaboration is encouraged in some courses that rely on
groupwork, whereas others expect all work to be done individually.

Kutztown University is not alone in taking academic honesty seriously; it's
considered an important value that educational and research institutions uphold
to enable learning, facilitate the truthful representation of information, uphold
fairness amongst the student body, and prepare students for ethical and legal
challenges in their future professions.

Activity 10.5: Creating an Academic Honesty Policy

As a class or with a group of other students, create what you think is the
best academic honesty policy for your specific course. Include details on
what counts as an academic honesty infraction, how such infractions
should be detected, and what the consequences should be.

Professors at Kutztown also have access to "originality detection" software called
Turnitin through the D2L course management shell. All assignments submitted
through D2L can also be submitted to Turnitin if your professor chooses to do so.
Turnitin attempts to find matches between your paper and material that has been
submitted to other schools and material on the web. If your professor uses
Turnitin and makes these reports available to you (both of which are optional
settings), you may see them by clicking on the "assignment feedback" button on
D2L.

Reading this report yourself can be useful, but it is also limited in several
important ways. First, the "originality score" it provides shouldn't be treated as a
reliable guide alone in determining any amount of plagiarism. 0% isn't
necessarily any "better" than 15% or 40%. The number is just a reflection of
how much of your work uses material that can be found in other sources. This
might include both correctly cited and uncited material, along with "false
positives" like lengthy book titles, cliches (which are found in many sources),
repeated material from a form letter or worksheet question, URLs, and Works
Cited citations. The originality score also may include any work also submitted for
other courses--including from a former college or high school--which is why it is
very important to disclose any reuse of your own work before submitting the
assignment. Undisclosed and unsanctioned reuse is often called self-plagiarism,
and it can be a breach of academic honesty guidelines depending on your
professor's classroom policies.

                                                                    151
In a nutshell, how ethical or unethical any source use is, is completely up to the
context and how you use it, which is not something Turnitin can evaluate itself.
For example, you might have written a research paper that uses a lot of sources,
and you cite them all correctly for a resulting score of 42% and this can be all
good. Another paper with a few uncited and plagiarized sentences might get a
result of 8% and this isn't good. The point is that it's all about how you
acknowledge your sources--something that Turnitin and other plagiarism-
catching programs online cannot determine--and how to cite correctly is the topic
of our next section.

                                                                    152
Activity 10.6: Reading the Turnitin Report
At some point where you are required to submit a rough draft on D2L,
check to see if you can find a Turnitin report on your assignment
feedback. Don't panic if you can't find it--many professors do not use
this feature, or do not release the reports. If you do find it, investigate
the highlighted text to see what it says you might have copied and from
where. Give yourself a mental pat on the back for any quotations that
are enclosed in quotation marks and use the method of citation or
attribution required by the course. Also, look for any possible errors
revealed by highlighted text not enclosed in quotation marks. Note that
paraphrase can be tricky (see paraphrase below), and errors in
paraphrase might be revealed with some phrases being highlighted in
succession. If you find any errors, take some time to carefully revise
them, reading over the section on citation below. If you find major
errors, it's best to ask for help by visiting your professor's office hours.

LLMs, ChatGPT, AI, and Academic Honesty

ChatGPT, Bing AI, Bard, Claude, Gemini, and other large-language models
(LLMs) are digital programs that use large amounts of "training data" to
generate text that sounds as if it might have been written by a human being. All
a user or "prompt operator" must do to use an LLM is to order the program to
"generate" something, and it will do so. Here's an example of ChatGPT on Open
AI generating a children's story about a boy named Justin who defeats monsters
with a jar of pickles:

                                                                    153
      ChatGPT Screenshot with the prompt "Generate a children's story featuring a boy named Justin who
                                  overcomes dangerous monsters with the use of a jar of pickles"

Though there's never been a story about a boy named "Justin" fighting monsters
with pickles, it wouldn't be totally accurate to call this story "original." LLMs like
ChatGPT have been trained on massive amounts of text on the internet to mimic
the dominant patterns of human speech.
But it's not human.
Unlike human beings, ChatGPT doesn't know if it's lying or telling the truth,
accurate or inaccurate. At this point in time, ChatGPT is often bad at math,
makes up reference sources and facts, and "hallucinates" by providing narratives
of events that never happened. ChatGPT generates answers that sound right but
may not actually be right.

                                                                    154
  ChatGPT Screenshot with the prompt "give a news article on hostile aliens landing on Kutztown University
                                                                            campus"

In the above screen capture from OpenAI, I asked ChatGPT to "give a news
article on hostile aliens landing on Kutztown University campus." In a matter of
seconds, ChatGPT produced a news article much like Orson Welles' "War of the
Worlds" 1938 radio broadcast, using details from Pennsylvania politics, as later in
the article Governor Tom Wolf makes a statement offering support to the affected
local community.

The above screenshot from OpenAI shows that sometimes (but not always)
ChatGPT will give a disclaimer about its limitations as it does above. I asked
ChatGPT to provide a list of sources in MLA style for a paper on aliens landing on
Kutztown Campus. Note that all the sources in its source list might seem to be
correctly formatted if any of these sources were real. However, like hostile aliens
at KU, none of them exists. This might be obvious in the case of a made-up topic
like "aliens in Kutztown," but this limitation extends to research on any topic;
ChatGPT will often fabricate sources and facts that are not real.

So, before we even consider the ethics of ChatGPT and other AI, we might
consider whether it would actually do what you want it to do. ChatGPT isn't
magic--it cannot predict the future, judge the accuracy of anything in the real
world, or give advice that you can rely on. It also cannot tell your own story for
you, generate recommendations for sources or find quotes for research, or

                                                                    155
                                                     ChatGPT MLA style citations Screenshot

anything else that requires human discernment, ethical judgment, or emotional
intelligence. All of this means that AI, in its current form, is unreliable as a
source, and, most relevantly, AI is unsuitable for most research projects and
composition tasks that ask you to write with your own voice using your own
reasoning.

There are also thorny ethical issues about copyright and representation that
haven't yet been resolved, at least at the time of writing this chapter. LLMs rely
on the unsanctioned use of copyrighted material and can sometimes mimic an
author's voice to the point where there may be legitimate concerns regarding
copyright infringement and plagiarism. Also, LLMs and other forms of AI can
replicate stereotypes and stereotypical language in very problematic ways, such
as by using sexist and racist language. Again, LLMs aren't human and thus don't
have the ability to exercise human judgment. That's up to us.

However, there might be ways that your professor might have you capitalize on
the strengths of LLMs for a learning activity or for a stage of your writing, such
as exploring revision possibilities for a small portion of your writing, generating
lists of ideas for a topic, various argument outlines to consider ideas in a

                                                                    156
different way, or creating a model essay on which you could practice critique and
peer review.

It's important to keep in mind that any use of LLMs like ChatGPT or other AI
should be done with the full knowledge and permission of your instructor. Your
professor's goal is to help you learn, and, like any tool, using AI might aid this
goal or totally subvert the learning process. If you aren't sure of your professor's
policies on AI, ask them beforehand so that it doesn't become an academic
honesty issue.

Note that Turnitin now has an AI detection function. This is separate from the
"similarity report" using the percentage generation. Whereas the similarity report
relies on finding copies of the same word strings, AI detection works by finding
the most common patterns generated by LLMs. Currently, this detection is fairly
accurate in high percentages, but may be much less so in lower percentages, and
may result in some "false positives." First, note that professors can ban the use
of AI in writing assignments (see section on LLMs), and if you use AI on an
assignment that prohibits it, you may be subject to the academic honesty policy.
But if your professor brings a Turnitin report to your attention that indicates AI
use when you did not actually use AI, discuss this with them in a forthright
manner during their office hours. I also suggest showing previous drafts or notes
as proof of your authentic hard work. AI and AI detection are constantly evolving
with daily updates to software like Turnitin and other AI detection programs, as
are attitudes surrounding AI use.

Even if you aren't using it for coursework, a major element to using LLMs
ethically is transparency. Being honest about exactly how and where you are
using the LLM in your writing treats your audience with the respect they deserve.
If your professor allows any use of LLMs in research papers, it's important to fully
attribute this use following the principles of effective attribution in the next
section, and, if a formal paper, using the documentation style appropriate to the
assignment. The MLA has a guide to citing AI, as do the APA, and CMS.

Effective Attribution

Whether in academic or informal contexts, effective and ethical attribution will
accurately acknowledge the what, where, who, and how of your source use:

          · What: What do you take from your source?

          · Where: Where do you use your source?

                                                                    157
          · Who: Who is your source?

          · How: How do you use your source?

We attribute others and are concerned with attribution all the time, even though
we don't often give it much conscious attention. For instance, if you hear a rumor
from a friend about yourself, you would probably be extremely interested in what
exactly was said, who said it, where they heard it, and how they heard about it.
That's because context matters, and even minor details--such as something
being said publicly vs. privately, whether the wording is paraphrased or exact--
can change our whole perception of an issue. Good online news sources, blogs,
and websites often use links for attribution, so that the source of their facts or
quotes can be fact-checked and followed up by their readers.

For example, investigate the following passage from The New York Times article
by Jack Healy on the experiences of an air conditioning repair specialist during
the middle of a heat wave.

                 As Phoenix slogs through a record 20 straight days of 110-
                 degree or higher temperatures, Mr. Guerrero, 33, has
                 emerged as maybe the most essential worker in a town
                 desperate to stay cool: the A.C. repair guy.

                 "We live in a city where you have to have it," he said. "If
                 they need us, we go."

                 Summer is always his busy season, but air-conditioner
                 service companies around the Southwest are seeing voracious
                 demand -- a result of record-breaking temperatures searing
                 the country from Florida to California, compounded by a
                 shortage of skilled technicians and equipment.

Even in the short passage above, author Jack Healy gives the what, where, who,
and how of his sources. In doing so, he uses some subtle techniques of effective
attribution that are applicable to many forms of composition.

Most obviously, Healy uses quotation marks, which indicate a verbatim, or
word-for-word expression. This expression ("We live...") is the what (the selection
of what is taken from the source), which in this case happens to be a selection of
spoken conversation.

Activity 10.7: Quoting a Real Person

Briefly interview another person on a topic of your choice, and take
notes on what they say, making sure that you record a few of their

                                                                    158
statements with absolute accuracy. Choose just one sentence that
stands out to you as particularly characteristic to how your interviewee
sounds and is a good representation of what they said to you. Then,
practice quoting a small portion of what you recorded as if you were
writing an article for The New York Times. Make sure to use quotation
marks around the verbatim (exact) words, and introduce the person
speaking with a signal phrase.

Quotations can give the reader a sense of how a speaker writes or sounds, so
when effective selections are chosen, they can add a sense of authenticity.
Seeing the exact words Guerrero used also gives readers a better picture of who
he is, and having the security of quotation marks demonstrates what's actually
being said, so there's less implication of an interpretation by the author.

However, using a quotation isn't the only option. If Healey wasn't sure exactly
what words Guerrero used, or if he wanted to express them in a different way or
for a slightly different purpose, he might paraphrase Guerrero's statement by
saying something like the following: Guerrero said that he always responds to a
call since they live in a city that absolutely requires AC. Notice how my
paraphrase here isn't just a word-for-word swapping out of what Guerrero said.
It changes the structure of the sentence as well as the word choice. Effective
paraphrasing will put the phrasing in my own words for my own purpose.

Activity 10.8: Practice Transforming Quotation Into Paraphrase

Take the sentence you used in the last activity and experiment with
paraphrasing it. Find at least three completely different ways to
rephrase the same sentence while keeping the meaning almost entirely
the same. Then, try to paraphrase for a different purpose, such as to
thoroughly explain to someone unfamiliar with the statement's topic, to
analyze and expose a particularly controversial point within the
statement, or to briefly reference the idea in order to show experts in
the topic that you understand it and can move on from it. However,
make sure to also maintain a connection to the "who" by using a signal
phrase.

Notably, Healy also makes it clear who is speaking by mentioning the speaker's
name, offering a little bit about them before quoting them, and using the phrase
"he said." A signal phrase is a clear indication of who is speaking in a quotation
or who is responsible for the ideas or data within a paraphrase. If the above
quote from Guerrero didn't have "he said," we might wonder if someone else
were speaking. Beyond this, we also know something about Guerrero since Healy
introduced him in the sentence before as a 33-year-old "A.C. repair guy."

                                                                    159
Knowing this relevant information not only gives clarity and imagery to the
passage but also gives him more credibility or ethos: more reason to trust him
since this is his area of expertise.

Because quotation marks are used around verbatim passages, the where is very
clear. We don't only know the content of what is being said, but also exactly
where Healey's source use begins and ends, and it's important to reflect this with
accuracy. But you might have noticed another technique Healy uses: linking. If
you click on any of the links that appear as blue, underlined passages in the
original but in bold in the passage text, they will take you to another relevant
page that supports the reference Healy is making about the 20-day heatwave or
high demand for AC. These passages support his point without being verbatim
repetitions. Instead, Healy is doing a quick paraphrase and then moving on to
the next topic, using the link to his source as a way to prove factual accuracy
about what he is saying. Linking is common in newsletters, webpages, and online
articles, but is less common in academic assignments where formal in-text
citations are generally used rather than links, but for much of the same purpose:
to provide your reader with a way to trace the source.

Finally, Healy's use of quotations and paraphrases is driven by a larger purpose:
his how. Healy doesn't just drop in a quotation and move on. He sandwiches the
quote with analysis so that its purpose is crystal clear. A "quote sandwich" begins
with the set-up of a signal phrase, other introduction of the source, or the
content like Healy does when he mentions the "A.C. Repair guy" to introduce who
Guerrero is and why he would be important to the conversation. The quotation
falls in the middle of the sandwich, integrated smoothly into the writing with a
signal phrase. Then, the quotation is followed by some analysis, explanation, or
connection to the topic at hand. So, for the metaphor of a quote sandwich, the
quote is the filling and the two slices of bread are how you set-up and explain the
quotation in your own words.

In Healy's writing, he follows up Guerrero's statement "If they need us, we go"
with a reiteration that summer is the busy season and so AC repair is a service in
demand. Guerrero's statement, then, is a witness to this fact and supports the
point that Healy is making without making it for him. You can also see how the
end of the passage moves the content in a new direction, that of AC repair
workers being in short supply. Guerrero's statement then gains new meaning as
we understand him and others in his profession as being in high demand.

The above passage shows what good attribution looks like using what, where,
who, and how in an online journalistic article. These features can look somewhat

                                                                    160
different in an academic essay, but the principles remain the same. Take a look
at the sample paper below and at this Google Docs link, which will be used in the
next examples.

                          Sample Paper Screenshot (Access the full text of the Sample Paper online)

This paper might look a bit different from Healy's article. For one, you may have
noticed that it is formatted differently, using double-spacing and containing no
links. You might also notice that the paragraphs are much longer. These
differences are simply the product of differences in genre. Healy's piece is an
online article in a newspaper while "Snakes in Summer Camp" is an academic
essay. However, for all these apparent differences, they share the same
philosophy of attribution, using signal phrases and quote sandwiches.
For instance, in the "Snakes in Summer Camps" example above, you might have
noticed that each quotation I used was introduced with my own phrasing like
"According to the CDC..." or "Naturalist Thomas Palmer argues..." These
introductions are signal phrases much like "he said" in the above example. Signal
phrases are often expected in academic writing. Not only do they help make it
clear where your source use begins and ends, but they provide your reader with
additional context about the source (such as the fact that Palmer is a naturalist
and is making an argument), and they can help your writing to "flow" by
explaining the relevance your source has to your argument.

                                                                    161
Additionally, you might notice that most of the sources are followed by my own
commentary, description, summary, and more. Following up a quotation with
more explanation is often key to helping your reader understand why you used
the source and what it means for your argument. Surrounding source use with
your own context and explanations is another example of the quote sandwich:
providing the bread on both sides of the "sandwich filling" that is your source.

Activity 10.9: Making a Quote Sandwich

Find a quotation that you want to use for a research paper and construct
a quote sandwich by beginning with a signal phrase like "According
to...," including a correctly formatted in-text citation in the
documentation style you'll be using and following up that quotation with
a sentence of your own explaining its relevance or significance in your
own words.

However, one big difference you may have noticed between Healy's article and
Sam Pell's essay is how each use of a source is quickly followed by numbers and
names in parentheses. These are called citations and are a way to link to source
material with brevity and specificity. Using citations is a key academic skill that
will be covered in the next section.

How to Cite

Citation is a specific attribution method used by students and researchers in
academic contexts. There are quite a few citation styles, and which one you
should use will likely depend on the academic field you are writing within.

MLA (Modern Language Association) style is used for many fields within the
humanities, particularly English literature and language arts.

          · MLA Association Website Online Style Guide

          · Purdue OWL MLA Sample Paper

          · MLA Guide from the KU Writing Center

APA (American Psychological Association) style is used in the social sciences
including psychology, sociology, and anthropology.

          · APA Association Website Style Guide

          · Purdue OWL APA Sample Paper

                                                                    162
          · APA Guide from the KU Writing Center

CMS (Chicago Manual of Style or Turabian) is used in history and other fields in
the humanities.

          · CMS Online Style Guide

          · Purdue OWL CMS Sample Paper

          · CMS Guide from the KU Writing Center

          · Other styles include AMA (American Medical Association), CSE (Council
            of Science Editors).

Why so many different styles?

Each citation style is created by a major organization within its field and reflects
the priorities of that field. So, you might notice that APA and other styles in
scientific fields emphasize the date of publication by putting it right in the in-text
citation whereas MLA does not. This emphasis of dates is particularly important
to styles in the sciences because scientific knowledge often changes quickly, and
readers will want to be certain that the most up-to-date source material is used,
whereas publication date is somewhat less important in the humanities.

Because many fields of study-including Composition-are interdisciplinary, you
might be asked to write research papers in any of these styles, or the professor
may give you a choice.

One thing to keep in mind is that no one is expecting you to memorize these
styles or to be able to use them without referring to a guide. Professional
researchers and writers often refer to style guide books like the MLA handbook,
websites like the association websites provided above, and sometimes
supplemental websites to Purdue OWL to look up rules and provide extra
clarification.

That said, knowing the basic elements that these citation styles have in common
is key to knowing what to do when the time comes to use any one of them.

Most citation styles have two basic elements to them: In-text Citations and a
Source List.

                                                                    163
An in-text citation (or, in some styles, a footnote) is a brief reference to a
source right after you use it in your paper. It is specifically formatted to give
enough information so that your reader can find it in your source list.

Here's an example of using a quotation and citing it with an in-text citation in
MLA style:

                 "The belief that rattlesnakes can be deadly is not without
                 foundation" (Palmer 93).

In the above example "Palmer" is the last name of the author "Thomas Palmer"
and "93" is the page number where this sentence is found in his book Landscape
with Reptile: Rattlesnakes in an Urban World.

Now, here's the same quotation with an in-text citation in APA style:

                 "The belief that rattlesnakes can be deadly is not without
                 foundation" (Palmer, 2018, p. 93).

Finally, here's the same quotation with an in-text citation using the author-date
method in CMS style:

                 "The belief that rattlesnakes can be deadly is not without
                 foundation" (Palmer 2018, 93).

As you can see, the differences between these citation styles are very subtle,
often just a matter of comma placement or the inclusion of a "p." Even in
documentation styles that use footnotes, or when using summary or paraphrase,
the general rule is the same: place an in-text citation immediately following a
source use. There are also slight variations in the rules when it comes to dealing
with multiple authors, authors mentioned in a signal phrase, sources without
explicit authors, one or more sources by the same author, and more, which are
all issues that a comprehensive style guidebook and online guides deal with fully.

However, an in-text citation is just a quick reference. More information is needed
to find the source. If I were looking for "Palmer" in the source above, I might
happen upon hundreds of authors named "Palmer." Which one is it?

A source list is a comprehensive list of all the sources used in your paper in
detail sufficient to pinpoint the actual source. This textbook uses a source list
called a "Works Cited." MLA style calls the source list a Works Cited, APA calls
it References, and CMS calls this a Bibliography.

                                                                    164
Here's an example of the Works Cited entry in MLA style that I would use on my
source list:

                 Palmer, Thomas. Landscape with Reptile: Rattlesnakes in an
                       Urban World. The University of Georgia Press, 2018.

Here's the same source as it would appear in an APA style Reference list:
                 Palmer. T. (2018). Landscape with reptile: rattlesnakes in
                       an urban world. The University of Georgia Press.

Finally, here's the same source in a CMS style Bibliography:
                 Palmer, Thomas. Landscape with Reptile: Rattlesnakes in an
                       Urban World. Athens: The University of Georgia Press,
                       2018.

As with the in-text citations, I hope that you notice more similarities than
differences in these source entries. Each of them gives the author's last name
first and then gives (in various orders) the year, the title, the publisher, and
sometimes other information like the publication locations, any editors,
translators, editions, artists and collaborators, and URLs. All this information is
meant to make it easy for the reader to find the exact source that the author is
using.
But, before we go any further, I'd like to show you how to use an in-text citation
and source list so that they work together in a sample paper. First, let's say I'm
writing an essay where I argue that summer camps shouldn't kill the snakes that
they find on the grounds. I read up on this issue and create an outline, as well as
find some interesting possible sources. In my essay, I want to correct the
misconception that venomous snakes are responsible for a lot of deaths. So,
while doing my research, I find the Palmer source, Landscape with Reptile as an
eBook in the library catalog:

                                                                    165
                                       Screenshot of KU Library Catalog Listing of Palmer's book

One very useful tool in the library catalog and on many of the library databases
is an automatic citation generator. This is a built-in tool that gives a source list
citation in any of the major citation styles. Since my paper is in MLA style, I click
the "Citation" button and select the most updated version of MLA (9th edition).
Then, so I don't lose the citation, I copy it to the bottom of my essay draft where
I am constructing an in-progress Works Cited page. Though the source list comes
last in a paper, it's often a great idea to construct it right as you find the sources.
That way, you won't lose track of any sources, and you can also see if you are
following any assignment guidelines you might have on the number and types of
sources you need to use.

                                                                    166
                      Screenshot of KU Library Catalog Listing of Palmer's book's citation information

Some professors assign an annotated bibliography, which is just a source list
with notes after each entry. Even if you aren't assigned a formal annotated
bibliography, it's a note-taking technique that can be very useful in keeping your
sources straight. Here's an example of one brief annotation on the source in my
in-progress Works Cited page.

                                                                    167
As I skim Palmer's book and search for mentions of rattlesnakes being deadly or
not, I notice one part where he talks about how frightened people are of
rattlesnakes but how that fear has very little basis in reality. Since this statement
can support my point, I copy the sentence into my paper and surround it with
quotation marks and note the page number (93).

                                                            Screenshot of Palmer's e-book

Because Palmer's book is fairly anecdotal, I look for more objective information
on venomous snakes and find the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website's
workplace guidelines. After reading it closely, I decide that it makes some
relevant points, and I highlight a key sentence that I may want to quote.

                                                                    168
                                    Screenshot of the CDC Website's article on Venomous snakes

I found this source online rather than through any library database, so it'll be up
to me to construct the citation on the source list. To guide my formatting, I follow
the general template of all MLA source list citations. Here's the general template:

                 Author's Last Name, Author's First Name (or committee
                       within organization). "Title, if article or other work
                       in larger publication." Title of container of article/
                       shorter work or self-contained, if book, Other
                       contributors (translators or editors), Version
                       (edition), Number (vol. and/or no.), Publisher,
                       Publication Date, Location (pages, paragraphs and/or
                       URL, DOI or permalink). Second container's title, Other
                       contributors, Version, Number, Publisher, Publication
                       date, Location, Date of Access (if applicable).

In MLA style, you include only the information that you already have rather than
writing "anonymous" or "N/A," as some other styles might do. This source, like
many organizational and government websites, has no author listed, so, as the
style dictates, I use the committee within the organization as the author. I search
for as much of the other information I can find on the CDC website, looking
particularly at the bottom and top of pages and come up with the following,
which I place in my Works Cited list.

                 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
                       "Venomous Snakes." Centers for Disease Control, 2021,

                                                                    169
                       https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/default.html,
                       18 July 2023.
While it's often perfectly fine to use "citation generators" like the ones on
NoodleTools, Grammarly, Citation Machine, or the built-in citation generators in
Word or Google Docs, I prefer to generate citations myself to familiarize myself
with the source and make sure that I don't miss anything. For instance, it draws
my own attention to the date the source was written or updated, something that
will be important in evaluating my sources. Doing citations myself also makes me
look more closely at patterns in my Works Cited and question my research
techniques: Am I using (too) many articles from websites? Am I citing authors
with a diversity of experiences and opinions?
My advice is that even if you do use any of the automatic generators, just make
sure to always double-check the results for accuracy. Many automatic generators
can miss details, and it's easy to cite a source incorrectly if you accidentally
select the wrong format (such as citing a book as an article) or citation style.
Getting back to my essay, I look for statistics from a reputable peer-reviewed
source to complement my research, and I find a source entitled "Rattle Snake
Toxicity" on the library databases. Like the catalog entry for books, the library
database has its own built-in tool to cite this pamphlet, which I use to copy into
my growing source list.

                                       Screenshot of a citation generator via KU Library Website

                                                                    170
For this fairly short pamphlet, I read it through to take notes and make sure I
understand what it's saying, and, in doing so, I find statistics that correspond
with the point that I want to make about the deadliness of rattlesnakes in the
US.

                                                       Article footnote highlight screenshot

After I read this section of the article in which I'm interested, I notice a "[3]"
written at the end of that paragraph, and I click on it to see what it is:

                                                            "[3]" highlight link screenshot

                                                                    171
It turns out that this is a reference to another source, an article entitled,
"Snakebite Injuries Treated in the United States Emergency Departments,
2001-2004" by O'Neil, Mack, Gilchrist, and Wozniak. I try to find this source
myself, but, unfortunately, it's not in the library databases or online, though it
seems to have been cited in many other places and treated as a reputable study.

Because it's also important to give credit to the original researcher who
generated the statistics, if I want to use it, I'll have to cite it as an indirect
source or a source that I use only secondhand. I can give credit to the original
source as well as the source that cites it by mentioning both in my in-text
citation like this: (O'Neil et al. as cited in Patel et al.). Here, I use "as cited in" to
indicate a paraphrase, whereas if it were a quotation, I should say "qtd. in" if
using MLA style. The abbreviation "et al." just means "and all" and it is used
when there are three or more authors. While it is best to try to find the original
source myself, sometimes it's not possible to do so, but it's still important to give
the fullest accounting of the source material that you can provide.

Activity 10.10: Cite a Peer-Reviewed Article

Find an in-text citation in a peer-reviewed scholarly article and then find
its full citation in the source list. Use information from that citation,
particularly the author(s) and title, to try to find that source using the
library databases and Google. If you can find it, see if you can pinpoint
the exact location in the source that the article refers to. Does the
scholarly article represent its source with accuracy? Are there any
surprises?

You'll notice that all three of the sources above deal with snakes but don't deal
with snakes in summer camps. In fact, there's very little online about this exact
topic and no whole books written about it. However, that's a very good thing-my
paper is more likely to contribute something original this way. Instead of
searching for sources that just say what I want to say, which is often a recipe for
derivative work that can cross the line to plagiarism, I'm searching for sources
that demonstrate points I'd like to make as tiny parts of my argument. It's up to
me to explain what these facts have to do with my thesis. After I read and think
about my sources and my argument as a whole, I come up with the following
paragraph in my rough draft.

                                                                    172
                          Sample Paper Screenshot (Access the full text of the Sample Paper online)

To make sure that I include the right information in my in-text citations, all I
need to do is look at my alphabetized Works Cited page. In MLA, APA, and CMS
styles, the in-text citations correspond with the source list citation by including
the first word or phrase of the source list citation. Most often, this word is the
author's last name, but it could also be the article title for works without known
authors or the organization responsible, as in my article on the CDC website. The
purpose behind including the first word or phrase in the source list citation is so
any reader of my essay can easily find the rest of the information about my
source by looking it up by alphabetical order in the source list.

Writing To Make YOUR Ideas Shine

In all the citation and attribution methods outlined above, you'll notice that they
only work for fairly short passages. Quotations should be used as support,
providing examples or demonstrations of ideas that you would like to discuss.
Even when using a "long" quotation, you should keep the material quoted to a
minimum to balance it with context, analysis, description, synthesis, and
discussion. Paraphrase should also always be followed by your connections to
your own ideas, arguments, or other sources constructed in an original manner.

                                                                    173
In a nutshell, sources should be used to supplement and bolster your writing
rather than replace it.
The bottom line here is that most academic contexts expect YOUR original ideas
to be at the forefront of your composition. Even when the topic is something
unfamiliar to you and your writing centers around summarizing other people's
research and ideas, or is supposed to deal with wholly factual material, you are
expected to write wholly original work in structure, phrasing, and selection of
sources and examples.
Frankly, it's really hard to do this. Most times, undergraduate students are put
into situations where they must write a paper about something they aren't an
expert in and must cite source material from experts who know much more than
they do! In these cases, it's natural to want to over rely on source material by
giving lengthy quotations and paragraph-long summaries, using the structure of
ideas from a single source, or paraphrasing long passages or chapters. However,
I want you to fight this urge.
Why?
Because grappling with finding your own phrasing (even if it's inelegant), your
own examples (even if they aren't ideal), and your own ideas (even if you are
still figuring them out) is what composition is all about. It's a messy, beautiful,
difficult, annoying, and often rewarding experience.

                                                                    174
Afterword: Writing for and Beyond KU

Throughout the previous chapters, we've reviewed how to make use of campus
resources such as the writing center and library, how to identify and write for the
rhetorical situation, how to follow conventions in narrative and argument, how to
hone your writing style, how to engage with the revision process, and how to
acknowledge source material. Throughout all of this, there's one thing that draws
all of this together: community.

We are always writing to or for our writing community. This community might be
extremely small and consist only of yourself and possibly one other person. Or
you might aim to reach hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of other people
with your writing. The skills that you build in composition courses will help you to
better reach that audience, whether you are writing a job application letter, a
research essay, a poem, a newsletter, or a business proposal.

Regardless of the audience you are writing for, you are also writing with a
community. Composition at Kutztown University is a general education course
that connects our student body, so you might find yourself comparing notes with
others on your shared or diverse experiences in taking composition. The
resources of the library, the writing center, the composition program, and more
exist to support you so that you aren't alone when writing gets tough. And your
professors--who all have to write research themselves--know firsthand how
challenging writing can be. Professors are there to support you in your journey to
develop your voice as a writer in your composition courses.

But let's say you want to become more engaged in our community of composition
at Kutztown University. One way to do this is to attend or present at our annual
Kutztown University Composition Conference (KUCC). Held every Spring, the
KUCC invites Kutztown University students in all composition and writing courses
to submit their work. Students will then present their work at our friendly,
welcoming conference. Sharing work in such a way will ensure that your writing
reaches a larger audience, will help you hone your presentation skills, and will
give you a valuable entry on your resume for graduate schools and future
careers. Students in both Fall and Spring semesters of composition or writing
courses are welcome to participate.

Another form of participation in our community is publication. Kutztown
University has many publication outlets specifically for our students including
Keystone Newspaper, The Shoofly literary magazine and poetry readings,
HerCampus new media brand, and Essence fine arts and literary magazine.

                                                                    175
Finally, you might decide to develop your skills in writing and composition even
further by taking another course in Professional Writing or English, or earning a
certificate, minor, or major degree program.
Regardless whether your engagement in Kutztown University's composition
community is just beginning or will soon conclude, the process of developing
your skills and voice as a writer is ongoing. See you on the trail.

"-But I Can't Say This to my Husband"

"My husband will give me this Christmas, as he does every year some lovely and
very useless trinket. He likes to be extravagant and a little foolish in his gift to
me. He feels that way about me. But sometimes I wish--how can I say it? He
wants so much to please me--only, like other men, he just a bit unseeing. To him
I'm still the girl he married. Young and strong and radiant with health. He doesn't
know--no one but the woman who cares for a home can know--how much of that
youth and strength and health can slip from one under the burden of cleaning
duties just a little heavier than they need be. Yet how can I suggest the gift I
really want? He would only laugh at me. Tell me that Christmas is no time for
such a sensible purchase. That I must have something for myself. If only he
could see that what I want is for myself. More for myself than any pretty trinket.
That it means the very preservation of those things about which he care so
much. My youth. Freshness. That sparkle which is unwearied health. I can't say
this to my husband. But I can say it to other husbands like mine: Why not give
her this year what she really wants? A Hoover." There is an illustration of a
vacuum at the bottom of the page along with the tagline "Give her a Hoover and
you give her the best."

Sue Czerny Introducing the Library Search
Homepage Transcript

This podcast is designed to serve as an introduction to the resources on the
library website at Kutztown University. Today we're going to talk about the
"Search Everything" search engine on the Rohrbach Library site. We are also
going to talk about the difference between research databases and public
databases, and we are going to take a look at keywords: what they are, how to
find them, and why you should use them.

Let's start at the library homepage, which is library dot Kutztown dot edu, and
you can see here that at the top the library homepage defaults to "Search
Everything." This is a search engine that takes the more than 100 databases that
you have access to as a student here It allows you to see how much information
is actually on the library website about whatever topic you are considering for
your research.

So why use the library website? The library website and the databases and the
material that you will find here are all copyrighted, licensed, and fact-checked so
that you know that the information is good information that you can use. If you
would use a public search engine like Google or Bing, that simply goes out to the
Internet and pulls in all kinds of resources but really has no way of checking to
see if the resources are truthful or good research.

We are going to go to the "Search Everything" search engine and this the search
I'm going to use today is video games and feminism. Now you can certainly use
the search box here but I'm going to show you the advanced search. This is a
little bit nicer to use because it allows you to put the filters in right away and it
saves you a step, so up here on the advanced search under search everything
you can see search articles, books, journals, and more. A second characteristic of
research databases as opposed to public databases is that research databases
are not going to correct spelling errors. Oh, I'm just going to do a quick
misspelling here to show you what I mean. I'm going to put in video games and
"feminsm" and if I search you're going to see I only get seven results now. And
when if something like this happens to you the first thing you want to do is check
your spelling. Oh, I'm now doing video games and feminism, and I'm going to
search that over again, and now I have 115,000. So, that's better than what I
had--seems to be more the type of search I thought I would get.

Also, you'll notice that I put in when we'll go back a screen and I didn't put in a
sentence. This is the third characteristic of a research database. The first

                                                                    183
characteristic is all the information is copyrighted and licensed. The second one is
spelling, and the third one to remember is that you use keywords. You don't use
sentences. In Google and Bing you can put in an entire sentence--I could have I
would have put in the sentence I need resources on video games and feminism; I
would have gotten a similar search in a research database. They just want
keywords.

Keywords are the nouns and adjectives in that sentence so that if you write
down the sentence, or you think of the sentence that you would put in Google.
And then only pull out the important nouns and adjectives or the phrases, so that
here we have an adjective and a noun and it combines as a phrase, and here we
just have a single word. And, put one concept in each box. Then, you can do
your search. A research database doesn't want a whole sentence; it just messes
everything up. So, we can do "video games" and "feminism"; here at the top
we'll put in our keywords, and then I'm going to go down. And, sometimes your
professors will say they only want academic peer-reviewed journals; this has to
do with the editorial process that the article went through. For this one, I'm
going to leave that; you can check that off if you want. I'm going to leave it
blank because I also want to have magazine articles and newspaper articles and
along there with journals. I am going to check full text. Full text is the librarian
jargon for "only show me results where the article is already there in the
database."

A parameter that is very helpful is published date. This is a really good way to
narrow down a subject a lot of times, and get your searches smaller so that you
don't have to go through things that aren't relevant. So, here you can do publish
date and now the first four here are the most often used ones you can also have
a custom range here for example. Maybe you only want to do video games in
feminism from 2000 to 2009; you could do that that way. I'm just going to pick
the past five years and then I'm going to scroll back up. And so now we have a
search on video games and feminism where I get where all the articles should
already be there and it's in the last five years.

So, this is the page. This is our result list and from here we can go, begin to go
through, and start to look for things that we can use in our projects.

If you have any questions or you're having problems with any of your searches,
remember that you can always go to the library homepage, and there's a little
chat button down here in the lower righthand corner and that will get you to a
librarian. Thank you very much, and good luck with your projects!
