Introduction

ABOUT THIS BOOK
BY XTINE BURROUGHS AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

This book was written by two artists who also happen to be educators teaching studio foundation classes in digital
art and design. While teaching classes that meet in software laboratories, we noticed that many of our students
expected to learn software but gave little consideration to aesthetics of history. A typical first day question might
be, "Are we going to learn Photoshop® in this class?" At first we were tempted to oblige our students' thirst
for so-called practical knowledge, but we recognize that in the absence of the visual, theoretical, and historical
frameworks practical knowledge is practically useless. To teach our classes we used the very best of the software
training manuals, and supplemented them with all the visual and historical material that was missing. We have
tired of fighting against these books as we attempted to reframe the technical learning inside of visual principles
and historical examples. After settling on a book that doesn't really encapsulate a class for years, we finally decided
to write the book that we think all introductory media design students should be using. For us a student anyone
learning, whether traditional and working towards a degree in art, communication, graphic design, illustration, and
so on, or if she is a self-taught found-it-on-the-bookstore-shelf learner. In the twenty chapters that follow, we have
created small bites of history, followed by visual references, and then digital exercises that explore the Adobe®
Creative Suite in a manner that extends learning design principles to the realm of the software demonstration.

BAUHAUS

One way to think of this book is a mashup of the Bauhaus Basic Course and the Adobe® Creative Cloud®. We
are taking the visual principles and exercises from the Bauhaus Basic Course and teaching them in the Adobe®
Creative Cloud®. The Bauhaus was an influential art, design and architectural school in Germany. It operated from
1919 to 1933, during which time it transformed art education, through its integration of art, craft, architecture and
design, its emphasis on modern materials, and the creation of the Basic Course. The Basic Course was a year long
course in which first year students learned composition, color theory, and how to use a variety of basic materials.
When many of the instructors fled Nazi Germany, arriving in the United States and other countries, they brought
this education model with them in the guise of the Studio Foundation course. This book takes its inspiration
from the Bauhaus model, transforming those traditional lessons into the digital exercises in the Adobe® Creative
Cloud®.

OPERATING SYSTEMS & VERSION NUMBERS

From the authors:

This book is written around the core principles of the Adobe® Creative Cloud® design applications. The latest
bells and whistles are not that important, and frankly, they are usually a marketing tool. What matters are the

                                                                                                              1
2  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

core principles that do not change from version to version, or operating system to operating system. While we
initially wrote this book using Adobe® Creative Suite® 3 on Mac OS 10.5, and have subsequently updated it first
to Adobe® Creative Suite® 4, and most recently to Adobe® Creative Suite® 6*, we have written it to be version
independent. We expect that this book will still be just as useful if you were using Adobe® Creative Suite® 2 on
Windows XP, Photoshop® 7 on Mac OS 9, or future versions of the software that will be released in the years to
come.

*Note: All content and exercises have been updated to use with Adobe® Creative Cloud® 2017.

MAC or PC?

Within this book we refer to all shortcuts using the MacOS protocol. If you are using this book with Windows,
simply translate the Command key (or CMD) to the Control key (CTR) on your keypad and the Option key (OPT) to
the Alt key (ALT). Everything else remains the same.

METAPHOR

Computer software interfaces are built on metaphors. These metaphors link the digital interface to real life tools
and processes.

An operating system is software that we use to operate the computer. The operating systems we encounter most
often are Mac OS, Windows, or Linux. These operating systems use graphical interfaces to enable us to create,
move, and delete files, and use other software to edit the contents of those files.

Regardless of the operating system you are using, most share a few central metaphors such as document, folder,
file system, and desktop. Before today's so-called "paperless office," office workers created documents on paper,
filed them in folders, and organized the folders in cabinets near their desks. The most important or current project
folders might have been sitting on their desktops. Of course the original paper system persists alongside the
computerized system, as well as in the computer's metaphorical structure.

If the operating system is like your home office, design software is like your studio. The metaphors of design
software are built around the tools of the artist and designer: pencils, brushes, palettes, artboards, and
6                                                                   XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

photographic equipment. These tools do what you would expect: pencils make hard-edged lines, brushes make
hard and soft-edged areas of color, colors are mixed in the Color panel.

Dreamweaver panel. The panels are located to the right of your workspace.

Flash panel. Panel choices will depend on your Workspace setting.

These metaphors are consistent across the graphical interfaces of operating systems and design applications. For
example, the panels and the tools look and behave in the same way -- despite subtle application differences
-- in Adobe's Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Dreamweaver, and Flash. Learning the metaphors and similarities
among these application interfaces will be one of the fastest routes to mastering the tools.

CREATE A NEW FOLDER

       1. To create a new folder on your computer, navigate to the place where you want your new folder to
            reside (for instance, the Desktop), and from the menu, choose File > New Folder. Most computer users
            typically store folders in the Documents folder or on the Desktop or in a designated folder on their
            Desktop. As soon as you create a new folder, the operating system temporarily names it untitled folder.
            As long as you do not click outside of the folder name, the name area remains highlighted in blue, and is
            ready for you to type a new name. We named ours digital_foundations and pressed the Return key.

         From the menu, choose File > New Folder

    2. If you clicked somewhere on the Desktop after creating the new folder, it may seem like you are stuck
        with a folder named `'untitled folder''. All folders can be renamed. To rename a folder, click once on the
        folder to select it, pause, and then either click on the name of the folder or press Return. Once the name
        is highlighted, you can type on top of the original name to replace it. We renamed our folder
        digital_foundations.

New untitled folder                  Select the folder, pause and click on it again

Name/rename the folder by typing it  Hit your return (enter) key to have your change
in the name space                    accepted

3. Move the new digital_foundations folder you just created to the Documents folder by clicking and
    dragging it from the Desktop into the Documents folder. To open the `Finder' window click on any clear
    area of your desktop. Notice the menu bar at the top of the screen will change to Finder. The Finder is
    the default file manager and graphical user interface shell used on all Macintosh operating systems. It is
    what allows you to manage files, applications and drives.
14  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Move your folder to the Documents folder

        DELETE A FILE

    4. Next we will review three ways to delete a file or folder. Choose one method and delete the new folder
        you just created. The metaphorical trash or recycle bin appears in most computer operating systems. To
        delete a document in Mac OS, drag it onto the Trash icon on the Dock.
1.1 EXERCISE 1: WORKING WITH FILES AND FOLDERS  15

There are three ways to delete a file or folder.
Another way to move an item to the trash is by selecting the item and pressing Command+Delete. The
Command (, ) keys are located directly to the left and right of the spacebar. They are used in most
keyboard shortcuts in Mac OS, much like the Control key is used in Windows.
Contextual menus provide yet another way to delete a file. The contextual menus appear by right-clicking
the mouse. If your mouse has only one button, Control+click accesses the contextual menu. Contextual
menu options change depending on the context in which you click. If you right-click on a folder, you will
see a list of actions that can be performed on that folder. This menu is different from the menu that would
appear if you right-clicked on a file instead. To delete an item using the contextual menu, right-click on
the file and select Move to Trash from the contextual menu.

It is important to remember that there is almost always more than one way to complete any given task. The best
method is usually the one that fits most efficiently within your personal work habits.

Files: vector vs. bitmapComputer graphics are created in one of two formats: vector and or bitmap.
Computer files containing these graphics may contain vectors, bitmaps, or both, as we will explore in
chapters 6 and 11.
Vector graphics are created by using mathematical algorithms: formulas that describe where points, lines,
and planes exist and how these elements relate to one another. Vector graphics can be scaled up to any
size and retain their smooth edges. Vector graphics look smooth and crisp at their edges, and they can be
16  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    easily scaled to any size. Logos are nearly always developed as vector graphics, as a logo has to fit easily
    on a business card, a website, and possibly a billboard or bus wrapping.

    Illustrator® is the application most often used to create and modify vector images.

    Bitmap or raster graphics are built from grids of pixels. Each tiny pixel contains a unit of color information.
    Bitmaps are used for digital photography and scanned images. Bitmap files are not as easily scalable as
    vector graphics.

    Bitmap or raster graphics are built from grids of pixels. Each tiny pixel contains a unit of color information. Bitmaps are
    used for digital photography and scanned images. Bitmap files are not as easily scalable as vector graphics.

    In the top and bottom images we "zoomed in" on the same logo to 700%. This means we are viewing
    the images at 7 times their actual sizes. If you enlarge a raster image too much, the pixel grid becomes
    visible to the human eye. The only possible compensation is to blur the edges. Either way, enlarging a
    pixel-based image results in loss of quality. Vector images don't have this limitation. On the other hand,
    extremely complex vector images take an excessive amount of computer processing power. The top
    image is a raster; it is easy to see the individual pixels that comprise the digital logo as tiny squares of
    color. In the bottom image, the logo has been created in the vector-based application, Illustrator®. Notice
    that the edges of the lines, letters and figure are still rendered as smooth lines.
1.2 Exercise 2: Creating a new file in Adobe Illustrator

LAUNCH THE APPLICATION
       1. In Mac OS, move the mouse to the bottom of the screen so that it appears over the dock. The dock
            displays icons that are buttons which launch various applications in one click. Click on the Illustrator®
            icon once and the application will open. If the icon is not in the dock, you can find the application in
            Macintosh HD/ Applications / Adobe Illustrator or Finder > Menu > Go >Applications >Adobe Illustrator.
            In Windows OS it is in Start > Programs > Adobe > Adobe Illustrator CC.

             The dock may be on the left, right, or bottom of the screen, and it may be hiding. Move the cursor to the edge of the screen
             and it will appear. To change the Dock settings, choose the Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Dock.
            DEFINE A NEW FILE
       2. Open Adobe® Illustrator®. To create a new document click File > New.
            When defining a new file, several settings must be taken into consideration. When you choose a new
            print document (as opposed, say, a new video document), Illustrator® loads some of the default settings
            -- file resolution, document sizes, and so on -- appropriate to that particular type of file. In the New
            Document dialog box, choose Letter from the Size pull-down menu. Letter (8.5 by 11 inches) is a
            common document size for print media. When we chose a new print document, the Size pull-down
            menu loaded standard sizes for the medium. If we selected a Web profile, the Size pull-down menu
            would have loaded standard settings for web design. Click OK.

             A dialog box is an interface that pops up when the computer needs information in order to complete a task. To

                                                                                                             17

         highlight the metaphor, the computer needs to have a conversation with you, hence the word "dialog." For instance
         the software needs specific information before creating a new document, such as the size, units, etc. Keep in mind
         that the dialog box asks questions that must be answered by clicking "OK" or "Cancel" before continuing work on the
         document.

        THE BLANK PAGE AND YOUR TOOLS

        Look around your new document and notice the interface elements. In the center is an Artboard. Analog
        layouts were created inside the area defined by cropmarks drawn on a board, which was referred to
        as the Artboard. Illustrator® reproduces the analog experience through metaphor. On the left side of
        the document area is the Tools panel. Like an artist's or designer's toolbox, the Tools panel holds pens,
        pencils, brushes, shape tools, and so on.

        On the right are more panels. Take notice of the Color panel. Painters mix together individual paint colors
        on a palette. In Illustrator®, as in the other Adobe® Creative Cloud® applications, you create colors by
        virtually mixing colors in a panel (read more about this in Chapter 5). The tools and panel can be moved
        around the screen, and they can be hidden or shown based on the amount of workspace on the monitor.
    3. Show the Layers panel by clicking Window > Layers, then hide the Layers panel by pressing the layers
        icon on the right side toolbar. Alternately, any panel can be shown or hidden by selecting its name from
        the Window menu.
        After quitting and then re-opening a program, panels will assume the same locations as when the
        application was last closed. This can be a time-saver on a personal computer, but it can be an annoyance
        in a classroom or lab when the previous user's custom panel configuration appears confusing. Most
        applications have basic or default workspaces. Reset the workspace layout in Illustrator® by clicking
        Window > Workspace > [Essential] or by using the pull-down menu on the Application bar. Before starting
        each of the exercises, set the workspace to the essential or basic settings so that your set-up is consistent
        with the settings we used while writing this book.
1.3 Exercise 3: Creating a dynamic composition

The Poet, 1911, Egon Schiele, oil on canvas. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egon_Schiele_009.jpg
Compositions can be static or dynamic. In this exercise, we will recreate the dynamic movement found within a
painting. Dynamic compositions are full of energy or movement. Angles are used to create motion. While a flat
horizon line is at rest, a triangle is in motion. The repetition of even spacing is easy on the eye, as our minds predict
the simple rhythm of an evenly spaced grid. Angles and uneven spacing between objects causes our eyes to move
back and forth. This physical movement translates into the perception of movement within a composition. Use
the Schiele painting as the guideline for your dynamic composition with rectangles. The final composition could
be like this image, if yours is based on the Schiele painting:

                                                                                                             19

Example of a completed image. Use your own color palette!

       1. In Illustrator®, click on the Rectangle tool from the Tools panel. Click and drag to draw a rectangle on
            the page.

       2. Once the rectangle is created, release the mouse and click on the Selection tool. Objects can only be
            modified when they are selected. The Selection tool is used to select an object in order to move, scale, or
            copy it. Click on the rectangle with the Selection tool. Notice that the selected rectangle has square
            anchor points on each corner and at the midpoint of each line. These anchor points are essential
            components of the vector art. They determine the contours of the shape by their position in relationship
            to each other. A rectangle is described by a path that turns at right angles through four anchor points to
            create four sides and meet itself to close the shape. To deselect the object, click on the Artboard in any
            area outside of the rectangle.
1.3 EXERCISE 3: CREATING A DYNAMIC COMPOSITION  21

     Notice that a tool tip shows up when the mouse hovers over a tool. The tool tip displays the name of the tool and the
     keyboard shortcut. This is true in most graphics applications.

3. With the rectangle selected, notice how the shape is made. The rectangle is an area filled with color and
    there may or may not be a line surrounding the edges. The interior color is called the fill. The outline is
    called the stroke. White and black are the default color settings for fill and stroke.

4. Look at the bottom of the Tools panel and notice what color is loaded in the Fill icon and what color is
    loaded into the Stroke icon. The Fill and Stroke icons stack with the active target on the top. To change
    the fill, it needs to be the top icon.

     The fill and stroke tool are located at the bottom of the Tools panel

5. While the rectangle is still selected, click once on the fill icon to reposition it on top of the stroke.
6. Click on the Swatches panel, then click on any color. It is assigned to the fill area of the rectangle and it

    also appears as the color in the fill icon. The rectangle will change because it was selected before a new
    color was applied.
22  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Close up of the Workspace and the Color Panel
    7. Click on the Stroke icon to position it on top of fill.

         Click on Stroke Icon then click on the "None" icon.
    8. Click on the "None" icon. This symbol, beneath the fill and stroke icons, is a white square with a red

        diagonal line. Clicking this will remove the stroke from the rectangle.
    9. With the Selection tool, scale or rotate the rectangle. Scale the rectangle by clicking on an anchor point

        and dragging toward or away from its center.
1.3 EXERCISE 3: CREATING A DYNAMIC COMPOSITION                                                                          23

Using the Selection tool by clicking on an anchor point

To rotate the rectangle, position the Selection tool just outside one of the four anchor points at the
corners. Don't click yet. Notice that the cursor changes from the usual Selection tool icon (straight, black
arrow) to a curved arrow. The curved arrow indicates that you can rotate the selection. When you see the
curved arrow, click and drag outside of the rectangle to the right or left in order to rotate the rectangle.

       Shapes can also be rotated via the Object > Transform > Rotate menu or with the Rotate Tool in the Tools panel.

10. When the first rectangle is complete (with the color, scale, and rotation of your choosing), deselect the
      rectangle by clicking on the Artboard. Notice that the anchor points are no longer highlighted.
24                                                  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    11. Use the Rectangle tool to begin the process again. Once a rectangle is made and modified, use the
          Selection tool to reposition it to the right, left, or on top of the other rectangle. Recreate the composition
          with up to 15 shapes. You should feel comfortable creating a shape and changing its fill and stroke
          colors.

    12. Arrange the rectangles so that they can be seen as one dynamic composition. Notice that as you create
          and position each rectangle, they appear stacked on top of each other. While you are creating this
          composition you may want a rectangle to be "sent behind" another rectangle. Select the top rectangle
          with the Selection tool, then click Object > Arrange > Send Backward.

    13. Shapes such as your rectangles can be sent backward repeatedly, or brought forward. Find these
          commands in Object > Arrange. Any art object can be positioned using these menu items. Finally, while
          art objects are sent backward or brought forward one at a time (through as many levels of stacking
          order as there are objects), they can also be sent all the way to the back of the composition or brought
          all the way to the front of the composition using Object > Arrange.In this image, a large black rectangle
          was sent all the way to the back of the composition after most of the dynamic composition was already
          made.

            Be sure to save your files!
1.4 Exercise 4: Saving a file

Click File > Save As to open the Save dialog box. Choose a location in which to save your file. It is common to save
files in the Documents folder. On a Mac, this is located in Macintosh HD/Users/Your_User_Name/Documents, and
can be found on the left side of the Save dialog box. On Windows Vista, this is located at Start > My Documents.
For this exercise name your file ch1-yourlastname-dynamiccomp.ai.

Using "Save As" to save your file.
All actions that can be performed on your file are located in the File menu.

                                                                                                             29
30                                                  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

You must name your file when you save it. Follow these naming conventions:

        · Avoid spaces. Instead, use_underscores_to_separate_words. Spaces are dangerous in web browsers. Any
            designer who plans to work with interactive media should form good habits by eliminating spaces from
            their file names.

        · Use lowercase letters. This is also a convention of designers who name files that will be referenced in
            code. Spaces and uppercase letters will not damage your files, but if you are just beginning to form good
            habits, you might as well learn all of the rules at once.

        · Never use characters such as those in the list below, as these reserved characters mean special things to
            applications and operating systems and can disable websites and crash applications.

The following are examples of reserved characters:
! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = ~ [ ] ' " ? / \ , : ; > <

        · Use a descriptive title, such as ch1-lastname-dynamiccomp.ai
            [ex: ch1-keene-dynamiccomp.ai]

        · Including your full name in a file name is especially important if you are submitting a file in a classroom
            or professional setting.

        · Make sure the file includes an extension. In this exercise, the file is saved as a an Illustrator® (.ai)
            document. The extension is .ai. In other words, the very worst file name that you could use is something
            like this: "My *best* ever/first file!" Not only does the name include spaces and reserved characters, it
            also fails to describe the file or format. Other bad names include the likes of "FINAL edit.ai," "final.ai,"
            "composition.ai," and other names that do not specify who made the file, or what is in the file. A better
            model for naming your files includes your individual or group name, a descriptive word about the
            contents of the file, and a date or versioning system. For example, when we sent a copy of our cover to
            the publisher on October 20th, we named it digitalfoundations_cover_1020.ai.

NATIVE FILE FORMAT FOR MASTER FILES

Most applications have a native file format for master files. This format can only be opened in the original
program, and should be saved frequently throughout the working process. A copy of a master file is often created
in a compressed, non-editable format when the author has finished editing the work. Compressing the file makes
it smaller and easier to transfer. These compressed formats are readable by many applications, not just the
original program. A .ai suffix indicates the file is an Illustrator® master file. If a logo, for example, was created in
Adobe® Illustrator®, it could be shared with a friend or collaborator as a PDF file, which is viewable in Adobe®
Acrobat® or Preview. These applications are installed on most computers. The exported files cannot be edited
and are usually much smaller in file size. If the friend asks for revisions on the logo, the original AI file would be
modified. After modification, a new PDF file would be saved and sent to the friend.
1.4 EXERCISE 4: SAVING A FILE  31

Key Command: Command+W closes windows in any application and on the Desktop.

CLOSING AND QUITTING
To close a file in Illustrator®, click the red button in the upper left corner of the window, click File > Close, or press
Command+W. Quit the application by clicking Illustrator® > Quit or by using the keyboard shortcut Command+Q.
It is very important that file extensions, or suffixes, remain intact. The extension assists the computer operating
system. It tells the system the type of file and the application to use when opening the file. This is especially
important when bringing a file from one operating system to another (such as going from a Mac to a PC).

SOME IMPORTANT FILE FORMATS INCLUDE:
.doc or .docx - Microsoft Word document
.rtf - Rich Text Format, non-proprietary word processing format
.txt - Text only, no formatting
.ai - Adobe® Illustrator® file
.pdf - Portable Document Format
.psd - Photoshop® document
.tif or .tiff - Tagged Image File - format for photographs, saved with lossless compression and used for scanning and printing.
This format will be revisited in Chapter 7.
.jpg or .jpeg - Joint Photographic Experts Group - a compressed image file format often used for photographs on the web
.gif - Graphic Interchange Format - a compressed image file format often used on the web for logos, design elements, and
other graphics with low numbers of colors.
.png - Portable Network Graphics (PNG /p/) is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG
was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the most used lossless
image compression format on the Internet. [source: Wikipedia]
.html - HyperText Markup Language - a text file written in the language used to create web pages.

       2. Type the word "Bauhaus" into the search field and click the Search Images button. The search engine will

            return all images related to the word "Bauhaus." The Bauhaus was a revolutionary arts and design
            school that operated in Germany from 1919 to 1933. The Bauhaus defined arts education for the 20th
            Century and beyond. You will learn more about the Bauhaus throughout this book.

    4. Expect errors! Nearly every search result produces errors. Sometimes errors follow a pattern that can be

        identified and excluded from the search query.
    5. Results can be limited by searching for a specific phrase. To search by a phrase, enclose the words in

        quotes. Do a search for "Bauhaus Dessau." Make sure to reset your image size to "All Image Sizes." Your
        results should include images of the Bauhaus Dessau. Dessau, Germany was the location of the
        Bauhaus from 1925-1932.

2.2 Exercise 2: Searching in the public domain

Just because you can download an image doesn't mean you can use it! An image may be protected by copyright
laws. Similar to a patent, a copyright is a legal tool for preserving control over the use of a creative work. Books,
poems, music recordings and compositions, photographs, paintings, sculptures, radio and television broadcasts,
films and even dances can be copyrighted. The Artist Formerly Known As Prince even has his symbolic name, "Love
Symbol #2" protected by copyright law.

Prince's Love Symbol #2
England initiated the copyright laws familiar to today's citizens as the Statute of Anne (1709). By the 1700s, the
widespread use of the printing press and an increase in literacy rates resulted in printers commonly reprinting
texts without crediting their rightful authors, or paying them. The Statute of Anne gave the author the exclusive
right to a work for a fixed period of time.
Copyright durations vary by nation. In the United States the length of a copyright used to be the life of an author
plus 50 years; on the 50th year after the death of an author, their works would be released into the public domain.
For works created by corporations, the length was 75 years from the date of publication. In 1998 congress passed
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended copyright by 20 years. This law was authored by a
musical-entertainer-turned-Congressman, and was heavily lobbied by the media industry. The act became known
as the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act," as Disney lobbied extensively to insure that the law reached back just far
enough to protect their copyright over Mickey Mouse.
Public Domain images have no licensing restrictions. An image automatically enters the Public Domain when
a copyright expires. Public domain is currently under attack, as media corporations struggle to control their
monopolies. The irony is that copyright was introduced to protect authors from this type of monopolistic power.

                                                                                                             39

An image is protected by copyright unless:
        · the use qualifies as "fair use"
        · the author declares it is part of the public domain
        · the image is old enough that the copyright has expired
        · the author licenses it under an alternative model

Several alternative licensing models exist, the most popular of which is a Creative Commons license. Creative
Commons operates under the moniker "Some rights reserved" and offers a range of licenses with subtle degrees
of control over whether derivative works and for-profit uses are allowed. Wikimedia Commons
(http://commons.wikimedia.org), and Flickr (http://flickr.com/creativecommons) focus partially or exclusively on
public domain or Creative Commons licensed images.

LICENSING YOUR WORK
Licensing work with a Creative Commons (CC) license is easy.
Upon setting a Creative Commons license, the creator of the work decides if both commercial and noncommercial
uses are allowed (some are noncommercial only), if others are allowed to modify the work once it is licensed
(called, "derivative work"), and if derivative works are allowed, whether or not the newly modified work also has to
be licensed with CC (called, "share alike").

Creative Commons licensing features
The types of licenses and a very brief description of each follows. Usually more than one type of licensing is in

use. More information can be found on CreativeCommons.org. All CC licenses state that the original author will be
given credited for her work, in addition to the following details:

                        give the author or licensor the credits (attribution) in the manner specified by these.

      Share-alike (SA)  Licensees may distribute derivative works only under a license identical ("not more restrictive") to the license that governs the
                        original work. (See also copyleft.) Without share-alike, derivative works might be sublicensed with compatible but more restrictive
                        license clauses, e.g. CC BY to CC BY-NC.)

      Non-commercial Licensees may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and make derivative works and remixes based on it only for

FAIR USE AND APPROPRIATION

Fair use

Reproducibility is a principal trait of digital media. Unlike paintings, records, books, videotapes or even
photographs, an exact replica of digital media can be made from the original file. This is true for digital
photographs, Compact Discs (and MP3s), DVDs, and websites. From sampling to mashups, collage to
subvertisements, contemporary artists and content creators use digital files as source material for the derivation
of new works. These works are considered new and original, but they are sometimes built with bits and parts
of copyrighted works. In the digital age, new works are often created when more than one existing work is
recombined in a new way, providing new visual relationships and new ideas.

Fair Use is not piracy! Fair use is legitimate and legal use of copyrighted media, as protected by copyright law. Fair use is free
speech. Fair use is not file sharing.

Copyright content can be used in a new work as long as permission is obtained from the copyright holder, or if
the media use falls into the category of fair use. Under the fair use clause of copyright law, limited copyrighted
material can be used for a "transformative" purpose, such as commenting upon, criticizing or parodying the initial
material. The 4 key factors are

        · the purpose of the derivative work
        · the nature of the original work: was the original mostly factual or creative
        · the amount of original work used
        · the effect that the new work has on the potential or actual market value of the original

Weighing these four factors in a copyright case is not an easy task, which is why judges have been asked to do
so. However, successful commercial media that takes advantage of the fair use clause include Saturday Night Live
skits, The Simpsons cartoons and Weird Al Yankovic songs.

Appropriation

Appropriation is a word that is used by media artists to describe the visual or rhetorical action of taking over the
meaning of something that is already known, by way of visual reference. For example, Andy Warhol appropriated
the Campbell's soup can visual identity to make large, iconic silkscreen prints of the face of Campbell's soup cans.
Warhol's soup cans are a modified version of "the real thing." The visual reference to the original soup can is
important, as the viewer needs this information in order to understand the idea that the reference conveys (your
personal translation of this could be something as simple as a popular American icon to a feeling associated with
comfort food). By transforming not only the size and limited graphic palette for portraying the soup cans, but
also the place where the viewer will encounter them (an art gallery as opposed to the grocery market), Warhol
appropriates the original Campbell's soup cans to create American art that relates to popular culture in its iconic
form. Appropriation falls into the category of fair use.
2.2 EXERCISE 2: SEARCHING IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN  45

Ironically, we do not have copyright permissions to use Warhol's paintings or photographs of Campbell's soup cans in this
book! Try an image search if you're curious about viewing this work.

Fountain, Marcel Duchamp (aka R. Mutt), 1917, ready-made object photographed by Alfred Steiglitz. https://www.flickr.com/photos/
digitalfoundations/2229000129/

Marcel Duchamp was the first artist to appropriate a common object in his art. This challenged the art community
in its definition of what is or is not labeled, "art". His ready-made sculpture was a urinal transformed into a
sculpture because Duchamp signed his pseudonym, R. Mutt on the urinal and submitted it to an art exhibit.
Duchamp believed that when an artist declared an object a work of art, the object truly becomes art. In this act of
appropriation, the everyday object becomes something other than what it once was. In the case of the urinal, the
transformation included the addition of the signature to the porcelain, the change of location (from a bathroom
to a gallery), and the change in purpose (whereas before the urinal entered Duchamp's hands this may have been
untrue, after 1917 no one has used the urinal that R. Mutt has signed for the purpose of waste containment).

2.3 Exercise 3: Searching in stock photography websites

Another source for imagery are stock photography websites such as GettyImages.com or iStockPhoto.com. These
websites are full of photographs and vector graphics to be used in advertising, corporate media, brochures,
campaigns, and other design applications. The advantage of these sites is they seem to have endless search detail.
Here is the iStockphoto image acquired from a search for "writer, table".

Stock photo from iStockPhoto.com. Girl Doing Her Homework. http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/object/
3584537_writing.php?id=3584537
The disadvantage is that the photographs are generic, and have the impersonal feel of an advertisement. No one
ever looks as happy as a model in an advertisement; most people are as physically attractive there is an overall
"generality" to the photographs. This young woman looks nothing like the two of us as we sat at our computers
editing this book on a wiki interface.

No one talks on his cell phone with such a big smile as this man! Stock photographs are staged. These images
should be used carefully, as the level of authenticity of the action within the image is noticeably low. These
licensing for these images is on a limited basis and will vary according to the price you pay.

       1. Go to Getty Images (http://GettyImages.com) and search in Creative Images > View by Collection for an
            image of what you are doing right now. In my case, that is "person typing at computer indoors." You
            might type "person reading book on couch." Try adding specifics like your hair color or the types of
            clothes you are wearing.

       2. Refine your search with their search phrases. Use the Filter and Sort panel to refine the search. Try
            specifying the location and age of the people.

    3. Ask yourself if anyone ever looks quite that content, pensive, or photogenic while reading a book unless
        they are acting for the camera. One strategy for using stock photography is to radically alter the original
        image, either through extreme image adjustments in Adobe® Photoshop®, or by tracing the image in
        Adobe® Illustrator®. As a transformation to the image, this kind of treatment usually results in using the
        image under the clause of fair use. The following image was created from a collection of stock
        photographs. Notice how any photographic information has been modified and abstracted into an
        illustrative form. Remember, most stock images are licensed on a per-use basis and you pay according
        to the licensing you choose.

Symmetry is achieved when the weight of a composition is evenly balanced. Symmetrical forms are perceived
as being stable. In order to achieve symmetry in any composition, the designer must create balance with the
compositional objects in both their positive and negative spaces in relationship to the grid. The positive space
often contains the active design elements while the negative space in a symmetrical composition is usually
passive.
The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry. Asymmetric compositions can be balanced or imbalanced, but the overall
DIGITAL FOUNDATIONS  55

weight distribution between the positive and negative space will be uneven. The negative space in an asymmetric
composition may be more active than the positive space.

The designer chooses to create symmetry or asymmetry within the composition in order to reach the visual or
psychological expectations of her audience. These decisions connect the concept of the presented material to the
presentation. For example, a logo for a bank should feel secure and restful, connoting safety and trustworthiness,
while a horror movie poster should feel emotionally charged, suspenseful and frightful. Logos for banks tend to
be symmetric compositions, and asymmetric designs are used to convey unstable ideas.

This advertisement is symmetric as the scale and lightness of the female figure in the foreground is

counterbalanced by the scale and darkness of the male figure on the right side of the image. The symmetry is
reflected over the y-axis in the center of the composition. The typography is centered at both the top and bottom
portions of the advertisement.

Leonardo da Vinci's classic drawing of the human form demonstrates the principle of symmetry in the human
body.

3.2 Exercise 2: Symmetry with passive negative space

In this exercise, the black circle in the center of the composition is the positive space and the white surrounding
area is the negative space. The negative space is not active, it is dictated by the active positive form. The circle is
evenly distributed within the composition. It is perfectly symmetric in relation to both the x and y axes, from the
left to the right and the top to the bottom.

       1. Open Adobe® Illustrator®. Create a new document in Illustrator® (File > New) using the default settings
            pull-down menu to create a letter size page in RGB color space.Name your document `lastname-
            firstname-symmetry'. When defining a new file, several settings must be taken into consideration. When
            you choose a new print document (as opposed, say, a new video document), Illustrator® loads some of
            the default settings -- file resolution, document sizes, and so on -- appropriate to that particular type of
            file. In the New Document dialog box, choose Letter from the Size pull-down menu. Letter (8.5 by 11
            inches) is a common document size for print media. When we chose a new print document, the Size pull-
            down menu loaded standard sizes for the medium. If we selected a Web profile, the Size pull-down
            menu would have loaded standard settings for web design. For this exercise we will use 1 artboard and
            change our Units of measure to Inches. Click OK.

             Creating a new document in Adobe® Illustrator®
            Now, save your document. Menu bar > File > Save. You do not need to change any of the default settings.
            The default file format is Adobe Illustrator (ai). This is the `native' or original file. Later you will save the file
            as a PDF (Portable Document Format).

                                                                                                             59
60  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    2. Click on the rectangular shape tool (shortcut key M) to create one square that has a white fill and a black
        stroke. Set the fill and stroke colors before drawing the rectangle. The fill and stroke icons are stacked
        on top of each other at the bottom of the Tool Palette (see chapters 1 and 3 for working with the fill and
        stroke). Double-click the icon that is on top and select the color you want to use from the Color Picker.
        Once you set the color for the top icon (fill or stroke), click once on the bottom icon (if you took care of
        fill first, now you will set the color for the stroke) and define this color by using the Color Palette
        (Window > Color Palette).

         Location of the Rectangular Shape tool and Color Picker
    3. With the white fill and black stroke colors defined, hold the shift key while dragging the Rectangle Tool

        on the Artboard. The result is a square instead of a rectangle. Click with the mouse and begin dragging
        before holding the shift key (SHIFT) and release the mouse before letting go of SHIFT. The square we
        made was about 2.5 X 2.5 inches.To size the square first select it, then go to the Control Panel >
        Transform and set the W (width) and H (height) at 2.5 (inches).

         Example of how to size the square by using the Control Panel > Transform functions
    4. While copy and paste are accessible through the Edit menu, we will use the Selection Tool to duplicate

        and position five copies of the square.
3.2 EXERCISE 2: SYMMETRY WITH PASSIVE NEGATIVE SPACE  61

Hot Key: While you are working, CMD (command) is the hot key for the Select Tool.

Choose the Selection Tool and hold the option key (OPT) and click on the original square, then drag the
mouse to the right. In Adobe® Creative Cloud®, Smart Guides are active by default. Smart Guides help
to easily align and center objects with other objects and also the artboard. Hold the shift key to keep the
movements restricted to a 0, 45, 90, or 180 degree motion (in other words, you'll position the new square
along the same baseline or x-axis to the right of the original square)

     Duplicating and moving a square on a horizontal axis.

     Hot Key: The relationship between SHFT and the Select Tool is two-fold: 1. Shift will constrain the proportions of
     objects as you drag to resize a shape or image, and 2. Shift keeps the movement of objects aligned vertically or
     horizontally on the Artboard.

5. Now that you have two squares that are exactly the same, side by side, select both squares at one time
    by marqueeing over them (using your Selection Tool click and drag over both of them beginning on the
    artboard) or by selecting the first square and then holding shift while clicking with the mouse to add the
    second square to the selection. Group the two squares using (Menu bar) Object > Group.

6. Grouped objects can be moved, transformed, and have their colors edited as one unit while their
    individual properties are maintained. In this case, the squares will be copied and positioned together.

7. Copy the two squares two more times, moving down the page.
8. Use the Select Tool to position the squares into place. Be attentive to the space between the margins of

    the page and the space between the outlines of the squares.
62  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    9. Use the Layer Palette (Window > Layers) to lock the squares on Layer 1. Next to the eyeball at the left of
        Layer 1, click on the square illustrated below. A lock icon will appear, indicating that the layer is locked.
        Locked layers cannot be modified until they are unlocked. This is a protective measure that a designer
        often takes when part of a project is complete and she doesn't want to accidentally select or move
        objects that are already established.

           Location of the Toggle Lock on the Layers panel.

    10. Once the layer is locked, create a new layer to work on by clicking the "Create New Layer" icon at the
          bottom of the Layer Palette. Layer 2 will appear above Layer 1. This is the layer that will contain the rest
          of the vector art objects in this chapter. Be sure that it is active (it will be highlighted) before proceeding.

           Creating a new layer from the Layers panel

    11. Create a black circle in the middle of the top left square with the Ellipse Tool. The Ellipse Tool might be
          buried beneath the Rectangle Tool in the Tool Palette, access it by holding a mouse click for a couple of
          seconds on the Rectangle Tool. All of the Shape Tools will be visible. Move the mouse over the Ellipse
          Tool to select it. With this tool, click and drag within the top left square. Hold the shift key once you begin
          dragging the mouse so that the ellipse becomes a perfect circle. Remember to change the color fill to
3.2 EXERCISE 2: SYMMETRY WITH PASSIVE NEGATIVE SPACE          63

black.

Positioning of your black circle is in the top right square.
Be sure to save your files frequently!
3.3 Exercise 3: Symmetry with less passive negative
space

In this exercise, the two new circles create a balanced, symmetric composition. The visual weight is the same in
the four quadrants created by the intersection of the x and y axes; and the circles are reflective over a diagonal
line. However, notice the tension between the two circles at the middle of the page. This tension is created when
the two active forms are so near to each other that the eye cannot help but notice the negative space between
them. The negative space fights for the viewer's attention. Therefore, the negative space is slightly less active than
it was in the first exercise.

       1. Copy the black circle and move it into the second square by using the Select Tool to click and drag on the
            original circle while holding OPT. Drag the new copy into place and release the mouse before releasing
            the key.

             Watch Out For This: If you are new to using the mouse and the keyboard together, practice using your non-mouse
             hand to activate hot-keys while keeping your mouse-hand on the mouse. It is ineffective to lift up the mouse hand!

       2. The new circle should still be selected, and anchor points surround the edges of the selected area. Use
            the Selection Tool to reduce the scale of the circle by clicking and dragging on one of the four anchor
            points at the edges of the circle towards its center. Hold SHIFT while reducing the scale of the circle to
            keep the proportions of the circle the same.

                                                                                                             64
3.3 EXERCISE 3: SYMMETRY WITH LESS PASSIVE NEGATIVE SPACE  65

Results of copying, moving and sizing your circle.

FYI: The units of increment that an object moves when using the arrow keys are defined in the General Preferences
(Illustrator® > Preferences > General). They are referred to as "Keyboard Increments" and the default setting is 0.0139
inches. All preferences are user-defined.

3. Hold down OPT and SHFT and click on the circle with the selection tool, then drag to the bottom right
corner of the square. This will duplicate the circle and move the new square at an exact 45 degree angle.
3.4 Exercise 4: Balanced asymmetry

In this exercise the two circles create an asymmetric composition. The weight distribution between the four
quadrants of the composition is not even, as most of the visual weight is felt in the upper left quadrant. The
composition does remain balanced, as the negative space between the two circles activates the viewer's attention
and becomes part of the visual weight on the page. The white area is still the negative space; however, the white
area between the two circles is within the path of the viewer's eye movement from the top (larger) circle to the
bottom (smaller) circle.

       1. Copy the second circle from the previous exercise and drag it into position in the third square.

              Watch Out: Did your circle turn into an ellipse? Without holding the shift key, the circles transforms into ellipses. Be
             sure to release the mouse before releasing the shift key when drawing forms that are modified by SHFT.

       2. Make another copy of this circle and drag it to the lower right of the composition.

                                                                                                             66

3.5 Exercise 5: Asymmetry with imbalanced visual
weight

In this exercise, the negative space is the white area surrounding the four black circles. The four black circles are
asymmetric in regards to the overall composition. The negative space creates more mass than the positive space,
and the four black circles pull the viewer's eye to the bottom of the composition. What is also noteworthy about
this exercise is that the four black circles are read as a line by the gestalt law of similarity, where like elements
(four circles) are read as a whole line before being perceived individually.

       1. Copy the smaller circle in the fourth rectangle and move it to the empty composition to the right.
       2. Create three copies of the small circle within the composition.

                                                                                                             68
3.5 EXERCISE 5: ASYMMETRY WITH IMBALANCED VISUAL WEIGHT  69

     Results for square 4. Duplicate and aligning circles.
3. Select all four circles using the Selection Tool by marqueeing over them (click and drag over all four,

    beginning on the Artboard) or by selecting the first circle and then holding SHFT while clicking on each
    one time with the mouse to add the remaining circles to the selection.

     In the lab, we call this "shift-clicking". Since we will probably refer to "shift-clicking" in future chapters, this always
     means holding SHFT while clicking on an object in order to add to a selection.

4. With the four circles selected, view the Align Palette (Window > Align). This panel will be used to
    distribute the four small circles evenly. Click the fifth button from the left under the "Distribute Objects"
    part of the Align Palette. Hold the mouse over this icon to see a pop up dialog box that displays,
    "Horizontal Distribute Center".
70  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    Location of the Horizontal Distribute Center on the Align panel.
    If the circles were not duplicated with the SHIFT key activated (to keep their position in order on one line),
    the Align Palette can also be used to align the objects with the button, "Vertical Align Top".

    Watch Out: One time I was demonstrating this and my circles were misbehaving. It turned out I had "Align to
    Artboard" activated within my Align panel. If your distribution seems far off, be sure that this option is not active in
    the bottom section of the Align panel.

    Location of align to Artboard function

    To access this option go to the menu bar > Window > Align. In the Align panel click on the small `hamburger' menu
    icon on the tab bar, choose Show Options and then select Align to Selection.
3.6 Exercise 6: Symmetry with patterning

Gestalt psychology is important to visual creators because it provides a theory for the way humans perceive
groups of shapes in a composition. While there are four distinct properties and six laws (termed, Pragnanz), one
of the main themes is the understanding that viewers see a group of like objects as a whole unit before seeing
the individual parts. Termed the law of similarity, the individual circles will be read only after the viewer sees the
entire pattern presented here as a square. It's nearly magic: a group of circles becomes a square.

       1. Select all four of the circles in the row in Exercise 5. Click Object > Group. Grouping objects is convenient
            as the separate objects maintain their autonomy while acting as part of a set that moves, transforms,
            and receives color information together. Grouped objects can always be ungrouped (Object: Ungroup).

             Hotkey: CMD+G is the hot key for grouping objects. CMD+SHFT+G is the hot key for ungrouping objects.

       2. Hold option as you click on the grouped row of small circles and drag it to the next composition.
            Duplicate the row three more times while adding SHFT so all four rows of circles have their left and right
            edges on the same margin lines. Use the Align Palette to fix the rows if they aren't organized (try
            selecting each row and using the button, "Horizontal Align Left.")
            NOTE: If all 4 rows are grouped together, the circles cannot be aligned properly.

       3. Select each column and click the second button in the Distribute Object section of the Align Palette
            ("Vertical Distribute Center"). This will space the circles evenly on the y-axis.

             The location of Vertical Distribute Center function on the Align panel. Results of square 5.

                                                                                                             71

3.7 Exercise 7: A focal point is defined within symmetric
patterning

In the last exercise, the repetition of the sixteen circles created a pattern. In this exercise, the repetition is broken
by changing the value and hue of one circle (one part of the whole) in the lower right quadrant of the composition.
A focal point is created by the contrast of value and hue. When the contrast between like and unlike forms is as
extreme as it is in this exercise, the designer can direct the viewer's eye to a particular part of the composition.
Utilizing contrast to create a focal point is an essential design skill.

       1. Select all of the circles in Exercise 6, OPT-drag them to the final composition. Hold SHIFT as you drag to
            move the set of circles along a straight path.

       2. Once the group of black circles is composed within the last composition, change the fill color of one of
            the individual circles to set a focal point. All of the black circles are part of a group. If the group is
            selected and the fill color is modified, all of the circles are modified. While this is useful, it is not our
            current goal. Instead, use the Direct Selection Tool to select just one circle. The Direct Selection Tool can
            be used to modify a path, an anchor point, or to alter one part of a group of objects. With your Direct
            Selection Tool click inside one of the circles and be sure to click inside the circle and not on the path
            around the edge of the circle. We do not want to modify the path, we want to modify the color of the
            whole circle.

                                                                                                             73

For many students and educators, The Bauhaus has become a symbolic point of entry to art and design education.
The precision of the grid in design and architecture was made relevant through studies at The Bauhaus. In Ellen
Lupton's The ABCs of (triangle, square, circle) The Bauhaus and Design Theory, the movement is credited as being
"the mythic origin of modernism" as founder Walter Gropius and László Moholy-Nagy were devoted to creating a
"universal language" and embraced methods of mass production (Lupton and J. Abbott Miller, 2).
The grid is utilized in all areas of design as a structure upon which forms can be precisely placed, reflected,
balanced or imbalanced. The grid is the invisible underlying structure that sustains the relationships between all
formal elements in print design, interactive design, industrial design, architecture, fashion, and more. Its origins
are established in the High Neolithic Era (4500 - 3500 BCE), according to Joseph Campbell who defines the grid
as "a geometrical organization of an aesthetic field." While the origin of the grid as an organizational structure
precedes the Bauhaus art movement and institution by more than 5,500 years, the Bauhaus movement perceived
the grid as not only an organizational structure, but as a structure that could be easily multiplied and reproduced.
By understanding the relationship between the grid and the organizational requirements of automation and mass
replication, The Bauhaus is responsible for design solutions utilizing the grid that became popular in the 1920s
and is still noticeable today.

                                                                                                             77

Counter-Composition IV, Theo van Doesburg, oil on canvas, 1924
http://flickr.com/photos/digitalfoundations/2229001727/

Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg created oil paintings of grid structures that illustrate the foundations of
Modernism. Mondrian was a Dutch painter who contributed to the De Stijl (in English, "The Style") movement
founded by Theo van Doesburg. Although neither Mondrian nor van Doesburg were masters at The Bauhaus,
Bauhaus members were aware of De Stijl and influenced by contemporary art movements. These grid-
compositions have been an inspiration to artists and designers who rely upon the grid as an organizational design
asset.

While the black and white paintings with brief areas of vibrant hues in primary colors appear to be simple
horizontal and vertical intersections, the renderings might allude to a city map, an electrical circuit board, or an
abstracted blueprint. The negative space in the composition can be perceived as the windows of tall buildings. The
grid is understood as a layout or a supporting structure while these compositions are the essence of the often
unnoticed foundations of modernity. Formulating an abstract concept from simple lines and planes is a practice
in translating visual cues into language-based meanings. It is the goal of any visual communicator to learn to do
this as both the reader of the message and the generator of visual content.
4.1 Exercise 1: Using guides to create a grid

       1. Create a new document (File > New) using the "Print" pull-down menu at letter size, in portrait
            orientation (8.5 by 11 inches, as opposed to 11 by 8.5 inches), named "the_grid." Click on the small arrow
            located next to Advanced  to view more options. Choose the color mode RGB.

             Create a new document dialog box.
       2. Rulers can be turned on or off. They appear at the top and right side of the document window. If the

            rulers are off, turn on the rulers by choosing View > Rulers > Show Rulers . Right-click or CTRL-click on
            the ruler to see all of the available units of measurement. Choose inches from the pull-down menu.

                                                                                                             79

    The location of the Show Rulers command

    Hot Key: CMD-R reveals and hides rulers.

    The rulers will now demonstrate that the Artboard is 8.5 by 11 inches. Sometimes the rulers load with
    zero at the top, left edge of the document, orizontally; but vertically, zero begins at the lower left corner
    of the document.To reposition zero so that it is located in the same place both vertically and horizontally,
    put the mouse in the top left corner of the ruler area, where the vertical and horizontal rulers seem to
    overlap, then click and drag to the top left corner of the page on the Artboard. Clicking and dragging from
    this area repositions zero on the Artboard.
4.1 EXERCISE 1: USING GUIDES TO CREATE A GRID  81

     Location of the Ruler Guides
3. In this step we will pull guides from within the rulers of the document. Guides are available in all

    Adobe® Creative Cloud® applications. They are always pulled from the rulers. Guides are used to create
    a grid on the page. The grid occurs when two guides (one horizontal and one vertical) intersect. The grid
    is used for assessing the relationship of the formal elements within the composition (images and text) to
    the positive and negative space (where other elements are and where there is nothing but empty
    space).Click on the Selection Tool, then place your mouse cursor within the ruler area at the top of the
    document. Click on the ruler and drag the mouse in a downward motion. A guide will be set in place
    when you release the mouse. Release the first guide at 5 inches on the ruler against the left edge of the
    page.

     Watch Out! If you release the mouse too soon, guides will be made in places where you don't want them! In
     Illustrator®, guides are automatically locked when they are released. To get rid of a guide that is locked into position,
     first unlock it by clicking View > Guides > Lock Guides. When the guide is not locked, simply click on it with the
     Selection Tool and press Delete on the keypad.

4. Repeat this step for the vertical guide, by pulling from the vertical ruler on the left edge and releasing
    the mouse at 4 inches on the ruler against the top edge of the page.

4.2 Exercise 2: Lines

Lines can be thin or thick, bumpy or smooth, dotted or solid, or straight or curvy. A line is the result of connecting
any two points on a plane. In this exercise we make a straight, thick, black line. In later chapter exercises, you will
create lines by alluding to them with repetitious single forms or by the gaze of the photographically reproduced
subjects within the composition. Lines can be used to provide direction, to separate parts of the page, or to
support elements on which images or typography rests. Many of the typographic visual references from The
Bauhaus (1919 - 33) include heavy lines that are used to separate areas of the page and provide direction for the
viewer's gaze. Notice that while the line we will create does separate the headline from the body copy on the page,
it does not cut the page into two distinct parts by running from edge to edge of the document. By leaving negative
space at the left edge of the composition, this line creates negative space that pushes the viewer's gaze towards
the body copy within the composition.

       1. Press the letter "d" on the keypad to load the default colors into the fill and stroke icons at the bottom of
            the Tool Palette. The default colors that load into fill and stroke in Illustrator® are black and white. The
            default colors that load into the color chips within the Tool Palettes of any of the Adobe® Creative
            Suite® programs are black and white. The letter "d" on the keypad always loads black and white into the
            color chips in the Tool Palette.

       2. Click on the Line Segment Tool. Clicking and dragging with this tool creates a new line. Clicking then
            holding the shift key (SHFT) while dragging creates a new line at a 0, 45, or 90 degree angle. Create a new
            straight line across the horizontal guide.

                                                                                                             83
84  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         The location of the Line Segment Tool

    3. Release the mouse and the line will be selected. If you click someplace off of the line and accidentally
        deselect it, reselect it using the Selection Tool. With the line selected, look in the Control Palette at the
        top of the document window. Notice that the line has values associated with it, including a fill color
        (automatically set to nothing, as signified by the red stripe across a white field), a stroke color (black) and
        a numeric value, indicating the weight of the stroke. Change the numeric value of the stroke weight on
        the line to 30 by typing 30 into the value box.

         The Control panel changes according to the tool you choose.

    4. Adjust the line so that it begins at about an inch into the page from the left edge by using the Selection
        Tool. The line may extend beyond the page edge on the right side. Anything that is outside of the page,
        represented by the black frame of the Artboard, will not be printed.

    5. Deselect the line by clicking anywhere on the Artboard outside of the anchor points surrounding the line
        with the Selection Tool.
4.3 Exercise 3: Using the Type Tool to create a headline

Headlines are typically larger than body copy and maintain a heavier weight on the page than most other
elements. The scale of the headline often relates to the scale of an accompanying photograph or illustration (it
may be the same width or half of the width, for example, as a photograph on the front page of a newspaper).
System fonts (the fonts that are installed on all computers, such as Arial, Chicago, Times, New York, and so on)
are usually reserved for the body copy on web pages; and they are not typically used as headlines. For print
designers, it is a good idea to stay away from system fonts! Web designers have to rely on them for body copy.
Display fonts (ornamental fonts, such as those that are free to download on (http://chank.com/freefonts.php) are
not legible enough to be used for body copy, but are often selected for headlines as they tend to be more ornate.
Sans serif type was first invented by William Caslon IV (1816) and was reserved, as John Kane writes in his A
Type Primer, "almost exclusively for headlines" (36). Using a sans-serif font for headlines is not a rule, but often
commands attention as they are sleek and authoritative in comparison to serif fonts. In this exercise, Gill Sans was
the typeface used for both the headline and the body copy. The ultra-bold font style creates a weighty headline,
and the regular variation of the typeface is very easy to read as body copy.

       1. Select the Type Tool in the Tool Palette (shortcut key T)

             The location of the Type Tool on the Tool Bar
       2. Click anywhere on the Artboard with the type tool. Do not drag. Clicking just one time will change the

            Type Tool into a flashing cursor. When you see the flashing cursor begin typing the headline, "Grid
            Systems." Illustrator® is a smart program, but it doesn't know when you are finished using the type tool.
            You have to tell it "I'm done;" and there are many ways to do this (see the sidebar). When you are
            finished typing your headline, click on the Selection Tool. The type is automatically selected as an object
            and the flashing cursor is gone.

                                                                                                             85
86  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Tip - How to tell Illustrator® you are done using the Type Tool: 1. Hold CMD and click anywhere outside of the type
         on the Artboard. The type is now deselected. 2. Press the Escape Key on the keypad. Notice your Selection Tool is
         automatically activated.

    3. Once the type is created, it can be edited by using the Selection Tool and the Control Palette or the
        Character Palette. If your type is not selected, click on it with the Selection Tool.

    4. In this exercise, Gill Sans Ultra Bold was used for the headline. While the type is selected, choose Gill
        Sans Ultra Bold (if you have it installed) or any other font of your choice from the Character pull-down
        menu either from the Control Palette or from the Character Palette (Window >Type > Character).

    5. The font size can be edited by typing a number into the font size box in the Control or Character Palette
        or by scaling the type with the Selection Tool. To scale the type, click on any of the four anchor points at
        the corners of the selected type object and drag towards (decreases the scale) or away from (increases
        the scale) the center of the type while holding SHFT. In this exercise, the headline is 44 points.

         Menu of font choices

    6. Use the Selection Tool to pick up the headline and move it so that the baseline is within the black line
        and the S in Systems is just to the right of the vertical guide.
4.3 EXERCISE 3: USING THE TYPE TOOL TO CREATE A HEADLINE                                                     87

The word "baseline" refers to the invisible line upon which typographic letters rest, as demonstrated here:

      `A' and `P' on a baseline

7. Kerning is the space between the letters in a single word. When you set body copy (for instance, a letter
    typed in Microsoft Word), you usually do not have to be concerned with kerning. The digital fonts are
    created to be well-kerned at smaller font choices (such as 10 - 12 points). However, when working with
    display text, such as a 44 point headline, the kerning should be studied. Traditionally, the amount of
    space between each letter should be even.In this exercise, we will adjust the space between the i and r in
    Grid and the s and t as well as the t and e in Systems. Place the type cursor just between the i and r in
    the word, Grid. Click when you see that the cursor looks like a single line so that you are able to edit the
    word.

     Watch Out: If you accidentally click when the Type Tool looks like a T with a dotted-box around it, you will make a
     new type object. If you accidentally create a type box use the Selection Tool to select it and then hit the Delete Key on
     your keypad.
88                                    XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    Once the Type Tool is between the i and the r in Grid, use OPT + the Right or Left Arrow keys on the
    keypad to nudge the letters to the left or right. This is the method of manually adjusting the kerning of
    the display text in Illustrator®, Photoshop® and InDesign®. Repeat this for the s/t and t/e in the word,
    "Systems". If you have used a different font you may need to adjust kerning between other letters. Be
    sure to save your work!

    The two images demonstrate the word "Grid" before and after kerning. Above is before kerning.

    After kerning
    Be sure to save your work often!
4.4 Exercise 4: Creating body copy with the Type Tool

Body copy is the content of an article, a book chapter, an essay on a web page, and so on. Body copy should be set
within a text box in all of the Creative Cloud® programs. As body copy is usually set within rectangles, consider the
overall shape of text to normally create a rectangular shape on the page. By utilizing a grid system, the production
artist controls how many columns of text appear in the final layout.

The artist should be interested in creating legible body copy. Legible body copy is not too big, too small, too
lengthy, too short, too light, or too dark. For a considerable amount of body copy (a full article, for example), the
copy should be set in columns between 3.5 and 4 inches in length or 35 - 65 characters. This is the point at which
many readers begin to read back over the words that they have already read. Instead of re-reading the same
words, a 3.5 inch line of body copy encourages the reader to move to the next line of type at about the time that
she is ready to move her eyes from right to left.

Assessing body copy is easy: squint your eyes while looking at the printed body copy. The overall grayscale value
of the printed rectangle (body copy) should be about 40 - 50%. It should not read as stripes of black against the
page. In this exercise we will consider adjustments that can be made if the copy is too light or dark.

Watch Out: If the final product will be printed, the designer should always take time to assess the printed version of the
composition. It is incredibly difficult to assess printed typography on the computer screen.

       1. Create a new vertical guide at the end of the last "s" in Systems.
       2. The type tool will create a type box when you click and drag with the Type Tool instead of clicking one

            time and entering text. Create a type box at about 7.25 inches (vertically), between the two vertical
            guides. If you want to you can set a guide at 7.25 inches.In the example we have used a paragraph of
            "dummy" (or placeholder) text that graphic designers have been using since the 1500s. The text begins
            with the two words, Lorem ipsum, and is often simply referred to as "Lorem ipsum" (ie. "Put some Lorem
            ipsum in there for now, we should be receiving the copy in a couple of days."). Lorem ipsum is used as
            placeholder body copy when the actual text is not available, as the letters within the Lorem ipsum text
            are more or less evenly distributed. Looking at "dummy text inserted here, dummy text inserted here"
            repeated enough times to create a block of body copy draws attention to itself as the repetition of such
            few amount of letters becomes a noticeable pattern. http://www.lipsum.com/ offers dummy text by the
            word count, paragraph count, and byte count. The text generator is at the bottom right of the web page.
            Generate two paragraphs of text.

                                                                                                             89
90                                                  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

    3. In the Control panel set your character fonts to Gill Sans (regular) was used at 11 points in this exercise.
        Copy and paste the Lorem ipsum text from the text file into the new text box.

    4. The body copy pasted into the new text box should be left-justified by default; but if it is not, use the
        Control or Character Palette to set the justification to the left. While the text is left justified, there is a
        sharp line created by the single letters in a column on the left side. This line extends to the headline, as it
        is aligned with the S in Systems. By the property of continuation, a line is made from the S to the body
        copy on the page. While this "line" created by the left margin is not as literal or heavy as the black line
        made in Exercise 2, it is just as relevant to the layout as it provides an intersection with the black line,
        further defining the grid on the page.

    5. Leading is the space between lines of type. The body copy is set at 11 points, and the leading is set at
        15.2 points. This is traditionally referred to as 11/15.2. Insert the Type Tool into any area of the body
        copy and then press CMD + A on the keyboard to select all of the type within this type box. With all of
        the type selected, press OPT + Down Arrow to open the leading. In the following two images, the leading
        has been adjusted and the text box has been resized in consideration of the margin space at the right
        and bottom of the composition. Notice how opening or loosening the leading creates a slightly lighter
        grayscale value when you squint your eyes and look at the block of text. Be sure to save your work!

    Example 1 - Leading is set to 15.2 pt (points)

    Example 2 - Leading is set to 15.2 pt (points) with line highlighted in black.
4.4 EXERCISE 4: CREATING BODY COPY WITH THE TYPE TOOL  91

Example 3 - Leading is set to 17.2 pt (points) to increase the line spacing

Although this did not occur in our exercise, two other typographic problems to look out for are orphans and widows.
An orphan is a single word that dangles on the last line of body copy, and a widow is a single word at the top of a new
column of text, before a paragraph break. These are undesirable type happenings that create imbalance and draw
attention to a place on the page where you don't necessarily want the viewer to focus.
4.5 Exercise 5: Using color to direct the viewer

In this exercise, the dot over the "i" will be replaced with a red square. A red square is also placed towards the
bottom of the composition, near the start of the body copy see the exercise example in ch4-ourfinalfile.ai) . By
repeating this form on two parts of the page, a relationship is made between the headline and the body copy. Red
is used intentionally to push the viewer's eye from the headline to the body copy.

       1. To create a focal point in the headline, replace the dot over the i in "Grid" with a red square. Removing
            one part of a letter is easy, but the letter must first be transformed from a line of editable text to a group
            of shapes. Before we do this, it must be noted that creating outlines of the original type will annihilate
            editing possibilities on the text object. When creating outlines around a piece of text, it is a beneficial
            practice to duplicate the text and leave it in the white space outside of the Artboard for reference or
            later editing possibilities.With the Selection Tool, click on the "Grid Systems" type, press the option (OPT)

            the Artboard, then click Type > Create Outlines.

        the i, the rest of the i will be selected. Marquee over the top portion of the dot (see the illustration
        below). Zooming in on the type will increase the likelihood of getting this the first time you try it, so don't
        be afraid to use the Zoom Tool or CMD + =. When part of the top of the i is selected, hit the delete key on
        your keypad until you see that the top portion of the i is missing.See the following three images, where
        the Direct Selection Tool marquees over the top half of the letter i, then the delete key is pressed two
        times.

German Bauhaus school educators Josef Albers and Johannes Itten helped define and expand upon color theory
during the years 1919 - 1923. Albers created a course in color theory that inspired the tutorial in this chapter.
Students who attend art and design universities typically complete these color studies using pigment and brushes
or with Color-Aid paper, however formal color studies are demonstrated in the digital environment with the
following four exercises where hue, value, and contrast are exploited to achieve various color relationships.
The traditional (analog) color wheel utilizes the RYB (red-yellow-blue) color model. In this subtractive color model,
red, yellow, and blue are the primary hues (what we think of as colors), which can be mixed together to create any
other color within the color wheel. Opposite colors on the wheel are called complementary, while analogous colors
sit side-by-side on the wheel. When the primaries are mixed together in the subtractive system, the resulting
product is black. In the digital spectrum, the RGB (red-green-blue) additive color system is used on television
screens and computer monitors. Colored light is mixed to create hue and value with red, green and blue as the
primary colors. When the primary colors in the RGB model are mixed together, the result is white.

                                                                                                             99

The CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) color model is another digital spectrum that is specific to the
print industry. Artists and designers often create high volumes of printed media using the CMYK color model to
synchronize the digital file with the four corresponding printing plates. This system is also subtractive, even though
it is utilized in a digital environment, so mixing equal parts of cyan, magenta, yellow and black produces black. The
CMYK color mode enables digital producers to access Pantone® colors, a set of industry specific colors that are
made to render a clear translation between the color that is presented on the screen and the color that will result
from the printer's equipment.

Vocabulary

        · Hue is color (e.g. red, blue, green, yellow)
        · Intensity, Saturation, Chroma and Brilliance all refer to how much pigment is in a color, which translates

            to how vivid a color appears.
        · Value is measured by how much white or black is mixed with a hue, or, it can be registered as the

            grayscale equivalent of a color.
        · Shades are a hue mixed with black.
        · Tints are a hue mixed with white.
        · Analogous colors are adjacent on the color wheel.

5.1 Exercise 1: Hue has value!

       1. Create a new document in Illustrator® using basic CYMK color mode in landscape orientation. Adjust the
            settings so the units are measured in inches and choose letter from the Size pull-down menu. We
            named our document hue-has-value.

             Create a new document in Adobe® Illustrator®
       2. Using the Rectangle Shape Tool, draw five squares on the Artboard. Check to make sure your smart

            guides are turned on. The guides help you with alignment. View > Smart Guides. Hold down the shift
            key (SHFT) while dragging each square to keep the proportions equal. Evenly distribute the squares by
            selecting all 5 squares, clicking "Horizontal Distribute Left" under the Align Panel (Windows > Align) as we
            did in chapter 3.

                                                                                                            107

     3. For each square, choose a fill color of a different hue with different values. Do not use a stroke.

         Remember to select the shape before you select a new color from the Swatches or Color Panel.

          Each square has a different hue with a different value. Choose color from the Swatches panel (above) or the Color Fill
          (below).
     4. Select all of the shapes by marqueeing over all of them with the Selection Tool or hold SHFT and click
         each shape with the Selection Tool. Hold the option key (OPT) while dragging the squares to create a
         duplicate set. If you hold the shift key after you begin dragging the mouse, the duplicate copy will move
         only in straight or 45 degree movements.

5. Select one of the duplicate squares with the Selection Tool then click on the Color Panel pull-down
    menu. The Color Panel is located in the panels on the right side of your Illustrator® workspace. The pull-
    down menu can be accessed by clicking on the down arrow located in the top right area of the Color
    Panel. Choose "Grayscale." This removes the Hue from the square and results in demonstrating the
    value of the associated hue. Repeat this step for each of the squares in the duplicate set.

on one square followed by the next) and drag it left or right in the grayscale order. Be sure to hold down
shift once you have started to drag the mouse as this will keep your movement strictly vertical or
horizontal. You may need to select each row and evenly distribute the squares again (see #2 above).

5.2 Exercise 2: Top or bottom?

       1. Create a new file in Illustrator® using basic CYMK color mode in landscape orientation. Illustrator® will
            remember your settings from the last document you created. If you have not created a new document
            since completing the above exercise, your document settings will already be programmed. Name the file
            document top_or_bottom.

             Create a new document in landscape mode (horizontal)
       2. Use one horizontal guide and three vertical guides to divide the page. Create the guides by clicking on

            the ruler and dragging the cursor onto the artboard. Place the horizontal guide at 4.75 inches, which is
            half an inch below the center of the page. Place three vertical guides at .5, 4 and 7.5 inches. If you don't
            see your rulers, turn them on by clicking View > Rulers > Show Rulers (CMD+R). You may want to make
            sure your guides are locked into place. View > Guides > Lock Guides.

                                                                                                            112
5.2 EXERCISE 2: TOP OR BOTTOM?  113

     Using Guides for Alignment
3. Create a 2 x 2 square on the top half of the page. Align the bottom of the square to the horizontal

    dividing line and the left edge to the middle vertical guide. To make the square exactly 2 by 2, double-
    click on the art board with the Rectangle Tool to see the Rectangle Options Dialog Box. Type "2 in" into
    the horizontal and vertical measurement boxes.

     If the dialog box is set to a different unit of measurement when it first opens, for instance points or pixels, typing "2
     in" tells the program to use inches instead of the units of measurement that initially appeared in the dialog box.

          Using the Rectangle dialog box to set measurements for your square

         USING THE COLOR PICKER

     4. Colors have three properties: Hue, Value and Saturation. Hue is the name used to define the color. For
         instance red, yellow, blue, and so on, are hues. Value refers to how much white or black is mixed into the
         color. Baby blue has white in it, while navy blue has a greater black value. Saturation is the level of
         intensity of the color. The color of pale winter tomatoes are less saturated than the color of ripe summer
         tomatoes.
         Double-click on the fill color in the bottom of the Tool Panel. The Color Picker dialog box appears. The
         Color Picker is another location for choosing colors. The Color Picker has controls for all three properties,
         hue, value and saturation. Choose a hue on the vertical slider to the right of the color selection area. Then
         choose a value by moving the color selection circle (in the large color box under Select Color:) up or down
         vertically. The higher you move the circle, the higher the value and the lighter the color appears. The
         lower the circle is placed correlates to a lower value and the color becomes darker. Choose a saturation
         by moving the color selection circle left or right horizontally. The further to the left the circle is moved, the
         lower the saturation. The color becomes more gray. The more right you move the circle, the higher the
         saturation value, and the more intense the color becomes.

     5. Make sure that the square is selected before choosing a color in this step. Use the Color Picker to choose
         a hue with a low value for the fill color of the square. Do not assign a stroke.
5.2 EXERCISE 2: TOP OR BOTTOM?                                                                                 115

     Use the Color Picker to choose a hue with a low value.

6. Option-Drag your square to the right to create a copy (holding down shift after you start dragging will
    retain it to a movement along the x-axis). Align the bottom of the new square to the horizontal guide,
    and the left side of the square to the vertical on the left side of the page.

7. Repeat this action to make a copy of the square to the right, once again aligning the bottom edge with
    the horizontal guide and the left edge with the vertical guide farthest to the right. This will give your
    squares even spacing.
116  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          Create 3 squares by duplicating, then align to your guides.
     8. Select all three of the squares and Option-drag them down to the right so that 1 inch of the upper left

         corner of the new squares overlap with 1 inch of the bottom right corner of the original squares. Hold
         down the shift key to drag the squares at a 45 degree angle.

          Duplicating and offsetting the squares
5.2 EXERCISE 2: TOP OR BOTTOM?  117

9. Give all three of the new squares a different hue with a higher value from the top three: With all three
    squares selected, double click on the fill square to bring up the color picker. Choose a different hue, and
    choose a higher value so the color has less black in it.

       Give 3 bottom squares a higher value hue from the squares on the top row.
10. Select the left set of two squares (drag with the Selection Tool, or shift-click with the Selection Tool).
11. With the two shapes selected, open the Pathfinder Panel (Window > Pathfinder). Click on the "Divide"

      button, the first button under the Pathfinder heading. Dividing two objects creates a new shape at the
      intersection of the paths. The overlapping space is the one inch square. It will become its own whole
      shape, and the three shapes will remain grouped.

       The Pathfinder Panel is located on the Main Menu Bar > Window > Pathfinder
12. Select all three shapes and ungroup them by clicking Object > Ungroup (CMD+SHFT+G). Now they can be
118                                             XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

            selected and treated individually.

       Ungrouping objects. Main Menu Bar > Object > Ungroup

13. Repeat steps 10-12 with the middle and right set of squares.
      Creating foreground and background depth using hue and value

      Now we will modify the color of the middle squares, starting with the left square. The purpose of this
      exercise is to see how hue and value can be used to create space or depth within a color field. You will set
      the middle colors to see how that middle square can be pulled forward or pushed back in space, visually,
      in relationship to the other two squares.

14. For the left set of squares, you will modify the center square such that it appears it is part of the top
      square, and both it and the top square are floating above the bottom square. Achieve this by choosing a
      hue and value that creates strong contrast with the bottom square (you will especially see this at the
      boundary between the two shapes), and little or no contrast in value with the top square.

15. For the center set of squares, modify the smaller middle square such that it is floating over both of the
      larger squares. This is achieved by choosing a hue and value that creates strong contrast with both of
5.2 EXERCISE 2: TOP OR BOTTOM?      119

      the other squares.

16. For the right set squares, modify the smaller middle square such that it is part of the bottom square, and
      both it and the bottom square are floating over the top square. This effect is achieved by choosing a hue
      and value that creates strong contrast with the top square, and little or no contrast with the bottom
      square. Be sure to save your document.

5.3 Exercise 3: Interaction of values

       1. Create a new document in landscape orientation. Your settings are the same as the last exercise file.
            Name your file `interaction_of_value'.

             Create a new Illustrator® document
       2. Use the Rectangle Tool to create a 20% gray rectangle that covers the whole Artboard, by using the

            CMYK color sliders to set the K value to 20% and all other sliders to 0%. First, choose your rectangle tool
            and start by clicking in the upper left corner of your artboard and dragging to the lower right corner.
            While the rectangle is still selected, turn off your stroke color. Next, display the color sliders by clicking
            on the drop-down menu in the top right corner of the Color Panel (located to the right of your
            Illustrator® workspace). Select "Show Options" by clicking on the tiny icon to the left of the "Color" label
            on the panel tab that toggles the options for the panel.

                                                                                                            120

     Creating a 20% gray by using the CMYK color sliders. The color sliders are accessed through the Color Panel.
3. Open the Layer Panel (Windows > Layers or locate the Layers icon in the panels to the right of your

    artboard). The gray shape should be located on Layer 1. Lock Layer 1 so that the gray shape does not
    move while completing the following steps.

     Locking layers by toggling (turn on/off) the lock icon
    Create a new layer using the button at the bottom of the Layer Panel.

          Create a new layer from the Layers Panel

     4. With Layer 1 locked and Layer 2 selected (highlighted in the Layer Panel), the following steps will be
         accomplished on Layer 2.

     5. Create Two 3 x 3 squares on top of the gray background. Fill one with white, eliminate any stroke color,
         and fill the other with black. Place the squares side by side, so that the left edge of one touches the right
         edge of the other in the middle of the gray area.

          Two squares, one white and one black

     6. Create one .75 x .75 square in the center of the white square. Fill the square with 50% black (middle
         gray).

     7. Option-drag a copy of this square to the middle of the black square with the Selection Tool. Use the Align
5.3 EXERCISE 3: INTERACTION OF VALUES  123

tools if necessary (Window > Align).

Exercise 3 results. Notice how the middle gray squares inside the black and white areas appear to have different values.

When values are placed near or on top of each other, we perceive their values as interacting and affecting
one another. It is important to keep this in mind when choosing hue and value combinations, as one value
will always influence the appearance of another.

Time to save your file!
5.4 Exercise 4: Interaction of colors

And now for the magic trick: in the next exercise three colors appear as four colors.
       1. Re-save your Exercise 3 file with a new name using File > Save As "interaction2".
       2. Shift select the two smaller squares and use the Color Picker or the Color Sliders (Window > Color) to
            assign the same new hue to them.

             Interaction of colors. Notice how the same hue looks different according to the colors it is next to.
       3. Select the larger square on the left (in this example, the white square is selected) and assign it a middle

            value and a complementary hue to the hue you just chose for the smaller square. You can use the Color
            Picker or the Color Panel, or you can "cheat" and follow these steps to find the complementary color:

                   a. Select the large square to the left, then use the Eye Dropper Tool to click on the smaller square.
                        This will fill the large square with the same exact color that you used in the inside smaller

                                                                                                            124
5.4 EXERCISE 4: INTERACTION OF COLORS  125

     square and for a moment, there will be no distinction between these two shapes and the
     smaller square disappears. The large square remains selected, so do the next step before you
     accidentally deselect!

b. While the large square is still selected, use the pull-down menu from the top right corner of the
     Color Panel to choose "Complement." This will assign the exact complementary color (in the
     color model that you have assigned to your document) to the larger square.

     Analogous color study

c. Now we will change the squares to the right to show analogous color works. Select the larger
    square on the right (in our example, the black square) and assign it an analogous hue to the
    hue of the smaller square (ours is green) with a middle gray value. Remember analogous colors
    are colors next to each other on the color wheel.
    First we used the Eye Dropper Tool to set the fill of the larger, black square to the same hue/value
    combination used in the small square (a repeat process from step a). Then in the Color Picker,
    we slid the hue cursor up slightly for the analogous hue and a little to the left for a value closer
    to middle gray.

     d. Notice that the two small squares look like they are different colors. They are, in fact, the same
          color, but the presence of the complementary and analogous colors influences our perception.
          The complementary color emphasizes the perception of the hues, and the analogous color
          subtracts the perception of the hues.

Line art is a composition made strictly in black and white, which does not include a shift in tonal scale. The
gradation of colors in a photograph of a sunset would not be considered line art, while a newspaper headline is
line art, as it is a work in typography, typically created in black on white. Line art most closely relates to drawing
with a bold marker, as the ink is either on the paper or it is not. The result is a composition understood through
the exploitation of positive and negative space.
Historically, line art referred to flat graphics or illustrations made in ink on paper, and was a method of efficiently
producing "camera-ready" materials for the commercial printer. If the work of art consisted of a gradation or
more values than black and white, the technical requirements for silkscreen printing became more cumbersome.
Layers of line art would have to be created and photographed, so the printer could recreate the gradation on the
single printed page with individual screens of overlapping color or value. Since the 1980s, digital technologies have
influenced both the commercial printing industry and the designers and media crafters who send files to print.
Printing has become less focused on "camera-ready" materials now that print-ready files eliminate the need for
re-photographing original art.

DIGITAL FOUNDATIONS  131

In this political poster by Ronen Eidelman the portrait is represented as a flat graphic while the type is large and bold. The contrast
between the vibrant red and paper white is intense. The message is quickly understood through a design that is both minimal and
dynamic. http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalfoundations/2265205253/in/photostream/

The original "flat graphic style" can be located in Plakatstil, which translates from German to English as "Poster
Style." Plakatstil is the opposite of decoration. It is bold and minimal, the type is large, while the image is sparse
and colors are bright. Lucien Bernhard's 1906 poster design entry to a contest held in Berlin by the Priester Match
Company is considered the first work to embrace this new graphic style, possibly inspired by the industrialization
of city life and a desire for fast-paced communication.

Although line art and flat graphics are especially utilized for the commercial purposes of logo and identity pieces,
the outcome of drawing a single line is as personal as your signature. Artists such as Pablo Picasso and Egon
Schiele (see chapter 1) are often identified by their line quality. Two lines can contrast one another due to the
weight of each line (the thick or thinness of the line), the amount of pressure used to draw the line, or the boldness
or starkness of a line that is heavy or one that is broken up into smaller pieces that reach towards a single
direction.

The Pen Tool

The Pen Tool is prominently used for creating flat graphics or line art. It can be used to make complicated forms by
132  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

tracing images and combining simple shapes. In addition to contouring and tracing, the Pen Tool is often used to
create shapes that are used for masking. The Pen Tool can be a little difficult to learn, as the process of using this
tool sometimes feels counter-intuitive. The artist has to know where her next point is before plotting it. Visualizing
lines, shapes, and space before they exist can be challenging. In this exercise the paintbrush is used to create quick
gesture drawings of the lines and shapes that will be recreated accurately with the Pen Tool to eliminate the type
of forethought that accompanies the use of this tool. With enough practice on top of template layers, newbies are
sure to develop Pen Tool intuition.
6.1 Exercise 1: Gesture drawings on a template layer

       1. Start with a new print document in Adobe® Illustrator® set to standard letter size dimensions. You may
            change the unit of measure to Inches. Name and save your file as lastname-ch6-pen-curves.ai.

       2. To begin, we will set up a template layer with quick, gesture strokes using the Paintbrush Tool. Select the
            Paintbrush Tool from the tool panel. Hit the letter D on the keypad to set the default colors into the fill
            (white) and stroke (black). Set your stroke size to 6 pts (See Control Panel > Stroke). Draw a straight line
            by clicking and dragging with the Paintbrush Tool. Deselect the straight line by clicking off of it with the
            Selection Tool.

             Key Command: Another way to deselect in Illustrator® is to use the CMD key to access the Select Tool and then click
             off of the Artboard to deselect.

       3. Draw a triangle with the Paintbrush Tool. The results of the paintbrush drawings are vector shapes,
            which always result in anchor points outlining the path. The Direct Selection Tool can be used to modify
            an anchor point. It is the tool to use when you want to modify part of a shape, but not the whole shape.

       4. Deselect the triangle and draw the remaining curves pictured below.

                                                                                                            133

     5. Open the Layer panel by clicking in the panel shown in the illustration below or use Window > Layers.
         Double-click the icon for Layer 1 in the Layer panel. Click on the "Template" button and then click "OK".
         The template feature will lock the layer, so that you will not accidentally modify the paintbrush work.
         Template layers also dim artwork on those layers (this will be especially noticeable in exercise 4).

6.2 Exercise 2: Recreating straight lines with the Pen
Tool

       1. Select the Pen Tool from the Tool panel. Click and hold your mouse on the tool to see the additional
            tools used on vector paths. Click on the vertical bar arrow on the right to undock the panel.The Pen Tool
            plots anchor points each time you click the mouse. Click once on the stroke icon at the bottom of the
            panel and set the stroke to red, so that you will see your work when it sits on top of the black template
            layer. Set the fill color to none.

             Location of the Pen Tool on the Tool Bar
       2. To make a straight line in red, click one time at the beginning of the black painted line. Release the

            mouse. Move the mouse to the end of the black line. Click one time. In two clicks, the Pen Tool creates
            two anchor points and joins the points with a straight line. If you are having trouble seeing the red line
            increase the stroke size to 6pts.

                                                                                                            136
6.2 EXERCISE 2: RECREATING STRAIGHT LINES WITH THE PEN TOOL  137

     Creating a line with the Pen Tool
3. Once the line is made, it can be modified with the Selection Tool for moving, rotating, or transforming or

    by the Direct Selection Tool, to modify one anchor point at a time. Deselect the line, then use the Direct
    Selection Tool to click once on the anchor point at the end of the line and drag it to increase the length
    of the line.

     Modifying a line with the Selection Tool

     Watch for this: The anchor points grow larger as the mouse hovers near them, making it easier to find the anchor
     points when nothing is selected.
138  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

       4. Use the Selection Tool to select the line and change the weight of the stroke from the Control panel.
            Notice how the line can be bold and aggressive with a larger stroke size or faint and slim with a stroke
            size that is less than 1 point.

       5. Deselect the line.

Part A: Recreate the triangle with the Pen Tool

       1. Click once at one corner of the triangle with the Pen Tool. Release the mouse. Click on the next corner of
            the triangle. Release the mouse. Click on the third corner of the triangle. Release the mouse. The fourth
            click needs to be exactly where the first anchor point was made.Image Caption: Notice in this image that
            the Pen Tool displays a small o, symbolizing that the path is closed and a whole object is made when the
            last click with the Pen Tool is made directly on the first anchor point. This is referred to as "closing the
            path." When a path is closed, or a shape is whole, it is easy to fill the shape with a color using the
            Selection Tool and the color tool panels.

          Notice in this image that the Pen Tool displays a small o, symbolizing that the path is closed and a whole object is made
          when the last click with the Pen Tool is made directly on the first anchor point. This is referred to as "closing the path."
          When a path is closed, or a shape is whole, it is easy to fill the shape with a color using the Selection Tool and the color tool
          panels.
     2. Select the triangle with the Selection Tool if it isn't already selected. Click the curved arrow above the fill
         and stroke tools in the tool panel. The stroke and fill colors switch places, (in this example, the triangle
         becomes red with no stroke, as opposed to a triangle with no fill, outlined in red).

          Key Command: The letter x on the keypad will switch the fill/stroke color in Illustrator® (in PhotoShop the same hot-
          key switches the foreground and background colors).

             Location of :Swap Fill and Stroke on the main Tool panel

             Filling the triangle with color

Part B: Modify anchor points using the Direct Selection Tool
Just for practice, use the Direct Selection Tool to modify two anchor points at a time. Click on one anchor point of
the triangle. Hold the shift key and click a second anchor point (so one whole side is selected), then begin dragging
the mouse to move both anchor points at one time. Alternatively, you can marquee over one side of the triangle,
and two anchor points will be selected. You can click and drag with the mouse to move these anchor points, or you
can use the up, down, left, and right arrows on the keypad. SHFT + ARROW modifies the placement by ten pixels.
Part C: Create a second shape to add dimensionality

       1. Begin by creating a second shape (a parallelogram) using the Pen Tool. Plot the first anchor point near
            the top of the first triangle.

       2. Use the edge of the first triangle to help visualize the dimensionality of the second shape. Plot the
            second anchor point to create a parallel line between the two shapes.

       3. Set the third anchor point so the area recedes in space, creating a unified perspective between the two
            shapes.

       4. Close the path by using your fourth mouse click to return to the first anchor point. If the shape isn't
            perfect, you can always go back with the Direct Selection Tool to modify individual anchor points.
140  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

             Closing straight lines to create a parallelogram
Part D: Atmospheric Perspective
Stand outside early in the morning or at twilight and look far down the street towards the horizon. Objects that are
further away appear less saturated than those that are near. Atmospheric perspective accounts for the perceptual
change that happens to the overall opacity of objects as they recede in space.

       1. Select the parallelogram and fill it with the same color you used in the triangle.
       2. Open the Transparency panel (Window > Transparency). While the parallelogram is still selected, change

            the transparency to 80%.Flat, basic shapes created with the Pen Tool can be combined to imply
            complicated shapes and three-dimensional space.

             Change the transparency of your shape using the Transparency panel (Window > Transparency)
6.3 Exercise 3: Curves

Part A: One curve
       1. The first curve is created in two points. The first anchor point is made by clicking and dragging the
            mouse slightly upward to imply the direction of the curve. Do not drag all the way over the curve like you
            are using a pencil or paintbrush, this tool does not work like a pencil or paintbrush. Release the mouse.

             Watch Out! If you set the Pen Tool with a fill and no stroke, the path is filled with color as each point is plotted with
             the Pen Tool. This can be confusing, even to professionals, while initially setting anchor points.

       2. Click once at the end of the curve and drag slightly downward until the curve looks similar to the
            template.

             Creating a curve using the Bezier Handles
            Deselect the curve.
Part B: Bezier Handles
When you are finished you will have one curve with two anchor points. Each anchor point will also have bezier
handles, which are used to modify sections of the curved line. With the Direct Selection Tool you can modify the
anchor points, the line segments, and each bezier handle. Every curve has a mid-way point, the bezier handles pull
on each side of this point.

                                                                                                            141

Part C: Two curves in a row

       1. Click and drag with the Pen Tool in the direction of the first curve. Release the mouse.

          You only need to click and drag a short distance to set the first curved point

     2. Click at the end of the first curve and drag down with the mouse - this tells the Pen Tool the direction of
         the next curve. Release the mouse.
6.3 EXERCISE 3: CURVES  143

             Creating a second anchor point to set the direction of the curve
       3. Click at the end point of the last curve and the final curve is made between the last two anchor points.

             It takes time and practice to master the Pen Tool!
            When you are working with the Pen Tool, you have to think ahead of the tool, towards the place where
            the line changes. Where does the curve change directions? This will inform where you click and how you
            drag the mouse.
Part D: Deleting and adding anchor points
You can click on an anchor point with the Direct Selection Tool and hit the delete key, or if the anchor is in the
middle of a path, you can use the Subtract Anchor Point Tool (Pen Minus) to click on an anchor point you want to
delete. You can use the Add Anchor Point Tool (Pen Plus) to add an anchor point any place on a path if you need
to add a curve or hard angle after you've finished creating your path with the Pen Tool.

Are you remembering to save your files?
6.4 Exercise 4: Curves and angles

The last sample on the template is an example of a curve next to an angle, next to a curve, next to an angle, and so
on. The Convert Anchor Point Tool is used to create this juxtaposition. This tool becomes active if you place your
mouse near an anchor point while drawing a path. It is also available as a separate tool, hidden beneath the Pen
Tool in the Tool panel.

       1. Use the Pen Tool to click once and drag in the direction of the curve at the first anchor point.

             Step 1
       2. Click at the second anchor point and drag to finish the first curve.

             Step 2
       3. Now place the Pen Tool close to the anchor point you just created, wait until you see the Convert Anchor

            Point Tool, then click the mouse. The bezier handle disappears because you no longer have a curve.

                                                                                                            145
146  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          Step 3
     4. Click after the next curve and drag the mouse down to create the curve.

          Step 4
     5. Click on the anchor point to convert it to an angle.

          Step 5
     6. Repeat this process until you trace the template.
6.4 EXERCISE 4: CURVES AND ANGLES  147

6.5 Exercise 5: Tracing an image and creating a clipping
mask

CLIPPING MASKS
The Pen Tool is often used in combination with images or vector art to create clipping masks. A clipping mask is
used to redefine which parts of an object are revealed to the viewer. They are commonly used on photograhic
images to "remove the background" from a figure in the image. Included in the files for this chapter is a
photograph of a hand in front of a flat wall (ch6-hand.psd is a Photoshop® document). First the Pen Tool will be
used to draw a path around the arm, then the resultant path will be used as a clipping mask to hide the rest of the
photograph.

       1. Start with a new print document in Adobe® Illustrator® set to standard letter size dimensions. You may
            change the unit of measure to Inches. Name and save your file as ch6-clippath-hand.ai.

       2. Choose File > Place to place the image of the hand (ch6-hand.psd) on the new layer. The cursor will `load'
            the image. Click any where on the artboard. Do not click and drag. That will change the image size.

                                                                                                            148

     Locating and unchecking the Link box. Image: http://wiki.digital-foundations.net/index.php?title=File:FIg06_Ex5_04_CS6.png

     Watch Out: The "link" checkbox in the Place dialog box is used to link (when checked) or embed (when unchecked)
     the image file in the Illustrator® document. Linking files can be useful as the images are not actually stored in the
     Illustrator® document, so the file size of the Ai document is not affected by large images. However, linked files must
     remain available on the hard disk or in the folder, in the same relative position as they were when the relationship
     between the linked image and Illustrator® file was created in order to view and print the Ai document. For beginning
     students, it is recommended to embed images, or keep "Link" unchecked.

3. Double-click the icon in the Layer panel and click on the "Template" checkbox. The image will appear
    dim. Name your layer `background'. Create a new layer above this template layer. Name this `hand'.

          Create a New Layer from the Layers panel
     4. Use the Pen Tool to trace the hand. Remember to start and stop on the same anchor point. Also

         remember that the path doesn't have to be perfect, as the Direct Select tool can be used to modify it
         once it has been created.

          A tracing of the hand and arm using the pen tool
     5. To transform the path into a clipping mask, you will select both the path and the image. First, unlock the
6.5 EXERCISE 5: TRACING AN IMAGE AND CREATING A CLIPPING MASK  151

background template layer. Next make sure you are on the hand layer. Using the Selection Tool click on
the path (around the arm/hand) then hold SHFT and click on the photograph background somewhere
above the arm/hand selection. You will see anchor points around the path you just plotted and on the
four corners of the placed photograph. Choose Object > Clipping Mask > Make.

Transforming the path into a clipping mask. Main menu > Object > Clipping Mask > Make

A clipping mask is used to define the areas that are revealed to the viewer, while any part of the image
outside of the path is hidden.
152  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     Tip: If you are making a clipping mask, you should have a path that is placed inside the photographic image. That
     is, the photographic image should be larger than the path that will be used to mask it. If the path is larger than the
     entire image, the mask will simply reveal everything, in which case you don't really need a mask.

          Tip: Be sure to click on the path, then shift-click the photographic image someplace outside of the path. Shift-clicking
          inside an area that includes both the path and the image deselects everything!

     6. Modifying the clipping mask or the image that is masked is possible, as long as you select just one or the
         other with the Direct Selection Tool. For first time users, this is not always as easy as it sounds. The most
         fool-proof way to select the mask and not the image is to use the Layer panel. Expand Layer 2 on the
         Layer panel. Now you have a group that contains the clipping mask and the photographic image. Expand
         the group so that you can see all of its parts by clicking on the sideways triangle to the left of the word,
         "Group", in the Layer panel. Now you will see the mask and the image.To the right of each path on a
         layer there is an area where a small colored box appears if that particular path is selected. Clicking on
         this part of the Layer panel will select a path within the Art Board. Click to create a blue box next to the
         clipping mask in the Layer panel. You should see the anchor points surrounding the mask within your
         document. Use the Direct Selection Tool to modify the mask without touching the photographic image.
6.5 EXERCISE 5: TRACING AN IMAGE AND CREATING A CLIPPING MASK  153

             left: Successful masking of the hand and arm. right: The Layers Panel after clipping has occurred. To open secondary
             layers, toggle (click on) the gray triangle next to the main layer.

       7. The Selection Tool can be used to move the entire image and mask as one unit, since they are grouped
            together within the Layer panel. Once a clipping mask has been made, it will remain grouped in the
            Layer panel unless you release it.Save your file.

READ ONLY, do not complete this step.

To delete the clipping mask, you can click on it with the Selection Tool then choose Object > Clipping Mask >
Release. Now both the path that was used as the mask and the image are available as two separate objects. They
can be deleted or modified as individual objects.

      CHAPTER 7: SCANNING

Download Materials for Chapter 7
Click here to download chapter 7 work files

The first photograms were made by photographic pioneers, William Henry
Fox Talbot and Anna Atkins in the mid-1800s. Photograms are made by
placing objects on sensitized paper, exposing the objects and paper to light,
and processing the paper to reveal the print. A camera is not necessary for
the production of this type of graphic image; and the result is more like an
abstract impression of the object than a highly detailed rendering. A
scanogram is the digital method of producing a "contact" image, similar to a
photogram, using a flatbed scanner. Like a photogram, a scanogram is
made by placing objects on the "sensitized area," or the scanner bed, where
the surface is exposed to the digital capturing devices that generate a file.

Photograms have been made by artists (see Anna Atkins' renderings of
natural elements or Man Ray, Lissitzky and Moholy-Nagy's collages) and by
commercial designers (see Paul Rand's package design and book jackets).
The process is fun to explore, because the result always differs from the
artist's expectations.

                                                                           A photogram of lemons, uploaded to

                                                                           user name Cormaggio.
7.1 Exercise 1: Creating a scanogram and understanding
file resolution

Scanners are hardware devices that use light and sensors to capture an image and through special software send
the image data from the scanning bed to the computer hard drive. All flatbed scanners operate in the same
manner, but the scanning software varies among various brands. In this exercise, the basic ideas of scanning,
resolution and file size will be addressed.

       1. Typically, a scanner is used to create a digital image of a printed work. In this exercise, a scan will be
            made of a three-dimensional object. Start by placing your object on the scanning bed and close the lid. If
            the object you're scanning doesn't allow the lid to close completely, put a dark piece of cloth over the
            scanner so the light from the device doesn't bounce out of the surface of the scanner (a jacket or dark
            sweater will work). Our example object for this exercise is a flower from an orchid - it lays flat so it will
            be easy to close the lid on the scanner.

       2. Open the scanning application. On the Canon scanners in the labs where we teach, the application
            automatically opens through Image Capture (a Macintosh application that is useful for capturing digital
            images from scanners and digital cameras), located in Macintosh > Harddrive > Applications > Image
            Capture. Here we will use Preview, however the following steps can also be performed in Photoshop®
            which we demonstrate at the end of this exercise. Open Preview and click File > Import from Scanner
            and click on the scanner plugged in to your computer.

                                                                                                            157
158  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     3. The scanner may automatically create a preview of whatever is placed on the scan bed. If it does not, a
         preview of the last item scanned may be visible. If a preview does not happen when the application is
         launched, look for a button to create a preview (it is often labeled, "preview", "overview", "view" or
         "prescan").

          As a result of clicking on the "Overview" button in the bottom left area of the scanning application, the size of the flower is
          small in comparison to the entire scan bed.
     4. The scanner will digitally capture the entire flatbed area. If your object is smaller than the flatbed, select
7.1 EXERCISE 1: CREATING A SCANOGRAM AND UNDERSTANDING FILE RESOLUTION  159

just the area that you want to digitize by marqueeing (clicking and dragging with a selection tool - on
most scanners just click and drag) over the image area. In Preview, part of the scan will be selected after
pressing overview. You can adjust the size of the selection by dragging the corners to fit your image. You
may have to look for a selection tool in order to constrain the area of the scan to just the image area on
the flatbed. At this point, your selection designates the location of the object on the flatbed. If you lift the
lid and move the object, you will have to re-preview the digital file in order to adjust the selected area.

     Notice the selection edges are very close to the edges of the flower on the scanning bed.

5. This is the crucial step. Before scanning the selected area, the artist must decide upon the final file
    resolution. The resolution specifically accounts for how many pixels are present in one inch of the digital
    file.

    Resolution for printed images

    Resolution is measured in dots or pixels per inch (dpi or ppi). The resolution of the scanned image is
    a necessary factor in the final print or on-screen output. In consumer or prosumer situations, such as
    personal ink jet printers or laser printers at stores that will make prints from your digital images, the print
    will look fine at a resolution of 200 to 300 dots per inch. In professional print environments, the rule is
    simple: ask the printer for the print specifications including file resolution and color space.

    Resolution for screen presentations

    Any image that will be used on-screen, for instance on a website or in a video, will need to be saved only
    at screen resolution, or 72 dots per inch. The file size is directly connected to the amount of pixels saved
    in each inch of the bitmap or raster file. Image files saved at screen resolution are much smaller in file
    size than images that are saved for printing.
    To determine the resolution to enter into the scanner software, simply acknowledge the size of the object
    on the flatbed, then decide how large you want the object to print on the page. If the object is, for
    example, 4 by 5 inches and the objective is to make a 4 by 5 inch print, scan the object at 200 - 300 dots
160  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     per inch. If you want to make an 8 by 10 inch print, either scan the object at 300 dpi and increase the scale
     to 200 percent, or scan the object at 600 dpi at 100 percent scale.

          In Preview after resizing the selection, the size of your final image is displayed next to the scan preview. Our image is
          roughly 3 by 3 inches. This is important information, as it will help me to determine what resolution I will use when I scan
          the file.

     6. Use the guidelines above, choose a resolution and be sure that the color mode is appropriate (black and
         white line art, grayscale or color).

          Here you can see that I am scanning at 600 dots per inch. I know that I can make a very good print on my ink jet printer at
          300 dots per inch. Since 300 multiplied by 2 is 600, I know that I will be able to make a very good print of this scan at close
          to 6 by 6 inches, or the width and height multiplied by 2.

     7. Finally, choose a file format for saving the scan. File formats such as JPEG, PNG, and PDF are used to
7.1 EXERCISE 1: CREATING A SCANOGRAM AND UNDERSTANDING FILE RESOLUTION  161

compress the size of the file, and therefore often result in a loss of digital information. File formats such
as TIFF and PSD are less "lossy" (the image does not lose digital information due to compression), and
are therefore better format choices if the intent is to manipulate the image in an editing program such
as Photoshop®.

             Here is my final TIFF file as seen in Preview. I will be opening this file in Photoshop® for the next exercise.
       8. The last step is to click on a button that reads something like "scan" in order to create the digital

           scanogram image file. Once your image is scanned, save it as ch7-yourlastname-scanogram.tiff (or .jpg if
           you're saving in JPEG format).

SCANNING IN PHOTOSHOP®
To scan an image in Photoshop®, click File > Import > Images From Device.
162  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

A dialog box will appear where you will be able to perform steps 3 through 8 from Exercise 1.
7.2 Exercise 2: A brief tour of tools and palettes in
Photoshop

Note: the screenshots in this exercise depict the steps using our sample file, flower.tiff. You should use your own
scanogram file that you created in Exercise 1.

       1. Open your scanogram file in Photoshop® by dragging it to the Photoshop® icon in the dock or using File
            > Open from within Photoshop®. Set the default workspace by clicking on Window > Workspace >
            Essentials (or use the Workspace drop-down menu at the upper right of the screen). Notice that the
            tools are located in the Tool Palette on the left side of the screen. The arrow at the top of the panel can
            be used to view the tools in a single or double column.
             In the Creative Suite programs, panels are accessible from the Window menu.

                                                                                                            163
164  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     2. Click once on any tool and notice the Options Palette at the top of the screen. All tools have specific
         options that are used to determine how each tool functions.

          The Rectangular Marquee Tool was selected in the Tool Palette. This is an image of the Options Palette, located under the
          menus at the top of the screen. When a different tool is selected, its options are shown in this panel.

     3. Palettes are also seen on the right side of the screen. All panels can be hidden or displayed by using the
         Window menu. Use the Window menu now and click on Navigator to display the Navigator Palette,
         which can be used to explore various areas of an image. The larger the resolution or dimensions of an
         image, the more likely it is that the whole image will not be viewable on the screen at 100 percent of its
         actual size. Using the Navigator is one method of moving around within a large image, but you will soon
         learn shortcut key alternatives to using this panel. This is worthwhile because the fewer panels that you
         need to keep open on your screen results in more screen space for viewing image details! Push the
         slider on the bottom of the Navigator Palette all the way to the right to zoom all the way into the image.
7.2 EXERCISE 2: A BRIEF TOUR OF TOOLS AND PALETTES IN PHOTOSHOP           165

    The small red square in the Navigator Palette indicates which part of the image is viewable on screen. Notice the slider is
    pushed all the way to the right, and in the bottom left corner we are zoomed in to 3200 percent.

4.                                      Enlarge the view of the image by

    zooming in and the individual pixels that comprise the image are in plain view. A pixel is the most basic

    picture element, or a single color unit of the bitmapped digital image file. That last sentence was full of

    jargon. Let's revisit those words:
166  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Pixel

         The word pixel is a combination of two shortened words: picture and element. Each pixel is one unit of
         color information. Pixels only exist when a real-world object is scanned or captured digitally.

         Bitmapped or Rasterized

         A digital file is considered bitmap or raster (two words used interchangeably) if it is comprised of pixels.
         The alternative is a vector file, where the image is made of mathematical coordinates whose relationships
         define areas of mass and contour. Adobe® Illustrator® is a vector-based application. Photoshop®,
         which is primarily used to work on photographic images, is commonly thought of as a bitmap or raster
         application. If the real world is captured digitally, it is converted into pixels.
     5. Double-click the Zoom Tool in the Tool Palette to see the image at 100%. It is important to view digital
         images at 100% as this is the "true" representation of the file. This is as good as it gets on the screen.

     Hot key: CMD+0 will change the viewing percentage so the image is as large as it can be on your screen. This hot key
     works in all of the Adobe® Creative Cloud® applications.

          Notice that the Zoom Tool options includes a zoom out button (Zoom Tool with a minus sign). Click on this and then click
          anywhere within the image. Keep clicking and you will continue to zoom out of the image. The button, "Actual Size," will
          also put the file at 100%. The button, "Fit Screen," will make the image as large as it can be viewed on your screen.

     6. Double-click the Hand Tool to see the image as large as it can be within your particular monitor settings.
         Now we'll try some key commands. Zoom in more than 100% by using CMD+= and then use the
         Spacebar key (SPCE) to access the Hand Tool. Hold SPCE and use the mouse to click and drag on the
         image. This moves the image around within the workspace, much like using the scroll bars at the edges
         of the document. In Photoshop®, you will never need to use the scroll bars because you will always use
         the Hand Tool.

          Hot key: Holding the spacebar on the keypad changes most tools to the Hand Tool. This is useful for quick, temporary
          access to the Hand Tool.
7.3 Exercise 3: Image Size, file size, and resolution

       1. When an image or object is scanned or input from a digital camera, it appears in the Layers Palette as
            "Background Layer." Look in the Layers Palette (Window > Layers) and notice that the background layer
            is locked. Double-click on the words "Background Layer" in the Layers Palette to use the Rename Layer
            dialog box. When you rename the layer it is automatically unlocked.A layer is like a single sheet of
            transparency paper. A "blank" or empty layer is transparent. When a scan or digital photograph is first
            opened, it lives on the "Background" layer. Layers can be added and deleted using this panel. Unlocking
            the background layer is a good habit, as it encourages the user to rename the layer (which is always a
            good idea) and enables the layer to be affected by tools and effects that can be "locked out" when the
            layer is locked.

             Tip: Double-clicking on the icon of the layer will open the Layer Style dialog box. If this happens, hit Cancel, then try
             again by double-clicking specifically on the name of the layer.

                                                                                                            167
168  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     2. The Status Bar runs along the bottom of the file. Click and hold on the area of the Status Bar that reads,
         "Doc:" followed by a number in kilobytes or megabytes. You'll see the file's dimensions (in pixels and
         printed dimensions), color mode, and resolution.

          Click on the status bar to see the overall size of the print on the page. Our print would be very small at the current file
          settings.

     3. Click Image > Image Size to see the resolution of the image.
7.3 EXERCISE 3: IMAGE SIZE, FILE SIZE, AND RESOLUTION                                                            169

4. Our scan (flower.tiff) is about 3 by 3 inches at 600 dots (on the print) or pixels (on the screen) per inch.
170  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     5. Uncheck "Resample Image" if it is checked, so that Width, Height, and Resolution appear linked together.
         Notice that the pixel dimensions at the top of the Image Size Dialog Box are no longer editable fields.
         The pixel dimensions will not change if a change is made to the editable Width, Height, or Resolution
         values. Modifying any one of these values results in corresponding changes to the other two. I set my
         height at 6 inches. This resulted in a width of 6 inches and a resolution of approximately 318 dpi. A print
         made at 318 dpi on my personal ink jet printer will be fine, that is, it will not be blurry or pixelated.

         Using the Image Size dialog box with "Resample Image" unchecked enables the user to change the
         dimensions of the printed image or the resolution (dpi) without changing the overall number of pixels in
         the digital file. This is a good thing - you would never want to change the amount of pixels within the
7.3 EXERCISE 3: IMAGE SIZE, FILE SIZE, AND RESOLUTION  171

    image, unless you simply want to delete some pixels in order to make the file size smaller. Pixels are
    created during the scanning process, on a scan bed or within the digital camera. The only way to make
    "new" pixels is to rescan or re-capture the digital file using a higher resolution. It is not possible to create
    new pixels inside Photoshop® after the fact. OK, that's actually a lie. You can make new pixels, but you
    never want to. If Photoshop® resamples the image (or, makes new pixels based on the surrounding
    pixels) the result is a blurry or pixelated image.

6. Click OK. Notice that nothing seems to happen to your file on the screen. This is because there was no
    change made to the actual number of pixels in the file. What changed is the amount of pixels that will be
    printed in one inch when the image is printed. Use the Status Bar to examine the result of changing the
    dpi in the Image Size dialog box while the option Resample Image was not selected. By nearly halving
    the resolution, the dimensions of the printed image have doubled. The size of the file stays the same.

     Clicking and holding in the Status Bar area demonstrates that my scan will print at a much larger size than it would have
     printed before I changed my resolution settings in the Image Size dialog box.

7. Choose File > Save As and change the format of the file from TIFF to Photoshop®, name your file
    ch7-yourlastname-scanogram.psd. Always save your work in progress using the native or master
    Photoshop® (PSD) format, it will give you more flexibility and options for revising your work as needed.
172  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG
7.4 Exercise 4: Basic adjustments to contrast, hue and
saturation levels

In this exercise we will make adjustments to the contrast, hue and saturation of the scanogram. The methods
utilized in this exercise are basic, that is, they are less specific than professional methods for color correction.
However, the scanogram creates an image with great density in the shadow areas and overexposed highlights.
The range of mid-tone values is usually discreet. As a result, these basic adjustments are easily seen and properly
utilized on this type of image file. In this exercise, how the image "feels" is more significant than the details in the
specific highlight and shadow areas. Advanced image adjustments are explored in chapters 8 and 9.

       1. To start, crop the image so that it is exactly 3 by 4 inches. Click on the Crop Tool in the Tool Palette, then
            use the Options Palette to set the Crop Tool to make a crop at exactly 3 by 4 inches. Click and drag with
            the Crop Tool over the image. When most of the image is selected, as in the screen capture below, press
            Return or Enter on your keyboard's numeric keypad to finalize the crop. Note: Depending upon the
            dimensions of your original image, cropping to 3"x4" may result in a slight enlargement of your original
            image or may require that you crop out a portion of your image. Either or both of these situations are
            acceptable for this exercise.

                                                                                                            173
174  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     2. Double-check the width, height and resolution in the Image Size dialog box and in the Status Bar.
7.4 EXERCISE 4: BASIC ADJUSTMENTS TO CONTRAST, HUE AND SATURATION LEVELS                    175

3. Click Image > Auto Contrast to automatically adjust the contrast within the image file.

4. Press CMD+Z on the keypad to "undo" the last step. Press CMD+Z again and Photoshop® "redoes" the
    last step. In Illustrator®, CMD+Z continuously undoes previous steps. In Photoshop®, the History Palette
    serves this purpose. We'll explore the History Palette in the next few steps.

Tip: The menu item for "Undo" is Edit > Undo. It is almost not even worth mentioning as you are best off knowing the
hotkeys for this important Photoshop® command.

5. Click on the Brush tool and make five random marks with it on the image. Press CMD+Z two times and
    you will still have five random brush marks on top of the scanogram.

     The Brush Tool is selected in the Tool Palette. The Brush Options can be used to select a brush size, a hard or soft edge on
     the brush, and the opacity of the hue that the brush draws (look towards the top right area of the Brush Tool Options).

6. Click on the History Palette (Window > History) and notice that it says, "Brush Tool" for each of the times
    that the paintbrush was used. Click once on each step in order to travel backwards through time. Just
178  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     clicking on the step is "enough," that is, nothing needs to be clicked in order to confirm that this is where
     you want to start working - just, start working and a new step will be recorded in the History Palette.
     Click on the step in the History Palette that restores the image to the point after Auto-Contrast was
     applied.

          In the History Palette, clicking on the step just above the five brush strokes, on "Auto Contrast" is the way to undo those five
          brush strokes.

     7. Click Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation. This adjustment changes the layer's hue, the intensity or
         saturation level of the hue and the value of the hues within the image. To create an overall wash of color
         or monotone effect, click on the "Colorize" button at the bottom right of the dialog box. Changes made
         to the hue (by dragging the hue slider) will become easily apparent.
7.4 EXERCISE 4: BASIC ADJUSTMENTS TO CONTRAST, HUE AND SATURATION LEVELS  179

             The Hue/Saturation adjustment is used to create a monotone wash over the image. Here the image takes on a sepia tone,
             similar to a traditional photographic bath used to cast a warm tone on the image.
            You've completed this exercise and this chapter. Make sure to save your work after these final steps.

      CHAPTER 8: TONAL SCALE

DOWNLOAD MATERIALS FOR CHAPTER 8
Click here to download chapter 8 work files
You will need the chapter 8 work files to complete this chapter's exercises.

When evaluating photographic images, in color or grayscale, the range of tones should be taken into
consideration. The tonal scale in an image encompasses the changes in value from black to white. Unless the aim
of the image-maker is to produce a low key (dramatically dark) or high key (exceptionally light) image, the file and
resulting print should include image details in the shadow and highlight areas.
Common problems that are addressed by adjusting the tonal scale are as follows:

       1. The image is too hot when the white areas are "blown out", meaning there are no image details in the
            highlights.

       2. The image is murky when there is not enough contrast between the darkest black value and the lightest
            white value.

       3. The image displays a colorcast when there is evidence of a hue in areas that should be neutral gray or
            white.

       4. The middle gray area of the image is too dark or too light, which usually corresponds (especially) to skin
            tones being too dark or light.

In this first recorded photograph, shown below, the exposure time was 8 hours! Notice the limited tonal scale due
to such high contrast among the dark and light values.

                                                                                                            181

from 1933 - 1938. The FSA hired photographers, such as Lange, Walker Evans and Marion Post Wolcott to
document America after the Great Depression. Notice how the range of tonal values expresses the details in
Florence's face and the blanket on her lap.

8.1 Exercise 1: Minor adjustments to the original file

       1. For this exercise, open in Photoshop® the file named Fig08_rgbimage.jpg (a photograph of a purple
            flower by Fred Benenson) included in the Chapter 8 Download Work Files.

       2. Whenever an image is scanned or captured digitally, the process of digitizing a three dimensional reality
            into a two dimensional file results in a loss of contrast. Unsharp Mask is a Photoshop® filter that is
            commonly used to compensate for this loss. From the menu bar, click Filters > Unsharp Mask.
            Photoshop® has many filters available which can be used to manipulate, enhance, or otherwise alter a
            digital image.

            The Unsharp Mask filter analyzes the contrast in edge areas of an image and increases the contrast of
            those pixels. Be sure that the Preview button in the Unsharp Mask dialog box is checked. Look at the
            image while clicking on the Preview button. Un-checking the Preview button displays the "before state"
            (the unfiltered image) and checking the Preview button reveals what the image will look like after the filter
            is applied. There are no set rules, but the guiding relationship is between the settings in this dialog box
            and file size. The larger the file size, the higher you will set values for Threshold, Radius and Amount. With
            smaller file sizes (anything less than 30 megs) you will probably leave the Threshold at 0, the Radius lower

                                                                                                            185
186  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     than 1.0 and adjust the Amount to somewhere between 20 and 250 percent, use your best judgement for
     an image that looks good. You will know when you've gone too far, the increased contrast will result in
     an image that looks pixelated and forced. Applying this filter should produce a minor modification. Once
     you're satisfied with the settings, click OK to apply the filter.

     3. Now we'll use the Crop Tool to crop the image. Click the Crop Tool in your Tools panel (or press the C key
         on your keyboard). When you activate the Crop Tool you will see a dashed border with control anchors
         appear around the image (if you don't see the dashed border and control anchors, click and drag across
         the image to define a crop box). Click and drag the anchors along the side edges of the crop box to
         adjust where the crop box is located in relationship to the image. The Crop Tool displays the cropped
         area by setting a dark gray cast on the parts of the image that will be cropped out of the scene. When
         the crop area looks appropriate, press Enter/Return on your keyboard or click on the checkmark in the
         Options bar Control panel at the top of the Photoshop® interface to "commit current crop
         operation."(Note: Sometimes you may need to rotate an entire image 90 degrees clockwise or counter-
         clockwise, or 180 degrees. To do this you can choose Image > Rotate Canvas and select the desired
         rotation from the submenu.)
8.1 EXERCISE 1: MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL FILE  187

     Tip: If it seems like the Crop Tool is sticking to the edges of your image, click on the anchor to readjust the crop area
     then hold down the CTRL key, which temporarily turns off "snapping" (a feature in the View menu that can be helpful
     when moving multiple objects into position). Let go of the mouse before letting go of CTRL.

4. When processing, capturing, or cropping images for use in print, it is a good idea to check the Image Size
    dialog box (Image > Image Size) to evaluate the resolution settings. Think about what size you need this
    image to be when printed and keep that in mind as you check the information in the Image Size dialog
    box. Remember from Chapter 7 that a printed image will be clearest if its resolution is between 200 and
    300 ppi. Many digital cameras record very large images, but the resolution is set at 72 ppi and may need
    to be adjusted. Looking at the Image Size information for our Fig08_rgbimage.jpg file, we see it has a
    resolution setting of 240 ppi and the cropped Width and Height of the printed image will be around
    15.8" by 15.6" (your crop may be slightly different).Let's try adjusting the Resolution to values of 900, 600,
    and 300 ppi and observe how that changes the printed Width and Height. Be sure to uncheck "Resample
    Image" before adjusting the resolution to a higher number. You should see that as the value of the
    resolution (measured in pixels per inch) increases, the width and height of the file decreases and the
    amount of pixel information (labeled as Dimensions near the top of the Image Size box, which should be
    grayed-out) remains the same. If all of this is not happening for you, and you are trying to increase the
    resolution of the file, something is wrong - double check your Resample setting and make sure that
188  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     checkbox is unchecked. When you are finished experimenting with Resolution settings, set the
     Resolution value to 300ppi and click the OK button.

     Notice the button for `Resample Image' is not checked in the Image Size dialog in the above images. In the Image Size dialog
     box in the second image, where the resolution value was changed to 900 ppi, the width and height that the image will be
     when it is printed is reduced to 4.219 by 4.16 inches and the amount of pixels (in the top part of the box) remains the
     same.
8.1 EXERCISE 1: MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL FILE  189

Tip: If you clicked with the Crop Tool and simply want to start over, the ESC key on the keypad will return you to
normal editing mode.

Use File > Save As and save your file as a Photoshop® file named ch8-lastname-flower_cropped.psd - make
sure you select Photoshop as the type/format and use your own last name in place of lastname when
you name your file.
8.2 Exercise 2: Understanding the histogram

Now we will take a look at the tonal range within the image. This can be done in any color mode, but for the
purpose of keeping this process easy for the first time, we'll change the image to grayscale color mode.

       1. Click on Image > Mode > Grayscale to convert the image from RGB color mode to Grayscale. You will
            see a dialog box with a message asking if you want to discard color information, click Discard. Use File >
            Save As and save this version of your file using ch8-lastname-flower_gray.psd as the file name.

       2. The next part of this exercise is to be observant about the value of the light and dark tones in your
            image. We do this with the use of the Histogram panel. Click Window > Histogram to display the
            Histogram panel.

             Notice the histogram for this image is clipped on the shadow side.
            This panel conveys information about the grayscale tones in the document. This is true regardless of
            whether the document is in color or grayscale, as color images are rendered digitally by compositing
            separate color channels (red, green, and blue, for example), each with corresponding grayscale values. So

                                                                                                            190
8.2 EXERCISE 2: UNDERSTANDING THE HISTOGRAM  191

once again, the Histogram displays information about grayscale values, even if they correspond to color
information. Here's the quick version of how to read a histogram:

                                                         The overall histogram graph displays the amount of information
within the image (y-axis) at the various levels of gray from black (on the left side of the x-axis) to white (the
right side of the x-axis). There are 255 levels of gray in any 8-bit image. Consumer scanners and digital
cameras typically capture 8-bit images. There are professional scanners and cameras that capture 16-bit
images, yielding more options for adjusting the tonal range; but for the beginning digital media student,
we will remain focused on 8-bit images.

Tip: The exclamation point triangle icon in Photoshop® usually means "out of gamut," but in the histogram it is meant
to indicate that the panel is showing cached information. Clicking on the icon will refresh the panel information. In
this exercise we are not changing anything, so it is not important to refresh.

Look at the histogram for your open image to make the following observations:

A. Does the histogram start and end at the beginning (dark values) and end (light values) of the x-axis? This
   would mean that there actually exists image information in the darkest shadow areas and the lightest
   highlight areas. If the graph seems to end before the edges of the box containing the histogram, the
   graph is "clipped" and there is no information at one (or both) end(s) of the spectrum. There is probably
   a noticeable lack of contrast in the image if the graph is clipped.

B. Where on the x-axis of the graph is most of the image information stored? In other words, where are
   the spikes in the graph? This should make sense in terms of how dark or light the overall image appears.

Imagine in the image above of the histogram that the midway point on the x-axis is where 50% gray occurs in the image. In
this image the highest spike appears somewhere between the blackest shadow and 50% gray.

C. Does the histogram have any gaps where information does not exist? This means that there is no image
   information in areas where gray values between black and white are expected. This is usually a result
   of "over-tweaking" an image with tonal adjustments, as opposed to something that will be noticeable
   from a scan or digital camera capture. Sometimes this is a reasonable result of increasing contrast in
   an image, especially when certain areas are particularly hot (bright or blown out highlights).
192  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     In our image, the histogram has no gaps. In the next exercise we will be making changes to the histogram and you will see
     gaps as a result.
8.3 Exercise 3: Adjusting the histogram in Levels or
Curves

For this exercise we will complete the first step (Levels) on the grayscale image that was used in Exercise 2,
ch8-lastname-flower_gray.psd. Then we will use the color version of the file, ch8-lastname-flower_cropped.psd, again.

       1. Click Image > Adjustments > Levels, which is used to control tonal adjustments specifically in the
            shadow and highlight areas. The Levels dialog box displays the histogram that we just viewed in the
            previous exercise. At the left side, tonal information is presented for shadow areas, then mid-tones,
            followed by highlights on the right side. Moving the input level sliders (the small triangles just beneath
            the graph) to correspond to image areas where there is information on the left and right sides of the
            histogram readjusts where 100% black and 100% white occur within the image. Tonal manipulations
            occur as a result of adjusting the numbers associated with each slider. If the objective is to make the
            image look abstract through high contrast, move the sliders towards each other. If the objective is to
            make the image seem true to life, the sliders should be used carefully. Adjust the sliders to your taste

and click OK.                                                                                   Use File > Save

                                                                                           193
194  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         As and save a copy of this adjusted image as ch8-lastname-flower_gray_adjusted.psd

     2. Open your ch8-lastname-flower_cropped.psd image. We'll be making some adjustments to the image so
         use File> Save As and save a copy named ch8-lastname-flower_curves.psd - this will be your working file
         for the remainder of this exercise. Look at the Histogram panel to see information about the grayscale
         values in this image.

     3. From the upper right pull-down menu in the Histogram panel, choose "All Channels View" to see the
         histogram for the composite RGB channel as well as the single red, green and blue channels that
         comprise the image. Even though the image is seen in color, the overall scale of gray values should be
         evaluated. Notice the graphs in the Histogram panel for each of the three separate channels (ask
         yourself the same questions as we posed when evaluating a grayscale image in exercise two).
8.3 EXERCISE 3: ADJUSTING THE HISTOGRAM IN LEVELS OR CURVES  195

     Look at the individual histograms for the red, green, and blue channels. Notice that there is more highlight information in
     the red channel, while all three channels peak around the same point in the shadow areas. Also notice that the red channel
     has the most color information across the x-axis while the other two channels have steeper slopes towards the start and
     ending points of the curves.

4. Click Image > Adjustments > Curves. Once again, the histogram is presented in the Curves dialog box.
    Curves, like Levels, can be used to adjust the tonal scale within the image.

5. This time, don't touch the RGB composite histogram. Instead, adjust each of the red, green, and blue
    graphs individually so that there is image information where the deepest shadows and lightest
    highlights appear. To do this, start by using the pull-down Channel menu from within the Curves dialog
    box to select "Red" (or use Alt/Option+3 on your keyboard). Use the input sliders on the left and right
    sides to move the edges of the endpoints of the line graph to the point where image information exists.
196  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG
8.3 EXERCISE 3: ADJUSTING THE HISTOGRAM IN LEVELS OR CURVES  197

6. Use the Channel pull-down menu to select "Green" (Alt/Option+4). Use the input sliders on the left and
    right sides to move the edges of the endpoints of the line graph to the point where image information
    exists.
198  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     7. Use the Channel pull-down menu to select "Blue" (Alt/Option+5). Use the input sliders on the left and
         right sides to move the edges of the endpoints of the line graph to the point where image information
         exists.
8.3 EXERCISE 3: ADJUSTING THE HISTOGRAM IN LEVELS OR CURVES  199

8. Click OK. Adjusting the Curves (or Levels, either adjustment could have been used for this last exercise)
    manually for each color channel produces a better result than simply doing this one time for the
    composite RGB channel.

9. Notice the Histogram. It should show a graph with information that spans from the left side of the x-axis
    (shadows) to the right side (highlights).
200  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG
8.3 EXERCISE 3: ADJUSTING THE HISTOGRAM IN LEVELS OR CURVES  201

                                                                                                                  The image on the top is before the
curves were altered and the image on the bottom has been modified. Information spans the entire x-axis on the histogram.
Notice that the contrast is slightly modified, but the overall change to the image is slight. Be careful about pushing the
sliders too far. The modifications should be minimal.
8.4 Exercise 4: Targeting saturation levels

Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation can be used to increase or decrease the saturation of specific hues within
the image. This adjustment is often used to make a dominant color appear more vibrant within an image, but
the result can hard to notice if the image is not being viewed at 100 percent. Even then, sometimes it is easier
to see the results of this image adjustment in the final print. Follow the steps below on your ch8-lastname-
flower_curves.psd file to demonstrate this concept.

       1. Click Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation. Use the pull-down menu on the word, "Master," to work
            specifically on the magenta areas of the image.

       2. Use the Saturation and Lightness sliders to modify the image. The image below demonstrates our
            settings, but remember that our monitors may be calibrated differently. It is best to eyeball these
            numbers, rather than follow our specific settings. Remember, be sure the image is showing at 100
            percent (use the Zoom Tool to zoom in or out) before making any adjustments.

                                                                                                            202
8.4 EXERCISE 4: TARGETING SATURATION LEVELS  203

3. When you are satisfied with your adjustments, click OK. The result should be similar to the image below.

In the middle of the 1800s, Hippolyte Bayard was one of the earliest photographers to create a combination print,
where two separate images are juxtaposed in a single photographic print.

                                                                                                            205

Self Portrait as a Drowned Man, 1840, Hippolyte Bayard, Combination Print.

Following Bayard's experiments, there are many combination prints and double exposures that were made as
photographic prints throughout the Victorian Era.

In the 1920s, Dada and Constructivist artists cut and pasted found photographs, their own imagery, and various
printed elements together to form an "anti-aesthetic" collage that challenged the viewer to decipher multiple
messages within the final composition. El Lissitzky's The Constructor (seen below) is an example of this type of work.
Lissitzky's self portrait combines his own head with fragments of machinery along with a hand that is interpreted
as "THE HAND OF GOD" passing over his face.
DIGITAL FOUNDATIONS  207

The Constructor, 1925, El Lissitzky, Self Portrait Photomontage.

These two images employ different methods of artistic production. The combination print was made during the
photographic printing process, while the photomontage combines various printed materials (in this case with
adhesive). The photomontage may have been re-photographed, such that the final print appears seamless. Today
tools like Photoshop allow for a less complicated process when combining multiple images.
9.1 Exercise 1: Using layers to create a double-exposure

In the camera, a double-exposure requires releasing the shutter to create one photograph, then carefully
rewinding the film back to the same frame, and releasing the shutter again to create another photograph on top
of the first one. An example of this process can be seen in Henry Van der Weyde's image of Richard Mansfield as
Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde.

In Photoshop®, the double exposure can be made by putting two images on separate layers, then adjust the

                                                                                                            209
210  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

blending mode of the top layer. We've provided two images on the disk, but you might explore taking two
images with a digital camera or scanning two photographs that address the subjects of time, dreams, paranoia,
schizophrenia, otherworldliness, duality, etc. The double exposure is often used to express duality or the passing
of time (also see Duane Michaels' photographs).

       1. Create a New Document using File > New. Name it ch9-yourlastname-double-exposure (using your own
            last name in place of yourlastname). Set the Width to 12 inches and the Height to 10 inches (make sure
            that your units of measurement are set to inches and not pixels - otherwise you'll have a much smaller
            document than intended). Set the resolution to 72 Pixels/Inch and leave the color space in RGB mode.
            Lastly, make sure the Background Contents setting is set to Transparent.

          72 Pixels/Inch (PPI) is also known as "screen resolution." Working at 72 PPI is appropriate for any content that will
          appear on a screen and that will not be printed.

     2. Open the hand01.jpg file from the Chapter 9 Downloaded Work Files. The file will open as a new tab in
         the main Photoshop® window. Click on the tab for the hand01.jpg image and pull down and away from
         the toolbar so the image is opened in its own window. There are many ways to copy the hand into the
         new document we are using to assemble the double-exposure. One method is to use the Move Tool to
         drag the hand layer (in this case, the Background layer is the hand layer) into a different document. Click
9.1 EXERCISE 1: USING LAYERS TO CREATE A DOUBLE-EXPOSURE  211

on the Move Tool in the Tool Panel (or press the V key on your keyboard), then click on the hand image
and drag it to the center of the double-exposure document we created in step 1. After you have copied
the hand into the double-exposure document, you may close the hand01.jpg document.

Alternately, the hand could have been copied and pasted using Select > Select All, then Edit > Copy, and finally clicking
on the new document before choosing Edit > Paste. Layers can also be dragged from the Layers panel into another
open document.

Notice that when the hand is dragged into the double-exposure document it appears very large. The hand
file contains more pixels than the double-exposure file does. We did this on purpose for two reasons: 1)
To demonstrate that the number of pixels in a document has a noticeable affect on the way that the file is
previewed in Photoshop® and 2) To distinguish the hand, originally a digital photo (the camera we used
stored a significant amount of information), from the new working file that we generated in step 1. You
can always create a new file with a higher resolution value, but for exercises that will not be printed it is
faster to work in a file with resolution no greater than the screen. The larger the resolution, the larger
the file size; and larger file sizes require greater computer processing power. Larger file sizes, requiring
212      XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         more processing power, tend to slow down the work process. In a learning environment, we try to avoid
         hindrances.

     3.  In the Layers Panel, double-click on the name "Layer 2"

         to rename that layer "hand01." Notice "Layer 1" beneath the "hand01" layer. Layer 1 is completely

         transparent. It was the first layer that Photoshop® generated when the new document was created. By

         moving the hand into the new document, we created a new layer. Click once on Layer 1 and then click on

         the trash can icon in the bottom right corner of the Layers Panel. At the "Delete the layer Layer 1"

         warning dialog box click "Yes." Now the layer hand01 is active (indicated by a blue highlight). To scale the

         hand so that it fits into the document, click Edit > Free Transform.

     4. When the image to be transformed does not run off the edges of the file document (as this one does), it
         is easy to transform it by using the arrows at one of the four corners of the transformation box to click
         and drag towards the center of the image. This type of transformation is similar to transforming objects
         in Illustrator®. Remember to always hold down the SHIFT key while scaling in order to maintain the
         proportions of the image. In a situation like this where we can't see the edges of the image's
         transformation box, it is easier to use the transform tools in the Options Panel at the top of the
         document. First click on the link icon between the width and height percentage boxes to maintain the
         image's aspect ratio (or proportions). Now enter 65% into either the width or height box and notice that
         the other box also takes on the 65% value. Press "Return" or "Enter" on your keypad to finalize the
9.1 EXERCISE 1: USING LAYERS TO CREATE A DOUBLE-EXPOSURE  213

transformation.

     Tool Tip: You can also confirm a transformation or a Type Tool setting in Photoshop® by clicking on the check-mark
     icon in the top right area of the Options Panel when you are using these tools. To get out of a transformation box,
     a crop box, or the Type Tool hit the Escape (ESC) key on the keypad, or use the delete icon in the top right area of
     Options.

5. Open hand02.jpg and use the Move Tool or another method to bring the image of the second hand into
    the double-exposure document. Notice that it has already been scaled for you. While the second hand
    (Layer 1 in the double-exposure document) is still active in the Layers Panel, click Edit > Transform >
    Flip Horizontal. The Transform submenu will modify any layer or a selection on any layer. It does not
    modify the entire document. Notice that this transformation only occurred on the second hand and not
    on the hand01 layer. Flip the image back to its original orientation by again clicking Edit > Transform >
    Flip Horizontal. In the Layers Panel, double-click on the name of Layer 1 to rename it, "hand02."
214  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     6. Next we'll use the Move Tool and Layer Blending Modes to move the separate layers into position.
         Clicking once on a layer in the Layers Panel sets it as the active layer. Whichever layer is active can be
         moved in the canvas area using the Move Tool. Make sure that the "hand02" layer is set as the active
         layer. Next, locate the pull-down menu that's set to "Normal" and is located above the Lock buttons in
         the Layers Panel. This is the Layer Blending Modes pull-down menu and is used to change the blending
         mode of the active layer. Click the Layer Blending Modes pull-down and choose "Multiply" to set the
         "hand02" to the Multiply Blending Mode. Leave the "hand01" layer in Normal mode. Blending modes
         define how layers interact. We will continue to explore these in the third exercise in this chapter.
9.1 EXERCISE 1: USING LAYERS TO CREATE A DOUBLE-EXPOSURE  215

Use the Move Tool on each of the layers so that they are positioned similar to what is shown in the
image below. The double-exposure happens in the area where the two images overlap. Multiply
blending mode allows us to see the two images together, as if they were photographed on the same
piece of film. In the next exercise we will crop the image so that only the double-exposure remains. Save
your work so far as a Photoshop® (PSD) file if you haven't done so already.
216                                                         XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     Your double-exposure should look something like this.
9.2 Exercise 2: Cropping and adjusting the hue

       1. Click on the Crop Tool in the Tool Panel (or press the C key on your keyboard) and notice the options for
            this tool in the Options Panel beneath the Photoshop® menu items. You'll see a pull-down menu with
            some crop presets, and boxes for numeric entry to the right of the pull-down menu. Set the pull-down to
            the W x H x Resolution preset, then enter 6 in into the crop Width box, 9 in into the Height box, and 72
            into the Resolution box.
            Upon entering values into the Width, Height, and Resolution boxes you will see a crop box appear over
            the canvas. Click and drag the crop box control handles to resize it so that you are cropping around the
            area of the document where the two layers overlap, similar to what is shown in the image below.

            Notice that the crop tool will only create a rectangular shape in the aspect ratio of 6:9 as you are dragging.

                                                                                                            217
218  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Finalize the crop by pressing Return or Enter on your keypad or by clicking the checkmark icon in the top
         right area of the Options Panel.

     2. Now we'll make some Hue/Saturation adjustments to the color of our double exposure, but we'll do this
         using what is known as a "non-destructive" editing technique. Remember when we made adjustments to
         Levels, Curves, and Hue/Saturation on the flower image in chapter 8? The changes we made with those
         adjustments permanently changed the pixels in that image. If we wanted to change them back or re-
         adjust, we'd have to start over with the original image.Non-destructive editing techniques use special
         features in Photoshop® that preserve the original image's pixel data while allowing changes to be made.
         Adjustment Layers are one such technique and can be added to a Photoshop® document by clicking
         on the Add Adjustment Layer button at the bottom of the Layers Panel (or by using Layer > New
         Adjustment Layer in the menu bar).
         Click the Add Adjustment Layer button at the bottom of the Layers Panel and notice that many of
         the adjustments available through the Image > Adjustments menu are available as Adjustment Layers.
         Choose Hue/Saturation... from the New Adjustment Layer menu in the Layers Panel to add a Hue/
         Saturation Adjustment Layer.

     3. When you add this Adjustment Layer you will notice the Properties Panel will open displaying controls
9.2 EXERCISE 2: CROPPING AND ADJUSTING THE HUE  219

like those you used before when making a Hue/Saturation adjustment. In the Properties Panel, check
the "Colorize" button and then use the Hue slider to create a cyan wash over the image. Click OK when
you are satisfied with the colorization.

Remember that you can always double-click on the Adjustment Layer's icon in the Layers Panel to access
the Properties Panel and modify the adjustment settings. Be sure the adjustment layer is in position as
the topmost layer so that it affects all visible layers beneath. Make sure to save your work when you are
finished with this step.

Tool Tip: Adjustment Layers can also be added using the Adjustments Panel. This panel has an icon for each of the
different types of Adjustment Layers that can be added to an image. Hover your mouse pointer over each icon and
you will see text describing the adjustment it represents. Simply click the icon for the adjustment you want and a new
Adjustment Layer will be added into your document just above the active layer.

EXERCISES 3 AND 4: EXQUISITE CORPSE (IN TWO PARTS)

The next two exercises in this chapter will take you through the process of creating an Exquisite Corpse image in
two parts.

"Exquisite corpse" (in French, cadaver exquis) is a parlor game that the Surrealists developed in 1925 (Wikipedia).
In this game, each player submits images (drawings, paintings, photographs) of heads, torsos and legs which are
combined to produce surprising bodily results. I have played this game with students using images of each other
that we captured in class on a digital camera as well as by using images from pop culture, found on the web. In
the past, we have placed Lindsay Lohan's head on John Goodman's body, George W. Bush's head on Paris Hilton's
9.2 EXERCISE 2: CROPPING AND ADJUSTING THE HUE  221

body (with the dog), and so on. Images of my students included in this chapter's downloaded Work Files, but it's
more fun to try this with pictures of your friends or family!
9.3 Creating and manipulating layers

       1. We'll use the double-exposure file that we just created as a starting point, so use File > Save As and save
            the file as ch9-yourlastname-exquisite-corpse.psd. Your file should look like the image in the screen
            capture below.

       2. Keep ch9-yourlastname-exquisite-corpse.psd open and use File > Open in Photoshop® to open all of
            the documents used in this exercise (from the downloaded Work Files, the files are: arm.psd, back.psd,
            ear.psd, head.psd, shoes.psd, and torso.psd). The files will open as individual tabs in the main
            Photoshop® window.

       3. Move all of the body parts into the exquisite-corpse document, just as we moved the hands into the
            double-exposure document in Exercise 1. Once all of the parts are on separate layers in the exquisite-
            corpse document, rename all of the layers to indicate which body part is on the layer. You can use the
            eyeball icon for each layer in the Layers Panel to hide and show the layer and quickly assess which
            image each layer contains. You can close the files for the various parts after you've added them all as

                                                                                                            222
9.3 CREATING AND MANIPULATING LAYERS                                              223

layers, make sure to keep your exquisite-corpse image open (and save your work!)

4. Click on a layer and drag it above or below another layer. The order of the layers in the Layers Panel is
    referred to as the "stacking order". This determines which image appears in the foreground (closer to
    the viewer's eyes) and which images fall to the background. Organize the layers so that they appear like
    the stacking order in the screen capture above. Notice that our Layers Panel has a left and right arm! We
    named our arm layer "right arm" then used the menu item Layer > Duplicate Layer... and named the
    duplicate layer, "left arm." Do this in your own file then, making sure "left arm" is the active layer, use
    Edit > Transform > Flip Vertical to flip the left arm and then Edit > Transform > Flip Horizontal to
    distinguish it from the right arm.
224  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     5. Click on each layer to activate it, then use the Move Tool to reposition the layer and Edit > Free
         Transform to scale it. Some of the layers will need to be scaled and moved in the stacking order if you
         want your exquisite corpse to look just like ours. When scaling, remember to hold the SHFT key while
         dragging on one of the four anchor corners in the Free Transform box to maintain proportion - or to link
         the width and height values if you are using the Options Panel to make the transformation. Also, be
         aware that it is safe to scale an image down in Photoshop®; however, it is typically not a good idea to
         scale an image up (or to make an image larger than it is) as this will create new interpolated pixel
         information in the image and will result in a degradation of image quality.
         Once you've finished this step save your file and move on to Exercise 4.
9.3 CREATING AND MANIPULATING LAYERS                                      225

Here is the stacking order for the layers in our exquisite corpse image.
9.4 Exercise 4: Adding an adjustment to specific layers

In this exercise we want to add an Adjustment Layer to the top of the Layers Panel, in order to bring some variation
in color into the composition.

       1. Make sure the top layer in your Layers Panel is your active layer. Add an adjustment layer for Hue/
            Saturation and use the "Colorize" button again to add a wash of orange. Notice that we've encountered a
            problem here - this adjustment colorizes the entire document and overrides the cyan Hue/Saturation
            layer we added previously. We want to retain those colors in our composition so we'll need to solve this
            problem.

                                                                                                            226
9.4 EXERCISE 4: ADDING AN ADJUSTMENT TO SPECIFIC LAYERS  227

     Oh no, we've lost our cyan! Don't worry, there's a solution...

2. Fortunately, current versions of Photoshop® give us an easy solution. Our first step will be to group the
    layers that we want the Hue/Saturation adjustment to colorize. To do this, click on the "ear" layer to
    activate it, then hold down the SHFT key, and click on the last layer in the stacking order above the
    adjustment layer from Exercise 2. This will select all of the layers that make up our exquisite corpse.

3. Next, click on the Layers Panel Pull-Down Menu in the top right corner of the panel and choose "Create
    Group From Layers..." In the New Group From Layers dialog box, name the new group, "corpse." This
    will make a new folder in the Layers Panel for all of the body parts. Layer Groups are used to help keep
    the Photoshop® Layers Panel organized and work in a similar fashion as Illustrator® Layers in that they
    contain the layers that comprise different parts of a Photoshop® document.
228  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     With layers selected for grouping, choose "Create Group from Layers..." in the Layers Panel menu.
9.4 EXERCISE 4: ADDING AN ADJUSTMENT TO SPECIFIC LAYERS  229

Creating a Group from our selected Layers.

Notice there's a thin arrow to the left of the "corpse" group's folder icon. Clicking that arrow will expand
the group so that you can see the layers it contains. Expand your "corpse" group so that your Layers Panel
looks like ours in the second image below.
230  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          Clicking the arrow next to a Layer Group's folder icon will expand or collapse that Layer Group.
     4. Now we come to the solution to our Hue/Saturation conflict. Hold the ALT/OPT key while moving your

         mouse pointer over the line between the top Hue/Saturation adjustment layer and the "corpse" layer
         group. You will see the cursor change to an icon that looks like a square next to a downward-pointing
         arrow.

          Watch for this cursor as you move your mouse pointer between layers while holding the Alt/Option key.
         When you see this cursor change, click the mouse button. This will create a clipping group between the
         adjustment layer and the merged layer. Now the adjustment layer will only affect the merged layer. The
         background images should appear cyan again.
9.4 EXERCISE 4: ADDING AN ADJUSTMENT TO SPECIFIC LAYERS  231

     Our result after clipping the "Hue/Saturation 2" Adjustment Layer into the "corpse" Layer Group.

5. Make sure that the "corpse" Layer Group is active, then use the Blending Mode Pull-Down Menu in the
    Layers Panel to set the group's mode to Linear Light and enter 50% for the Layer Opacity (to the right of
    the Blending Mode Pull-Down Menu). A decreased opacity enables the viewer to see through the a layer
    or layer group, and helps to blend it with the layers underneath. Sometimes these methods can create a
    murky image where the foreground and background are hard to decipher. Remember that every image
    communicates a message, so you'll want to be aware if certain blending modes or other techniques
    result in a loss of clarity in your composition.
232  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

             Set the "corpse" layer group's blend mode to Linear Light and set its Opacity to 50%

You've finished the exquisite corpse! Your result should resemble the image below. Save your work and take a
break, you've earned it!

DIGITAL MANIPULATION
Digital tools empower content producers to parody graphic content both on and off of the screen. Media-makers
have the ability to change the appearance of virtually anything with tools such as copy, paste, mask and clone.
So the question is: given the opportunity to change any image, message, or text, where would you begin? Your
answer depends upon your interests, but usually emerges from political tension. In other words, the oppressed
can reclaim messages of the dominant paradigm by altering the symbolism embedded in words or images in the
physical and/or digital world. These messages might appear in museums, on city streets or in cyberspace.
The "subversive" part of the message-making is the way in which the aesthetics of the altered media rely upon the
viewer's visual and intellectual understanding of the dominant culture prior to media confrontation. The Billboard
Liberation Front and The Anti-Advertising Agency create work that illustrate this idea. Not too surprisingly, this
counter-cultural, playful method of protest has already been co-opted by the advertising industry.

                                                                                                            235

In No Logo, Naomi Klein illustrates how advertisers are utilizing methods common to contemporary artists to
create brand awareness. She writes, "Pepsi's on-going threat to project its logo onto the moon's surface hasn't
yet materialized, but Mattel did paint an entire street in Salford, England, `a shriekingly bright bubblegum hue' of
pink - houses, porches, trees, road, sidewalk, dogs, and cars were all accessories in the televised celebrations of
Barbie Pink Month. Barbie is but one small part of the ballooning $30 billion `experiential communication' industry,
the phrase now used to encompass the staging of such branded pieces of corporate performance art and other
`happenings.'" (See No Logo, Naomi Klein, New York: Picador 9-12.)

The Billboard Liberation Front is a group of San
Franciscan message-makers who aim to repurpose
and "improve" billboard messages by painting or
pasting on top of preexisting billboards. The group
began their mission in 1977 and have grown into a
worldwide phenomena by collecting images on the
web. From The Billboard Liberation Front Manifesto:

"And so we see, the Ad defines our world, creating both
the focus on "image" and the culture of consumption
that ultimately attract and inspire all individuals Image: BLF
desirous of communicating to their fellow man in a
profound fashion. It is clear that He who controls the Ad speaks with the voice of our Age." (Jack Napier and John
Thomas).

You can read the entire manifesto at: http://www.billboardliberation.com/manifesto.html

The Anti-Advertising Agency creates subversive media
in opposition to the role of advertising in
contemporary society. Many of their projects are
participatory, which means that viewers become
"doers" or art-makers. In People Products 123,
participants download package designs that feature
images and information about the workers
responsible for producing the consumable product.
The package designs are to be printed by the
participant, repackaged around the product, and
"shop-dropped" in the store where an unassuming
shopper would purchase the product contained in the
newly informative packaging.

10.1 Exercise 1: Replace part of one image using the
Clone Stamp Tool

In this exercise, we will use two images in the public domain from the US government. The first all-female C-130
crew, and a historic image of Amelia Earhart.

       1. Open the file first_all_female_crew.jpg in Photoshop®. Zoom in on the central figure of the crew, Capt.
            Carol J. Mitchell. We will start by replacing her head with a sample of the flag and will do this using a non-
            destructive approach. By non-destructive, we mean that the original pixels in the photo will not be
            permanently changed by our edits. Start by using the Rectangular Marquee Tool to create a
            rectangular selection around Capt. Mitchell's head.

                                                                                                            237
238  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     2. Zoom out so you can see more of the flag above her head. Place your cursor inside the selected area
         and notice that as long as any selection tool is active (and specifically, the Move Tool is not active), the
         the cursor changes into a white arrow with a small rectangular selection icon. When you see this cursor,
         click and drag the rectangular selection up straight above the figure's head - you are only moving the
         selection itself. No pixels in the image are being moved.
10.1 EXERCISE 1: REPLACE PART OF ONE IMAGE USING THE CLONE STAMP TOOL  239

3. Copy the flag from the background layer and paste it. Edit > Copy followed by Edit > Paste will create a
    new layer (CMD+C followed by CMD+V will do the same). Name the new layer, "flag." Then, using the
    Move Tool (press V on your keyboard), click and drag in the canvas to move the "flag" layer so that it is
    positioned over Capt. Mitchell's face as shown below. Once you have the copied section of flag roughly
    in position, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge it pixel-by-pixel into place. See if you
240  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     can get the stripes of the "flag" layer to match up with the original image behind it.
     Save your work as a PSD named ch10-yourlastname-amelia-crew.psd before continuing.

     Hotkey: CMD+J is the hot key for "float," which will copy and paste part of a layer onto a new layer directly on top of
     the selection.

     4. You'll likely notice that the pixels on your "flag" layer stand out from the rest of the flag. We'll use the
         Clone Stamp Tool to clean that up and help everything blend together more seamlessly. The Clone
         Stamp Tool is a special brush that replaces small areas of a layer with a sample from another area of the
         canvas or a separate image.
         Activate the Clone Stamp Tool in the Tool Panel (or press S on your keyboard) and then use the Options
         Bar to set the brush Size to about 20px and the Hardness to about 10% (access these controls by
         pressing the brush settings down-arrow button in the Options Bar as shown in the screen capture
         below). Using a soft brush will help the cloned sample appear to blend into the original image, even
         though we will do all of our cloning on a new layer.
         Also, make sure that the "Aligned" button is checked and that the Sample pull-down menu is set to
10.1 EXERCISE 1: REPLACE PART OF ONE IMAGE USING THE CLONE STAMP TOOL  241

"Current & Below" (this last setting will allow us to clone into an empty layer with samples from the other
visible layers).

     Compare your Clone Stamp Tool Options to those in this screen capture.

     Tip: The open and close bracket keys on the keyboard (usually just to the right of the P key) are the hotkeys used to
     increase and decrease the brush size without using any menus or dialog boxes. Holding down Shift while pressing
     the brackets will adjust the brush hardness/softness.

5. Now for the most important part of this exercise - sample parts of the flag in order to blend the areas
    around the edges where the copy and pasted image is an obvious manipulation.
    First, create a new layer and name it "clone". We'll be brushing our sampled pixels into this layer in order
    to maintain a non-destructive approach.
    Before you can paint with the Clone Stamp Tool, you must define a sample source point. For best results,
    you want to choose a source point that is similar to the area that you want to clone into. For example,
    the upper left corner of our "flag" layer doesn't quite match the flag image around it. We'll want to find a
    portion of the image that is similar to that area and use it as our sample point, such as a bit above that
    top left corner of our "flag" layer's pixels.
    To define the sample point, place your cursor over part of the original flag image, then press and hold the
    ALT/OPT key. You'll see the cursor change to a crosshair cursor. Position the crosshair right over the edge
    of the flag's red stripe, a bit above the top corner of your "flag" layer's pixels. Click your mouse once to
    define that point as the clone source.
242  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     With the Clone Stamp Tool active, hold down the ALT/OPT key and click the crosshairs at a point above your pasted flag
     pixels, right along the edge of the red flag stripe.
     Next, position the mouse on top of the corner where the pasted flag needs to be blended and click once
     to cover it with a soft, brushed sample. Pay close attention to the brush work. Determine if the first
     click is blended or not by looking at the surrounding values. Decide if your new sample is blending in.
     If it does, move on to the next area. You'll get best results by ALT/OPT+clicking to create a new sample
     before brushing into each area. If the first click did not blend perfectly (it probably didn't - this takes some
     practice), use CMD+Z to undo the last step and try it again.

     Tip: Notice that once you have defined a sample source point, the Clone Stamp Tool brush shows a preview of the
10.1 EXERCISE 1: REPLACE PART OF ONE IMAGE USING THE CLONE STAMP TOOL  243

cloned pixels inside its cursor circle. You can use this to match up your cloned pixels precisely before clicking to paint
them in. If you don't have a good match, ALT/OPT+click to re-define your sample source point.

Line up the Clone Stamp Tool's clone preview with the spot on your image you want to clone into. Click once to stamp the
clone into place. In some areas you may be able to click and drag to clone a nice blend, other areas will require re-defining
the sample point.

Be careful with your application of the Clone Stamp Tool. The soft brush creates a little bit of a blur on
the image. A small amount of blur is necessary in order for the sample to blend in, but clicking with the
soft brush repeatedly will result in a blurry area in your image. Remember, the purpose of our cloning
is to create a seamless and unidentifiable image hoax. Creating a blurry area on the image will be draw
attention to that area. In order to achieve the hoax, the clone must be made in such a way that the viewer
is deceived! You may find that some areas require making your brush smaller to get the sample stamp
just right.

Work around all of the edges by creating a new ALT/OPT+click to sample the flag and then click with the
brush to apply the clone. CMD+Z will be used often in this process! We finished the clone in about 25-30
precise mouse clicks.
244  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          Our result after cloning. The pasted patch of flag now blends in much better!

     6. View the clone layer by turning the eyeball icons off of all of the other layers. Here is what ours looked
         like when we were finished:
10.1 EXERCISE 1: REPLACE PART OF ONE IMAGE USING THE CLONE STAMP TOOL  245

Turn the other layer's eyeball icons back on and Save your work.
10.2 Exercise 2: Add Amelia Earhart to the image of the
crew

       1. Since the image of Amelia Earhart was originally a black and white photograph, we should change the
            image of the Air Force crew into grayscale. In keeping with our non-destructive approach, we'll do this by
            adding a Black and White Adjustment Layer on top of the clone layer. Apply the adjustment by clicking
            the Black & White Adjustment icon in the Adjustments panel (if you don't see the Adjustments panel, use
            the menu Window > Adjustments to show it). The default settings for the Black & White Adjustment
            Layer will be sufficient for our needs, so you don't need to change any settings after adding the
            Adjustment Layer.

       2. Open the image of Amelia Earhart, select her head and neck with the Rectangular Marquee tool and
            choose Edit > Copy. Toggle back to the Photoshop® document and choose Edit > Paste. Use Edit >

                                                                                                            246
10.2 EXERCISE 2: ADD AMELIA EARHART TO THE IMAGE OF THE CREW                                      247

Free Transform (Command+T) and hold Shift while scaling Amelia Earhart's head down so it is in
proportion with the body. Finalize your transformation by pressing the Enter key or clicking the
checkmark button in the Options Bar. Name the new layer "Amelia".
10.3 Exercise 3: Add a layer mask

Layer Masks are a special component of Photoshop® layers that can hide portions of a layer's pixels. Layer Masks
do not delete or alter image data, they simply hide or show parts of images based on the use of black (hidden),
white (revealed), and shades of gray (transparent, partially hidden) in the mask portion of the layer. Layer Masks
are a very useful tool in non-destructive editing and are much more forgiving than using the eraser tool. We will
use a Layer Mask on the Amelia layer to blend her into the new background.

Note: Other types of masks include clipping masks (see Exercise 4 in Chapter 9) and vector masks, where vector data instead
of bitmap data determines what is black and what is white. We will work with layer masks in this chapter and in Chapter 11.

       1. Create a layer mask on the Amelia layer with the Add layer mask button at the bottom of the Layers
            panel. This mask will hide the background around Amelia's head. Notice that the layer now has a
            thumbnail icon for the layer's image and an icon for its mask. Photoshop® indicates which part of the
            layer you are working on by framing the corners of its icon in the Layers panel with white brackets. The
            title bar in the document also reflects the area that is currently active. You can see from these indicators
            that the Layer Mask in the Amelia layer is active.

                                                                                                            248
10.3 EXERCISE 3: ADD A LAYER MASK  249

2. Activate the Brush tool (B on the keyboard) and make sure that the default colors are loaded into the
    foreground/background color chips (black as foreground, white as the background color) by clicking on
    the small black/white color chip icon to the top left area of the actual color chips in the Tools panel. Then
    click the angled double arrow icon next to the default colors button. This will swap the foreground and
    background colors, setting black as the foreground.

     Key Command: Press the letter D on the keyboard to set the foreground and background color chips to the default
     setting of black and white, respectively. Press the X key to swap the foreground and background colors. Swapping
     foreground and background will be very useful when you're working on the Layer Mask.

3. Notice that the icon for the mask is white in the Layers panel. Since the entire mask is white, none of the
    layer's image pixels are currently hidden. With the Layer Mask active, painting in the canvas with black
    paint will add black to the mask and will hide those areas of the layer's image pixels. If you make a
    mistake, switch to white paint to retrieve hidden parts of the image. Practice painting with black and
    white paint. Paint with different size brushes and notice what happens with a soft or hard brush, or with
    different brush opacity settings.
250  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     Painting into the Layer Mask with black hides image pixels in the Amelia layer.

     We used a soft brush for the background area and kept it far away from Amelia's head. As we brushed
     closer to her hair, we reduced the opacity of the brush in the Options bar to about 40%. At a reduced
     opacity, clicking a few times near her head with black paint removes the background while keeping her
     hair from being cut to an unnatural shape. We also used a soft brush on her neck so that it blended
     smoothly with the neck in the crew photo.
     Watch Out: Do not delete image data. Do not use the eraser. Using the eraser is destructive editing. Now
     that you are learning to use Layer Masks, you can practice making non-destructive edits. This technique
     is so important that it is the dominant topic in Chapter 11.

     One more detail: we added a Layer Mask to the flag layer in order to hide part of the flag that was covering
     the collar in the original image. Our finished result is shown here:
10.3 EXERCISE 3: ADD A LAYER MASK  251
10.4 Exercise 4: Matching levels and image quality

The last steps are to correct Amelia's skin tones and match the quality of the images. Notice that Amelia's
photograph was taken outdoors, while the Air Force crew was indoors. The harsh light on Amelia's face is
noticeably different from the light on the rest of the crew's faces. We will make a quick adjustment to Amelia's skin
tone in order to create a more realistic collage.
One method of making this adjustment would be to use the Burn Tool on the image pixels of the Amelia
layer. Burning and dodging are photographic manipulations native to the traditional darkroom. In the darkroom,
additional exposure time increases the amount of light hitting the paper. This can be done selectively, resulting
in a "burned" area of the image. Burning darkens the value of that portion of the print. Light can also be blocked
during the exposure by dodging over image areas where the tonal values are too dark with a small tool, resulting
in a lightened area of the print. Photoshop® has Burn and Dodge Tools to provide a digital equivalent to their
traditional darkroom counterparts.
However, using the Burn Tool in this case is a destructive method and we want to stick with non-destructive
methods so that we can continue to make adjustments without permanently altering the pixels in any of our
layers. We'll work with Amelia's skin tones using a Levels Adjustment Layer to achieve the results we want instead
of using the destructive Burn Tool.

       1. With the Amelia layer set as your active layer, add a Levels Adjustment Layer. We only want this to adjust
            Amelia's head, so make sure to clip the Levels Adjustment Layer into the Amelia layer. (Remember
            clipping from the Exquisite Corpse exercise in the last chapter?).

                                                                                                            252
10.4 EXERCISE 4: MATCHING LEVELS AND IMAGE QUALITY  253

     Make sure to clip the Levels 1 layer into the Amelia layer (hold ALT/OPT and click the line between those two layers in the
     Layers Panel.
2. In the Properties Panel, use the white slider on the black-white spectrum bar to limit the white values.
    This will bring the tone of the highlights on Amelia's face down to match the other people in the image.
    We adjusted the slider so that the white Output Levels were at about 220.

3. Next, adjust the midtone slider in the histogram area of the Properties panel (it's a flat histogram, but it's
    still a histogram) until the midtones in Amelia's face are closer to those of the other crew members. We
    went with a midtone value of about 0.94 to start with. The beauty of using an Adjustment layer is that
    you can adjust the lightness or darkness until you have an accurate match, and re-adjust later if you
    decide your first round of changes wasn't quite right.
254  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     4. Our final manipulation will be to match the quality of the images. We're obviously working with two
         photographs taken many years apart from each other, and that shows in the quality of one image
         compared to the other. The photo of the crew is much clearer than that of Amelia. Since we can't
         enhance the quality of Amelia's photo, the approach in situations like these is to reduce the quality of
         the better image so that it matches the lowest quality image in the composition.
         We'll do this by using a combination of filters. Since filters alter pixels, we'll also want to use Photoshop®
         Smart Objects to allow this step to be done non-destructively. In your Layers panel, click the Background
         layer so that it is the active layer. Then hold down the Shift key on your keyboard and click the clone
         layer, this should select the clone, flag, and Background layers. With those three layers selected, click the
         menu button in the upper right of the Layers Panel and select "Convert to Smart Object".
10.4 EXERCISE 4: MATCHING LEVELS AND IMAGE QUALITY  255

The Smart Object you've created looks like a layer named "clone" but has a thumbnail showing the full
crew image and a Smart Object icon. Rename the Smart Object layer "crew".
256  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         A Smart Object combines the selected layers into one layer, but retains their ability to be edited. If you
         want to edit layers within a Smart Object, double click the Smart Object's thumbnail icon in the Layers
         Panel and the embedded layers will be opened as a separate tab. This is kind of like having a PSD within
         your PSD. The advantage of converting to a Smart Object is that filters can be applied to the Smart Object
         in a way that allows them to be re-adjusted. You'll see in the next step.

     5. When looking at the quality difference between the images, Amelia's image is fuzzier and has more
         noticeable film grain. Let's start by softening the quality of the crew image (now our Smart Object). WIth
         the "crew" layer active, use the Menu Bar and choose Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur... then, in the
         Gaussian Blur dialog box, adjust the Radius until the quality of the crew image looks like a better match
         to Amelia's photo. Make sure "Preview" is checked so you can see the effect in your composite image
         while you make adjustments. It won't take much blur, maybe around a 0.6 radius. When you're happy
         with your amount of blur, click OK.
10.4 EXERCISE 4: MATCHING LEVELS AND IMAGE QUALITY  257

6. Now let's add some grain to the crew image. Choose Filter > Noise > Add Noise... from the Menu Bar.
    The Add Noise filter adds a graininess to an image. You'll notice though that the noise isn't being blurred
    and has a sharper quality than the grain in Amelia's photo. For now, accept the default settings for Add
    Noise and click OK.
258  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     7. Here's where the power of Smart Objects and Smart Filters really becomes clear. In your Layers Panel,
         notice that the "crew" layer now has two Smart Filters. Each Smart Filter has an eyeball icon that can be
         used to turn the filter off or on. You can also click and drag on each individual Smart Filter to re-order
         them. Click on the Add Noise filter in the Layers Panel and drag it so that it is below the Gaussian Blur
         filter - you'll see the noise is now blurred!
10.4 EXERCISE 4: MATCHING LEVELS AND IMAGE QUALITY  259

8. Now that the Add Noise Smart Filter is underneath the Gaussian Blur Smart Filter, we can go back into
    Add Noise and re-adjust until the two photos match better in quality. To do this, double-click on name of
    the Add Noise Smart Filter in the Layers Panel. You'll see a message notifying you that the Smart Filters
    stacked on top of Add Noise will not preview while you're making adjustments - this means you won't
260  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     see blur effect when adjusting the amount of noise, so you'll need to make a best guess. Click OK in that
     message and you'll then the same Add Noise dialog box you used when adding the filter. Adjust the
     amount of noise to a level you think will make the images feel like they're equivalent, then click OK. You
     may need to repeat this process, fine-tuning the amount of noise until you are satisfied with the results.
     If necessary, you can double-click the Gaussian Blur Smart Filter and adjust it as well, and you may wish
     to adjust the Levels 1 midtones.
     Once you are happy with your results, Save your work. You're finished with this chapter!

Our final result.

SCREENCASTS
This screencast combines elements of Chapter 6 (the Pen tool) with elements of Chapter 11 (layer masks). It does
not correspond specifically with materials in this chapter, but it is related. Students have provided feedback that it
is helpful to see these complex tools in action.
NON-DESTRUCTIVE EDITING
In Chapter 9 we referred to Hippolyte Bayard's Self Portrait as a Drowned Man from 1840 as the first combination
print. The history of photographic manipulation extends almost as far back as the first photographic images.
Digital tools such as Photoshop are used for small and large image manipulations, such as the slightest adjustment
to tonal range or the creation of an alternative reality.

                                                                                                            263
264  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

Note: See this link for a group exhibit in 2000 at the Laurence Miller Gallery titled Alternative Realities.

In certain situations, the digital artist must be ethically aware of the manipulation that occurs in such applications.
The National Press Photographers Association maintains a code of ethics that journalism students and
professionals should abide. Journalists and news photographers strive for accuracy in their image-based
reporting. There are historical cases of digital manipulation which are often used to illustrate a violation of the
NPPA code of ethics (see the National Geographic 1982 cover image of the pyramids).

Note: Click here for the NPAA code of ethics.

For the purpose of art-making, editorial or opinionated commentary, manipulation can be used to challenge the
viewer's expectations. An image can be reinterpreted as it relates to other images within a composition through
the modification of scale or proximity. The visual reference to Philippe Halsmann's Dali Atomicus demonstrates a
manipulation of reality, or the laws of physics, made with a 4 by 5 camera in his studio. This image was captured
after "six hours and twenty-eight throws," wrote Halsman in Halsman on the Creation of Photographic Ideas
(1963).
The visual reference to Dada artist Kurt Schwitters' Dada Soiree demonstrates that typography can also be
manipulated in the construction of a collage. While neither of these visual works were created in a digital
environment (both were made before the advent of digital tools), alternate realities and manipulations are often
created with computer software. Within the exercises of this chapter, we will focus not only on manipulating an
image, but also on working in a non-destructive method. To edit the digital file non-destructively is to work in such
a way that the original image is preserved. Any edits or modifications to the original file are placed on separate
layers or in alpha channels, which we will explore further in exercise 2. As we have seen in previous chapters, non-
destructive editing also involves the use of layer masks and adjustment layers.

11.1 Exercise 1: Using Quick Masks and Alpha Channels

Photoshop® Quick Masks and Alpha Channels provide a method of working with selections that is similar to
working with the Layer Masks you were introduced to in Chapter 10. They can be very helpful when creating a
selection that you'll want to use more than once.

       1. In Photoshop®, use File > Open to open the file of Salvador Dali holding a cat from this chapter's
            Download Files.

       2. Use the Lasso Tool from the Toolbar to make a selection around the left part of Dali's mustache. The
            Lasso Tool can be used to make freehand selections. Click and hold with the Lasso Tool near the
            beginning of of the mustache and drag all the way around its contour. The selection is made when you
            bring the mouse pointer back to the point where you started and then release the mouse button. It's
            okay if your selection is not be a perfect tracing of the mustache, we will modify the selection in the next
            step. The Lasso tool serves the purpose of making a fast draft of a selection which can be used as a
            starting point for masks.

                                                                                                            267
268  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     3. Enter Quick Mask Mode by pressing the "Q" key on the keyboard or clicking on the Quick Mask icon at
         the bottom of the Toolbar, just beneath the foreground/background color chip icons. Quick Mask Mode
         will put a red tint over all of the image areas that are not selected. This makes selected areas easily
         visible and provides another way to modify a selection, similar to other masks in the Adobe® Creative
         Suite® programs (like Photoshop® Layer Masks). Learning to use Quick Mask Mode will help you to
         understand masking.
         Remember, Masks define which areas are visible and which image areas are invisible. Masks do not delete
         image areas (this is why we have classified this as "non-destructive"), they simply are used to hide or show
         parts of images. Since masks are either hiding or showing image areas (or partially showing), they operate
         in black and white and create transparency with shades of gray.

     4. Click on the Brush Tool and make sure that the default colors are loaded into the foreground/
         background color chips (black on top, white as the background color) by clicking on the small black/white
         color chip icon to the top left area of the actual color chips in the Toolbox.
11.1 EXERCISE 1: USING QUICK MASKS AND ALPHA CHANNELS  269

Tip: Pressing the "D" key on the keyboard will load black into the foreground color and white into the background
color chip. These are the default color positions.

As you've learned previously, in a Layer Mask the color black will hide part of the image and the color
white will reveal part of the image. Quick Mask Mode works in a similar way, with the red overlay
representing where you have painted with black or white to add or remove the to mask. Painting with
white paint on the Quick Mask will take away red parts (masked parts). The big difference between Quick
Mask and a Layer Mask is that the Quick Mask is actually creating a selection rather than hiding/revealing
image pixels. The "masked" areas (painted with black and represented by the red mask) are areas that are
not selected, while "unmasked" areas (painted with white, no red overlay) represent selected areas.

In other words, painting with black in the Quick Mask will add to the mask and subtract from the selection
area. Practice painting with black and white paint. Paint with different size brushes and notice what
happens with a soft or hard brush, or with the brush set at different opacities. As you are painting, press
the letter "Q" to exit Quick Mask Mode. You will see the resulting selection. Press "Q" again to re-enter
Quick Mask Mode and continue painting to modify the mask. After a little experimentation like this, you'll
begin to see how Quick Mask Mode allows you to use painting tools to create and/or refine a selection,
instead of being limited to only using the selection tools (marquee, magic wand, lasso, etc.).

Use Quick Mask Mode to refine and clean up the selection you made around Dali's mustache

     Our final brushwork in Quick Mask Mode and the resulting selection in Standard Editing Mode.

5. Exit Quick Mask and return to Standard Editing Mode when you are finished modifying the selection in
    Quick Mask Mode. Your selection should now more closely fit the contour of the mustache.
270  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          Here is an image of our Lasso tool selection before Quick Mask and the final selection after making modifications with the
          Paintbrush in Quick Mask.

     6. Choose Select > Save Selection and name the new selection left mustache. Click OK.

     7. When a selection is saved it becomes an Alpha Channel. An alpha channel is a grayscale channel that
         defines which parts of an image are visible. All channels can be viewed individually by clicking on their
         names in the Channels Panel.
         Click on the Channels tab in the Layers Panel, then click on the name, left mustache. The file now shows
         the left mustache alpha channel. Everything that is not included in the mask is black, and the once
         selected shape of the left side of the mustache is white.

         You can also think of an Alpha Channel as a Layer Mask that's not attached to a specific layer. Saving a
         selection as an Alpha Channel allows you to re-use that selection when needed without having to re-build
         it from scratch.
11.1 EXERCISE 1: USING QUICK MASKS AND ALPHA CHANNELS  271

8. Click back on the Gray channel in the Channels Panel to return to Standard Editing Mode. Deselect the
    left side of the mustache by choosing Select > Deselect from the menu bar or use the key command,
    Cmd+D.
    Now, we'll reselect the left side of the mustache by loading our saved selection from the Alpha Channel
272  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     we created. Start by holding down the Cmd key on your keyboard. Next, move your mouse pointer over
     thumbnail image of the left mustache Alpha Channel in the Channels Panel and click the thumbnail once.

          When holding Cmd and positioning your mouse pointer over an Alpha Channel thumbnail, you will see a "Load As
          Selection" cursor. Click once to load that Alpha Channel as a selection on your canvas.
         You should see the selection appear around the left side of Dali's mustache again. This is referred to
         as "loading" a selection. Practice deselecting and then loading the Alpha Channel to re-select by using
         Cmd+D (deselect) then Cmd+click (reselect) on the alpha channel.

          Windows users: Remember that you will use the Ctrl key instead of Cmd for any Cmd+ operations..

     9. Use File > Save As... to save your work as a PSD named ch11-yourlastname-dali-cat.psd
11.2 Exercise 2: Saving a selection on a layer mask

Important Note: The remaining exercises have many steps, so make sure to save your work often as you step through.
You don't want to risk having to start over if Photoshop® crashes while you're working!

       1. To start this exercise, make sure you have loaded the left mustache selection from your Alpha Channel.
       2. Duplicate the selected pixels into a new layer by pressing Cmd+J on your keyboard (or you could copy

            and paste using the Edit menu or Cmd+C and Cmd+V key commands).
       3. Rename the Background layer to "original image" and the copied Layer 1 to "left mustache".

       4. Make sure that "left mustache" is your active layer. Use the Move Tool to position the mustache on the
            left side of the cat's face.

                                                                                                            273
274  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     Watch Out: If the left mustache layer was not active (highlighted) you may have moved the layer containing the
     original image. Make sure the layer that you want to edit is active before editing.

     Now we'll rotate the mustache to match the angle of the cat's head. Use Edit > Free Transform (or
     Cmd+T) to activate the transformation bounding box. Before you start rotating, move the Free
     Transform's reference point from the center of the bounding box to the right end of the mustache by
     clicking and dragging the center crosshairs as shown below. This will allow you to rotate from that point
     instead of from the center of the layer's pixels. Rotate the mustache and press the Enter key on your
     keyboard to finalize the transformation.

     1) Click and drag the Transform bounding box's reference point; 2) position the reference point over the right end of the
     mustache; 3) rotate the mustache into position. (Your movement coordinates and rotation angle don't have to match the
     numbers in the images.)

     Finally, add a Levels Adjustment Layer and clip it to the left mustache layer. Adjust the levels to make the
     mustache darker. We will add a final adjustment for contrast at the end of this exercise, but making this
     adjustment now will make our next steps easier to see.
11.2 EXERCISE 2: SAVING A SELECTION ON A LAYER MASK                                                         275

     Darken the cat's mustache with a clipped Levels Adjustment layer so that it's easier to see.

5. Now we will add a mask to the left mustache layer in order to further refine how the layer blends with
    the original image. Make sure the "left mustache" layer is your active layer, then add a layer mask by
    clicking on the Add Layer Mask button in the bottom of the Layers Panel.
276  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     6. Zoom in to at least 100% before editing the mask. Notice that the layer mask's thumbnail icon in the
         Layers Panel is white (everything on the layer is revealed) by default.The mask is currently active in the
         Layers Panel. Remember, you can tell which part of the layer is active - the content or the mask - by the
         white brackets framing around corners of the icon for the active layer component.

          Tip: Click on the icon of the layer content or the layer mask to activate either layer component.

         Now we will blend the edges of the mustache using the Brush Tool on the layer mask. This will make the
         mustache appear more realistic on the cat's face. Click on the Brush Tool in the Tool Panel (or press the B
         key on your keyboard), then get set up with the following steps:

                   Make sure black is set as your foreground color. Black will be used on the mask to hide parts of
                      the layer content.

                   Use Window > Brush to show the Brush Panel. Adjust your Brush settings to a big, soft brush.
                      We set our brush size to 40 pixels with a 20% hardness. We also find that setting the Spacing to
                      1% results in a much smoother painting experience.
11.2 EXERCISE 2: SAVING A SELECTION ON A LAYER MASK  277

Now, paint just around the edges of the mustache with the edge of the Brush Tool brushing against the
edge of the mustache. You may need to increase or decrease your brush size while painting - remember
that you can use the ] key to increase brush size and the [ key to decrease.

Tip: In Photoshop® Preferences (press Cmd+K), go to the Cursors settings and select "Full Size Brush Tip" under
"Painting Cursors". This will show a more accurate brush cursor when using a soft brush and will make it easier to tell
where your brush edge is, including the soft fade.
278  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          Use a soft brush in your layer mask to clean up the edges of the mustache

     7. When you have finished painting into your layer mask and are satisfied with your blending of the
         mustache edges, zoom out to "Fit on Screen" viewing mode by using Cmd+0 and then view the image
         with and without the layer mask. Shft+click on the mask icon to disable the mask. Then Shft+click again
         on the mask icon to enable it. This is a way that you can check how much of a difference your mask has
         made compared to the unmasked layer.
11.2 EXERCISE 2: SAVING A SELECTION ON A LAYER MASK  279

8. View the mask in the document window by Alt/Opt+clicking on the mask icon in the Layers Panel. While
    it is possible to edit the mask with black or white paint in this mode too, it's not very helpful without
    being able to see the effects of editing the mask with the image visible. To restore your view to Standard
    Editing Mode, simply click on the layer's content thumbnail icon.

9. Now for the true test: repeat all of the steps in both exercises with the other half of the mustache! You
    should end up with something like the image below.
280  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     10. Once again, repeat these steps for the eyes. Use the Ellipse Selection tool to select one of Dali's eyes.
           Then hold Shft while selecting the other eye with the same tool. Make the "original image" layer active by
           clicking on it. Press Cmd+J to float the selected eyes to a new layer. Rename the layer "eyes" and position
           it as the topmost layer.

            Tip: If you see a warning that says "Could not make a new layer from the selection because the selected area is
            empty." then you probably did not make the correct layer active before pasting or floating.

     11. With your "eyes" layer active, use the Move Tool to position the eyes onto the cat's face. You will have to
           select each eye individually to move it into place and use Edit > Free Transform to rotate it. Add a layer
           mask and use black paint to hide the edges of the eyes.
11.2 EXERCISE 2: SAVING A SELECTION ON A LAYER MASK  281

Okay, now things are getting weird.
11.3 Exercise 3: Adding an adjustment layer and
organizing layers with groups

       1. Add a Levels Adjustment Layer on top of the eyes layer. We used the button in the Adjustments Panel to
            add our Levels Adjustment Layer.

       2. Push the sliders beneath the shadow and highlight areas towards each other in the Adjustments panel
            to create more contrast in the image.

                                                                                                            282
11.3 EXERCISE 3: ADDING AN ADJUSTMENT LAYER AND ORGANIZING LAYERS WITH GROUPS  283

3. Now we will organize all of our manipulations into one folder. Click once on the "left mustache" layer
    then Shft+click on the "Levels 1" layer to select all layers above original image. Use the Layers Panel
    pulldown menu to choose New Group from Layers... and name the group "manipulations". Now the
    non-destructive layers are grouped into one folder. The folder can be collapsed or expanded using the
    small sideways triangle on the left side of the folder icon in the Layers Panel.
284  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG
11.3 EXERCISE 3: ADDING AN ADJUSTMENT LAYER AND ORGANIZING LAYERS WITH GROUPS  285
11.4 Exercise 4: Adding a shape layer

       1. Choose the Rounded Rectangle tool from the Toolbar. This tool hides behind the Rectangle tool. All of
            the tools grouped beneath the Rectangle tool are called Shape tools. In Photoshop®, Shape tools and
            typography created with the Type tool can be added to the document as vector layers.

       2. Look in the Options Bar to verify that you are using the Rounded Rectangle tool to make a Shape layer,
            instead of a Path (which creates a path like the Pen tool) or a Pixel layer (which creates a selection).

       3. Draw a rounded rectangle in the image near Dali's fingers. Notice that you will have a new layer named
            "Rounded Rectangle 1" in the Layers Panel. Shape layers can be moved with the Move tool and they
            appear in the Layers panel as an overall path of color with a vector mask defining where the color is
            applied and where it is hidden, based on the way the shape was drawn. Additionally, after you draw the
            shape, the Properties Panel will open allowing you to set various attributes of the rounded rectangle
            shape you created.

                                                                                                            286
11.4 EXERCISE 4: ADDING A SHAPE LAYER  287

4. It's easy to change the color of a Shape layer as long as the document is in a mode that supports color!
    Try to load a red hue into the foreground color chip. It's gray! Use Image > Mode > RGB Color to convert
    this grayscale image to RGB color mode. At the "Merge layers before mode change?" warning, choose
    "Don't Merge." We want to preserve all of the non-destructive work that we've done, and merging would
    eliminate that!

5. Now put a red hue into the foreground color chip using the Color Picker or the Color Panel. As long as
    the Shape Layer is active, use the key command Alt/Opt+Delete to fill the "Rounded Rectangle 1" layer
    with the color you loaded into the foreground color chip. You can also set the color for a Shape Layer by
    double-clicking its thumbnail icon in the Layers Panel, or by using the color chips in the Properties panel
    while the Shape Layer is active.

6. Activate the Type Tool (press T on your keyboard) and click into the red rectangle. Type Dali and his cat
    on top of the rectangular box and click the checkmark button in the Options Bar to exit type editing
    mode.
    Note: If you still have red set as your foreground color, you'll need to change the type color to black. You
288  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     can fill your type with black however you like, but try a fill key command on this layer, too. We loaded
     black in the background color chip and used Cmd+Delete to fill with the background color.

     Now set your font and other type specifications. We used Myriad Pro Semibold Italic as our font, set in
     78 points with 40 point tracking. You can set the tracking and other type attributes in the Character Panel
     (use Window > Character if you don't have the Character Panel displayed).

     Finally, use the Move Tool to position the type layer so that it's vertically centered on the rectangle.

     That's it, you've made it through another chapter! Save your work and take a well-earned break.

       1. Download and open seagram_building.jpg from the Chapter 12 Work Files download.

       2. If you followed the exercises in Chapters 8 and 9, you should be comfortable changing the tonal range
            and color of this image. Adjust the tonal range and color to your liking by adding one or more
            adjustment layers.

                                                                                                            295
296  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG
12.1 EXERCISE 1: FROM DIGITAL INPUT TO WEB READY  297

3. Save this file as a master copy by choosing Save As from the file menu, choose PSD as the file format,
    and save your file as ch12-yourlastname-firstname.psd.

4. The image from the download files was taken by a 21-megapixel digital camera, and is larger than we
    need to display on a web site. Additionally, since we've made some adjustments and want to retain our
    master file as a PSD, we'll need to create an optimized image for use on a website or on social media. To
    optimize images for online use, we use the Export features in Photoshop®. Choose File > Export >
    Export As... to open the Export As interface. Photoshop® and Illustrator® both have this tool available,
    allowing you to to resizes and compress your images, flatten layers, and prepare an image for the web
    all while retaining your original master file.
298  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     5. The Export As dialog has several important parameters to set. The most important parameter is the
         Format listed under "File Settings" in the top right of the interface. As a general rule, photographic
         images and other images continuous tone or a large range of colors are saved as JPEGs. Graphic images
         -- images with few colors, such as logos and line art -- are saved as PNGs or GIFs. Since this image is a
         photograph, select JPEG from the Format pull-down menu.

     6. Some of the Formats available in the Export As dialog are also available through File > Save As, including
12.1 EXERCISE 1: FROM DIGITAL INPUT TO WEB READY  299

the JPEG format. However, using the Export As dialog gives a greater amount of control over JPEG
compression settings and prepares the image for web use in a few other ways that Save As doesn't. We'll
start with the Quality setting.First, notice that at the bottom of the Export As dialog are some zoom
controls. Click on the + button there to zoom in and view the image at 100%. We'll want to be looking
closely at the image to more easily see the effect of JPEG compression.

    Also note that the left side of the Export As interface shows information related to the optimized image.
    At this stage, we want to pay particular attention to the estimated file size of the optimized image, which
    at 100% Quality is about 4.9MB. This is important because the smaller the file size is, the faster the image
    will download as part of a web page. The 4.9MB file size is a very large or "heavy" file and will increase
    download time unnecessarily.

7. In the File Settings section at the right of the Export As dialog, set the Quality setting to 0% by typing into
    its box or clicking on its down arrow and using the slider. Watch the image closely as you make this
    change and you will see differences in the image quality appear. Saving an image in JPEG format
300  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     compresses the saved image into a smaller file size by removing pixel detail from specific areas in the
     image. This is called lossy compression.The JPEG format lossy leaves what are known as compression
     artifacts in the image. These show up as blurry or pixelated areas in an image, which you may have
     noticed in heavily compressed images online. JPEG compression artifacts most often show up in areas of
     solid or nearly-solid color, or around edges of objects in an image.

     Notice the loss of detail and the appearance of JPEG compression artifacts when comparing the image preview at Quality
     settings of 100% and 0%.

     Along with seeing a preview of the compressed image in the center of the Export As dialog, the estimated
     file size is also updated when you change the Quality setting. Notice that the image information in the
     area at the left of the dialog now lists the file size at around 223.5KB.
12.1 EXERCISE 1: FROM DIGITAL INPUT TO WEB READY  301

     Note: The human eye cannot easily detect image compression artifacts if a small amount of compression is used
     and the image is viewed on a computer screen. Photoshop® JPEG compression presets run from Low to Maximum,
     and correspond to a numerical range from 0 to 100. Zero is a very low quality, where you will definitely be able to
     notice the loss of quality as visible compression artifacts in the image, while the maximum 100 level (although still
     having had image data thrown away) shows no visible decline in quality. The trade-off is that more compression
     creates a smaller file. Weigh your needs for file size against your perception of image quality to decide what level of
     compression to use on a case-by-case basis.

8. While the file size at 0% quality is nice and small, the image doesn't look as good as it could. We want to
    find a balance between a nice looking image (not covered in artifacts) and a file size under 1MB. Increase
    the Quality to 60% and watch the areas of the image where you noticed the artifacts at 0%. On average,
    a Quality setting between 60% and 80% is where you'll end up when looking at image quality, though this
    will vary depending on the amount of detail and texture in any particular image that you're compressing.
    Notice that the compressed file size at 60% quality is 1.1MB, we'll address that in the next step since we
    do want a smaller file size.
302  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     9. In addition to compression, we can also reduce file size in this case by reducing the pixel dimensions of
         the image. We can do this directly in the Export As dialog, without permanently altering our master
         image file. Locate the Image Size section of the dialog, underneath the File Settings section on the right
         side. The original pixel dimensions are 5760×3840 pixels, which is much larger than we need to display
         online.
         Computer monitors and mobile devices have a wide range of screen sizes these days. In order to deliver
         images that are sized appropriately for different devices and Internet connections, it is often necessary to
         prepare multiple sizes of an image for online use. For this exercise, we'll prepare two optimized sizes of
         this image.

         For desktop computers, let's scale the image down to a width of 1600px. Edit the Width value under the
         Image Size settings and the height will be scaled proportionally to 1066px. To help our scaled image's
         quality, also set the Resample drop-down to Bicubic Sharper. This will result in sharper detail when
         Photoshop® re-interpolates the image's pixels while generating the smaller size. Your Image Size settings
         should match those shown below.
12.1 EXERCISE 1: FROM DIGITAL INPUT TO WEB READY  303

Notice that this has reduced the optimized file size from 1.1MB down to 125.1KB. This is much more
acceptable and our image quality is looking pretty good.

10. Now we'll create an additional optimized file for mobile screens using the Scale All controls in the upper
      left corner of the Export As dialog. In the previous steps, we've just defined the settings for our 1x
      optimized image. In the Suffix field, enter _desktop then click the + button in the Scale All box to add
      another size for this image.

Clicking the + button will create an additional optimized copy of the image. For this second optimized
copy, set the Size drop-down to 0.5x and enter _mobile in the Suffix box.

Now click the Export All... button in the lower right of the dialog, choose where to save your optimized
files, and click the Export button. You should end up with two .jpg files in the folder you saved to:
one named ch12-yourlastname-firstname_desktop,jpg and the other named ch12-yourlastname-
firstname_mobile.jpg with file sizes around 122KB and 45KB, respectively. Notice that the _mobile image
has pixel dimensions of 800×533.

Note: File naming standards for the web use only lowercase letters, alphanumeric characters, underscores, and
dashes (no spaces).
304  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     If you open each of the JPEGs in Photoshop®, you'll also notice that their resolution is set to 72ppi. The
     Export All process also reduces the ppi since images for display on the web or exclusively on screens
     typically use a standard 72ppi setting.

     We're finished with the ch12-yourlastname-firstname.psd file, so you may save and close it.
12.2 Exercise 2: PNG & GIF vs JPEG

As stated in Exercise 1, photographic images with many colors are saved as JPEG files, and graphic images with few
colors are saved as PNGs or GIFs. Following these rules will produce better quality images and smaller file sizes
for graphic images.
The GIF and 8-bit PNG formats reduce an image's sizes by limiting the number of colors in the image to no
more than 256 total. This is called an indexed color palette. The fewer colors used, the lower the file size. In
combination with some compression algorithms this can create some pretty small files. As you can imagine,
however, significantly reducing the number of colors in photographic images would result in a very altered
appearance.
PNG also has a 24-bit format that uses a much larger range of color and a compression algorithm to produce true-
color compressed images. These have excellent quality but are typically larger in file size than JPEG compressed
images.
Both PNG and GIF can include transparent portions of an image. The GIF format only allows one of the colors in
its indexed color palette to act as transparency, while PNG can contain a true alpha channel to define transparent
or semi-transparent areas in an image. Use of an alpha channel to create transparency allows transparent fades
and smooth edges along transparent areas in an image.

       1. Use the gear-icon.psd image included in this chapter's work files and the Photoshop® Export As
            interface to save an optimized version of this image as an 8-bit PNG, scaled down to a width of 500px.
            Zoom in and notice how clean the image is (no compression artifacts).

                                                                                                            305
306  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Click the Export All... button and you should end up with a file named gear-icon.png, make note of the
         optimized image's file size (it should be around 12KB). Note: you do not need to export multiple sizes of the
         image in this exercise, just the 1x size in the Scale All area will be sufficient, and it doesn't need a Suffix.

     2. Now use Export All again to see how much compression it would take to get the same file size from this
         image using the JPEG format. Make sure the Image Size is still 500px and adjust the Quality slider down
         to your guess of a percentage that it will take to reach the same file size as the PNG you saved. Zoom in
         and you'll notice JPEG artifacts around the black edges in the image. Click Export All... to save your JPEG
         version of this image.
12.2 EXERCISE 2: PNG & GIF VS JPEG  307

                                                                                                                                              From this
            exercise, it should be apparent why JPEG is not the best format for graphic images that have solid colors.
            As you can see, a much cleaner image results from using the PNG format. You can use the Photoshop®
            Export As interface to experiment with the GIF format on your own, and you may want to try turning off
            the background layer to play with transparency in your optimized image. You may also want to
            experiment with a photograph to see how the different formats create different results in quality and
            file size.

             Note: GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) was developed in 1987 and makes use of a patented compression method.
             The PNG (Portable Network Graphic) format was developed around 1996 as a non-patented GIF replacement. The
             relevant patents expired in 2004, though by that time PNG had become fully supported on the web and a more
             popular format than GIF. One GIF feature that PNG does not have is animation, which has become the primary use
             of GIF in modern times.

            That's all for Chapter 12!

Two single-page layouts, the result of this chapter's exercises.

MULTIPLES: CREATING UNITY

When creating multi-page documents, the grid is the principle way of organizing page elements. A grid divides a
page into columns. An artist can follow the columns strictly, or use them as a rough guide to work within. The
Gutenberg Bible visual example follows a very rigid grid structure: the two columns of text have the same line
length, which is a measurement of how long a line of text is before it breaks to a new line (Fig 13.#) The two
columns of text also have the same vertical length. When two pages are viewed together in an open book such as
this, the pages are read together as a spread. The pages in this spread follow the grid in exactly the same manner.

However, the grid can also be used with much flexibility. In the visual reference example of the New York Times
layout from 1918, the grid is more complex and versatile. This grid divides the page into eight columns.

Counting the columns on the page is easy: find the smallest column and measure its width. Then divide the width
of the page with the width of the smallest column. An eight-column grid creates a very flexible layout. Instead of
eight even columns of text flowing down the front page of the newspaper, some larger graphic elements like the
headline at the top of the page expand across all eight columns. Other text blocks are given visual emphasis, or
create visual hierarchy on the page by spanning multiple columns. Also notice the distribution of negative space
on the page. Since there is a lot of text on this front page, contrast is created by increasing the leading in some
areas of the page and by allowing some of the text blocks to expand beyond one column.

13.1 Exercise 1: Unity through repetition - master pages

       1. Create a new document by choosing File > New > Document. Notice that a document can have many
            pages. We will work on just two pages. For this lesson, specify the letter page size, no facing pages, two
            pages, one column, and leave the margins at their default settings. A new document may also be created
            by clicking "New Document" on the welcome screen. Click OK. Save your document as
            ch13-yourlastname-unity.indd.

             Setting up a new InDesign® document

             The Welcome screen appears at the launch of most Adobe® applications such as InDesign® and Dreamweaver®,
             but not all. It can be turned off by checking the box in the lower left corner, "Don't show again."

       2. Load the Advanced workspace by choosing Advanced from the Application bar then click on the Pages
            panel to open it. In this panel, each rectangular icon represents a page in the document. Double-click
            the page 2 icon to jump to that page and then double-click the page 1 icon to go back. Another way to
            navigate through the pages in a document is to click the Next Page or Previous Page arrows at the
            bottom of the document window. You can also use the Hand tool to drag the pages around within the

                                                                                                            313
314                                                            XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

            document window.

Tip: A workspace can also be selected from Window > Workspace

Notice that pages 1 and 2 are labeled with the letter "A". The letter "A" signifies that these pages are
based on the master page called "A-Master". You can create multiple master pages, which can be applied
to any page within the document. Master pages commonly contain a grid and any recurring design
elements. They allow you to create a consistent layout throughout the pages in a publication and they
make it possible to automate layout changes, because any modification you make to a master page is
automatically reflected on all the pages to which it is applied. By default, a new document's pages are all
based on A-Master, even though A-Master is empty. We will work on the A-Master page next.

     The InDesign® workspace and working with Master pages

3. Double-click the A-Master page icon in the Pages panel. You are now on the master page. Anything you
    place on this page will be stored on A-Master and will automatically appear on all the pages based on it.
    Also notice that A-Master is the page you are currently working on by looking at the page box at the
    bottom of the document window.
13.1 EXERCISE 1: UNITY THROUGH REPETITION - MASTER PAGES                                                     315

     A-Master selected as the current working page in the Pages panel.

4. We will now set up guides on the master page similar to the Illustrator® exercises in Chapter 4. Guides
    are created by dragging them from the horizontal and vertical rulers in all Adobe® programs. If your
    rulers were not displaying in inches, you can Control-click (or right-click) each ruler and selected Inches
    before adding guides to the page.

     Key Command: Show or hide rulers from the View menu in any Adobe® program or press Command+R.

     Control-click or right click on the InDesign® rulers to change their unit of measure.

5. Click and drag to create guides. Starting with the horizontal ruler at the top of the document window,
    click into the ruler and drag a guide to 3 inches, using the vertical ruler at the left of the document
316  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     window as a reference. Then drag a guide from the vertical ruler to 5 inches, using the horizontal ruler
     as a reference.

          Your guides should have a similar placement to the ones shown here.

     6. Now we will use the Line tool to draw a heavy line along the horizontal guide. Click on the Line tool in the
         Toolbox to select it. Starting at the right edge of the page, Shift-click and drag toward the left edge of the
         page to draw a straight line along the horizontal guide. Notice that we didn't draw the line all of the way
         to the left edge, so the negative space remains active as it did in Chapter 4. When you release the mouse
         button, you'll notice that the line almost disappears into the guide. We will hide the non-printing guides
         to make it easier to see the line.
13.1 EXERCISE 1: UNITY THROUGH REPETITION - MASTER PAGES  317

     The top image shows the location of the Line Tool on the InDesign® Toolbar. The second image shows where to draw a line
     along the horizontal guide.
    To hide the guides, press the keys Command+Semicolon. This will enable you to see the thin line you just
    made. Next we will make the line thicker.

     Guides can be hidden by pressing Command+Semicolon on the keyboard.
7. Use the Selection tool to select the line if it isn't already selected, and then choose a line weight from the

    Stroke pull-down menu in the Control panel at the top of the work area (we used a weight of 20 points).

     Control-click (or right click) each ruler to change measurement standard to Inches
8. Open the Swatches panel. Click the Stroke icon to bring it to the front and then click on the red color

    swatch (C=15, M=100, Y=100, K=0). Notice that all the swatches are defined with CMYK values. Since
    InDesign® is mainly used for creating documents that are output to a commercial printer, the default
    colors in the Swatches panel are using the CMYK color space.

Use the swatches panel to choose CMYK color for the line
318  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

            Watch Out: Make sure the Stroke icon is on top of the Fill icon so that the color red is applied to the line

      9. Turn on the guides again with Command+; or View Menu > Guides & Grids > Show Guides.
     10. Double-click the page 1 icon in the Pages panel to view the first page of the document. Notice that the

           guides and thick, red line are in place on page
     11. Double-click the page 2 icon in the Pages panel and notice that the guides and red line are also in place

           on the second page of the document. Objects on a master page automatically show up on any pages
           based on that master. It's important to understand that the items on a master page can only be
           modified or deleted from the master page they belong to (unless they are overridden first, which we will
           do in Exercise 2). Try to select the red line or move the guides on pages 1 or 2 and you will see that they
           are not selectable. Reminder-Save your work often!

     The "A-Master" page has been applied to both pages in the document.
13.2 Exercise 2: Creating B-Master

The document we are creating contains only two pages, so only one master page is needed. However, in larger
documents that have several layout variations, it is often necessary to use multiple master pages. We will make a
second master page in this document in order to demonstrate the process.

       1. Click on the pull-down menu at the top right corner of the Pages panel, and choose New Master.

             Create a New Master Page
       2. In the New Master dialog box, set B-Master to be based on A-Master using the pull-down menu. (Fig

            13.#) Click OK to create the new master page. Tip: To view all the master pages without having to scroll
            to find them, drag the horizontal divider line in the Pages panel downward.

                                                                                                            319
320  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          The New Master dialog box allows you to create a new master page or a master page based on an existing master page.
     3. In this document, B-Master will be similar to A-Master, but we will modify the color of the line so that it is

         cyan instead of red. Since B-Master contains all of the A-Master elements, those elements cannot be
         changed unless they are modified on the A-Master page or they are overridden. Try selecting the red line
         with the Selection tool and you will notice that it cannot be edited. Override the red line (and not the
         guides) by Shift+Command-clicking on the line with the Selection tool.

          Note: You can right-click or Control+click on any page icon in the Pages panel and choose "Override All Master Page
          Items." This would make master page items editable on the entire page.

     4. Use the Swatches panel to change the color of the line to cyan (C=100, M=0, Y=0, K=0).

          Use the Swatches panel to change the color of the line. Make sure your line is selected.

     5. Apply the B-Master page to page 2 by right-clicking or Control-clicking on the page 2 icon in the Pages
         panel and choosing Apply Master to Pages from the context menu. In the Apply Master dialog box,
13.2 EXERCISE 2: CREATING B-MASTER        321

choose B-Master from the pull-down menu.

     Apply the B-Master page to page 2
6. Double-click the page 2 icon in the Pages panel to view the second page. We will now create a

    typographic headline that will be copied to page 1. In theory, this is something that would normally be
    done on the A-Master page, but we want to demonstrate a useful paste function that is not available in
    every Adobe® program. Click and drag with the Type tool to draw a text frame, which is like a text box in
    Illustrator®. Type the words "Unity on the Grid" into the frame.

     Watch Out: Unlike Photoshop® and Illustrator®, type cannot be made by simply clicking on the page with the Type
     tool and typing text. In InDesign®, type can only be created within a text frame.

    Now format the headline by selecting all the text with the Type tool and then specifying a font and type
    size. In the following example, we are using Futura Condensed Extra Bold at 48 points. Pay attention to
322  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     the kerning, making sure that the spaces between the characters in the headline are visually equal. If
     necessary, use the same manual kerning techniques we learned in Chapter 4 to improve the kerning.
     To kern quickly and visually, place your cursor between any two letters; then press Option (Mac) or Alt
     (Windows) and click the left or right arrow keys on the keyboard. Next, use the Selection tool to select the
     text frame and then reposition it so that the left edge of the frame aligns with the left edge of the cyan
     line and the baseline of the text aligns with the top of the line.

          Use kerning to format the headline

     7. Now we will copy the headline to page 1. With the text frame still selected, choose Edit > Copy. Double-
         click the page 1 icon in the Pages panel, and then choose Edit > Paste in Place. The headline appears in
         the same position on this page as it is on page #2. The Copy command in InDesign® copies both the
         type and its location on the page. Be sure to Save!

     Copy the headline and use the Edit> Paste in Place command to assure the second headline is in the exact positioning as
     the other headline.
13.3 Exercise 3: Linking text frames

InDesign® is often used to create multi-page documents for commercial printing or for viewing as a PDF file on
a screen. In either case, long documents can contain a lot of text. InDesign® allows you to place as much text as
you want into one single text frame and then use the threading function to link multiple text frames together so
that the text can flow from one frame to another. In this exercise, we will link two text frames on pages one and
two with about five paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum dummy text. In Chapter 4 we used Lipsum.com to generate five
paragraphs of dummy text. InDesign® has Lorem Ipsum dummy text saved into the application so you can easily
fill a text frame with dummy text without pasting it from someplace else.

       1. On page 1, use the Type tool to click and drag a large text frame on the Artboard area. We need to load
            more dummy text into the frame than we intend to use in order to illustrate the threading feature.

       2. Choose Type > Fill with Placeholder Text to fill the frame with dummy text.

                                                                                                            323
324  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

          InDesign® has a feature that allows you to fill a frame with dummy text. Create a frame, choose Type> Fill with Placeholder
          Text.

     3. Use the Selection tool [V] to move and resize the text frame so that left edge of the text frame is aligned
         with the vertical guide. Pull the top edge of the frame down so it starts at 6 inches. The right and bottom
         edges of the text frame align with the right and bottom margins on the page.
13.3 EXERCISE 3: LINKING TEXT FRAMES  325

     You can move and resize the frame. The text will autoflow to fit the frame.
4. Look at the bottom right corner of the text frame and notice the red square that surrounds a plus sign.

    This icon means that there is more text stored (but not visible) in the text frame. Using the Selection tool,
    click on the plus sign. Notice that your cursor has changed to a "loaded cursor." InDesign® "knows" that
    you are ready to link this first text frame to another text frame in the document.

     The red plus sign in the square means there is more text than what will fit in the frame. The cursor is now "loaded" with the
     additional text and can be loaded and linked to another text frame.
5. Now navigate to page 2. With the loaded cursor, click and drag a text frame in the same location as the
    frame you created on page 1. The overflow of text in the first frame will flow into the second text frame,
326  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     since the frame on page 1 is now linked to the frame on page 2.

          With the "loaded cursor" click and drag a new text frame on page two. The text will automatically flow from page 1 to page
          2.

          Tip: View > Extras > Show Text Threads to see a visible line that indicates which frames are linked together.

     6. Using the Type tool, click inside either of the two text frames and press Command+A to select all of the
         text. Make a change to the typeface using the Font Family menu in the Control panel or the Character
         panel (Window > Type & Tables > Character). Our type is set with Futura Medium in 11 points with the
         leading, or the space between the lines, set at 13.2 points. Notice that the typeface changes in both text
         frames because Command+A (or Edit > Select All) selects the text in all of the linked frames. Time to Save
         your work!
13.3 EXERCISE 3: LINKING TEXT FRAMES  327

Make font changes to all of the text. Select all then use the Character panel to change your font. When you select all it will
change all fonts that are linked together on page 1 and page 2
13.4 Exercise 4: Creating shapes

In Chapter 4 we created unity on the page through the repetition of shape and color. We will create unity in this
chapter with the same technique, but this time we will place the colored square in the same location on sequential
pages.

       1. Use the Rectangle tool and hold the Shift key to draw a square on page 1 and then go to the Swatches
            panel to assign the red color to it.

             Note: Use the curved arrow icon above the Fill and Stroke icons at the bottom of the Toolbox or at the top of the
             Swatches panel to swap the fill and stroke colors. The white square with the diagonal red stripe is used to assign no
             color.

            With the Selection tool, drag the red square to align its left side with the vertical guide, and position the
            bottom of the square against the top of the body copy. If necessary, use the arrow keys on your keypad
            to nudge the square into place. Once the square is just touching the text, press Shift+Up Arrow one time
            to move the square ten points higher than the text.

             Create visual interest and draw the viewer to the text by creating a colored square at the top of the paragraph.
       2. While the square is still selected, choose Edit > Copy then navigate to page 2 and choose Edit > Paste In

            Place to create a second square in the same location as the one on page

                                                                                                            328
13.4 EXERCISE 4: CREATING SHAPES                                       329

3. Use the Swatches panel to change the color of this square to cyan.

Use the Swatches panel to change the color of the square to cyan.
Save!
13.5 Exercise 5: Exporting a PDF

It is important to always save a file as you are working on it. The InDesign® file, designated by the file extension
.indd, is the native file. A .pdf file is most commonly used for sharing a document to view or proof and it can
also be used for printing. When an .indd file is exported as a .pdf file, the graphics and fonts are embedded in
the document, making it a portable package that is easy to share with others. While printers can print .indd files,
we often suggest sending a .pdf file to your printer to avoid common problems such as: the printer does not
have InDesign® (or maybe not the version of the application you used), or the the fonts you used in your layout.
Sending an INDD file to print requires sending the native file, fonts, and images (referred to as linked objects).
Sending a PDF file is more efficient - you only have to send one file containing the whole package.

       1. Save the InDesign® file by choosing File > Save.
       2. Now we'll export a copy of the file as a .pdf file for sharing, viewing, or printing purposes. Choose File >

            Export. In the Export dialog box, choose Adobe PDF (Print) from the Format pull-down menu. Use the
            same name and location as your original indd file, and click the Save button.

             Export your saved file as a PDF for sharing, viewing or printing.
       3. In the Export Adobe PDF dialog box, there are many options, which change depending on which

            category at the left side is active. In the General category, notice the Pages area, which contains three
            choices: All, Range, and Spreads. For this exercise, leave the All option selected so that all the pages are
            exported. Since we did not design the layout as spreads (or facing pages) we will choose the Pages
            option. Notice the Compatibility pull-down menu at the top right corner. If you know that the person you
            are sharing this PDF with has an older version of Acrobat®, or if you need to comply with specifications
            from a commercial printer, choose an option from this pull-down menu to format the PDF document for
            a particular Acrobat® version. For now, choose Acrobat 8/9 (PDF 1.7).

                                                                                                            330
13.5 EXERCISE 5: EXPORTING A PDF  331

     There are many export options. For this exercise follow the settings shown above.
4. Click the Export button. You may see a warning about overset text. If there is more dummy text in the

    second text frame than what is visible on the page, the Export to PDF function prompts you with a
    warning message. (Fig13.#) We are aware of the abundance of text in this exercise, so you can click OK
    through the dialog box. During another project, you could modify the text frame so that all of the text
    that should be visible is set within the frame.

     InDesign® will give you a warning if there is more text than what is showing in the text frames (overset text).
5. Open the PDF file in Adobe® Acrobat® Professional, Adobe® Reader®, or Preview. Notice that the file

    can be viewed but not easily edited. To edit the file, open the native .indd file in InDesign. Save your
    work.

TWO-PAGE SPREADS
A common aspect of publication layout design is the two-page spread, or a set of pages viewed together. Spreads
are often used as a visually interesting introduction to an article in magazines, with the layout designed to have
the two pages working as a unified whole. It is this specific type of spread which we'll explore in this chapter.

                                                                                                            333
334                                                                           XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

A Google image search for "two-page spread" brings up a variety of examples.
14.1 Exercise 1: Image Preparation

       1. Use Photoshop® to open the skyline.jpg image and use Image > Size to check the its size and
            resolution. Make sure Resample is unchecked and set the image to have an a resolution of 240ppi (this
            should give the image a height of 12.6 inches.

             Use these settings to adjust the image size of skyline.jpg
       2. Change the image's Mode to CMYK Color. Then, Using a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer, adjust the

            image so that it is similar in appearance to the example here.

                                                                                                            335
336  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     Set your Hue/Saturation adjustment layer similar to what's shown here.

     After adjusting the Hue/Saturation, add a Levels adjustment layer and adjust the dark values to
     something like the example below.
14.1 EXERCISE 1: IMAGE PREPARATION  337

     Your Levels adjustment layer should be set similar to what's depicted here.
3. Save the revised image as a native Photoshop® document named skyline.psd and close Photoshop®.
14.2 Exercise 2: Fundamentals for the Layout

       1. Open InDesign and create a new document using the following specifications shown here:

            After you've created your document, save it as ch14-yourlastname-firstname.indd
       2. Use File > Place and place the skyline.psd image you created in the previous exercise into your

            InDesign® document. Using the column guides as a reference, drag the image out to span 7 columns
            wide (leave the first three columns on the left side of the spread empty).

                                                                                                            338
14.2 EXERCISE 2: FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE LAYOUT  339

Scale the placed image so that it is 7 columns wide and positioned on the right side of the spread.
Once the image is placed, adjust its frame height so that it reaches the top and bottom margins. Use
the Fill Frame Proportionally button in the Control Bar to scale the image up so that it fills the frame.

The "Fill frame proportionally" button can be used to quickly re-scale an image frame's content to fit its frame while
retaining the image's original proportions.
Then use the Selection Tool and the circle in the middle of the image frame to position the image within
the frame so that it's similar to the example here.
340  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

         Make sure your Layers Panel is showing (if it's not, use Window > Layers to show it) and name the active
         layer image, lock it, then save your file.

     3. Create a new layer named text and make sure it's the active layer. Activate the Type Tool and use the
         Control Bar or the Character Panel to choose "Myriad Pro Regular" for your font. Now draw a text frame
         starting at the upper left of the column grid and dragging to the right so that it spans all 5 columns of
14.2 EXERCISE 2: FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE LAYOUT  341

the left page. Type "A Room with a View" (without the quotation marks) into the text frame. Select all of
the text you typed and set the following type specs: Font size: 100pt, Leading (line spacing): 82pt.

Next, put your type cursor in between the words "Room" and "with" and delete the space. Then use
Shift+Enter to add a soft return to set the headline in two lines.

In the paragraph settings (in the Control Bar or the Paragraph Panel), set the Left Indent to 7p1 and the
First Line Left Indent to -7p1 (make sure you include the minus sign there, this should set the second
line so that it's indented and the words "Room" and "with" are in vertical alignment as shown below).

          The "Fit frame to content" button re-sizes a frame's width and height to match the boundaries established by the content of
          the frame. This is a quick way of cleaning up frames that are larger than necessary after formatting text.
         Once you have the headline set, activate the Selection Tool and click the Fit frame to content button
         in the Control Bar. Then click a blank area on the page to make sure that the headline text frame is not
         selected.
     4. Now we'll add the intro paragraph for this spread. Drag a horizontal guide from the top Ruler down to
         the 17p6 mark. This will give us a reference for where to place the top of the intro paragraph text frame
         we're about to create.

         Now use File > Place to bring the text file top_paragraph.txt into your document and drag out its text
         frame so that it spans the second and third columns of the left page and is positioned at the horizontal
         guide we created.
14.2 EXERCISE 2: FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE LAYOUT  343

Then, with that new text frame selected, activate the Type tool and set the following type specs in the
Control Bar and Paragraph panel:

         Font: Myriad Pro Regular
         Size: 20pt
         Leading: 21pt
         Tracking: -50
         Use the All Caps button [TT] to set the text to all caps without retyping it
         Align right

     5. Pull out another horizontal guide from the top ruler, this time positioned at 37p0. Place the next
         paragraph of text using the bottom_paragraph.txt file. It should span 3 the first columns of the left
         page and have its top aligned with the new horizontal guide.
14.2 EXERCISE 2: FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE LAYOUT        345

Set the type specs for this text frame as follows:

         Font: Minion Pro Regular
         Size: 12pt
         Tracking: 0
         Align left
         Space After paragraph: 1p0

     Now that you have all of the basics in place, make sure that you save your file!
14.3 Exercise 3: Adding Variety and Visual Interest

Now we'll work with refining some of our type styles, adding visual contrast to help the reader more easily
distinguish the various parts of text in our spread, and giving a little flair to the design.

       1. With the Type tool, select the words "Construction Industry Job Fair" in the bottom text frame, then
            change the following settings to visually set it apart as a subheading:
                     Set the font to Minion Pro Semibold, 24pt type with 24pt leading
                     Change color to Navy Blue (C=100 M=90 Y=10 K=0)
            Lastly, break the subheading into two lines using a soft return. Your work should resemble the sample
            image below.

       2. Unlock your image layer and make sure it's your active layer. Using the Line Tool, draw a horizontal rule
            between the left edge of the picture to the right edge of the word "Fair", aligning the line vertically with
            the top of the letter "r". Using the Stroke and Swatches panels, turn the rule into a 4pt dotted line with a
            red color. Lock the image layer again when you're finished.

                                                                                                            347
348  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     3. Change the text color of the intro paragraph to 60% gray (hint: select that text frame and change the tint
         of the black in your swatches panel - make sure you're adjusting the Type color!)

     4. In the headline of your spread, select the text "A Room with a" and set its color to Navy Blue (C=100
         M=90 Y=10 K=0). Select the word "View" in your headline and set its color to [Paper], then save your
         work.
14.3 EXERCISE 3: ADDING VARIETY AND VISUAL INTEREST  349
14.4 Exercise 4: Add Your Byline

       1. Use Illustrator® to create a decorative, signature/icon-style byline using your name. Include the
            following: Font: your choice, Include a simple shape. (Example: the circle shape behind my name shown
            in the image below).

       2. Once you have completed your byline graphic, save it as byline.ai and place it in into your InDesign®
            document. Be sure to place the graphic on its own layer named byline.

            Your finished layout should resemble the image below.

                                                                                                            350
14.4 EXERCISE 4: ADD YOUR BYLINE  351
14.5 Exercise 5: Export and Package

When it's time to send an InDesign® document to print, a common practice is to send a Packaged copy of the file
to the print service provider. A Packaged copy bundles all placed images, font files, and other necessary assets
into an organized folder ready to send to the person who will prepare the InDesign® file for print.
Along with the Package, it is a good idea to send a PDF as a sample of how the InDesign® file should appear.
Remember, a PDF includes embedded images and fonts and is usually a stable method of providing a digital
"proof" that a print shop can compare with when producing your printed output. Some print shops will only need
a PDF, but it's good to know how to package your InDesign® files in case you need to provide a full set of files for
your document to someone else.

       1. First, make sure you Save your InDesign® document when you have finished all the steps above. Next,
            check your Links panel to make sure all linked files are updated. If you see any links with a yellow
            triangle warning sign, it means they need to be updated. You can easily update all links using the Links
            panel menu "Update All Links" option.

       2. Next, export as a PDF by using File > Adobe PDF Presets > [Press Quality] to save a PDF copy of your
            document. Name your PDF ch14-yourlastname-firstname_proof.pdfNote: In the PDF dialog box make
            sure "spreads" is checked, then click the "Export" button.

                                                                                                            352
14.5 EXERCISE 5: EXPORT AND PACKAGE  353

     Make sure "Spreads" is checked in the Pages options to ensure the PDF's layout is set up correctly for a two-page spread.
     Otherwise, each page in the spread will appear separately from the other in the PDF.

3. Finally, export a Package by choosing File > Package... to open the Package dialog box. Review the
    information in the Package dialog box and then click the Package... button. Note: You may see a prompt
    to save your document before InDesign® can package it, go ahead and save.
354  XTINE BURROUGH AND MICHAEL MANDIBERG

     After clicking the "Package..." button, you'll see the Printing Instructions dialog. Enter your name in
     the Contact field and enter your email address in the Email field. For this exercise, you can skip entering
     the other information and just click the Continue button.
14.5 EXERCISE 5: EXPORT AND PACKAGE  355

After clicking "Continue" you will be prompted to choose a location to save the Package. Save your
Package to the same location on your hard drive where you saved the other files you created in this
chapter. Name your Package Folder ch14-yourlastname-package and use the default settings for the
package options, then click the Package button.

Note: You may see a warning about restrictions applying to copying font software for use by a service
provider. This is regarding proper procedure when supplying font files to someone else, who should
delete them from their computer after they are finished processing your files. Read the message and click
OK.

Once InDesign® has finished packaging your file, you should see a ch14-yourlastname-package folder
among the other files you generated while working on this chapter. Look inside that folder and you should
see all of the files that are part of your two-page spread.

Notice that the package contains a PDF that it generated itself, though it didn't have the spreads option
turned on, so the pages in that PDF will appear as two separate pages rather than as one spread in the
PDF you generated yourself in step 2 of this exercise.

After you've looked through the packaged files, you are finished with this chapter.
