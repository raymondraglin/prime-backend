and Democracy

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Identify and explain seven characteristics of rhetoric as a civic art.
          Describe the origins of democracy and its reliance on rhetoric.
          Identify the ways rhetoric and democracy reinforce each other.
          Demonstrate how ordinary people use rhetoric to engage their communities.

At the age of fifteen, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg grew very concerned about climate change. Many kids her age
shared this concern, but Thunberg acted on it. In August 2018, she began skipping school each Friday to protest outside
the Swedish Parliament building and elsewhere. She advocated for politicians to take action and stop the environment's
degradation. She became, in these actions, a democratic participant.

            Does it seem strange to call a fifteen-year-old a democratic participant? You may think the label only applies to
people who can vote and to elected leaders or government officials. However, democratic participants include all those
who participate in public conversations about issues in a democratic society. Opportunities to speak in such conversa-
tions occur in local, regional, national, and even international organizations and networks where people work together
for positive change. Perhaps you are already involved in such a group on your campus or in your community: a service
organization like Habitat for Humanity, an affinity group such as a Latino cultural association, or a team of debaters or
deliberation facilitators who help people think or talk through tough public issues.
            You do not need to be a legal citizen to be a democratic participant. While you must be a US citizen to vote
in elections, citizenship is not required to engage in public communication and community building. For this reason,
unless we are talking specifically about voting in political elections, in this book we use "democratic participants" and
"community members" when we refer to democratic participation.
            This chapter explores democratic participation more fully by considering rhetoric and its relationship to
democracy. It begins with a definition of rhetoric as a civic art with seven important characteristics. We then turn to an
explanation of the historical relationship between rhetoric and democracy with a particular emphasis on the beginnings
of democracy in ancient Greece. The chapter next describes how rhetoric and democracy are mutually reinforcing and
ends by returning to Thunberg as an example of civic engagement and democratic participation.

                                                                                               Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy | 1
Rhetoric as a Civic Art

Teachers and scholars have often associated rhetoric with persuasion, but with mixed characterizations. While some
have positively associated the term with rich thought and expression, others have negatively equated rhetoric with hol-
low talk. Both versions can be considered rhetoric.

Box 1.1 Rhetoric's Rich Heritage

                                                                      During the Middle Ages and Renaissance in West-
                                                                   ern higher education, rhetoric was one of the seven
                                                                   traditional liberal arts, which included the trivium
                                                                   (i.e., grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadriv-
                                                                   ium (i.e., arithmetic, geometry, music, and astron-
                                                                   omy).

                                                                   In this book, we offer a definition of rhetoric that

                                                                   sets a high standard for public communication in society.

                                                                   We define rhetoric as a civic art devoted to the ethical

                                                                   study and use of symbols (verbal and nonverbal) to address

Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.                                  definition deserves an extended explanation.

                                                                   First, rhetoric is a

civic art that is produced and studied for the good of society. We use civic in a manner rem-

iniscent of its Latin origin (civicus): matters that relate to the city or citizens. Since we rec-

ognize that democratic participants need not be citizens, we use "civic" in this book to

emphasize matters that relate to public life. Civic engagement refers to participation in

community organizations, institutions, and groups with the goal of contributing to the pub-

lic good. Rhetoric, then, is our chief tool to participate in public life and improve our com-

munities. We characterize rhetoric as a civic art because it encourages and requires

individual expression, interpretation, and style. Such artistry requires speakers to study and

practice rhetoric, which is the next characteristic.

Second, rhetoric entails both the study and use of symbols, which we refer to as rhetorical theory and practice.

That is, rhetoric includes training (practice) in the use of symbols, such as speechmaking. It also involves studying the

symbols produced by others. These studies draw on and help create theories about how rhetoric functions.

2 | Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy
                                                Third, both the study and use of rhetoric are ethical practices because they are
                                    grounded in moral principles, based on reason, and attached to rigorous standards of evalua-
                                    tion. This suggests that rhetoric is actively (or consciously) produced and that the ethical (or
                                    unethical) nature of the motives, choices, and effects of a speaker or analyst is important.

                                                Fourth, rhetoric includes verbal and nonverbal symbols. Verbal symbols are the words
                                    we write, speak, and study. Nonverbal symbols include visual images and audio sounds. All
                                    symbols can be powerful in democratic discourse. For example, consider how images of war
                                    and destruction, sounds of gunfire and chaotic yelling, and words calling for public support
can move audiences.
            A fifth characteristic of rhetoric is that it is typically used to address public issues. The emphasis here is on the
audiences who are addressed or spoken to about public issues. In other words, rhetoric is produced for public audi-
ences. While the rhetor, or the one who speaks publicly, is important, the listener or reader--that is, the audience--also
plays a crucial role. The audience interprets, evaluates, responds to, and acts on--or resists--a rhetor's public discourse.
Consequently, meaning is ultimately negotiated between a rhetor and an audience.
            This relationship between the rhetor and an audience leads to a sixth characteristic of
rhetoric: Rhetoric is a form of power. Rhetoric can be a means of control that encourages action
or limits an audience's options, sometimes without us even being aware of this effect. In a most
basic example, consider how a parent gets their young child to do and not do many things sim-
ply with words. Then consider the power of the words in documents such as the Declaration of
Independence and the US Constitution. As those documents suggest, rhetoric has the power to
liberate from domination.

          Box 1.2 Rhetoric as a Form of Power
                                              An example of rhetoric as a form of power can be found in Martin Luther King

                                           Jr.'s powerful refrain "I have a dream" from the speech he delivered from the steps
                                           of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. That repeated phrase carried the vision and
                                           essence of the American civil rights movement to resist oppressive, racist beliefs
                                           and policies and to empower people of color to live in equality with white Ameri-
                                           cans.

            Rhetoric has the ability--the power--to put ideas before the eyes and in the minds of audiences and to move
audiences through language, sound, and imagery. At the same time, audiences can accept, alter, or resist those efforts.

            Seventh, and finally, rhetoric is situational and contingent. Rhetoric operates in specific
contexts and situations to address problems that are of a probabilistic and contingent nature.
Rather than dealing with truth claims that are verified through formal logic or scientific demon-
stration, rhetoric addresses contingent matters that are uncertain, open to multiple possibilities,
and dependent on many variables. Reasonable people are likely to disagree on how to best
address specific community issues. While it is generally used to persuade, rhetoric can also be
utilized to inform an audience. Both goals are valuable when community members need to bet-
ter understand the particular situation and contingent nature of a public issue and decide on a
solution.

                                                                                              Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy | 3
Box 1.3 Seven Characteristics of Rhetoric as a Civic Art

1. Rhetoric is a civic art that is produced and studied for the good of society.
2. Rhetoric entails both the study and use of symbols.
3. The study and use of rhetoric are ethical practices grounded in moral principles, based on reason,

     and attached to rigorous standards of evaluation.
4. Rhetoric includes verbal and nonverbal symbols.
5. Rhetoric is used to address public issues by communicating to an audience.
6. Rhetoric is a form of power.
7. Rhetoric is contingent and situational.

            Our definition focuses attention on rhetoric's use in public contexts among community members and policy-
makers. Thus, it specifically orients us to the practice of public speaking, which is the process of forming and delivering
rhetorical content to an audience in the hopes of persuading or informing that audience. Public speech is a primary
means of participation in a democratic society. We turn next to exploring the beginnings of democracy in ancient
Greece and its reliance on rhetoric.

The Historical Relationship Between Rhetoric and Democracy

                                                              From its beginning, democracy was conducted in and

                                                              through rhetoric. In the West, this relationship began in

                                                              Athens, Greece, in the late sixth century BCE. Imagine an

                                                              who lived in a society structured by a noble class, they are

                                                              an active participant in the governmental functioning of

                                                              issues of the day with their fellow citizens not only infor-

Indeed, it is hard to exaggerate the importance of these advances, as participation was shared much more widely than

ever before in Western history.

          Box 1.4 Democratic Participation in the Athenian Assembly
4 | Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy
   Let's take a closer look at the Athenian Assembly to understand how the power to participate was shared.
The Athenian Assembly met forty times each year on the Pnyx Hill in Athens, Greece. Attendance ranged
from three thousand to six thousand citizens. The Pnyx represented the political center of the city-state, in
contrast to the Agora marketplace (the social and legal center) and the Acropolis (the religious center with
the Parthenon, Erechtheion, and other sacred and ceremonial buildings), which both sat adjacent to the
Pnyx. These three--Pnyx, Agora, Acropolis--formed a physical and visual triangle.

Assembly meetings began from the

speaker's platform located on the Pnyx. The presid-

ing officer sacrificed a pig and prayed to the gods. A

proposal was then announced, and the presiding

officer asked, "Who wishes to speak?" Any topic

could be raised during the Assembly meetings, but

the majority of topics were set in an agenda con-

structed by a smaller council. Anyone could speak

two times on a single issue, and there was no for-

mal time limit. There were means for keeping long-

winded speakers in check, however, such as

heckling and, in more extreme cases, shouting the

person down. These meetings were often quite            Speaker's Platform, Pnyx Hill, Athens by Larry via Flickr, CC
boisterous and emotionally expressive. When the         BY.
moment seemed right, the presiding officer called

for a vote. As such, the participants in this democracy had the opportunity to fully engage in listening,

speaking, and voting.

            Of course, ancient Athenian democracy was far from perfect. It excluded women, foreign-born males, and
slaves. In addition, critics such as Plato, Isocrates, Thucydides, and Aristophanes critiqued the Athenian democratic
experiment toward the end of its prominence, in the late fifth and early fourth centuries. They consistently character-
ized Assembly members as at times easy to manipulate, gullible, distracted, and lacking in motivation for the task of
self-governance.

            Two-and-a-half millennia later, many of these critiques persist. Some in the United States worry that the
majority of democratic participants lack the ability to stay informed enough to engage productively in the political
process. The enormous size of the United States, with over 340 million people, also poses tremendous difficulties for
participation. It is rare to experience the personal nature of Athenian democracy's face-to-face rhetorical exchanges.

            Similarly, just as ancient Athenian democracy excluded women, non-Athenian males, and slaves, today critics
express concern over whether all members of the public--all races, ethnicities, religions, socioeconomic statuses, and
other groups--are fully able to participate and have their ideas heard.

            Yet at the same time that Plato and others critiqued democracy, some teachers pointed to exciting ways that
rhetorical education could improve democratic engagement.

Rhetorical Education

Because it occurred through public speaking, democratic participation created the need to educate individuals in the

                                                                                              Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy | 5
practice. Some teachers, such as Aristotle, taught the principles of rhetoric to noble Athenian students, including
Alexander the Great. The early sophists, like Protagoras, Gorgias, and Isocrates, however, violated tradition by teaching
a range of subjects, including rhetoric, to anyone for a fee. Their new educational model helped shift the city-state of
Athens away from a nobility structure and toward broader democratic participation.

Box 1.5 Ancient Rhetorical Education and Civic Engagement

                                                 Both Isocrates and Aristotle pointed to exciting ways a
                                              rhetorical education could improve students' democratic
                                              engagement.

                                                          Isocrates became famous for his school of rhetoric,
                                              which emphasized civic participation. It trained students to
                                              focus their rhetorical skills on addressing practical matters
                                              of the state.

                                                                   Aristotle simi-

            Isocrates and Aristotle devoted much of their lives to teaching
rhetoric to students, demonstrating the difficulty of the skills involved
and their importance for democratic participation.

Much has changed since democracy and rhetoric began in                              Aristotle by Alvaro Marques Hijazo via

ancient Greece. Yet when we turn to the United States, we see that rhetoric has played a similarly important role

in the establishment of American democracy. Rhetoric was used among colonists in discussions and debates

about the British Crown's control and eventually over their possible independence, leading to the Declaration of

Independence and the US Constitution.

Today, many US colleges and universities continue to teach public speaking skills to prepare students

for effective democratic participation. In fact, as box 1.6 illustrates, many of the fundamental skills taught in pub-

lic speaking courses today reflect the canons of rhetoric first described by Aristotle! The relationship between

rhetoric and democracy in the US and elsewhere remains strong.

   Box 1.6 The Canons of Rhetoric

   The basic elements of public speaking, first described by Aristotle, were put into a formal structure by
Cicero in the first century BCE.

6 | Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy
             Invention is the process of investigation and thought that produces the content of your speech. We will
          explore elements of invention in chapters 5, 25, and 26.

             Organization is how a speaker orders the points in a speech and verbally connects those elements so
          their audience can follow. You will learn about organization in chapters 12, 13, and 14.

             Style is the language or expression we use--the words we choose. Chapter 16 focuses on style.
             Memory is how a speaker stores and recalls the information shared in a speech. We will cover memory
          in chapter 17.
             Delivery is how a speaker physically conveys words and ideas, both vocally and nonverbally, to the
          audience. Chapters 17 and 18 will explore delivery.

Rhetoric and Democracy Are Mutually Reinforcing

Democracy is a political system that locates control and power in the people. You may think such power resides in the
ability to vote. However, rhetoric provides community members with many more ways to exercise power and control in
a democracy. In fact, their voices--their rhetorics--are necessary to establish and maintain democracy.

Rhetoric Encourages Democracy

Rhetoric encourages democracy in several ways: It helps form communities, focuses members' attention on shared con-
cerns, and enables members to advocate and to think critically.

Finally, rhetoric supports democracy by supplying the fundamental skills necessary for effective participation.

These skills include both the production and analysis of messages.

   Former president of the National Association of Teachers of Speech W. Norwood Brigance declared,

"Every educated person ought to know when a thing is proved and when it is not proved, should know how

to investigate and to analyse a proposition that confronts him [sic], and how to search for a solution, how to
talk about it effectively before others, and how to contribute to a discussion on problems of joint interest."1

            To function effectively in a democracy, democratic participants must be able to assess
others' communication and effectively voice their thoughts.

            Developing the abilities to speak well and critically analyze communication will not only
aid you as an individual, but these skills will also help you protect democracy. Democratic par-
ticipants who are trained in rhetoric are better able to identify, call out, and avoid unethical
communication practices that threaten and weaken democracy. We will explore these practices
in greater detail in later chapters.

            In sum, rhetoric and democracy cannot be separated. Rhetoric is both the means by
which democratic participation takes place and the content that is produced through that participation. When we shift
from thinking "democracy equals voting" to appreciating that "democracy is a system in which all the participants, the
people, have the power," we see how integral rhetoric is to this process.

          Box 1.7 Practicing Democracy
          We each have multiple and recurring opportunities for civic engagement:

           1. Speak up in class to respond to what your professor and your classmates have to say.
          2. Ask questions and share your ideas at public events on your campus.
          3. Attend the open hearings and meetings of your local school board and city council and ask ques-

                tions, share your ideas, and advocate.
          4. Write or call your local representative, mayor, or the governor of your state about an issue or to

                suggest a new solution to a problem.
          5. Send a letter to the editor of your local newspaper, record a podcast, or upload a social media post

                and follow the responses you receive.

Democracy Encourages Rhetoric

The relationship between rhetoric and democracy can also be seen when we consider how democracy encourages
rhetoric. It does so in at least three ways: Democratic government bodies require ordinary people's participation,
democracy protects people's right to publicly disagree with their government leaders, and election victories rely, in part,
on rhetorical skill.

            First, all three branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial) allow--and in many cases
require--participation by the people. Presidential candidates for office must secure votes, and this requires them to
speak to voters and, if they are wise, to listen to them. Once elected, they must likewise listen to the public and respond
to them, if for no other reason than to seek reelection. The legislative process often requires a period for the public to
provide comments on new laws and regulations, and the judicial process allows and even requires individuals to speak in
court. Thus, all our foundational democratic institutions promote and facilitate the practice of rhetoric. You may expe-
rience this as a college student. Perhaps you have run for a student government position, offered public commentary on
campus rules or regulations, or had to testify when a wrongdoing occurred. If so, you know the prominent role rhetoric
plays in these democratic processes.

            Second, democracy encourages rhetoric because a fundamental feature of all democratic societies is the right
of the people to gather peacefully and to protest. In other words, democracy allows the public expression of dissent
and dissatisfaction. Democracy even requires such open disagreement and debate to make the public aware of pressing

                                                                                              Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy | 9
issues, help them understand how problems may differently impact groups of people, and press for solutions. You might
have witnessed or participated in a public protest on your own campus.

Box 1.8 Democracy Encourages Rhetoric

                                                       We saw the power of public dissent in the early
                                                    twenty-first century as LGBTQIA+ activists around
                                                    the globe advocated for marriage equality. They
                                                    used demonstrations, public speeches, legal action,
                                                    and political campaigns. Their advocacy and
                                                    protests sparked conversations, drew supporters
                                                    (and critics), and ultimately contributed to the
                                                    legalization of same-sex marriage in many coun-

                                                    democratic societies--places that allow peaceful
                                                    social protest.

mocratic. The most egregious examples include threatening (or actually using) physical or military force against critics.
During the 1960s, for example, some governmental leaders and angry Americans attempted to squelch peaceful civil
rights protests through a variety of physical means, including arrests and jail time, attack dogs, water hoses, billy clubs
and knives, and even--ultimately--assassinations of protest leaders.

   Box 1.9 Antidemocratic Efforts to Stop Rhetoric

called on police and the National Guard to clear
crowds who had peacefully gathered in front of the

          office in 2024, Trump warned that if elected president, he would, according to a news report, "use the pow-
          ers of the federal government to punish [his] critics and political opponents."3

               Such abuses of power punish and silence people who openly and lawfully express disagreement. In this way,
   they weaken democracy and the power of the people. They concentrate power, instead, in the hands of a few politi-
   cal, military, or law enforcement leaders. Such actions are antidemocratic because democracy encourages and protects
   public expressions of dissent.

                                                    Third, and finally, democracy reinforces rhetoric because election victories are typi-
                                       cally achieved by skilled advocacy. You might reflect on how rhetorical abilities may have
                                       played a role in students' ability on your campus to assume leadership roles. Perhaps you are
                                       reading this book because you want to improve your advocacy skills. We are referring to the
                                       ability not to produce the loudest voice but rather to develop the most persuasive message.
                                       As we argue in later chapters, persuasive rhetoric should, ideally, be based on thorough and
                                       accurate research, organized in a clear and compelling manner, and adapted to the audience
                                       and situation.
               In sum, rhetoric and democracy exist in a powerful, synergistic relationship. Each feeds and stimulates the
   other.

 Rhetoric as Civic Engagement

   Participants in a democratic society engage through rhetoric, and they do so in a variety of ways. In this last section,
   we return to Greta Thunberg as an example of how a young adult's use of multiple types of rhetoric began as local civic
   engagement but grew into an international effort.

  Civic Rhetoric at the Local Level

   As we explained previously, Thunberg was just fifteen years old in 2018 when she began skipping school on Fridays to
   protest Sweden's inaction against climate change. She learned about the devastations of climate change at an early age
   and reacted strongly. She is on the autism spectrum and has explained that it gives her a different vantage point to see
   our environment and the need for action.

  Recall a recent example of people using social media such as Facebook, Twitter (now X), or TikTok
     to improve the health of the community.

  Go to the website or social media feed produced by your local newspaper. Find an example of civic
     engagement that is highlighted in an article, such as a fundraising effort for a family that lost their
     home in a fire or an effort to increase funding for the local school district.

  Find the website, social media feed, or podcast produced by your city or town and identify an initia-
     tive hosted by the city that engaged community members, such as a tree-planting project or a pro-
     gram to teach entrepreneurship to high school students.

Civic Rhetoric at the Global Level

   Thunberg's efforts quickly drew national and international attention.
She became a sought-after interview subject and speaker partly due to
her message but also because of her plain and forceful manner of
speaking to world leaders. She was invited to meet the pope and was
even asked to be a featured speaker at the United Nations Climate
Change Conference in 2018 and 2019. She has been criticized for her
way of speaking and accused of being naive to the realities and energy
necessities of modern life. Nonetheless, she has persisted with great
effectiveness.

exist--and where they do not already exist, community-minded individuals can create them with communication skills

and an understanding of how civic engagement works. Such civic communication can take many different forms.

The Many Forms of Civic Rhetoric

Oral communication remains a popular form of civic advocacy--whether that means speaking orally at protests, political
events, or during interviews. However, we can advocate through written and visual forms of rhetoric as well. You might
write a letter to be printed in your campus or local newspaper or on a blog. Visually, you could tape your mouth closed
to help protest against a leader's unwillingness to listen to your group's concerns, or members may all dress the same to
convey solidarity.

             Box 1.12 Thunberg's Written and Visual Communication
             In addition to using oral communication, Thunberg has deployed written and visual communication for
          her environmental advocacy. Thunberg is the author of several books, including No One Is Too Small to Make
          a Difference (Penguin Random House, 2019), Our House Is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and Planet in Crisis
          (Penguin Random House, 2021), and The Climate Book (Penguin Random House, 2022).

                       She has also employed visual rhetoric to aid her advocacy. In 2019, for instance, she sailed from Ply-
          mouth, England, to New York City for the UN Climate Activism Summit rather than fly to highlight the high
          carbon footprint of flying. Her choice was visually communicated through news media coverage that tended
          to feature pictures of her on the sailboat. Her efforts led to a flight shame movement globally.

               Of course, public speaking is not restrained to being used in person. Many leaders and social influencers have
   made great use of oral, visual, and written rhetoric on social media, and you can too.

             Box 1.13 Thunberg's Strategic Use of Social Media
             On July 5, 2024, a few days after six members of Mother Nature, a Cambodian environmental justice group
          led by young people, were sentenced to prison time, Thunberg posted a message on her Instagram account.

            While we primarily emphasize public speaking as oral communication in this textbook, you can also adopt visual
and written rhetoric to participate in your community. Thunberg's activism is a good example of the many rhetorical
means and media by which public advocacy and civic engagement can take place.

            It is our hope that through this book, you will better understand the relationship between rhetoric and democ-
racy and will realize your great potential to improve your communities as a democratic participant. To assist with this
learning, we encourage you to treat your classroom as a kind of public space. That is, in your classroom speaking, envi-
sion yourself as a public actor, not just a student giving speeches to be graded. You are a democratic participant capable
of improving your professor's and fellow students' understanding of community issues and moving them to action.

     Summary

        This chapter has oriented you toward the necessity of public speaking skills for democratic participation and
     civic engagement. It has explained the following:

          Democratic participants include all who participate in public conversations about issues in a democra-
             tic society. While legal citizenship and the ability to vote aid democratic participation, those aspects are
             not required to act as a democratic participant.

          Civic engagement is participation in organizations, institutions, and societies with the goal of con-

                                                                                             Public Speaking as the Intersection of Rhetoric and Democracy | 15
             tributing to the public good.
          Our definition of rhetoric has seven important characteristics: It is a civic art, involves the study and

             use of symbols, is ethical, makes use of verbal and nonverbal symbols, addresses public issues, is a form of
             power, and is situational and contingent.
          Democracy began in Athens, Greece, in the late sixth century BCE, and it sparked the need for rhetoric
             and rhetorical education.
          Rhetoric encourages democracy by being the chief means by which a community of any size is formed,
             by enabling participants to jointly focus their attention on particular issues, and by supplying the funda-
             mental skills necessary for effective participation and for its protection.
          Democracy encourages rhetoric because all the United States' foundational democratic institutions
             promote and facilitate the practice of rhetoric, a fundamental feature of all democratic societies is the
             right of the people to gather peacefully and to protest, and election victories are typically achieved by
             skilled advocacy.
          Ordinary people can use rhetoric to participate both locally and globally in civic engagement.

 2. Unproductive Public Discourse and the Politics of
 Polarization

        Chapter Objectives

           Students will:
             Describe the public sphere and the role of public discourse within that sphere.
             Analyze the qualities of unproductive discourse.
             Identify contemporary obstacles to productive communication.

   Are you comfortable talking about controversial topics or politics, especially with people who disagree with you? Do you
   happily join in when someone mentions the current US president, abortion, or gun rights?

               If you're like most Americans, the answer is no. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, 61% of US
   adults--including both Democrats and Republicans--"say having political conversations with people they disagree with
   is generally `stressful and frustrating.'" Relatedly, that same survey found that 84% of adults say "political debate has
   become less respectful over the last several years," and "78% say political debate has become less fact-based."1 Conse-
   quently, many of us avoid these conversations, sticking to safer topics like the weather or sports.

               But even some previously "safe" forums and top-
   ics have become polarized and heated. Since the 2020
   COVID-19 crisis, for example, many local school board
   meetings (that were "once orderly, even boring") have
   erupted into angry exchanges over mask mandates,
   transgender students, and teaching about race.2 In 2014,

                                                                                                  Image by Mohamed Hassan via Pixabay, Pixabay license.

the most popular form of entertainment--video games--became particularly contentious. Using the social media hash-
tag "Gamergate," "thousands of people in the games community began to systematically harass, heckle, threaten, and
dox several outspoken feminist women in their midst."3 Even sports have prompted vehement disputes over players'
protests of police violence, over vaccination requirements, and over transgender athletes.

            In this chapter, we diagnose the issues that plague public communication and consider how you can fix them.
We begin by defining the public, public sphere, and public discourse. We then highlight problems with public communi-
cation, including the qualities of unproductive discourse. We end by identifying obstacles to more productive exchanges.
Our goal is for you to reflect on how and why we, as democratic participants, so often publicly agree or disagree in ways
that harm our relationships, public institutions, and democracy.

The Problems with Public Communication

Robust disagreement is necessary for a healthy democracy. Multiple, divergent perspectives and arguments allow for
better discussions of public policy. Too often, however, our disagreements devolve into yelling matches and oppositional
sides. To diagnose how and why, let's begin by examining what type of speech counts as public discourse and what ele-
ments in that discourse are cause for concern.

Analogy: Competitors on a reality television show      Analogy: Members of a sports team

            Our definition of a public draws heavily on the concept of the public sphere as articulated by the sociologist
and philosopher Jrgen Habermas. For Habermas, the public sphere is the gathering of community members to discuss
matters of common concern. The public talks, argues, and reasons together as equals, disregarding social and economic
inequalities among participants, ideally arriving at a more fulsome understanding of the issues.4

            When a public comes together to discuss matters of shared concern, they participate in public discourse. Public
discourse refers to rhetoric that is publicly offered to address a significant community concern or issue. You likely hear
public discourse on your campus about national politics, over local community projects, and regarding university stu-
dent services ranging from dining options to financial aid. Several factors make a discourse public rather than private:

 1. the setting and participants (it is visible and accessible to anyone implicated by the decisions made there);
2. the topics discussed (they impact a whole community); and ideally,
3. the nature of the communication (it is concerned with the common good rather than the desires of a few individu-

      als).

You can see, then, that "public," the "public sphere," and "public discourse" involve many members who may vary consid-
erably from each other but who come together to discuss their shared concerns.

Growing Concerns About the State of Our Public Communication

   When we look at the current state of our public discourse, we see we've developed
bad habits. Scholars who have voiced concerns about our communication may help
us understand what, precisely, is wrong with the way we talk to each other.

            1927: The efforts to diagnose and correct our public discourse might be
traced back to American philosopher and education advocate John Dewey and his
book The Public and Its Problems. Dewey contended that more and better communi-
cation is necessary to improve the public and, hence, democracy.

   "The essential need, in other words, is the improvement of methods of
debate, discussion, and persuasion. That is the problem of the public."5

            1998: In the twentieth century, political theorist Benjamin Barber pointed to  John Dewey via Picryl, Public
broadcast media as symbolic of more modern problems with public discourse in his           Domain.
book A Place for Us: How to Make Society Civil and Democracy Strong.

          "Talk radio is loudly public without being in the least civil, though it is seductively entertaining. Unfortu-
       nately, its divisive rant is a perfect model of everything that civility is not: people talking without listening,
       confirming dogmas, not questioning them, convicting rather than convincing adversaries."6

            2021: A twenty-first-century characterization of the problems of public discourse was offered by political the-
orist Maxime Lepoutre in their book Democratic Speech in Divided Times.

   "We find a public sphere saturated with emotional appeals, including intensely negative emotions such as

rage and resentment. Instead of mutual respect, public speakers routinely use their airtime to ridicule,

demean, or vilify others. And where sincerity should reign, campaigns of misinformation instead proliferate
unimpeded."7

               How would you characterize US public discourse today? Would you agree that when you hear public figures talk
   about hot topics, you mostly hear ranting, emotional accusations, and ridicule? In this book, we label such talk "unpro-
   ductive discourse." We turn next to the central features of unproductive discourse that make it so problematic.

  Qualities of Unproductive Discourse

   Unproductive discourse is purposefully sensational public communication designed to promote division and to mis-
   represent the complexities of public issues. It features poor arguments that appeal to the least common denominator,
   name-calling that substitutes for nuanced analysis, and an emphasis on points of division rather than points of agree-
   ment. In fact, when we look across multiple examples, several such qualities repeatedly appear. These qualities include,
   but are not restricted to, the following: division, dichotomous thinking, combativeness, certainty, lack of listening, win-
   ning, distrust, hierarchical communication, dogmatism, and misinformation.8 We consider each quality in box 2.1.

                                                                     began organizing events where drag queens read

                                                                     literacy, inclusivity, and diversity, some people

misinformation, distrust, combativeness, and certainty in their critiques.

 According to a Forbes article, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for instance, falsely accused drag
   queens of "having their way" with kids during story hours.

24 | Unproductive Public Discourse and the Politics of Polarization
 Fox News personality Tucker Carlson told his audience that story hours are intended to "indoctri-
   nate and sexualize children."

 Baseless claims of drag queens "grooming" children spread on social media outlets like TikTok. Sev-
   eral states introduced, and some passed, legislation banning or criminalizing drag shows where chil-
   dren might be present, with some labeling the shows as "obscene" content.9

                   In response, drag queens and sup-
       porters utilized dichotomous thinking, divi
       sion, misinformation, and combativeness in
       their self-defense.

 In late 2024, popular drag queen performer Jinx

Monsoon, for example, stated that conservatives

are "literally perpetuating lies." She added, "Their

whole agenda right now, it's just all such blatant

hypocrisy. Everything they accuse us of, there's

no data that supports it, and then they get caught

doing the thing that they say queer people are

doing."

 In the same video, drag performer Ben-

DeLaCreme argued, "Drag is not to be feared.

Drag is about love, until you cross us. Then you

better fear us, because we are strong. So back
down or watch out, is how I feel about it."10

 In March 2023, two drag supporters poked fun

at conservative leaders through a comedic but

combative Instagram account called "RuPubli

cans" that promoted misinformation by featuring
AI-created images of GOP leaders in drag.11

 Defense of drag became more intimidating at a

2022 drag brunch in Texas, where supporters

guarded the venue against protesters by dressing

largely in black and holding AR-15 style              BenDeLaCreme All Stars by hinnk via Wikimedia

                                    Rather than productively discuss the potential benefits of, and concerns about,
                        Drag Story Hour, several communicators used an array of unproductive discourse quali-
                        ties. Consequently, they reduced the issue to two incompatible sides, depicted each other
                        as opponents to be defeated, and provided little education about the issues of literacy,
                        diversity, safety, and modeling.

  Impacts of Unproductive Discourse

    Unproductive discourse offers some benefits. It often captures our attention and entertains us. Catchy one-liners that
    require little knowledge can be exciting and fun to watch. Such rhetoric tends to evoke strong emotions from listeners,
    stirring people to care about issues they might otherwise ignore. It can also bring a sense of clarity to an issue by con-
    trasting two sides.

                                                     However, the harmful outcomes produced by unproductive discourse overwhelm
                                         any advantages. Unproductive discourse typically lives up to its name in that it is, well, unpro-
                                         ductive. It produces little new or reliable information, nor real understanding, as to why the
                                         participants or sides fundamentally disagree. Instead, it can miseducate us, since it overly
                                         simplifies complex issues and participants, overlooks additional perspectives, and spreads
                                         false information.

                                                     Finally, unproductive discourse discourages us from becoming civically engaged
                                         because it emphasizes our divisions and turns us into spectators rather than participants. We
    are reduced to sitting on the sidelines and cheering or booing the participants. It's not surprising that many of us opt
    out of the spectacle altogether, developing cynical attitudes about politics and civic affairs.
                So what needs to change? The next section identifies recurrent obstacles to productive discourse that need to
    be addressed.

  Obstacles to Productive Communication

    There was never a golden era of respectful public discourse to which we hope to return. But there are at least five
    aspects of the situation today that exacerbate the problems: social media, the news media, the strategic use of incivility
    and disinformation, the marketing of ideas, and our own reluctant participation in democratic processes.

12. We derived these qualities in part by considering the inverse or opposite of the qualities of "civil talk" proposed by

    Benjamin Barber in A Place for Us: How to Make Society Civil and Democracy Strong (New York: Hill and Wang, 1998). We
    return to Barber's qualities of civil talk in the next chapter.
    26 | Unproductive Public Discourse and the Politics of Polarization
  Social Media

       Have you ever scrolled through social media and read a
    post that made you angry? Did you reach out to the per-
    son who posted it to thoughtfully discuss the topic? Or
    did you leave an angry comment or emoji, or even
    unfriend the person, and then move on to the next post?
    If you chose the latter, you're not fully to blame.

                Social media platforms encourage users to post
    things that will garner attention and emotional reactions.
    For public issues, that often means provocative or contro-
    versial claims that stir viewers' emotions but rarely
    expand their understanding. Pair that posting incentive
    with communication restrictions (such as the number of
    characters allowed or typical post lengths), and you can
    see why social media are not designed to facilitate Image by Pixelkult via Pixabay, Pixabay license.
    thoughtful discussions. Instead, they encourage, at worst,
    angry invective or, at best, an entertaining escape or mindless scrolling.

               Artist and writer Jenny Odell claims, "The platforms that we use to communicate with each other do not
            encourage listening. Instead they reward shouting and oversimple reaction: of having a `take' after having
            read a single headline."13

                Even people who refrain from making or commenting on posts are affected by the social media they consume.
    Algorithms that influence which posts we see tend to result in streams that largely reflect and reinforce our beliefs14
    and even steer us toward posts that feature anger and animosity.15 Together, the types of posts we are exposed to and
    the content they highlight tend to sow oversimplification and emotional reactions and discourage curiosity, empathy, or
    listening.

  News Media

    Similar to social media, some news media frame, cover, and discuss issues in ways that emphasize conflict and talking
    points rather than depth and nuance. Cable news programs (e.g., FOX, CNN), in particular, frequently feature verbal
    fighting between people with differing views. Such news shows attract viewers, but they often make issues appear too
    immense or too unattractive for viewers to meaningfully engage.

               News media shows on cable television tend to validate and valorize guests who stoke controversy and dis-
            agreement.

  Incivility and Disinformation as Strategies

    Two additional related, and more disheartening, obstacles are when public actors purposefully use ethically suspect tac-
    tics to impede meaningful discussions. One such tactic is what professor of public policy Susan Herbst calls "incivility as
    strategy."16 Most of us were probably taught growing up to avoid incivility, or offensive and rude behavior. Some public
    figures, however, purposefully choose incivility to gain attention and to silence detractors. Comments from radio and
    television personalities come to mind as a broad example, or attending a community forum and yelling to prevent a
    speaker from being heard.

                The other tactic is the spread of disinformation. Misinformation is the unintentional spread of inaccurate or
    false claims that lack sufficient or valid evidence and/or identifiable and credible sources. It is listed as a quality of
    unproductive discourse because it hurts deliberation when speakers fail to double-check the validity of their infor-
    mation before passing it on. Even more harmful, however, is disinformation, which refers to the deliberate attempt to
    spread wrong information to mislead listeners. Like incivility, some public actors use disinformation strategically to
    attract support for their ideas or followers for their campaigns.

               Box 2.3 Misinformation and Disinformation in COVID-19 Rhetoric
               We can find examples of misinformation and disinformation in some of the public discourse around the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, President Donald Trump downplayed the virus's threat and even promoted
            drinking disinfectant to combat it despite no supporting evidence. He and others in the White House also
            suggested, without evidence, that the virus was released by a lab in Wuhan, China.17 In the summer of 2020,
            the US military capitalized on this false belief through a disinformation social media campaign that targeted
            the Philippines. To weaken China's influence there, the military created false accounts that mimicked Fil-

    28 | Unproductive Public Discourse and the Politics of Polarization
                   When politicians and powerful actors purposefully impede discussion and decision-making, we
       need different approaches to public discourse.

Marketing Ideas Rather Than Working Toward Compromise

The political arena has, in many ways, become more like corporate marketing, or the deliberate promoting and selling
of products or services to consumers. Political strategists package politicians (especially candidates) and their ideas for
an American consumer market. We watch thirty-second television commercials that advertise their family lives and val-
ues (with which almost no one disagrees), look at their official websites (which are nearly always clad in patriotic colors),
and read memorable posts designed for social media. Civic engagement becomes reduced to simply choosing which
candidate to "buy" with your vote--and later to choose which prepackaged policy to support. In the process, the public
welfare becomes fragmented into demographic and interest groups, and individuals are reduced to passive consumers.

Reluctant Participation in Democratic Processes

Finally, we have ourselves to blame. How often do you research current issues? Contact your governmental representa-
tives? Hold lively and respectful discussions with friends and family about controversial topics?

            As members of a democracy, we too often do the following:
   Sit back and watch as decisions are made for us.
   Believe we are too busy to keep up with the issues or get involved.
   Defer to experts and authorities, wrongly assuming their powerful positions or knowledge will somehow enable

      them to promote the public welfare better than the public itself.
   Copy some of the more destructive discourse practices we see so frequently. We think that participating in a

      democracy means adopting a boorish persona and using the qualities of unproductive discourse.
            Fortunately, there are ways to speak much more productively to bring about the change we wish to see in our

institutions and communities. To improve our public discourse, many scholars and public thinkers have offered solu-
tions to increase the quality of our public exchanges, and we outline these in the next chapter.

     Summary

        This chapter outlined the contemporary state of our public discourse. It explored the qualities of unproduc-
     tive discourse, and it encouraged you to also think about a rhetoric's broader impacts on the public sphere
     when evaluating communication. In this chapter, you learned the following:

                                                                                              Unproductive Public Discourse and the Politics of Polarization | 29
          Public discourse today is largely problematic. It frequently features qualities we associate with unpro-
             ductive discourse, partly due to the obstacles that prevent speakers from engaging in more productive
             forms of communication.

          Unproductive public discourse is characterized by the following features: division, dichotomous think-
             ing, combativeness, certainty, lack of listening, winning, distrust, hierarchical communication, dogma-
             tism, and misinformation.

          Obstacles to productive discourse abound. They include social media, the news media, the strategies of
             incivility and disinformation, the treatment of the political arena like a marketing campaign, and the iner-
             tia or disillusionment of many everyday people who choose not to become involved and change our pub-
             lic conversations.

3. Changing Our Public Communication Toward
Productive Discourse

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Employ the qualities of productive discourse.
          Assess the difficulty of employing productive discourse.
          Explain the benefits of productive discourse.

How do you, as a democratic participant, improve communication practices? How can you speak in ways that build rela-
tionships and contribute to problem-solving rather than polarization? In this chapter, we consider possible solutions.
We first rethink public discourse and then introduce specific qualities of productive discourse. We end by considering
the difficulties and benefits of productive discourse.

Rethinking Public Discourse

To begin with, we can mentally shift away from equating public discourse with advancing one's self-interest and defeat-
ing oppositional views. We can instead think of public discourse as respectful explorations of disagreement. Such explo-
rations are designed for understanding differing opinions, recognizing our shared identity as a community, and making
wise judgments about what is best for the community as a whole.

                                                            Greek teacher of rhetoric Isocrates worked to "dis-

                                                            individual self-advancement and to associate
                                                            rhetoric instead with social interactions and civil
                                                            exchanges among human beings."1 That means we,
                                                            like Isocrates, can choose how to approach and use
                                                            rhetoric: for selfish gain or thoughtful exchanges

                                                            as the central tool for facilitating social interactions and

common interest rather than self-advancement. Such an approach incentivizes our use of specific productive discourse.

We turn next to the qualities that distinguish this type of rhetoric.

Qualities of Productive Discourse

   Political theorist Benjamin R. Barber advances "Nine
Characteristics of Civility" to encourage public behaviors

                                                                                                 Benjamin R Barber by Erich Habich via Wikimedia Commons, CC

   that will improve democracy.2 We borrow heavily from his characteristics to outline what we call "productive discourse."
               Productive discourse is public communication that is responsible to one's community and manages differences

   constructively. It requires active democratic participation through talking and listening. It reflects sound reasoning. It
   pursues multilateral problem-solving, and it relies on ethical standards of communication and interaction.

               Drawing on Barber's work, we can identify specific qualities at the core of productive discourse: commonality,
   deliberation, inclusiveness, provisionality, listening, learning, lateral communication, imagination, and empowerment.
   To these we add two additional qualities: trust and reliable information. In box 3.2, we briefly paraphrase each of Barber's
   qualities of "civil talk"--what we call productive discourse--and then describe our additional qualities.

Difficulties of Productive Discourse

Have you ever angered someone because you said the wrong thing or expressed a different opinion? Did you wish they
would instead try to understand you and show you some grace and compassion? That's what we must be willing to give
each other, especially when we strongly disagree. Unfortunately, few models of such patience and charity exist in the
media or our everyday lives. Consequently, while the qualities of productive discourse are easy to list, they can be harder
to use.

            In addition to curiosity and graciousness, speaking productively also requires time and attention. Compared to
unproductive discourse, it is not very exciting. However, if you are willing to devote the time and energy required to
learn these skills, then you will discover their numerous benefits.

Benefits of Productive Discourse

Productive discourse benefits civic engagement in at least three ways: It enriches our understanding of complex issues,
it unites communities, and it shifts attention to agreeable policies.

36 | Changing Our Public Communication Toward Productive Discourse
               To again state the obvious, productive discourse is productive! It produces a richer education about the impor-
   tant issues that affect our lives. You can recognize their complexity and uncertainty and the multiple options available.
   Such understanding means you can make better, more informed decisions about these pressing issues.

             When productive discourse is used, you are more likely to actively address public issues and improve your
          community rather than watch other people fight it out or make policies for you.

               In addition, productive discourse produces a more united community. You are likely to leave an exchange with
   a more sympathetic understanding of where someone else is coming from and with a stronger sense of what we hold in
   common.

               Finally, productive discourse moves conversations beyond entrenched positions toward mutually agreeable
   policies. Such outcomes are more likely to motivate you to get involved. Because of its numerous positive outcomes, we
   consider productive discourse a much more responsible and promising form of communication than unproductive dis-
   course.

             Box 3.3 Productive Discourse In Practice
             The murder of George Floyd, a Black man, on May 25, 2020, by white Minnesota police officer Derek
          Chauvin helped spark national conversations over racism, policing, and police reform. Just five months later,
          in November 2020, Black social media personality Emmanuel Acho posted the video "A Conversation with
          Police" to his popular YouTube series "Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man."4 In the video, Acho
          talked with four white male members of the Petaluma (California) Police Department about racism and
          policing. Their conversation illustrated several qualities of productive discourse even as they discussed con-
          tentious topics.

                       The conversation featured inclusiveness by involving a range of officers. While Acho was the only
          Black person visibly present, the officers themselves represented an array of positions and years of experi-
          ence--differences Acho made clear when introducing and asking questions to each officer and that officers
          occasionally referenced (e.g., "I've been doing this for thirteen years..."). Acho even invited an officer in the
          live audience to provide his perspective as a traffic officer. By including this range, the conversation
          revealed a variety of perspectives among the officers and thus avoided dichotomous thinking: Black people
          versus "the police." Instead, "the police" became humanized and differentiated across multiple positions,
          experiences, and viewpoints.

                       The conversation also displayed inclusiveness by becoming multidirectional. Acho primarily asked
          the officers questions, but the officers occasionally asked Acho questions as well. For instance, after Officer
          Ryan McGreevy answered Acho's question about whether there is "enough accountability in the police force

                                                                                          Changing Our Public Communication Toward Productive Discourse | 37
       when mistakes happen," another officer immediately asked Acho, "What does justice look like to you in these
       situations?" By enabling all participants to ask questions as desired, the conversation was shaped by more
       than one person or perspective. It also required all participants to potentially be on the "hot seat" and
       answer questions, not just ask them. Consequently, the discussion included a greater number of topics, per-
       spectives, and experiences than a strict interview format would have allowed.

                   In addition, all the participants clearly listened to each other. They appeared to make eye contact
       and nodded their heads as others spoke. No one cut anyone off, and follow-up comments or questions rec-
       ognized what was previously said. In one instance, retired Officer John Antonio, for example, asked Acho if
       Black officers make him as nervous as do white officers. As Acho explained why not, Antonio verified he was
       hearing Acho correctly. Antonio asked if Acho's connection with Black people "makes you relax a little bit
       more or..." That check-in allowed Acho to clarify the distinction he was making so Antonio and all viewers
       could better understand his perspective.

                   Finally, several participants displayed provisionality rather than certainty in their positions. For
       example, traffic officer Nick (no last name provided) explained that his officers approach every person at a
       traffic stop the same way rather than interact differently with Black people (in recognition that the experi-
       ence can be very different for them than for white people). But he added, "Maybe we should [approach them
       differently]." Later in the video, when Officer Greely explained why "defunding the police"--such as by allow-
       ing mental health workers, rather than police officers, to respond to mental health crisis calls--does not
       work when a person is wielding a knife, Acho admitted, "I had not heard it like that before." Such comments
       displayed humility and open-mindedness as discussants recognized the merits of each other's points and
       the limitations of their own understanding. Such provisionality lent to a productive discussion because par-
       ticipants (and, likely, viewers) better understood and respected each other.

     Summary

        This chapter identified the qualities of productive discourse as well as their numerous benefits for civic
     engagement. Specifically, in this chapter you learned the following:

          Productive discourse is characterized by commonality, deliberation, inclusiveness, provisionality, lis-
             tening, learning, lateral communication, imagination, empowerment, trust, and reliable information.

          Models of productive discourse are sparse because such communication requires graciousness, time,
             and attention, and it is not as exciting to watch as unproductive discourse.

          When utilized, productive discourse enriches our education about important issues, unites us as com-
             munity members, and shifts our conversations from entrenched positions to mutually agreeable policies.

4. Productive Discourse Is Responsible, Not
Necessarily Polite

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Distinguish productive discourse through its responsibility to the audience and community for the

             accuracy and impact of claims rather than through its politeness or civility.
          Evaluate whether a public discourse produces a more, or less, inclusive and equitable public sphere.
          Identify policing discourse that determines preferred or appropriate ways of talking together when

             deliberating public issues.
          Recognize reasons why democratic participants may use rude, angry, or uncivil rhetoric.

In the previous two chapters, we explored qualities that influence whether communication functions productively or
unproductively. In chapter 3, we defined productive discourse as public communication that is responsible to one's
community and manages differences constructively. In contrast, we described unproductive discourse in chapter 2 as
purposefully sensational public communication designed to promote division and to misrepresent the complexities of
public issues.

            If we ended our explorations there, you might assume that productive and unproductive discourses are easily
distinguishable, with clear-cut differences. However, actual public discourse is often more muddled with a mixture of
qualities. Focusing only on discursive qualities--getting caught up in checklists--can lead to superficial conclusions and
cause us to overlook what a rhetorical exchange is actually producing.

            In this chapter, then, we explore cases where seemingly "civil" or polite discourse functions unproductively as
well as when apparently "uncivil" or rude discourse functions productively. We will also consider why some rhetors opt
for uncivil communication. We begin, however, by more closely scrutinizing what we mean by productive discourse.

Responsibility, Not Necessarily Politeness

If you read through the list of qualities we associate with productive discourse in chapter 3 uncritically or too quickly,
you might mistakenly conclude we emphasize speaking "politely" or what some call civil speech: communication that
maintains decorum by being respectful, dispassionate, and polite. In other words, don't yell, avoid interrupting others,
and talk calmly through disagreements.

            However, such an equation is misguided. Borrowing from political theorist Benjamin R. Barber, our focus on

40 | Productive Discourse Is Responsible, Not Necessarily Polite
  productive discourse "is not about politeness; it is about responsibility."1 Speakers must be responsible to their audience
  and community for the accuracy and impact of their claims. That means productive discourse should ultimately produce
  something greater than a calm or friendly exchange; it should help build a more inclusive and equitable public sphere.

             Productive discourse should help build a more inclusive and equitable public sphere.

              Responsible public discourse, then, is public communication that draws on the qualities of productive dis-
  course to produce a more inclusive and equitable public sphere. It may or may not be civil. Indeed, it may appear as
  uncivil speech--rhetoric that violates decorum because it is disrespectful, angry, and/or impolite.

              So how can we determine when civil discourse operates unproductively and when uncivil discourse actually
  functions productively? Clues may be found by answering the following questions:

     Does the discourse attempt to spark or subdue discussion about an overlooked issue and ongoing societal problem?
     Does the rhetoric strive to include or exclude historically marginalized members of the public in democratic partic-

        ipation?
     Does this discourse attempt to preserve or question the power of historically dominant members of the public?
     All together, these questions suggest that responsible public discourse encourages public discussion of overlooked or
  unresolved issues as it draws the voices, experiences, and knowledge of historically marginalized people into democra-
  tic discussions and decision-making. It also questions the social, cultural, and economic power of historically dominant
  people rather than unreflectively granting their perspectives authority.

              Notice the questions posed here are worded as binary distinctions for clarity, but a public discourse might not
  be as clear-cut. In that case, you can ask if it leans more in one direction than another to make your judgment. The point
  is to avoid relying solely or superficially on the qualities listed in chapters 2 and 3 to determine productive and unpro-
  ductive discourse. Instead, also answer these questions to help distinguish the two types of rhetorics. Let's apply these
  questions to two different cases as examples.

Civil Discourse That Functions Unproductively

                                               Some forms of public discourse may appear civil or use some quali-

                                               ties of productive discourse but actually function unproductively. We

                                               can look, for example, at "Change My Mind" videos by social media per-
                                               sonality Steven Crowder.2 In these YouTube videos that were popular in

                                               the early 2020s, Crowder sits at a table with a poster that makes a

                                               provocative and conservative-leaning claim, like "There Are Only 2

                                               Genders," "Common Sense Gun Control Is Nonsense," and "Black Lives

                                               Matters Is a Terrorist Organization." He usually recorded his conversa-

                                               tion at a college campus with willing nearby participants.

                                               In most of these videos, Crowder (and often his conversational

                                               partners as well) talks politely in ways that may seem to abide by several

                                               qualities of productive communication. He deliberates by engaging

                                               arguments and positions. He listens; he rarely interrupts the other per-

                                               son and does not typically raise his voice. He also appears to seek to

                                               learn what the other person thinks as he asks follow-up questions to

                                               clarify their position.

                                               However, when we pay closer attention, we discover that

Steven Crowder by Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia  Crowder's polite discourse does not qualify as productive because his
Commons, CC BY-SA.                             statements borrow unproductive qualities and contribute to a more
                                               exclusive and inequitable public sphere.

Let's explore one example--"There Are Only 2 Genders"--by answering the questions posed earlier.

1. Question: Does the discourse attempt to spark or subdue discussion about an overlooked and ongoing societal

problem?

          Answer: Crowder's question starts conversation on the important public issue of gender. He says he

          wants "real conversation" and does "not set up [topics] to be a debate." Yet Crowder's starting point

          for discussion is a declared resolution: "There Are Only 2 Genders." This resolution was undoubtedly

          prompted by a national conversation that was already occurring about people who identify as transgender

          and nonbinary. Crowder's resolution and the conversations it started did not highlight an overlooked

          issue. Rather, they reacted to the attention alternative genders were receiving. The resolution suggested

          an attempt to reverse or subdue that attention.

          Furthermore, Crowder refers to the resolution as reflecting "my point of view" and spends every con-

          versation defending it. He thus frames the topic as consisting of only two incompatible positions: for and

          against the resolution (dichotomous thinking).

          During conversations, Crowder strives to prove the superiority of his position (winning). For example,

          he continually returns to four points to defend the presence of only two genders: that the gender theory

          that distinguishes sex and gender is "modern," that legal documents historically used gender and sex

          interchangeably, that we must know the number of genders possible, and that intersexuality is an anom-

          aly. Rather than attempt to explore more broadly and learn, he restricts conversation to these few,

          repeated points (dogmatism). His devotion to the resolution essentially shuts down, or subdues, actual

          deliberation of the topic.

            2. Question: Does the rhetoric strive to include or exclude historically marginalized members of the public in
      democratic participation?

                       Answer: Though Crowder talks to marginalized members of the public (including a nonbinary person
                    and a Black man), his resolutions typically seek to exclude them. If successful, for instance, arguing there
                    are only two genders excludes the existence of transgender and nonbinary people.

                       Many of his recurrent debate tactics also unfairly exclude alternative perspectives and arguments.
                    Rather than truly listen, he frequently depicts the other person's views as leading to an inevitable conclu-
                    sion--one that is very hard for them to defend. For example, he tells the first person he talks to (Thomas)
                    that Thomas must name how many genders exist for his argument (that sex and gender are different) to
                    have credibility "because we as a society have to know this." Those who perceive gender as a spectrum
                    cannot possibly identify the number of genders possible, since the concept of a spectrum eschews such
                    simple categories.

                       Crowder also occasionally focuses attention on the other person's character or affect rather than the
                    issue by labeling the other person's reactions (combativeness). For example, he says to the second person
                    (Madison), "You're getting very heated," "You've been set up here from the get-go for it [what I say] to
                    be offensive," and "You've been very privileged in speaking over me." Such comments shift attention from
                    Madison's arguments to their manner of speaking, implying their form of speech does not meet standards
                    and should be stopped.
            3. Question: Does this discourse attempt to preserve or question the power of historically dominant members of
      the public?

                       Answer: Crowder's defense of two genders preserves power ascribed to historically dominant people:
                    cisgender people who subscribe to a gender binary. It weakens attempts by marginalized community
                    members (like transgender and nonbinary people) to claim power and legitimacy.

                       In fact, Crowder uses prepared knowledge in these conversations to preserve power. He goes into dis-
                    cussions knowing the topic and having prepared research. He continually refers, for instance, to gender
                    theory being "modern" by starting with Simone de Beauvoir in 1948 and then being developed by John
                    Money and Judith Butler. Those speaking with him, however, spontaneously decide to talk about the topic.
                    They demonstrate varying degrees of knowledge or ability to speak eloquently on the spot, which makes
                    some of them come across as unintelligent. Thus, Crowder strategically places himself in sites where his
                    prepared knowledge becomes a source of power over conversational volunteers. He could instead give
                    them a chance to ruminate or do their own research before conversing about the topic.
            Together, the impacts of Crowder's conversations are irresponsible and restrict the public sphere. He produces
more entertainment than education as he seeks to prove the superiority of his beliefs and devalue opposing viewpoints.
Those watching in person or online may be less likely to participate in public discourse because they fear being similarly
combated or even humiliated. Thus, just because public discourse appears polite or "civil" does not mean it meets the
criteria of productive discourse.

Uncivil Discourse That Functions Productively

On the flip side, some public discourse that appears uncivil by using qualities of unproductive discourse may actually
function productively. We'll focus on one such form: social protest.

                                                                                                  Productive Discourse Is Responsible, Not Necessarily Polite | 43
               The activist social movement ACT UP formed in
   1987 to advocate for more and faster governmental
   resources to fight (the then lethal disease) AIDS. Short for
   the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, ACT UP sought to
   draw attention to the over fifteen thousand peo-
   ple--mostly gay men--who had contracted and died from
   the disease since it was discovered in 1981.

               ACT UP members used a variety of communica-
   tion tactics. Among their most memorable and notorious
   were evocative social protests, such as demonstrating
   outside--and inside--of Saint Patrick's Cathedral during
   mass ("Stop the Church"), holding a mock trial of leaders
   who impeded AIDS funding and research, spreading the Uganda Action by Kaytee Riek via Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA.

   wrapping the house of North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms in a giant yellow condom.

               Evaluating these protests with the list of unproductive qualities named in chapter 2 could prompt us to judge
   them negatively. The actions communicated distrust, lack of listening, combativeness, and a focus on winning. Let's
   pause, though, before we label the protests as uncivil and therefore unproductive. We need to explore how labeling
   rhetoric as uncivil can function as policing discourse.

  Policing Discourse

   Policing discourse is the use of rhetoric to determine preferred or appropriate ways of talking together when delib-
   erating public issues. It functions to control or "police" communication that violates what is considered preferred or
   appropriate.

               The call for civil speech is a policing discourse. People in positions of power have historically used this discourse
   to critique protesters. Critics tell protesters that they are "too radical," "too angry," or "too rude." That is, protesters are
   charged with violating decorum by being disrespectful, angry, and/or impolite.

               ACT UP was widely denigrated for adopting uncivil and thus inappropriate means of communication. In a 1989
   opinion piece authored by The New York Times after the group's cathedral demonstration, the newspaper concluded,
   "Arguments over AIDS, homosexuality and abortion are not going to be advanced by hysterics, threats or the disruption
   of religious services. They might be advanced by serious argument that reflects conviction." The piece also claimed that
   ACT UP's cathedral demonstration "offers another reason to reject both the offensive protesters and their ideas."3

   storming-of-st-pat-s.html.
   44 | Productive Discourse Is Responsible, Not Necessarily Polite
               Notice the policing discourse at work by the Times in differentiating "serious argument" that's worth listening
   to from "hysterics" that are not. By definition, policing discourse attempts to exclude or censor communication it deems
   uncivil. The implied instruction or demand is that protesters would be heard if only they "spoke appropriately" or "fol-
   lowed the rules" by adopting more acceptable forms of advocacy and argumentation.

             Box 4.1 The Public Sphere, Rhetoric, and Inequality
             In a democracy, community members are supposed to gather as equals. Regardless of differences in age,
          gender, sexuality, occupation, income, education, and so on, ideally, all community members can join in
          talking through public issues together. Recall from chapter 2 that Jrgen Habermas conceived of the public
          sphere as the gathering of community members to discuss matters of common concern.

                       Reality often fails to meet that ideal, however. For instance, not all members of a democracy get to
          participate. Philosopher Nancy Fraser has argued that gatherings of citizens have historically been created
          through the exclusion of some members of society, such as the poor,
          women, and children.4 In other words, certain men could talk with
          each other as equals by contrasting themselves with groups who were
          not even invited to speak or be heard in community conversations
          about public issues.

                       Exclusions from deliberating in the public sphere continue to
          exist, even if they are often subtler than the open discrimination of
          America's past. It is more difficult to participate in civic affairs, for
          instance, if you are living in poverty, less educated, undocumented, or
          a minor. Such exclusions might be simple accidents or weaknesses
          that have not yet been corrected, or they might be strategic.

               Calls for civility may seem reasonable and, at times, well intentioned. However, policing discourse has histori-
   cally been used primarily against social protesters who highlight injustice and call for change. By excluding their forms
   of communication, policing discourse shuts down their demands for equity and reform. Professors of communication
   Anna M. Young, Adria Battaglia, and Dana L. Cloud succinctly explain this tactic: "With the invocation of civility, calls
   for change are muted in favor of the status quo."5 In other words, labeling protest speech as uncivil ostracizes these
   rhetorics that expose something uncomfortable or unjust in the public realm. We saw how critiques of ACT UP's protests
   as "hysterical" discounted their accusations and claims. As box 4.2 explains, scholars such as Audre Lorde and Maxime
   Lepoutre have warned that we should instead attend to uncivil, especially angry, speech for the insights and injustices it
   reveals.

Box 4.2 The Productivity of Angry Speech

   To defend the productivity of some angry speech,
the twentieth-century poet, professor, and activist
Audre Lorde gave an address to the National
Women's Studies Association Conference in 1981
that she titled "The Uses of Anger." Lorde noted
that our culture has frequently branded public
expressions of anger--particularly by women--as
inappropriate.

            Lorde challenged her audience to listen to
the content behind anger. She told her audience we
should "listen to the content of what is said
[angrily] with at least as much intensity as we
defend ourselves against the manner of saying." She
warned, "When we turn from anger we turn from
insight, saying we will accept only the designs
already known, deadly and safely familiar."6

            More recently, political theorist Maxime    Audre Lorde by Elsa Dorfman via Wikimedia Commons, CC
Lepoutre has similarly argued that "anger can and       BY-SA,

should play a key role in democratic public dis-

course." Lepoutre claimed that "Public expressions of anger have a distinctive ability to reveal injustices, and

to promote understanding of injustices, when these may otherwise have gone unnoticed or been misunder-

stood." In "divided societies," they explain, "injustices suffered by some groups are often invisible to, or mis-
understood by, others."7 Thus, Lorde and Lepoutre suggest that some speech may be both angry and

productive.

  Uncivil Rhetoric That Functions Productively

   Let's consider, then, how ACT UP's uncivil speech functioned productively by answering the three questions posed ear-
   lier:

               1. Question: Does the discourse attempt to spark or subdue discussion about an overlooked issue and ongoing
         societal problem?

                          Answer: ACT UP's protests sparked national discussions about AIDS at a time when the disease had
                       killed tens of thousands of victims but was largely ignored in the broader public sphere. A major reason
                       for silence was the disease's negative perception as a "gay plague" (since it largely affected gay men) at a
                       time when homosexuality was still heavily taboo and even illegal in many US states. President Ronald Rea

                    gan did not publicly recognize AIDS until 1985, after nearly six thousand people had died and the epidemic
                    was raging. Congress was reluctant to fully fund research to cure it. The news media also were slow to
                    seriously cover the epidemic. Though ACT UP's efforts drew criticism, they also attracted national atten-
                    tion to AIDS, its victims, and the need for funding and humane treatment.
            2. Question: Does the rhetoric strive to include or exclude historically marginalized members of the public in
      democratic participation?

                       Answer: ACT UP consisted of queer people and their allies, who lacked easy access in the 1980s to tradi-
                    tional means of deliberation and advocacy due to their sexuality. Religious leaders condemned gay people
                    as immoral. Even as late as 1993, the Reverend Billy Graham suggested that AIDS was God's punishment
                    for gay people (though he later apologized).

                       When gay people did advocate publicly, their arguments and experiences were not necessarily taken
                    seriously by political leaders. In 1982, when a journalist asked Reagan's press secretary, Larry Speakes, if
                    the president had a reaction to the six hundred documented cases of AIDS, Speakes made light of the dis
                    ease by joking that he didn't have AIDS while other media members laughed.

                       ACT UP's efforts, then, empowered queer people who were clearly marginalized from the public sphere
                    by shifting the narrative from them as shameful sinners to advocates who deserved serious recognition
                    and support.
            3. Question: Does this discourse attempt to preserve or question the power of historically dominant members of
      the public?

                       Answer: ACT UP's communication directly challenged the social power of political and religious leaders
                    who devalued and discredited the homosexual community. Their protests turned the tables by encour-
                    aging onlookers to question the morality, decency, and ethics of the very leaders who condemned gay
                    people. The giant condom over Helms's house visually suggested he was an unsafe leader that the public
                    needed to be protected against. The cathedral protest, mock trial, and dumping of ashes on the White
                    House lawn all implied that political and religious leaders were responsible for allowing the epidemic
                    to grow and kill. The protests characterized these leaders' accusations against homosexuals and silence
                    about AIDS as unethical and unfair.
            Consequently, while many of their protests qualified as uncivil, ACT UP's communication functioned produc-
tively, because it produced a more inclusive and equitable public sphere. It's telling that while ACT UP faced heavy crit-
icism in its day, today it is widely seen as an incredibly successful and important social movement.

Why Use Uncivil Rhetoric?

You might still wonder, however, why do protesters ever adopt angry or rude (uncivil) rhetoric when they could instead
choose to communicate more respectfully and politely (civilly)? Scholars have provided several answers: Protesters typi-
cally lack easy access to the public sphere, uncivil protest demands attention that might otherwise be difficult to attract,
and uncivil communication reflects frustration and anger.

            First, because marginalized people typically have less access to power in the civic arena, it is harder for them
to influence public discussion and policies through traditional, acceptable means. Professors of communication Nina M.
Lozano-Reich and Dana L. Cloud have noted that:

       The powerful rarely are willing to invite those less powerful into dialogue; the oppressed are hard pressed to
       convince oppressors who benefit materially from oppression to be open to dialogue, let alone radical change.

                                                                                                  Productive Discourse Is Responsible, Not Necessarily Polite | 47
          Many discussions are by `invitation only,' a phrase suggesting that invitation belongs to those who set the rules
          for exclusion.8

               In other words, because they call for change, marginalized groups (the oppressed) lack easy access to public
   deliberations that use traditional, civil means of expression. It's not in the interests of the powerful to invite the
   oppressed into such civil discussions. Consequently, marginalized groups must often turn elsewhere to advocate for
   change.

               Second, those marginalized groups excluded from the public sphere tend to form what Fraser has called sub-
   altern counterpublics: gatherings of people excluded or dissuaded from the public sphere who raise issues ignored or
   trivialized by the broader public.9 In other words, their very exclusion from the public sphere tends to encourage people
   to come together on their own. They find affirmation and a sense of belonging among one another.

               Members of counterpublics learn and teach each other methods of challenging their exclusion in the broader
   public sphere, such as social protest. Indeed, sometimes social protest is the only way for members who are excluded
   from, or devalued in, the public sphere to influence public discussion and policies. They adopt the kind of rhetoric that,
   due to its incivility, demands attention.

               Finally, social protest by the oppressed typically reflects their anger and frustration. Their voices, needs,
   and calls for change using traditional means have been ignored, devalued, and/or discredited. Consequently, civil
   speech--especially when defined as dispassionate and polite--cannot adequately express the hurt and frustrations of
   their lived experiences and the vigor of their demands for change. As Lorde and Lepoutre explain (in box 4.2), anger is
   sometimes better able to communicate the presence and ongoing harms of injustice.

              Box 4.3 Not All Uncivil Rhetoric Is Productive
              Not all public protest that utilizes uncivil speech functions productively. Recall in chapter 2 that we
           named incivility as a quality of unproductive speech that some people use to gain attention and silence
           detractors.

            We can look to the August 11 and 12, 2017,
"Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as
an example. Participants marched at night with tiki
torches on the University of Virginia campus,
chanting "Blood and soil" (a phrase that evoked Nazi
rhetoric) and the antisemitic expression "Jews will
not replace us." The next day they carried Nazi and
neo-Nazi symbols, Confederate flags, and weapons.
Featured attendees, such as KKK leader David
Duke, organizer Jason Kessler, and neo-Nazi
Richard Spencer promoted white supremacy.

Here we have a social protest that used

uncivil speech: It was impolite, combative, and           Charlottesville "Unite the Right" Rally by Anthony Crider via

cal confrontations broke out with counterprotest-

ers, and white supremacist James Fields drove his car into counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer and

injuring thirty-five people.

            The violence was egregious, and we do not diminish it. But even if we focus only on the protesters'
communication, we can determine that it was unproductive in increasing the inclusivity and equity of the
public sphere. To understand why, we return again to the three criteria established earlier.

   1. Question: Does the discourse attempt to spark or subdue discussion about an overlooked and
ongoing societal problem?

      Answer: The march was held in Charlottesville in reaction to the city's decision to remove a
statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and rename the park in which it was located. Lee's
statue was the seventh such statue removed in Southern states since 2009, reflecting a national con-
versation about monuments, white supremacy, and racial violence. The "Unite the Right" rally, then,
attempted to subdue that discussion by showing support for keeping the statue and intimidating
people who disagreed.

   2. Question: Does the rhetoric strive to include or exclude historically marginalized members of the
public in democratic participation?

      Answer: By featuring known white supremacists and chanting Nazi and antisemitic rhetoric, the
protest clearly sought to exclude any Americans who are Jewish or not white from civic engagement.
The violence also suggests that some members wanted to physically stop anyone who disagreed with
their ideology from speaking against it.

   3. Question: Does this discourse attempt to preserve or question the power of historically dominant
members of the public?

      Answer: By promoting white supremacy and antisemitism, the protest explicitly sought to pre-
serve the power of white, Christian Americans, who have historically occupied positions of cultural
and economic privilege in the US.

   Consequently, not all protest that uses uncivil expression functions productively. Therefore, we challenge
you to examine the functions of uncivil rhetoric before you condemn or champion it.

                                                          Productive Discourse Is Responsible, Not Necessarily Polite | 49
            Recall that productive discourse is about responsibility, not necessarily politeness. Responsible public discourse
is public communication that draws on the qualities of productive discourse to produce a more inclusive and equitable
public sphere. When we evaluate public discourse more carefully, we are cautioned against uncritically using a list of
qualities to label a rhetoric as productive or unproductive. Otherwise, on one hand, we might fail to recognize forms of
expression that seem civil but actually exclude marginalized perspectives and perpetuate inequity. If we call these dis-
courses productive, we, too, may unintentionally constrict the public sphere and block challenges to the status quo and
powerful interests.

            On the other hand, we might also fail to appreciate social protest that appears uncivil but strives to expand
democratic participation and increase equity. If we label these as unproductive, we may inadvertently help eliminate
participants, reinforce inequality, and strengthen policing discourse that demands "acceptable" speech. These are
important aspects of public discourse we hope you will keep in mind as you promote civic engagement in your many
public relationships.

     Summary

        This chapter returned to distinctions we made in earlier chapters between unproductive and productive dis-
     course. It warned against using lists of qualities in overly simplified ways that miss the goal of productive dis-
     course: to build a more inclusive and equitable public sphere. Specifically, in this chapter you have learned:

          Responsible public discourse is public communication that draws on the qualities of productive dis-
             course to produce a more inclusive and equitable public sphere.

          We can better distinguish productive discourse through its responsibility to the audience and commu-
             nity for the accuracy and impact of claims rather than through its politeness or civility.

          Policing discourse is the use of rhetoric to determine preferred or appropriate ways of talking together
             when deliberating public issues. It functions to control or "police" communication that violates what is
             considered preferred or appropriate.

          The call for civil speech--communication that maintains decorum by being respectful, dispassionate,
             and polite--is a policing discourse. People in positions of power have historically used civil discourse to
             critique protesters by accusing them of using uncivil speech: rhetoric that violates decorum because it is
             disrespectful, angry, and/or impolite.

          Marginalized groups may choose uncivil speech to protest because they lack easy access to the public
             sphere where civil discourse occurs, uncivil protest demands attention they otherwise struggle to
             attract, and their communication reflects their frustration and anger.

5. The Ethics of Public Speaking

        Chapter Objectives

           Students will:
             Explain the meaning of ethics and ethical codes.
             Complete the ethical responsibilities of preparing to speak in public.
             Practice the ethical communication behaviors expected of public discourse.

  When preparing for a speaking occasion, you might be tempted to seek guidance and inspiration from past examples.
  Examining others' speeches might uncover an ingenious theme, identify a clever reference, or clarify "what not to do."
  Take a few notes from this speech, "copy and paste" a paragraph from another, venture into ChatGPT or Gemini to brain-
  storm topics and organize themes, and before you know it, you have a page or two of promising ideas. However, what is
  the difference between cultivating ideas based on other speeches and plagiarizing their content?

              With so much information available at our fingertips, it is easy to commit an ethical misstep--whether due to
  being willfully deceptive, using unauthorized generative AI assistance, taking imprecise notes, and/or failing to attribute
  critical information. Such transgressions--and their consequences--explain why ethics is an important, and occasionally
  confusing, concern for public speaking.

              We admit ethical questions are not always easy to answer. However, we also hold that there are recognized
  ethical practices that should govern our speaking and listening behaviors. In this chapter, we consider ethics in three
  dimensions: the relationship of ethics and rhetorical ethics, the ethics of speech preparation, and the ethics of speech
  performance.

 Ethics and Rhetorical Ethics

  Generally associated with the field of philosophy, ethics refers to a set of moral principles governing human conduct as
  it pertains to motives, ends, and the quality of one's actions. The ethical quality of conduct is generally evaluated based
  on how it reflects what is deemed "good" or "bad," or "right" or "wrong," in a culture. We frequently use criteria such as
  honesty, morality, equality, and justice that are derived from culture, religion, upbringing, and community and institu-
  tional contexts to judge the ethics of a behavior.1

  1996), 235.
  52 | The Ethics of Public Speaking
Ethical Codes

A more specific articulation of ethics is an ethical code, a set of rules or guidelines agreed to by a culture or group
to regulate behavior. For instance, the American Medical Association (AMA) has a "Code of Medical Ethics" that is rec-
ognized as the "most comprehensive ethics guide for physicians." With medical advances and changing legal guidance,
the code is subject to reflection and debate. For instance, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, abortion and some
assisted reproductive technologies, and genetic testing and stem cell research present thorny dilemmas. However, the
code provides physicians with principles to guide their professional conduct.2

            College communities also typically have their own code of ethics, such as a university's "rule of conduct" that
governs student behavior and academic honesty. Common to such policies is a prohibition on cheating and plagiarism,
including copying others' work, wrongly taking credit for others' words and ideas by failing to supply necessary attribu-
tion, and engaging in additional prohibited activities. You are probably familiar with the meaning of academic honesty at
your institution--and if you are not, you should be. While such codes provide guidance to students, inevitably there are
debates over their interpretation and enforcement. Perhaps you can point to important debates and discussions about
your institution's code of conduct or policies.

          The Virginia Military Institute's (VMI) honor system is one
       of the most historic ethical codes in higher education. At the
       heart of its system is the principle that cadets are "men and
       women of honor and integrity who can always be trusted" to
       follow their succinct code: "A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal,
       nor tolerate those who do."3

The difficulty in identifying a singular, universal ethical

code is that individuals and communities have different world-

views, experiences, and values. Behavior that is accepted and      Virginia Military Institute by National Park Service
expected in one community may be out of bounds in another.         via Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.
Actions we would dismiss as unethical in the abstract--lying, for

instance--might be more complicated when put into specific contexts. The point is that ethical standards are commu

nity standards, and thus, we can expect disagreements about their meaning. However, that does not mean all actions

are acceptable, only that ethical evaluations are based on many factors.

 Rhetorical Ethics

                                       While no single widely known code of rhetorical ethics exists on the level of the AMA's "Code
                                       of Medical Ethics," we can identify communication behaviors that are deemed acceptable and
                                       unacceptable. Rhetorical ethics, or the ethics of public speaking, refers to how we expect
                                       speakers and audience members to behave and interact as they communicate about matters
                                       of the public good. To that end, rhetoric scholar James Herrick identifies a set of ethical goods
                                       inherent across the history of rhetorical practice:

                                          (1) discovering truths and arguments relevant to decision-making on contingent issues,
                                       (2) advocating, interpreting and propagating ideas before publics, and
                       (3) testing propositions in debate.4
      When you, as a speaker, adhere to these practices, you enrich our public discourse. Moreover, you embody ethical
   rhetoric and reflect the qualities of productive discourse discussed in chapter 3.
               We contend that rhetorical ethics involves the preparation of public speakers, the actions of speakers in pre-
   senting information, and as the next chapter explores, the listening behaviors of audiences.

 The Ethics of Speech Preparation

   Rhetorical ethics begins with the speech preparation process. This includes the commitment a speaker shows to an
   audience as well as the ethical choices made in the selection of information. While the next section on speech perfor-
   mance discusses the latter topic, here we consider speech preparation as an ethical demand.

             Box 5.1 The Deceptively Hard Work of Speech Preparation
             When done well, public speaking looks deceptively easy--it is "just talking," after all. Few people fully
          appreciate how difficult it is to craft a successful presentation--the time it takes to develop the main idea,
          do the research, choose the language and tone, practice the delivery, and so forth. In fact, one might say we
          are trained to not notice these efforts.

                       work. America Ferrera and Denzel Washington are effective actors because they

have honed their craft over many years.

            Even nonactors like the late Steve Jobs, cofounder and chief executive officer of Apple, achieve
speaking success, in part, due to their extensive preparation. Before his death, Jobs was a highly anticipated
and captivating business speaker, and his "tech talks" were "must-see TV" for computer geeks and investors
alike as he introduced new products and updates.

            Watching Jobs, one might note his easy extempora-
neous style, his eye contact, the engaging gestures, and the
integration of his content with his visual aids. Although he
tended to pace, it fit the persona he developed. In his
appearances at the Macworld Expo, for example, Jobs
appeared casual and relaxed, perhaps giving the impression
that he had not prepared very much or was not trying very
hard. On the contrary, this was part of the appearance Jobs
worked diligently to cultivate. We are not suggesting that the
accolades Jobs received as a speaker were unwarranted.
Instead, they were achieved after a significant investment of
time and effort.

           might be relevant. Evangelist says that Jobs would go through multiple dress rehearsals that focused on
           every conceivable element with "no detail...overlooked."6

               What effective public speakers and performers have in common is that they take their development of public
   discourse--their speeches, their work--very seriously. They are responsible to their audience; they are ethical in their
   preparation.

               The idea that speech preparation is not only important but also an ethical demand for speakers was well
   explained by Professor W. Norwood Brigance in a public speaking textbook chapter entitled "Four Fundamentals for
   Speakers."7 In his direct and challenging style, Brigance made clear how much work is required of public speakers:
   "Effective public speaking is a technique, as definitely as are the techniques of designing airplanes and removing appen-
   dixes, except that it is older and more complex than either."8 How can Brigance claim that public speaking is more com-
   plex than the precise calculations required to keep an aircraft in flight or the delicate movements necessary in surgery?
   His point is that there is not a single rote method for speechmaking, nor is there an equation available to guarantee suc-
   cess. With so many human factors and variables, public speaking requires constant revision and adaptation along with
   sustained attention to its preparation.

              Box 5.2 Ethical Preparation
              Elements of ethical preparation are addressed across this book, including instruction on research, rea-
           soning, outlining, and delivery. Some of the more important practices that demonstrate ethical preparation
           for your public presentations include the following:

   Responsibility and
respectfulness

            Another Brigance maxim to which we subscribe is his belief that a speaker "must earn the right to give every
speech."9 While many people "like to talk" or "like to debate," they overlook the responsibility that comes with the oppor-
tunity. When you are given a chance to speak, it comes with a corresponding ethical responsibility to take the occasion
seriously and to come prepared with something meaningful to share. See box 5.2 for advice on practices important to
ethical speech preparation.

The Ethics of Speech Performance

Every so often, we learn that a high-profile speaker unethically took another person's ideas. Perhaps you know of such
an example. But why does it matter if the speaker did not invent their speech? Does it really change how an audience
should understand and respond to the rhetoric? Yes, it very well might. In this section we examine the ethics of public
influence and five ethical practices important to public communication.

The Ethics of Public Influence

Perhaps the central reason rhetorical ethics is important is that audiences make decisions based on the public discourse
they hear. We form judgments based on listening to commencement speakers, reading a trusted information source on
the internet, and even when making travel decisions after seeing a forecast from the local meteorologist. In each case,

                          The Ethics of Public Speaking | 57
          rhetors communicate information the public uses in decision-making: How can I best con-
          tribute to society? Which candidate should I vote for? What can I do about environmental
          problems in my community? Is it safe to travel today? Public rhetoric--your rhetoric--has
          consequences for which you are responsible, and thus you have an ethical duty to your audi-
          ence.

             Your rhetoric has consequences: Audiences make decisions based on what you say

to them!

   Box 5.3 Fact-Checking a President

   Because the public makes choices based on the rhetoric of elected officials, some news outlets increas-
ingly "fact-check" their public statements. In likely the most visible stance on the topic, starting in 2016, The
New York Times began pointing out what it felt were misleading statements by Donald Trump rather than
just reporting what he said.

     This started by taking a stand against then-candidate Trump's "Birther Lie" concerning the birth-
        place of Barack Obama.

     It continued by chronicling "Trump's Lies" after his first year in office during his first term as presi-
        dent.

     The newspaper proceeded by recording how his public statements between the 2020 presidential
        election and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot contained "persistent repetition of lies."

     The paper later identified Trump's "frequently false" statements during a June 2024 presidential
        debate as a candidate for a second term as president.

     It persisted by documenting his "`Machinery' of Misinformation" during Trump's second term.

                                                                                    It is easy to question the stance of The New York
                                                                       Times as the product of the "liberal media," but its
                                                                       approach is notable in repeatedly calling out a president

            for the accuracy of his statements. It does so because public discourse influences the decisions that the
            public and voters make.10

                National Communication Association (NCA), the largest organi-
    zation of communication scholars and practitioners in the United States,
    has a Credo for Ethical Communication that provides a useful perspec-
    tive on responsible communication behaviors. In part, the credo holds:

            Questions of right and wrong arise whenever people communicate.
            Ethical communication is fundamental to responsible thinking,
            decision-making, and relationship building, and community devel-
            opment within, and across, contexts, cultures, channels, and media.
            Moreover, ethical communication enhances human worth, human
            life, and dignity by fostering truthfulness, fairness, responsibility, NCA Nameplate by
            personal integrity, and respect for self and others. We believe that Acekinghearts on

                                                                                                                          Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA.
            unethical communication threatens the quality of all communica-
            tion and consequently the well-being of individuals and the society in which we live.11

                The NCA Credo goes on to list principles at the core of ethical communication, including

       advocating "truthfulness, accuracy, honesty, and reason as essential to the integrity of communication";
       condemning "communication that degrades individuals and humanity through distortion, intimidation, coercion,

          and violence, and through the expression of intolerance and hatred"; and
       accepting "responsibility for the short- and long-term consequences for our own communication" while expecting

          "the same of others."

    You should quickly recognize that qualities consistent with the NCA Credo have been promoted in the opening chapters
    of this book--and appear central to The New York Times's criticism of Donald Trump's rhetoric (in box 5.3). Similarly, if

Box 5.4 Artificial Intelligence and Ethics

   Advanced artificial intelligence, more commonly
known as generative AI, is rapidly reshaping the
world in significant ways, including how content is
produced. A quickly expanding and ever-changing
array of generative AI chatbots and AI assistants are
available, including ChatGPT, Claude, Google Bard,
Bing Chat, and Gemini.

Increasingly, members of the workforce

need to understand how to use generative AI, and

colleges need to teach their students about effec-

tive, ethical use. The extent to which generative AI

acts as a supplement, as opposed to a replacement,

for independent work is an important part of the

conversation. We advocate measured, thoughtful         Artificial Intelligence by mikemacmarketing via Wikimedia

the speechmaking process rather than substitute

for it, maintaining an emphasis on the importance of independent learning of the fundamentals of speech-

making. Here are some considerations to make before you use generative AI as well as how to use it:

Ethically Using Generative AI

  Examine any policies your school has on the use of AI in academic work.
  Discuss any potential use of AI with your instructor in advance of utilizing it.
  Follow any policies or parameters for AI use set out by your instructor: What your instructor says

     determines the contextual, ethical use of AI for your work on that speech and in that class.
  Track and cite your AI use to keep it transparent, including search inputs supplied to the AI. Chap-

     ter 9 provides specific instructions on how to cite your use of AI.
  Verify any information you locate using AI rather than simply relying on what the AI generates.

Using Generative AI as a Feedback Tool

  Use AI to brainstorm leading arguments and counterarguments on your topic.
  Use AI to identify policy options and solutions.
  Use AI to identify the strengths and weaknesses of your outline so you can improve it.
  Use AI to polish your writing and make writing suggestions.
  Use AI to prepare for questions the audience might ask about your speech.

Limiting Your Reliance on Generative AI

 Don't rely on AI to locate and cite sources. Some generative AI make up sources, including citations
   that seem plausible but are not factually accurate. Chapter 9 also discusses this tendency.

 Don't rely on generative AI to provide accurate information. AI is limited based on the resources

60 | The Ethics of Public Speaking
        available to it.
     Don't rely on AI to generate complex and engaging prose.

   The quality of AI-generated content is quickly improving with each iteration of AI chatbots, but limita-
tions to source material and writing quality remain. Such issues have occasionally emerged in controversial
and problematic ways, including in the creation of legal briefs that have relied on faulty information. There
are also important questions related to bias in the language and stereotypes used by some AI, the material
generated by AI, and efforts to detect it. These concerns range from the limitations of facial recognition, to
generation of imagery, to faulty accusations of AI use that have been levied, particularly against nonnative
English writers and speakers.12

Ethos and Five Ethical Practices of Public Communication

                      When engaging in public speaking, there are five ethical practices that deserve additional atten-
                   tion: plagiarism, ethical research, sound reasoning, respectful language, and taking responsibility
                   for consequences. In each case, a violation results in a loss of ethos. Aristotle identified ethos as
                   one of three modes of proof used for invention. Ethos refers to the state of one's public character
                   or persona--what we commonly call credibility. In the context of public speaking, ethos involves
                   an audience's perceptions of a speaker's trustworthiness, competence, goodwill, and dynamism.13

                               As listeners, we assess a speaker's credibility to help determine how much merit to place

on their message:

 Does the speaker seem honest and of high integrity (trustworthiness)?
 Do they--by reputation, expertise, or performance--demonstrate themselves as capable (competence)?
 Do they appear to care about the audience's welfare (goodwill)?
 Is their performance engaging (dynamism)?

All these components have ethical implications, although, understandably, it is the expectation of trustworthiness that
is most often invoked in ethical evaluations.

Avoid Plagiarism

The most commonly recognized ethical responsibility of a speaker is to refrain from plagiarism. Pla
giarism is the unacknowledged use of another's words and ideas as one's own. As a college student,
you should understand the importance of original work that is free of plagiarism. You should also
understand the need to uphold academic honesty, which avoids all forms of cheating. Original, eth-
ical work is expected from you because it is fundamental to learning, and it is a core component of
honesty.

            In a public speaking class, it constitutes plagiarism if you submit as your own a speech, outline, or paper pre-
pared by someone else. Plagiarism also includes using language and ideas developed by another source without appro-
priate citation. Submission of such work is dishonest and thwarts the educational process. Even if you develop delivery
skills through the performance of someone else's work, you cannot learn the speechmaking process, which ranges from
topic selection, to thesis development, to research, to argumentation.

            Generative AI raises new and complex questions surrounding original work. You should discuss any use of AI for
speechmaking with your instructor in advance and acknowledge any use of AI within your work. See box 5.4 for further
considerations on the ethical use of AI as part of the speechmaking process.

            Plagiarism is a concern not only in the classroom but also in society. Several public figures, from politicians to
academics, have been accused of plagiarism. These instances (considered in box 5.6) underscore the need to carefully
document sources and to not use others' work as your own. Failing to do so can have devastating consequences and
creates the need for public explanations and apologies.

Box 5.6 Case Studies: Plagiarism in Society

                                    In May 2021, University of South Carolina president Robert Caslen
                                 resigned after acknowledging that aspects of his commencement speech
                                 plagiarized a 2014 commencement address given at the University of
                                 Texas by retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, who was tasked with
                                 leading the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In an acknowledgment that
                                 parallels the scenario that opens this chapter, Caslen wrote, "I was
                                 searching for words about resilience in adversity and when they were
                                 transcribed into the speech, I failed to ensure its attribution. I take full
                                 responsibility for this oversight."14

                                 Another high-profile inci-

                                 dent involved the 2016 Republican

Conduct Ethical Research

As the examples from Robert Caslen and Melania Trump in box 5.6 illustrate, plagiarism also reflects failings of ethical

research and, most specifically, proper practices for using supporting materials. These ideas are addressed with addi-

tional depth in our discussions of research (chapters 8 and 9) and reasoning (chapters 26 and 27). Here we are interested

in how source use involves important ethical considerations. So while ethical research implicates issues of plagia-

rism--for instance, not citing sources or giving the impression that the ideas or words of others are your own--it also

extends to the larger realm of academic dishonesty based on how research is gathered and credited.

                                                   Speakers commonly face the issue of how to give proper credit

                                                   to sources. In written work there is the expectation that we use formal

                                                   modes of documentation ranging from in-text acknowledgment of a

                                                   source, to endnotes, to bibliographies. Since an oral presentation is a

                                                   different format, there is sometimes confusion over how to approach

                                                   such issues. However, the basic expectation is that materials that merit

                                                   citation in written form also merit citation in an oral form. Chapter 9

                                                   specifically addresses how to orally cite research and more thoroughly

                                                   addresses its importance.

                                                   Keep in mind that all sources should appear in a bibliography

Commons, CC BY.                                    ply source information to audience members on request. Ultimately, a
                                                   good rule of thumb is when you are uncertain if material needs to be

cited, err on the side of inclusion and provide a verbal acknowledgment.

Beyond citation there are three additional ethical issues related to the use of sources:

 Do not overstate or manipulate evidence. Representing evidence accurately rather than manipulating it to fit your
   desired conclusion is necessary to establish public or audience trust. Remember that the information you convey
   can influence decision-making.

 Do not fabricate evidence. Even if you are confident that the evidence exists, do not take a shortcut by inventing
   what you think you know. Instead, locate credible evidence for the idea and cite it. If you cannot locate the evi-
   dence, then the legitimacy of your assumed conclusion is also in doubt.

 Do not suppress counterarguments and opposing evidence. Instead, acknowledge them. This is important because
   it allows a community to thoroughly consider policy options, particularly since some in your audience are likely
   aware of such evidence. It is through addressing counterevidence that you can supply important analysis and refu-
   tation that can ultimately strengthen your case. Chapter 25 provides guidance for how to acknowledge and refute
   counterarguments when developing a persuasive speech.

Practice Ethical and Sound Reasoning

A third ethical responsibility for speech performance is that we make reasonable claims supported by evidence. We must
not rely merely on assertion, a claim that lacks an evidentiary basis and is offered without reason, support, or data.

64 | The Ethics of Public Speaking
            Relatedly, we must balance appeals to pathos, more commonly called emotional
appeals, with the use of reason. Pathos refers to the psychological state of the audience and
rests upon a speaker's effective, ethical appeals to the audience's emotions and motivations.
Like ethos, pathos is part of the rhetorical canon of invention identified in chapter 1.

            However, relying exclusively on pathos in ways that deter critical thinking is unethi-
cal. For instance, it is unethical to ignore the facts of a situation in favor of preying on an
audience's fears. Overly relying on fear tends to discourage thoughtful, reasoned analysis.
Chapter 33 offers an analysis of a speech that engaged in this practice.

Use Language Ethically

Fourth, as a speaker it is your responsibility to respect your audience by using ethical language. Words are crucial to
our understanding of the world and help construct identities. Through our words we can bring a community together
to pursue improvements or divide it and hinder such progress. Think about competing ways to discuss substance addic-
tion, transgender persons, or national identity and ethnicity. Our language can be constructive and inclusive in advanc-
ing dialogue, or it can severely undermine it.

            Therefore, it is important to avoid rude, vulgar, sexist, heterosexist, and racist language as we treat audience
members humanely. Sexist, heterosexist, and racist language excludes audience members and denies their value as
fellow community members by perpetuating negative perceptions. The labels, metaphors, and euphemisms used to
characterize groups of people make it easier to dismiss them and sometimes to even forget their humanity. Similarly,
inaccurate naming or pronoun use dehumanizes those included in the discussion and/or those being talked about.

            Certainly, we might use unethical language unintentionally, but to do so willfully--for instance, by intentionally
ignoring an individual's pronouns--is to deny and damage identity, reinforce stereotypes, and purposefully disrespect
the people involved. The ethical speaker thinks about the context within which they are communicating, attempts to
avoid charged or hateful language, and discusses people and objects in appropriate and accurate terms.

Be Responsible for the Consequences of Your Rhetoric

Finally, the ethical speaker considers and accepts the consequences of their rhetoric. Remember, people base decisions
on what you say. Therefore, you must consider the consequences of your message for them.

ideas at the core of ethical speaking behavior. Use these principles as a checklist to review your speech preparation prior
to delivering a presentation to ensure you are practicing ethical communication.

     Summary

   This chapter explored the importance of rhetorical ethics in maintaining the reputation of rhetorical practice
and making public deliberation possible. Public speaking ethics includes the ethics of speech preparation and
the ethics of speech performance. Specifically, in this chapter we observed the following:

     Ethics and ethical codes are used to evaluate our behaviors.
     Rhetorical ethics provides guidelines for the practice of public communication.

   sional opportunities.
 There are significant public implications to unethical behavior, including poisoning public discussion,
   making reasoned decision-making more difficult, and leading publics toward unwarranted conclusions.
 Sound rhetorical ethics begins with the speech preparation process as we earn the right to address
   audiences by being prepared, well informed, and practiced.
 Ethical speaking behavior also means being mindful of our conduct as a speaker and, in particular,
   avoiding plagiarism, practicing ethical research, bringing forward reasonable claims that are supported
   by evidence, treating audiences with respect, and taking responsibility for the consequences of our
   rhetoric.

        Chapter Objectives

           Students will:
             Explain listening as an ethical obligation.
             Demonstrate an ethical listening attitude by employing several types of listening.
             Illustrate listening to comprehend and retain information.

                                                 It is tempting to think that public speaking ethics is only about talking--it is called
                                     speaking after all. However, speechmaking is a transactional act between a speaker and an audi
                                     ence; by listening to a speech, you are participating in it. You do that through your feedback to
                                     the speaker, such as through your eye contact (or lack thereof), body language, head nods, and
                                     so on. You also participate in a speech as a listener by how the speech impacts your own com-
                                     munication. Perhaps you will later use the knowledge gained from the presentation to partici-
                                     pate in public dialogue about the topic or to inform another class presentation.

                                                 An ethical listener demonstrates responsibility to the speaker and to the society in
   which they live through how they listen. This chapter explores several characteristics of good, ethical listening. Specifi-
   cally, we will consider how an ethical orientation to listening includes possessing an ethical listening attitude, listening
   to comprehend and retain information, and listening for message evaluation.1

 Enacting an Ethical Listening Attitude

   An ethical listening attitude, whereby you approach discourse with an open mind and without
   fixed opinions, enables and requires you to engage in five types of listening that we explore next:
   active listening, appreciative listening, empathetic listening, listening to learn, and listening to
   improve.

               Communication scholars sometimes lament that listening is a "lost art." Perhaps this is
   related to changes in public communication. You might recall from chapter 2 that unproductive
   discourse transforms listeners from participants into spectators of public dialogue.

               If you are to meaningfully participate in the civic world, you need to avoid the tendency to be a passive recipient
   of information. Instead, you must strive to practice active, engaged listening.2 When we say that an ethical listener prac-

tices active listening, we mean they participate in the speech act by listening closely, critically, and constructively. An
active listener concentrates on what the speaker is saying, thinks about and reflects on the meaning of the speaker's
content, and focuses on the potential of the message rather than on merely tearing it down.

   Box 6.1 Types of Listening

   A speaker might adopt several different and overlapping orientations to listening depending on their
goals, motivations, orientation to the topic, and occasion. Some of the more common and important types
of listening include the following:3

Active listening          An active listener listens closely, critically, and constructively. They concentrate on what the

   Appreciative lis      Appreciative listening is an attitude that allows for the enjoyment of a presentation, its aes-

information

   Evaluative listen     Evaluative listening involves thinking critically about a speech's content and testing its
ing                    claims in order to form judgments about its ideas.

            Appreciative listening is an attitude that allows us to enjoy a presentation and its aesthetics. We should appre-
ciate, and even be inspired by, a well-crafted speech when its style and the spirit of its message are pleasant to the ear.4

                                       Empathetic listening is ideally suited to deliberative practices, as it considers "the humane
                           aspects of public issues." As communication scholars Michael Osborne and Suzanne Osborne
                           explain, this listening quality encourages a "closeness" between the listener and speaker and a con-
                           cern "for others in the immediate or larger cultural audience, who might be affected by his or her

words."5 This characteristic of listening reflects that we are open to change, that we respect and value the speaker, and
that we have a sense of social responsibility that extends beyond self-interest.6

          Box 6.2 Examples of Empathetic Listening
          Think for a moment about a situation when a speaker or audience member was radically different from
       you. For instance, perhaps you are from an urban area, and a speaker advocated to hunt and fish in certain
       areas using means you typically reject. You lacked experience or a personal connection to the topic, but
       empathetic listening allowed you to see the issue from the speaker's view.

                   Or imagine being a burgeoning small-business owner engaged in a community discussion about
       zoning, one that could potentially adversely affect your ability to place your business in a particular loca-
       tion. Empathetic listening means working to understand the issue from the perspective of those who sup-
       port zoning regulations, despite your personal interest. Practicing empathetic listening means, as best we
       can, seeing the world through the eyes of another and feeling as they do.

            Finally, by listening to learn, you attend closely to what others say to gain knowledge and insights from their
arguments and perspectives. When listening to improve as a speaker, you listen to how they present their speeches.
Concentrate on the speaker's structure, development of the argument, and use of quality sources. However, also reflect
on speaking techniques: common strategies used to introduce and frame the topic, how the speaker modulates their
voice for emphasis, and how they incorporate visual aids.7 By listening attentively, we can understand the speech and
improve our own speaking abilities.

       rhetoric and democracy, was known to counsel students in a frank and challenging style. Here Brigance
       offers sharp words on the role and responsibilities of listeners in a public speaking classroom.

                  Your role while others speak, then, is not to fade into a coma and be merely aware that there is a
               noise. It is not to be half conscious, dully skim what is said, and rouse yourself when there is a pause,
               change of pace, an especially emphatic word, or an interesting tidbit. If you listen in these ways,
               opportunity once gone cannot be recaptured. Rather, when others speak you are in position to say,
               "Here is the chance to learn without making mistakes, or having to pay for them."...

                           First, you want the answer to "What did the speaker say?" That is, you listen to get the idea
               and determine its worth: What is the speaker talking about? What is his proposition? What is his
               skeleton of supporting ideas? Are his facts accurate? Can his judgment be trusted?...

                              Second, you want the answer to "How did the speaker say it?" That is, you listen to discern
                  and evaluate his speaking techniques: What kind of introduction was that? Was he [sic] too slow in
                  getting to that point? Did he make the proposition clear?...Should he have used a summary of that
                  topic? Would not an illustration or comparison have made that point clearer?...He made that point
                  perfectly clear in two minutes; I wonder if I can use that method in my next speech? He certainly
                  knows how to use examples; ought I to look into how to use them better? Note how he drove that
                  topic home with a climax; that's where I fell down on my last speech.8

               Ultimately, adopting an ethical listening attitude allows you to get the most from public communication. It
   reflects an openness and adaptability that is at once ethical and puts you in position to consider a presentation from
   several different perspectives depending on your goals and circumstances. Such an approach starts with active listening
   but also is open to practicing appreciative and ethical listening while seeking to learn and improve as a speaker.

 Listening to Comprehend and Retain Information

                                  Ethical listening includes listening to comprehend and retain information, or the orientation in
                                  which you listen to understand and remember the content of a speech. Only by comprehending
                                  an issue--be it the presentation by the wildlife enthusiast or the discussion of zoning discussed
                                  in box 6.2--can you intelligently participate in its discussion. Similarly, through retention you can
                                  carry your new understanding forward into later conversations on the issue.

                                               You can only comprehend and retain information if you pay attention to speeches. As a
                                  listener, you should adopt habits that will improve your attention. Box 6.4 provides specific sug-
   gestions to help you understand and remember what speakers share.

              Box 6.4 Practicing Ethical Listening: Comprehending and Retaining Information
              There are several behaviors and actions you can undertake to be a more ethical listener who desires to
          effectively comprehend and retain information. These include the following:
                Listen with an open mind: Be receptive to the message.
                Listen actively: Stay mentally alert and engaged with the message.
                Take notes: Remain engaged by writing down key ideas from the presentation.
                Create a speech outline: Chart the speaker's structure, including noting key sources and supporting

                   material so you might consult and review them later.
                Compose questions: Be prepared to engage the speaker in discussion.

8. Brigance, Speech, 89.
   72 | The Ethics of Listening
 Check your understanding: Use paraphrasing during discussion to verify your understanding of the
   speaker's message ("Did I understand you to mean..." or "Is it your contention that...").

 Limit distractions: Silence your phone and put away other electronic devices that might distract you
   during the presentation.

One of the challenges for speakers and audiences

today concerns the effective, ethical use of electronic

devices. Tablets and laptops facilitate note-taking and

interacting with supporting materials. However, these

same electronic devices--as well as smartphones--create

listening challenges too. A room full of laptops creates

obstacles to speaker-audience intimacy as listeners can

hide behind screens and type on keyboards. Likewise,

they create temptations, as do smartphones, to surf the

web and frequent social media sites.

Speakers and listeners must navigate the poten-

tial and problems of such electronics together. An

increasing number of speakers, for instance, work smart-

phones into their presentations through the use of QR     Chirp Audience by Scott Beale / Laughing Squid via Flickr, CC
codes, surveys, and quizzes. Chapter 28 explores the      BY-NC-ND.
advantages and challenges of similar kinds of audience-

interactive visual aids.

For our emphasis here, the ethics of using electronic devices during presentations is often situational, as box

6.5 suggests. When speaking in an educational setting such as a classroom, remember that you want others to listen to

your speech; you should extend equal respect by listening to other students' speeches. It is an ethical responsibility that

you listen rather than engage in superfluous use of electronic devices.

   Box 6.5 Electronic Devices and Listening: What Are the Ethics?

   Should you use a tablet or laptop while listening to a presentation? Is it ever OK to access your smart-
phone while listening to a speaker?

                                                                         The Ethics of Listening | 73

                   Be mindful that use of electronic devices, even use that we think is discreet (such as looking at a
       cell phone under a table), can often be seen by the speaker and can disrupt other audience members. Give
       speakers your attention and respect, and also ensure you can effectively retain and evaluate information.

Listening for Message Evaluation

A final component of ethical listening is message evaluation. Evaluative listening means thinking critically about a
                             speech's content and testing its claims in order to form judgments about its ideas. In this type of
                             listening, we practice critical thinking by evaluating the argument and evidence, we assess source
                             credibility, analyze reasoning patterns and consider logical fallacies, and begin to form our own
                             perspectives on the issues presented.
                                         You should recognize that the three core ethical listening qualities addressed in this chap-
                             ter correspond with elements of productive discourse discussed in chapter 3. That is, as a democ-
                             ratic participant, you should have an open mind in first considering a public concern (e.g., an

ethical listening attitude). Then you must listen to fully understand the issue and possible solutions (e.g., comprehend
and retain information). Finally, once you sufficiently understand the issue, you are ready to discuss it and reach a criti-
cal judgment (e.g., message evaluation).

     Summary

        This chapter explored the importance of ethical listening in making public deliberation possible. Listening

ethics includes maintaining an ethical listening attitude, comprehending and retaining information, and evalu-
ating the message. Specifically, in this chapter we have observed the following:

     Rhetorical ethics demands ethical listening. As audiences of public discourse, it is our dual responsibil-
        ity to respect the speaker and to openly, carefully, and critically consider their message.

     There are a variety of ways to ethically practice listening in a public communication setting, including
        active listening, appreciative listening, empathetic listening, listening to improve, listening to compre-
        hend and retain, and evaluative listening.

     There are a number of strategies we can employ as a listener to more ethically engage with speakers,
        including practices to enhance attention and retention and steps that lessen distractions and limit
        unproductive engagement with electronic devices.

 7. Standpoint Theory and Ethical Rhetoric

        Chapter Objectives

           Students will:
             Use standpoint theory to describe the impact of social identities on knowledge.
             Explain the mythical norm.
             Appraise how standpoint theory influences ethical speech preparation, speech performance, and lis-

                tening.

   The previous two chapters explored how choices concerning your speech preparation, speech performance, and lis-
   tening can help you practice ethical communication. This chapter introduces standpoint theory to further enrich that
   understanding.

               We will first explain standpoint theory and the related concept of positionality. We will then turn to the ideas of
   intersectionality and the mythical norm. We will end the chapter by using these theories and concepts to reflect again
   on the ethics of public speaking.

 Standpoint Theory

                                Standpoint theory emerged from feminist philosophy in the 1970s and 1980s to help explain how
                                we gain knowledge and form perspectives.1 The theory suggests that our standpoint--which is pro-
                                duced by our social identities--influences our knowledge of the world. As philosophy scholar Bri
                                ana Toole explains, "Knowledge is sensitive to features like your race, your sex, your gender, your
                                sexual orientation, your class, your religious affiliation, and so on."2 Our social identities impact
                                how we are perceived and interact with the world. In other words, our social identities play a role
                                in how we are treated, what we are (or are not) encouraged or expected to do, where we can (or
   cannot) easily go, and where and when we are invited to speak. Those experiences influence what we know.

1. Sandra Harding is credited with coining the term standpoint in Sandra Harding, Whose Science? Whose Knowledge?
   Thinking from Women's Lives (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991).

               For instance, a dark-skinned American Sikh man wearing a turban is more likely
   in the United States to be treated with suspicion (or even hate) and mistaken as Muslim
   than, say, an American white man wearing a baseball cap.3 Consequently, the Sikh man
   likely knows more about racism, islamophobia, and microaggressions in the United States
   than the white man, who is less likely to experience them.

             Box 7.1 Standpoint Theory and Positionalities
             Which of the following questions can you readily answer? Which questions have
          never occurred to you before?
                Which buildings on your campus are easily accessible for people with

                   physical disabilities?
                Which areas of campus are well lit at night and/or have safety call boxes?
                Where is the nearest gender-neutral bathroom located?
                Where are spaces available for religious practices?
                Who should you contact at your college for help paying for textbooks?

                       Your ability to answer likely depends on your physical ability, gender, religion (or lack thereof), and
          socioeconomic class. In other words, your knowledge (or ignorance) is influenced by your social identities.

  Positionalities

   Standpoint theory contends that we differ in our access to knowledge because our standpoints are differently posi-
   tioned. Notice here the word positioned. That relates to the concept of a positionality, or a person's location (or position)
   in relation to others in social categories of difference. Such social categories include ethnicity, gender, sexuality, physical
   ability, religion, citizenship, socioeconomic class, occupation, and so on. The American Sikh man and American white
   man, for example, have different positionalities regarding their ethnicity and religion. However, the men share the posi-
   tionalities of nationality and gender.

               A positionality, then, is largely the same as a social identity, but it recognizes that social identities typically carry
   and communicate cultural meanings through their distinctions from others within that category. In the social identity
   category of "physical ability," someone who is physically able-bodied carries cultural associations that are different from
   those carried by someone who is visibly physically disabled, which differ from a person who is invisibly physically dis-
   abled.

  Power

   Different cultural meanings matter because they typically translate into differing degrees of societal power. In other

   78 | Standpoint Theory and Ethical Rhetoric
words, a society will grant privileges to some positionalities within a social category. Physically able-bodied people,
for example, appear regularly in visual media and school curricula, can expect most spaces and transportation to be
designed for them, and are likely to be included in group activities. Cultures accord less privilege to others who differ
within a category. Invisibly physically disabled people, for instance, are frequently hassled for using aids or needing extra
help, since their need is not visibly obvious. Society oppresses and even denies others within a category. Visibly phys-
ically disabled people may have to research routes and spaces to ensure they can access them, are often mistaken as
being mentally challenged or talked to like children, and face job discrimination.

            To help articulate such differentiations, we can borrow from Toole the definitions of a dominantly situated
positionality as "a knower that does not occupy a position of social oppression" (or one that enjoys social privilege and
power) and a marginally situated positionality as "a knower that does occupy a position of oppression."4

            A notable irony is that cultural power is inversely related to knowledge.

                                                                                       practices because they and their peers experience them.
Knowledge Likely knows less about oppression because they don't likely experience it.

            It is also important to note that while the terms "dominantly situated" and "marginally situated" imply two sep-
arate categories, you might think of positionalities instead as existing along scales of difference--from more dominantly
situated to more marginally situated. For example, in terms of housing in the US, we might recognize homeowners as
more dominantly situated than people who rent an apartment or home--and even then, we might differentiate among
the types and neighborhoods of homes owned or rented. Shifting toward more marginally situated positionalities, we
can identify people who are in temporary shelters (due to emergencies or personal safety) as less marginally situated
than people who are homeless long-term.

            In addition, it is important to state again that how a positionality is situated is based on social or cultural asso-
ciations rather than anything inherent or true about the people who occupy it.

   Box 7.2 Power and Oppression, Not Necessarily Majority and Minority

   Labels for types of positionalities correspond with one's position in relation to social oppression (and
privilege). They do not necessarily equate to people in the majority or minority demographics of a popula-
tion. We'll provide two examples to explain.

   Dominantly Situated but Not the Majority

   A positionality is not dominantly situated because it is popular, common, or widespread. It is dominantly
situated because it yields social power and privilege. Thus, a minority population can have a positionality
that is dominantly situated. In South Africa between 1948 and 1994, for instance, the policy of apartheid gave
white Afrikaners political, economic, and social power, though they were numerically in the minority com-
pared to Black Africans.

   Marginally Situated but Not the Minority

4. Richardson, "Identity Matters" (emphasis added).

                                                                                       Standpoint Theory and Ethical Rhetoric | 79
             Similarly, a positionality is not marginally situated because it is uncommon or rare. Rather, it is marginally
          situated because it lacks societal power and suffers oppression. Thus, a majority population can have a posi-
          tionality that is marginally situated. For example, being the only able-bodied person in a room full of people
          with physical disabilities does not make the able-bodied person marginally situated. They may be the only
          such person in that context, but culturally their physical ability still carries greater authority and privilege
          than people with disabilities. Most spaces, for instance, are designed for able-bodied people, implying they
          are "normal" compared to people with physical disabilities who are expected to adapt.

               Of course, none of us consists of a single social identity or positionality, which is why we turn next to intersec-
   tionality.

 Intersectionality and the Mythical Norm

                                                          Intersectionality is a concept coined in 1989 by legal scholar Kimberl Cren
                                                       shaw.5 It suggests that our social identities consist of multiple features that com-
                                                       bine in meaningful ways to create intersecting forms of privilege and oppression.
                                                       Crenshaw uses the example of Black women to illustrate how they are more likely
                                                       to experience the intersection of both racism and sexism, unlike white women
                                                       (who encounter sexism) or Black men (who deal with racism).

                                                                   Each of us has developed a standpoint that consists of intersecting posi-
                                                       tionalities--some of which are more dominantly situated and some of which are
                                                       more marginally situated. You can use the "wheel of power/privilege" to begin
                                                       locating some of your positionalities and reflect on how they intersect and impact
                                                       your experiences and knowledge.

            You'll notice that "power" is located at the wheel's
center. The closer one's positionality approaches the cen-
ter, the more social power, privilege, and prestige it is
granted in the United States.

            Positionalities near the center of power are also
more likely to be associated with cultural norms. That is,
they produce and reflect a culture's standards or expec-
tations for desirable (or normative) behaviors, values, and
appearances. Having a driver's license, for example, is
expected and assumed as "normal" in the United States.
That association contributes to its social power and priv-

are more likely to discount or reject claims and evidence (by marginally situated positionalities) that social oppression
exists.

            Recall in chapter 4 that one reason social protest functions productively is because it can help people with
privilege and power acknowledge societal inequity. However, that chapter also explains that social protest as a form of
communication--often used by socially marginalized knowers--is typically critiqued as inappropriate, since it does not
meet societal norms for civil discourse.

Standpoint and Ethical Rhetoric

Now that we've established standpoint theory, positionality, intersectionality, and the mythical
norm, let's return briefly to the three ethical considerations considered in the previous two
chapters: speech preparation, speech performance, and listening.

            Speech preparation: Part of being responsible to your audience--and doing the hard but
often invisible work of speech preparation--is recognizing the opportunities and challenges
posed by your standpoint for the speaking situation. Imagine you are speaking as a person with
a marginally situated positionality about a topic to an audience with dominantly situated posi-
tionalities. Consider how sharing your experiences might offer the audience something impor-
tant and meaningful. Your standpoint can help them recognize an issue that may seem obvious to you but not to them.

            Of course, you must also anticipate that such an audience may resist your perspective and, accordingly, you
should be prepared to address counterarguments and cite outside sources as well. On the flip side, if your audience or
the speaking occasion seem odd or unfamiliar to you, perhaps because you and they occupy different social identities,
treat the audience with respect. Learn as much as you can about them and the occasion and adjust your speech prepa-
ration accordingly.

            Speech performance: Recall from chapter 5 that central to an ethical speech performance is using communica-
tion that, according to NCA's credo, "enhances human worth, human life, and dignity." Acknowledging your standpoint
should help you recognize your assumptions about what topics are worth talking about, who is worth talking to, and
how to address them. Becoming more cognizant and even critical of your assumptions may help you adopt the five eth-
ical behaviors discussed in that chapter: avoiding plagiarism, conducting ethical research, practicing ethical and sound
reasoning, using language carefully, and taking responsibility for the consequences of your rhetoric.

            For instance, recognize that not everyone will be similarly impacted by your language and ideas. Research
beyond your own standpoint to learn how people with marginally situated positionalities may be affected if your lan-
guage and ideas are adopted. For example, if you advocate for an organization to move its meetings to a distant location,
away from the "noise" of loud buses and "people on the street," your speech will fail to account for the needs or humanity
of people who rely on walking and public transportation.

            Listening: Similarly, consider how your standpoint plays a role in who you listen to and how. Which speakers do
you readily deem authoritative, and which might you be inclined to discount or dismiss? What kinds of people tend to
speak in the communities you are a member of, and who must fight to be heard? Why?

            If you become more aware of your standpoint, then you might choose to listen more attentively to people with
different positionalities. Furthermore, you might recognize limits to your knowledge due to your dominantly situated
positionalities and remain open to speakers who share different experiences.

     Summary

82 | Standpoint Theory and Ethical Rhetoric
   This chapter explored standpoint theory and its implications for ethical speaking. Specifically, in this chapter
we observed:

     Standpoint theory suggests that our positionalities influence what we believe to be true and normal.
     A positionality refers to a person's location (or position) in relation to others in social categories of dif-

        ference. Dominantly situated positionalities are those that occupy positions of privilege, while marginally
        situated positionalities occupy positions of oppression.
     Our social identities consist of multiple features that combine in meaningful ways to create intersect-
        ing forms of privilege and oppression.
     The mythical norm refers to the set of cultural expectations for what is normal and desirable. They are
        associated with dominantly situated positionalities. However, they are mythical because no one (or very
        few people) only consists of dominantly situated positionalities, and everyone is, in fact, unique.
     Knowing standpoint theory can help us reflect critically on our assumptions and think more deeply
        about the practices associated with ethical speech preparation, speech performance, and listening.

8. Preparing to Conduct Credible Research

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Adopt a research mindset that approaches research as inquiry, values diverse perspectives, clarifies the

             scope and needs of research, and slows down to determine best steps.
          Distinguish differences among sources according to their timeliness, accessibility, and mutability.
          Differentiate sources from compilers and recognize artificial intelligence as a type of compiling tool.
          Assess the value of sources according to their bias, accuracy, authority, recency, and relevance.

Imagine you want to develop a speech about excessive waste. Perhaps you worry about the environmental impacts of
landfills, and you feel frustrated when your friends use new plastic water bottles every day. But you don't know enough
to speak for more than a minute or two, and you don't have any special experiences that could offer unique insights. So
why should an audience listen to you or accept your opinions?

            This situation calls for research, the process of learning about a topic by discovering what credible sources
have said, written, or recorded about it. The best speakers use research to improve their understanding of an issue,
determine or narrow their focus, and support their claims. Strong research sets apart powerfully compelling speeches
from merely interesting or entertaining ones.

            Good research also improves civic engagement
and aids productive discourse. At a minimum, it enables
you to speak accurately; you avoid basing presentations
on unproven assumptions or misinformation. At most,
research helps you better understand complex topics by
discovering multiple perspectives. Consequently, you can
help your community more fully comprehend the intri-
cacy of the issues facing it. Finally, good research focuses
your attention on ideas rather than on the people advo-
cating them. Such a focus gives you an appropriate way to
critically examine alternative positions. For all these rea-
sons, this textbook assumes effective civic engagement

from, and cite strong sources.

            To help you conduct credible and effective research, this chapter will teach you how to differentiate and eval-
uate sources. We will begin by considering the type of mindset--or habits of mind--you should adopt to make your
research more effective and enjoyable.

                                                                                                                            Preparing to Conduct Credible Research | 85
Research as a Mindset

To some of us, research means quickly finding internet "hits" to fill a required bibliography or finding evidence to back
your position. Neither act really involves research, however. Recall we defined research as the process of learning about
a topic by discovering what credible sources have said, written, or recorded about it. That means research initially
requires adopting a particular mindset: one that values inquiry and diverse perspectives, clarifies the type and scope
of research needed, and slows down to thoughtfully discover appropriate sources. We will briefly explain each of these
habits of a research mindset.

Approach Research as Inquiry Versus Strategy

Research means educating yourself. To do that, you should approach research as inquiry: the process of studying a
topic with the desire to learn. This contrasts with approaching research as strategy: the process of studying the topic
only to find sources and evidence that support your preferred solution.

Research as Inquiry                                     Research as Strategy

                                                        Self-focused: Helps you promote your preferred option without
                                                        fully educating yourself on alternatives first

   Box 8.1 A Librarian's Perspective on Research

   Instruction librarian Lane Wilkinson distinguishes researching as strategy by referring to it simply as
searching. In their words, "It's a simple distinction: when you know the answer, or know that an answer
exists, you search. When you don't know the answer, or aren't even sure about the question, you research."

86 | Preparing to Conduct Credible Research
          Wilkinson goes on to distinguish research as inquiry as "involv[ing] uncertainty, persistence, iteration, and a
          willingness to accept that what you discover may not fit in neatly with what you believe."1

              When researching, then, your mindset should be to remain open to finding the best outcomes for your com-
  munity, not simply searching for information that supports your predetermined conclusion.

 Value Diverse Perspectives

                                 When you approach research as inquiry, you should encounter perspectives that differ from your
                                 experience and knowledge. As we learned in chapter 7, our standpoint influences what we know
                                 and find authoritative. Recall that standpoint theory suggests that our social identities influence
                                 our knowledge of the world and our perceptions of what is true or normal. Thus, we're likely to
                                 dismiss or discount perspectives that emerge from differing standpoints as foreign or even untrue.

                                             A research mindset encourages us, instead, to be self-reflexive of our standpoint and to
                                 value experiences and knowledge that differ from our own and from each other. Indeed, among
  research's benefits is learning how diverse people, groups, and organizations define, experience, and talk about the issue
  and possible ways to address it.

 Clarify Research Scope and Needs

     Another habit of a research mindset is to clarify your
  research needs and scope. First, how broadly or narrowly
  should you focus your research? Think of yourself some-
  what like Goldilocks, who, in the fairy tale, entered the
  Three Bears' house and tested their chairs, beds, and
  bowls of porridge to find the ones that were not too hard/
  hot or too soft/cold but were "just right" for her needs.
  Similarly, your goal is to determine the scope of your
  research that is "just right" for your needs: not too broad
  or too narrow. Review your assignment instructions or
  talk with your instructor for guidance.

                                                                                                 Image by Wannapik Studio, CC BY-NC.

          Box 8.2 Researching Too Broadly or Too Narrowly
          Imagine your speech topic regards mental health, and you need to conduct research to learn more.

                   Researching too broadly: Researching "mental health" will result in an overwhelming number of
       sources that may not directly relate to each other.

                   Researching too narrowly: Alternatively, beware of overly narrowing your focus, which may result in
       few or no useful sources. An example of an overly narrowed topic is "depression in eighth grade boys who
       live in Iowa."

                   "Just right": What research topics qualify as "just right" in breadth will vary based on your audience
       and speaking situation. For a classroom speech, though, you might consider researching about particular
       types of mental health challenges (e.g., depression, PTSD, gender dysphoria), specific kinds of people
       affected (e.g., men, elderly, people of color), or particular regions impacted (your state, rural towns, college
       campuses).

            Second, what type of evidence and sources do you need? Too often, we make assumptions about what sources
compose "research": scientific data, legal rulings, news articles? Instead of making assumptions, clarify exactly what
types of information you need. Consider your speaking goal and the type of speech you are delivering (deliberative, per-
suasive, etc.) as well as your audience. As we will discover in chapter 11, effective speakers adapt their speeches to their
audiences. That includes considering the kinds of sources and information your audience deems credible and com-
pelling. In some cases, it may be preferable and more helpful, for instance, to cite a press release that describes the
conclusions of a scientific experiment rather than citing the scholarly article itself.

Slow Down

It is tempting to immediately jump online and search Google or ChatGPT for your topic. The quickness of the results
feels satisfying. But are the results likely to meet your needs?

                                               After considering your research needs and scope, take a moment to thoughtfully
                                   identify the best way to locate the types of information you need. If you decide you need a
                                   press release, then look for news articles by using a database such as Nexis Uni or searching
                                   specifically on Google News. If, instead, you need a scientific article, then search a database
                                   like PubMed that features such scholarship or use Google Scholar.

                                               Slowing down also means not necessarily accepting the first relevant source you find.
                                   We will talk about evaluating sources in "Criteria to Consider When Finding Sources: BAARR."
                                   For now, we recommend you read laterally, meaning that you find and review several sources
about the same topic. Such exposure will help you decide if you have narrowed your topic appropriately, if you are find-
ing the types of evidence and information you need, and if the information you are finding is widely shared or is subject
to debate or disagreement.

88 | Preparing to Conduct Credible Research
          Box 8.3 Adopting a Research Mindset
          If you want to conduct research about reducing waste, adopting a research mindset could mean that you
       do the following:

             Research as inquiry: Don't assume your college community doesn't care enough about the environment
          or waste management, and don't assume recycling is the best answer. Instead, explore exactly what can
          get recycled in your area and how the global economy might impact that. Discover how waste reduction
          might impact the problem and if and why your community isn't already reducing its waste.

             Value diverse perspectives: Consider not only what other students experience and think or even just
          what administrators say. Find and learn from custodial workers at your college, any clubs or organizations
          devoted to environmental concerns, waste management in your city or town, and studies about which
          items actually get recycled.

             Clarify research scope and needs: For the scope, do you want to address waste only on your college
          campus or also in your city or town? Do the two affect one another? Should you consider how state regu-
          lations might impact how waste is handled? Might you expand your research to other countries for alter-
          native models of waste management, reduction, or recycling?

                   As for your research needs, do you require state or national data about how much waste is cur-
       rently produced? Might offices or people at your university help you attain more local information and per-
       spectives? Would examples or models from other colleges or states prove more useful? Might a survey or
       public opinion poll help you understand consumer behaviors?

             Slow down: Where should you look first? Might local newspaper archives be helpful, or perhaps con-
          ducting interviews may be most effective? Will you find the type of research you need, instead, in national
          news articles or scholarly studies? Perhaps you can look at collegiate press releases or even reviews of
          campus dining companies to learn about innovative ways to reduce, reuse, or recycle waste.

Differences Across Sources

With so many sources available online, it can be difficult to differentiate one from another. To the untrained eye, sources
can all look similar: words on your screen, possibly with images or even videos. Such similarity can prevent you from rec-
ognizing important differences across sources that can help you decide which sources best suit your research needs. In
this section, we highlight how sources use different processes in creating and publishing information and how sources
differ from compilers.

Differences in the Information Creation and Publication Process

If you were shown digital copies of a newspaper article, a book chapter, and a blog, could you quickly tell they are very
different types of sources? Do you know why? Clues can be found in their timeliness, accessibility, and mutability.

                                                                                                                            Preparing to Conduct Credible Research | 89
Timeliness

                                                              to report what is "new"), but they typically take a little

and record them, and then edit and post the resulting video.
            Shifting toward the even slower end of the spec-

trum, we find scholarship. Scholarly books and articles
are produced by professional academics or researchers.
While the pace can vary, most scholarship takes consid-
erable time to publish. The lengthy process includes time
to prepare, write, and submit a manuscript to a journal or
university press; undergo review by other people in the
same scholarly field; revise based on their feedback; pos-
sibly go through a second round of review and revision;
and finally be formatted for publication. The process can
take anywhere from several months to a year to complete
before being published.

Accessibility

Timeliness corresponds with a source's accessibility. In this context, accessibility refers to whether and how easily the
author can directly publish their work. As mentioned, faster sources tend to give the author more direct access to pub-
lishing. If you had the funding, for instance, you could create a website today and publish nearly whatever you want.
Slower sources tend to have more gatekeeping, which is when people or groups other than the author have the power to
decide what gets published and how. As we explained, professional journalists and scholars need to obtain several other
people's approval before their work can be seen by a wider audience.

   Box 8.4 Research Trade-Offs Related to Timeliness and Accessibility

   A source's timeliness and accessibility do not determine its worth, but they do convey research trade-offs
you should consider:

      Faster, More Directly Accessible Sources (e.g., Social      Slower, More Heavily Gatekept Sources (e.g.,
  Media Posts)                                                 Scholarly Books)

  time

- Typically lack depth and may include inaccurate information

Mutability

   Finally, sources vary in their mutability, or likelihood of
changing. They may all appear immutable (stable), but
what you read on your screen today may not be the same
when you access that source in a month or year.

            It depends on the type of source. Some sources,
such as online news articles and organizations' websites,
are likely to change over time. Even websites maintained
by authoritative sources like the United States govern-
ment tend to alter as their information is updated. The
URL remains the same, but the information or even titles
will change. As another example, social media posts can
alter, since the original author can edit or even delete the
post. In contrast, other sources are reliably static; that is,
they don't change over time. Once a scholarly article or
book is published, that's it. It will be the same every time Image by CyberRabbit via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.
you return to it.

            The likelihood of a source changing impacts not only how you cite it (which we discuss in chapter 9) but also
how difficult or easy it is to find again. If you use a source that is likely to change or even disappear, we recommend you
"freeze" it by saving a copy or a screenshot with the date you saved it. If you want to return to a particular digital source,
you might also save it by creating a Perma Link through Perma.cc if your college library has a subscription you can use.
Alternatively, you can save the source to Internet Archive's WayBack Machine at https://archive.org/web/. That service
can also come in handy if you failed to save a source and are desperate to find it again!

          Box 8.5 Differences Across Sources

                                                                                                                             Preparing to Conduct Credible Research | 91
          Online sources may appear similar, but they differ in important ways based on the following:
             Timeliness: how slowly or quickly they are created and published.
             Accessibility: how directly or indirectly an author can publish their work.
             Mutability: whether the content is dynamic or static over time.

Sources Versus Compilers

Though we have used the term, we have not yet defined what we mean by a source. That term matters, because you need
to differentiate between a source and a compiler. For our interests, a source is an original communication product that
has been written by one or more human authors and published for an audience. A book, a news article, and a speech are
all sources. A compiler is a service that gathers information from multiple sources and makes it available. Two types of
compilers that students often confuse with sources are research databases and artificial intelligence (AI).

Research Databases

   A research database is an organized online storehouse
of information that can easily be searched to retrieve
desired sources. Numerous research databases exist with
collections ranging from scholarly articles and ebooks to
news media broadcast transcripts and legal documents.

            Most of the popular research databases are actu-
ally databases of databases. That is, they include multiple
collections of sources. Popular examples include JSTOR,
ProQuest, and Academic Search Complete. College
libraries typically subscribe to several databases, allowing
students to access them for free as long as they enter
through the library's website. Check your college library's
home page or talk with a reference librarian at your uni-
versity about available databases and how to access them. Image by Jan Antonin Kolar via Unsplash, Unsplash License.
Often, if you go through your college's library home page,
you can access for free the research databases the library subscribes to. If, instead, you go directly to a database's web-
site, you will likely run into a paywall.

            A research database is a compiler, not a source, because it is a service that pulls together and presents existing
sources based on your search terms. Consequently, it can make researching for some sources easier and quicker. How-
ever, it is not a source.

92 | Preparing to Conduct Credible Research
  Artificial Intelligence (AI)

      Many types of AI exist, but at its core, AI draws on,
   retrieves, and compiles scores of sources to produce con-
   tent. The content is prompted by a user's questions (while
   using an AI chatbot) or search terms (while using a search
   engine like Google). The output--such as the paragraphs
   an AI chatbot writes in response to your request or the
   images an AI text-to-image generator might pro-
   duce--can make AI appear like a source. However, AI is
   not a source as we have defined it. It is not human, and it does not (yet) produce original communication as we--your
   authors--think of originality.

               Instead, machine-learning AI uses algorithms that very quickly analyze existing data from myriad sources to
   find patterns--which is the compiling function--and then predict a useful or appropriate response. AI may assemble the
   predicted content in novel or unique ways, but it is based on the sources and data that AI draws on.

             PCMag's K. Thor Jensen explained the shortcomings of generative AI: "Computers aren't capable of what
          we would consider original thought--they just recombine existing data in a variety of ways. That output
          might be novel and interesting, but it isn't unique."2

               AI's function as a robust compiler rather than a source helps explain why it tends to unreflectively repeat the
   dominant racist, sexist, and homophobic biases and stereotypes commonly found in existing sources3--and why you are
   more likely to encounter factual errors when using generative AI. According to PCMag's K. Thor Jensen, the datasets AI
   trains on become outdated and reflect societal biases.4

               Jensen also points to two additional factors for AI's errors: the complexity of AI's coding, which prevents our
   ability to trace the source of an inaccurate response to correct it, and AI's requirement to produce a response to your
   query even if it does not have the answer.5

             "A generative AI model cannot tell you whether something is factual; it can pull data only from what it's

           been fed. So if that data says that the sky is green, the AI will give you back stories that take place under a
           lime-colored sky. When ChatGPT prepares output for you, it doesn't fact-check or second-guess itself. And
           while you can correct it during your session, those corrections aren't fed back to the algorithm. This soft-
           ware is comfortable lying and making things up because it has no way not to, and that makes relying on it
           for research especially risky."6

               Further, people can use AI to deliberately produce false videos or recordings of famous people, for instance,
   doing or saying things that never occurred. While many of these fakes are produced in good fun (like hearing Adele's
   version of a Beatles' song), the technology can easily be used more maliciously to trick audiences into believing false-
   hoods.

               Therefore, we warn you to not rely on AI for your research. Not only is it a compiler rather than a source, but
   it also risks being inaccurate or used purposefully to deceive--a point we made in chapter 5 and explore more fully in
   chapter 9.

               Having said that, AI can help you get started on a speech by functioning as a feedback tool. As we suggested
   in chapter 5, you might use AI to brainstorm arguments and counterpoints. It can also help you restate complex ideas
   more clearly and produce effective visual aids. If you want to use AI in any of these ways,

    1. consult your instructor and/or librarian to discuss if and how you can use AI,
    2. consider the ethical implications involved in doing so (chapter 5),
    3. explicitly acknowledge your use of AI by citing which tool you used and how (chapter 9),
    4. double-check any sources AI cites to ensure they actually exist and provide useful information, and
    5. find additional sources and develop and synthesize the ideas you gain on your own.

 Criteria to Consider When Finding Sources: BAARR

   In addition to adopting a research mindset and distinguishing differences among sources, we urge you to recognize that
   not all sources are equally credible. Some sources may be easy to find but are outdated and provide inaccurate infor-
   mation, for instance. If you adopt such sources, you set a very low bar for references and evidence, which will reflect
   poorly on your credibility and weaken your advocacy.

               Instead, we invite you to keep in mind five criteria when you find sources. You will notice they form the acronym
   BAARR to remind you to set the bar high when finding sources. They include the following:

      Bias
   Accuracy
   Authority
   Recency
   Relevance to your topic

      Avoid thinking of these as a checklist; rather, use the criteria to answer questions about each source so you can make
   thoughtful decisions.

6. Jensen, "Yes, Machines Make Mistakes."

   94 | Preparing to Conduct Credible Research
 Bias

  Bias is a predetermined commitment to a particular ideological or political perspective. A biased
  source is one that openly professes such a commitment or is commonly recognized as doing so.
  Biased sources can include those that see the world through a predetermined set of presump-
  tions, beliefs, and/or philosophies.

             Box 8.6 Biased Sources
             Biased sources include the following:
                politically aligned sources (e.g., the liberal magazine Mother Jones and the conservative magazine

                  National Review)
                some nonpartisan organizations (e.g., People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals [PETA] and the

                  Food Research and Action Center)

               Biased sources are likely to produce information and perspectives that reflect or even reinforce their prefer-
  ences. To return to a speech on excessive waste again, if you interviewed the board chair of Keep America Beautiful,
  they would certainly provide information on why recycling is important and should be improved.

               The point of this is not that you should never make use of biased sources. Indeed, most sources include some
  kind of bias. Fortunately, many biased sources can be considered authoritative, relevant, and recent. Rather, you should
  utilize biased sources knowingly and incorporate them into a broad range of sources, including those that are not inher-
  ently biased or are more balanced. When you use a biased source in your presentation, acknowledge it as such. This
  shows the audience you are an honest speaker because you make your sources fully known rather than deceptively use
  biased sources to manipulate your listeners.

               Two of the most helpful ways to identify whether and how much a news source is politically biased are through
  Ad Fontes' online Media Bias Chart and the AllSides Media Bias Chart.7 Both reveal that biased sources vary in their
  degree of bias. The Ad Fontes' chart also accounts for sources' degrees of reliability or accuracy. We turn to this impor-
  tant consideration next.

 Accuracy

  Whatever your immediate speaking goal, your ultimate achievement is to aid your community in
  thinking through issues and making sound decisions. Fulfilling that objective requires accurate
  information. Accuracy refers to the truthfulness or veracity of the information provided by a
  source. Unfortunately, misinformation and disinformation abound. As defined in chapter 2, mis-
  information is the unintentional spread of inaccurate or false claims that lack sufficient or valid

evidence and/or identifiable and credible sources (i.e., an innocent mistake or gaffe). Disinformation, in contrast, refers
to a deliberate attempt to spread wrong information to mislead listeners.

   Box 8.7 Examples of Disinformation                Disinformation vs Misinformation by Srijankedia/Eman235 via
                                                     Wikimedia Commons, CC BY.
   Disinformation can be spread by a range of peo-
ple, groups, and organizations--including some that
may surprise you or do not appear to deliberately
supply disinformation. The following are examples:

 Some government actors distribute disinformation for propagandistic purposes. We can find exam-
   ples historically in the lies US high-ranking government officials knowingly made about the Vietnam
   War (famously revealed in the Pentagon Papers) or in Russian President Vladimir Putin's falsehoods to
   his own people about its war on Ukraine.

 Interest groups have been created online to promote disinformation and political polarization
   around topics such as climate change. They can have convincing-sounding names like the Climate
   Intelligence Foundation, and their online presence can appear authoritative, but their bias against
   environmentalism corresponds (in this case) with strategically promoting disinformation.

            Obviously, you must be wary of both misinformation and disinformation so you do not mislead your listeners.
Saying that can be easier said than done, since sources that meet other criteria--that is, they are authoritative, recent,
and relevant--can present disinformation.

            Your best bet, then, is to read laterally and do some background reading. As we established earlier, reading
laterally means finding and reviewing several sources about the same topic, and background reading involves going to
reference sources that reflect information and facts that are consensually agreed to by a wide variety of parties. These
strategies will help you decide if the information you are finding is widely shared or is subject to debate or disagree-
ment. If a source you have found directly contradicts what you are finding elsewhere (for instance, that climate change
is occurring), that can be a clue that the source may be promoting misinformation or disinformation and should be fur-
ther investigated.

Authority

           Authority relates to the expertise, power, or recognized knowledge a source has concerning a topic.
           We might distinguish among various types of authority a source may exercise: subject, societal, and
           special experiences.

                Subject Authority

Subject authorities are sources with trained expertise on the topic. A scholar with a PhD in waste management studies
would be a subject authority on that topic. Somewhat similarly, the Environmental Protection Agency would also be

96 | Preparing to Conduct Credible Research
   an authoritative source about environmental effects of landfills, because the agency's entire work--that is, their subject
   expertise--focuses solely on environmental concerns. Sources that have also been reviewed by subject experts--such as
   scholarly publications--carry even more authoritative weight.

  Societal Authority

   Societal authority emphasizes a source's power to control outcomes based on their position within a society or orga-
   nization. Your mayor would be considered an authoritative source, for instance, about your city's waste management
   challenges. Similarly, Harvard University's Office for Sustainability wields societal authority over that university's reduc-
   tion, recycling, and disposal of waste.

  Authority from Special Experiences

   Authority can also be accrued through special experiences. For instance, a person who grew up in a neighborhood near a
   hazardous waste site could speak with some authority on that experience. Perhaps they attended town meetings about
   the site, experienced ill health effects, or could share the site's effects on their quality of life.

               Recall that sometimes special experiences are due to one's positionalities. In chapter 7, we
   discussed how, according to standpoint theory, a person with a marginally situated positionality is
   likely to know more about a relevant system of power because they are more likely to encounter
   and navigate it. Hazardous waste sites are more often located near neighborhoods of low-income
   families and people of color.8 The special experiences of such a person who grew up near a haz-
   ardous waste site might also be able to shed light on how such issues as racism and classism con-
   tribute to inequity.

               It is important for you to assess the type and degree of a source's authority--both for yourself and on behalf of
   your audience as part of your obligation to ethical speech preparation, discussed in chapter 5. Such assessment helps
   you determine how much you and your audience can trust a source to understand the topic. It also prevents you from
   dismissing sources that can offer useful information but may not be authorities on the subject. Reference librarians are
   great resources and can answer questions you may have about finding authoritative material. Don't be afraid to approach
   one of them at your university or college library to ask for help.

  Recency

   The recency of your sources is also important. Recency refers to how up to date the information is that a source pro-
   vides. If the source and its information are outdated, then it is not terribly useful to you or your audience. Imagine if you
   began a speech about waste by sharing data from ten years earlier. "What about now?" your audience would immedi-
   ately wonder.

                                        Instead, when addressing community concerns and issues, seek sources published recently.
                            Even persistent community issues can change at any moment. If your town's mayor announces a
                            new waste reduction plan the week before your speech, you would need to incorporate that
                            announcement and revise your speech accordingly. Otherwise, your audience will likely dismiss
                            your speech as obsolete.

                                        Of course, not every topic requires the use of recent sources, however. For example, his-
torical facts seldom change and thus can be supported by older sources. Landmark works that have received acclaim
might maintain a timeless character. On the other hand, our understanding of history can alter with new archival
research, the release of private papers, and new interpretations of historical documents. Thus, a more recent treatment
of a traditional topic may, depending on its credibility, prove to be a superior source.

Relevance

Not every source that mentions your topic is as relevant as another. Relevance refers to the
degree of association between the source, a speaker's topic, and their audience. Highly relevant
sources offer information that directly addresses your particular focus on your topic and res-
onates with your specific audience. No matter how interesting the information or ideas pre-
sented by a source, it won't help your speech if it doesn't relate directly to your topic or your
audience.

          Box 8.8 Relevant Sources for a Speech About Excessive Waste
          If you wanted to motivate your college community to reduce waste, you would desire sources relevant to
       your audience and particular angle.
             You might find articles in your college newspaper to be more compelling, for instance, than national

                news articles.
             You might turn to a source such as The College Sustainability Report Card, an annual survey con-

                ducted by the Sustainable Endowments Institute that grades each college and university's efforts at
                sustainable living. What if you discovered that your college's chief rival consistently scored a much
                higher grade than your own campus? That might get your audience's attention and perhaps bring out
                its competitive spirit!

                   The point is that with each speech, you must consider which sources work for your particular topic
       and audience.

            Together, the criteria discussed--bias, accuracy, authority, recency, and relevance--can help you decide which
sources to use to develop your speech and which to dismiss. Opt for sources that best meet your needs, using the cri-
teria as guidelines. When in doubt, you can also always ask a reference librarian for help.

     Box 8.9 Criteria to Evaluate Sources: Setting a High BAARR
     When determining the value and veracity of a source, consider the following criteria. Think of each as a
  spectrum rather than a box to be checked.
     Bias: A predetermined commitment to a particular ideological or political perspective.
        Who are the publishers, sponsors, and/or authors of the source? Who paid for the source's cre-

           ation? What can you learn about them?
        How is the source described, such as in an "About" section or mission statement?
        How do other sources describe this source, and where does it fall in the Ad Fontes Media Bias chart

           or on the AllSides Media Bias chart?
        What evidence of bias, if any, is present in the material itself?
     Accuracy: The truthfulness or veracity of the information provided by a source.
        Has the material been reviewed or vetted by an editor or reviewers?
        Does the material line up with information and facts provided by other sources about the same

           topic? Do a wide variety of parties agree on the same facts?
        Can you find reviews or responses to the material?
     Authority: The expertise, power, or recognized knowledge a source has concerning a topic.
        Who is the author, and what type of (relevant) authority do they have, if any?

                Are they an expert on the subject matter? Do they have a title or degree that demonstrates
                   their expertise?

                Does their position in society or an organization lend them authority on the subject?
                Have they had relevant special experiences that authorize the information they provide?
     Recency: How up to date the information is that a source provides.
        What is the publication date or the date the material was last updated?
        Have more recent sources appeared that alter or revise the information the source provides?
        Are you using the source to establish a historical fact or to offer a more recent interpretation of a
           historical occurrence?
     Relevance: The degree of association between the source, a speaker's topic, and their audience.
        Does the source directly address your particular focus on the topic?
        How well will this source resonate with your specific audience?

Summary

                                                                                                                       Preparing to Conduct Credible Research | 99
        This chapter has introduced you to the mindset, considerations, and evaluative criteria needed to prepare to
     conduct credible research. Good research produces more effective speeches and aids productive discourse.

          We recommend you adopt a research mindset that approaches research as inquiry, values diverse per-
             spectives, clarifies the scope and needs of research, and slows down to determine best steps. If you
             approach research in this way, you will more likely enjoy the purpose of research: to learn about a topic
             by discovering what credible sources have said, written, or recorded about it.

          Distinguishing differences among sources can help you decide which sources best suit your research
             needs. In particular, it is important to appreciate the different processes sources use in creating and pub-
             lishing information as well as how sources differ from compilers.

          Artificial intelligence is a robust compiler rather than a source. While it may help stimulate speech
             ideas, it does not qualify as a source and therefore should not be used as such or to find sources.

          Assess the value of sources by asking questions about their potential bias, accuracy, authority on your
             topic, recency, and relevance to your topic. Use these criteria to set a high BAARR for your research.

9. Finding and Documenting Research Sources

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Strategically find research sources using Google and college library resources.
          Conduct an interview effectively.
          Accurately document sources through written and spoken citations.
In the previous chapter, you learned how to prepare to conduct credible research. That chapter talked about adopting a
research mindset, recognizing differences across sources, and evaluating the value of sources. Keep those skills in mind
as you read this chapter, which will help you shift from preparing to finding and documenting research sources.

            Because most students use Google to find sources, this chapter will provide tips to make your efforts more
fruitful. We will follow that with the encouragement to also explore the resources available through your college or local
library. Then the chapter will explore interviews as a means of creating sources. We will give you tools to contact some-
one to interview, prepare for the interview, and conduct the interview. Finally, the chapter will end by explaining the
importance of documenting your sources and providing guidance for how to do so for a variety of sources. But first we'll
begin with a note about using artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to find research sources.

102 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
Using Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to Find Research Sources

   As AI becomes more popular and powerful, students
increasingly turn to chatbots for their research. We clari-
fied in the previous chapter that AI is itself not a source
but is more of a robust compiler of sources. We defined a
compiler as a service that gathers information from mul-
tiple sources and makes it available.

            As you probably already know, among the infor-
mation that an AI chatbot can compile are research
sources. If you ask ChatGPT for "a list of specific sources
about excessive waste management," for example, it will
provide five or so. The ease and efficiency of this service
is terrific, but be careful! AI chatbots can "hallucinate," or
make up, sources that do not exist.

   "In addition to potentially providing false infor-  Image by Ungeorgiy via Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.

mation, ChatGPT can produce legitimate looking
reference citations for materials that don't exist."1

Box 9.1 AI Hallucinates Research Sources

When we asked for specific sources about excessive waste, most of what ChatGPT provided did not exist.

  It named The Waste Land: A History of Waste Management by Elizabeth A. M. McKenzie, published by
     Routledge in 2019, but that full title does not appear on Routledge's site, Amazon, or Google Scholar.

  Similarly, ChatGPT listed a scholarly article by John Smith titled "Excessive Waste: A Global Per-
     spective" and published in 2021 in the Journal of Environmental Studies, volume 34, issue 2. This jour
     nal does exist, but its volume 34 was published in 2024 (not 2021), that volume only consists of issue
     number 1 (so there is no issue 2), and John Smith does not appear in the journal's list of authors pub-
     lished.

Others have run into similar problems with AI chatbots hallucinating research sources.2

            AI chatbots will get smarter with time and therefore should offer more accurate references and hallucinate less.
Nonetheless, if you choose to use an AI chatbot to find research sources, it will always be your responsibility to (1) make
sure the sources provided actually exist and (2) find the sources and read them. Recall from the previous chapter that
research is the process of learning about a topic by discovering what credible sources have said, written, or recorded
about it. Finding and documenting sources are means toward the end of that learning, not ends in themselves.

Finding Research Sources with Google

In addition to AI chatbots, you probably also turn to Google to conduct research. Tech companies such as Google
have incorporated AI into their products, including their search engines, making a distinction between Google and AI
somewhat futile. For our purposes, however, when we refer to Google, we mean the more traditional search engine as
opposed to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini.

            Fortunately, search engines like Google can often meet your research needs, especially for an introductory-
level class.3 To help you, we will briefly discuss domain labels, open access resources, specialized search engines, and
advanced searches.

Domain Labels

When deciding which Google search results to use, consider domain labels. The top-level domain name appears after
the dot of a web address. Use the domain name to decide which search results are more likely to be of high quality, such
as the following:

.edu US postsecondary educational institution  willamette.edu, usc.edu

.gov US government entity                      whitehouse.gov, senate.gov

.mil US military organization                  army.mil, health.mil

.org Noncommercial organization, such as a charity or nonprofit organization habitat.org, redcross.org

Information from any of these domain labels is less likely to be used to sell you a service or product. In contrast, the .com
domain name refers to a business with explicitly commercial motivations, such as exxonmobil.com or walmart.com.

            Of course, websites with the domain labels listed here may still offer biased information. As we discussed in the

2. "Don't Get Ghosted."; Robin Emsley, "ChatGPT: These Are Not Hallucinations--They Are Fabrications and Falsifications,"
   Schizophrenia 9, no. 52 (2023), https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-023-00379-4.

3. Maureen Richards, "Is `Just Googling It' Good Enough for First-Year Students?," College & Undergraduate Libraries 28,
   no. 1 (2021): 85-104, https://doi.org/10.1080/10691316.2021.1894295.

   104 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
   previous chapter, bias does not mean you should not use the source, but it does mean you should be aware of the bias
   and honest with your audience when citing the source.

               For domain labels, also notice that the examples are for US websites. Other countries issue domain names
   as well, and when they do, they include a country code at the end of the website address. For instance, all website
   addresses that end with .uk, such as parliament.uk, refer to domain names issued by the United Kingdom. So that is
   worth keeping in mind as you process the information provided.

 Open Access Resources

      Another savvy way to find higher-quality research on Google is to look for open
   access (OA) materials in your search results. According to Anita Walz, "Open
   access items are always free to read. Unless printed, they are always online, and
   never require passwords, log-in credentials, payments, or access restrictions to
   read."4 They typically do not include advertisements either. OA materials most
   frequently appear as scholarly books and articles, typically making them more
   credible, thoughtful, and in-depth than other types of digital resources.

                                                                                                                                       Open Access by Rafabollas via Wikimedia
                                                                                                                                       Commons, CC BY.
             Box 9.2 Finding Open Access Research Sources
             There is no single "OA" website to search. Instead, there are many online repositories of OA materials.
                If you want to find books, you might begin by using the Directory of Open Access Books or the
                   Online Library of Open Access Books.
                If you want to find journals or articles, you might start with the Directory of Open Access Journals.

 Specialized Searches

   In addition to considering domain labels and finding open access resources, you can also take advantage of the special-
   ized search options that search engines like Google offer. These options only show websites that fit the specific category
   chosen. For instance, Google currently offers search engines devoted to news, scholarship (Google Scholar), patents,
   finances, trends, books, and images. Once you have chosen your specialized search engine (say, Google Scholar), type in
   your search terms knowing you will only retrieve sources directly relevant to the type of specialized search you selected.

Advanced Searches

                                   A final way you can smartly use Google is by using its Advanced Search options. The exact loca-
                                   tion of the Advanced Search page changes, but it is typically part of Settings, or you can search
                                   on Google for "Advanced Search" or go directly to google.com/advanced_search. Once there,
                                   you will find a wide range of options, including

                                searching for sources with precise phrases or ranges of numbers,
                                ensuring particular words are not included in the findings,
                                narrowing sources to those updated within a given time period (past twenty-four hours, past
      week, etc.),
   searching only specific types of domain labels or sites, and
   many more.

            While all the advanced options can be incredibly useful, we draw your attention to conducting a site- or
domain-specific search. This type of search limits your research results to matches found only on one particular website
or domain label. A site-specific search--like all the Advanced Search tools--is a helpful way to both harness the power of
a search engine like Google and focus your search.

          Box 9.3 Using a Site-Specific (Advanced) Search
          Let's say you want recent information about landfills, but only data published on the Environmental Pro-
       tection Agency (EPA) web pages. In that case, you would simply

             go to google.com/advanced_search
             on the Advanced Search page, type your search term: "landfill"; and
             then find the prompt for "site or domain" and type "epa.gov."

                   Every result listed will include epa.gov in its web address. Alternatively, you can search only for a
       particular domain label, such as .org websites.

Limitations with Using Google

Be aware of Google's limitations as a place to search for sources: The results range in quality, paywalls can stop you from
accessing materials, and you might mistake the results from an incorporated AI chatbot for search engine results.

            First, the quality of Google's findings can range dramatically, and the order in which
findings are listed does not correspond to their quality. Don't assume the best research mate-
rials will appear at the top or that the best resources can necessarily be found through
Google. Even using the tips provided, you are more assured of high quality if you search
through your library's website.

            Second, despite the proliferation of OA materials, you can quickly run into paywalls
that prevent you from accessing the sources you need unless you pay. Your university library
website, in contrast, likely provides full free access if you are a student, or you can often

106 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
request free materials through an interlibrary loan. Thus, you likely should never have to pay to access a source yourself.
If you hit a paywall, then turn to your university library's website for free access. If you cannot find the resource there,
ask a librarian or your instructor for help, or request the material through an interlibrary loan.

            Finally, AI chatbots are increasingly built into search engines, including Google. Although chatbot results are
typically separated from search engine results visually and/or through labeling, if you are not careful, you might mis-
take the results for sources produced by the search engine.

            Consequently, we strongly recommend that you access sources in more than one place when searching for
sources. If you begin with Google, don't end there. Also explore what your campus library's website and professional
librarians have to offer.

Finding Research Sources Through Your Library

As a college or university student, you likely already pay (in your tuition or school fees) for library resources, both online
and in person. It's smart, then, to make use of those resources! We will comment briefly on especially helpful online
library resources and the types of in-person guidance your librarians can likely provide you.

Research Databases for Subject-Specific Sources

Among the most useful library resources you can find through your college library's website are research databases. In
the previous chapter, we defined a research database as an organized online storehouse of information that can easily
be searched to retrieve desired sources. We listed the various types of sources you can access through such databases.

            Here we'll add that you can conduct subject-specific searches by targeting specific, relevant databases. For
example, if your speech topic concerns community spaces, you might find Art and Architecture Complete especially
useful. If, instead, you need to learn about vaccines, then MEDLINE could prove useful. Your library may not subscribe
to these exact examples of databases. The point is for you to find and make use of the subject-specific databases your
college library does have through its website. Libraries often have subject-specific research guides that will suggest
which databases are most relevant to given subjects. They are generally aligned with majors and minors offered at the
institution.

                                                                                                                      Finding and Documenting Research Sources | 107
Local News Sources

                                                              Your library also likely provides free digital access to a
                                                           variety of local news sources, such as your university's
                                                           newspaper, your local town newspaper, the newspaper of
                                                           one or more major cities in your state, and one or more
                                                           national newspapers (such as The New York Times or Wall
                                                           Street Journal). Your library likely offers both archival and
                                                           ongoing access to such news sources. If you choose a
                                                           topic that is particularly localized, you may find searches
                                                           in one or more of these news sources handy.

   Don't forget about your university's librarians them-
selves! They are paid professionals who are trained to
help you find appropriate resources. Find out when one is
available and make an appointment or drop by! Not only
might you get help locating useful sources, but you are
likely to also pick up several more tips on how to search
effectively.

Choosing Your Search Language

Whether you search for sources on Google or your Image by Desola Lanre-Ologun via Unsplash, Unsplash License.
library's website, choose your search language thought-
fully. If your first search terms do not result in what you want, think of synonyms and try those. Persist, despite frustra-
tions. Online search success comes partly from discovering the right words to use to produce sources that help you
learn, focus your topic, and educate your community in turn. If you are striking out, go back and read background infor-
mation about your topic. Background reading involves reference sources such as encyclopedias and dictionaries. These
sources tend to reflect information and concepts that are consensually agreed to by a wide variety of parties. Conse-
quently, you can look for what words or phrases those sources use and try them in a search.

            So far we have mostly discussed accessing sources online, sometimes with the help of librarians. Next we turn
to another way to find sources: through interviews.

108 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
Interviews

                                                                  You might not immediately think of interviews when
                                                               researching a topic. Yet people can be some of your best

Begin by deciding what kind of person might be most helpful to talk to about your topic. Consider, for example, where
they might be located. We stress the value of initiating a local interview. Certainly, interviewing someone internationally
or nationally can provide very useful information and input. But part of becoming involved
in your community involves learning who the local experts are. Whether you live in a small
town or urban setting, you can find people nearby who can convey the local impact of the
issue you are studying, even when it is global in scope. They may also provide possible
solutions your community might adopt to improve it.

            To find a local person to interview, research your area. Ask local community mem-
bers (nonprofit organization participants, teachers, coaches, religious leaders, and so on)
for suggestions, search online for relevant groups and organizations, or visit your local
library. Once you have chosen a person to interview, make an initial connection. We rec-
ommend the following:

   Introduce yourself and your project.
   Tell them why you want to talk to them. For instance, explain you would like input to help develop your speech,

      and be clear and specific about the subject matter you want to discuss. This allows the interviewee to reflect on
      the topic in advance and, if appropriate, to review and collect relevant information to share with you.
   Estimate the amount of time you anticipate the interview will take (thirty minutes? one hour?) so the interviewee
      can account for that when scheduling the interview.
   Set up a day and time to conduct the interview. Don't assume an interviewee has time at that moment or when it is
      most convenient for you.
   Clarify their preferred means of communication (via videoconference, phone, or email or in person).

Preparing for the Interview

Prepare for the interview by carefully crafting your questions. Keep your questions specific but open-ended and neutral.

                                                               Finding and Documenting Research Sources | 109
Consider what types of information you are seeking and write your questions accordingly, using box 9.4 for guidance.
Be prepared to ask follow-up questions. End the interview by allowing the respondent to offer additional thoughts.

          Box 9.4 Asking Questions to Gain Different Types of Information
          When writing and asking questions, consider the kind of information you'd like to learn from the person
       you are interviewing.

             If you want factual information, ask for the exact data and facts you need. You might also tactfully
                request how the person knows these facts or from whom or where the information comes. If the
                interviewee references a report or study, for instance, ask where you might find a copy.

             If you want information about the person's experiences, ask how they have been affected by the
                topic or what a typical day at work or at the organization they belong to looks like. Or you might
                request the interviewee to relate their most vivid memories associated with your topic.

             If you want to learn the person's opinions or feelings, explicitly invite a perspective on or response
                to an opinion or policy proposal you've read or heard.

             If you want the person's ideas for local actions community members can take to help improve the
                issue you're researching, simply ask what local people, including college students, can do to help
                address or solve the problem. If the person is part of an organization devoted to the issue you're
                exploring, you might ask how local community members can aid their organization--what needs or
                opportunities it currently has--and get all the necessary details to relay to your peers if you choose to
                advocate one of these options.

Conducting the Interview

Having made a contact and prepared your questions, you are ready to conduct the interview. Follow a few simple guide-
lines to help ensure an enjoyable and productive exchange:

   Be punctual for your scheduled time if your interview is by videoconference, phone, or in person.
   Reintroduce yourself and remind the respondent why you asked for the interview.
   Ask your questions one at a time.
   Either take great notes during the interview or ask permission to record the interview. Don't count on your memory

      to recall their answers. Recognize that some people may feel uncomfortable being recorded.
   Make clear to the interviewee how you will use the information provided and verify you have permission to use their

      input and quote them. Sometimes people will share information with you off the record or will not want some
      ideas attributed to them. You need to respect their wishes.
   Thank the person for taking time to talk with you.
   Keep an eye on the time. Stick to the amount of time you estimated when scheduling the interview. If you come to
      the end of that time and wish to continue, ask if the person can answer one or two more questions. Provide the
      option of ending the interview in case they cannot linger.
   When you leave, spend time immediately going over your notes. Make sure you note the date of the interview and
      the name and title of the person you interviewed.
   Give the person the option to review any quotations you plan to use from the interview for accuracy.

110 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
            By following this guidance, you should enjoy a very positive interviewing experience. Your exchange will likely
provide helpful information and opinions for your speech. And you will probably feel more closely joined to your com-
munity afterward because you connected with another member.

Source Documentation

Once you have found strong sources for your topic--whether through Google, your college library, or interviews--how
do you properly and effectively credit them in your speech? We next answer this question by considering how to doc-
ument your sources during a speech and in an associated bibliography. We will begin by explaining the importance of
source documentation.

Better Safe Than Sorry

Whenever you get ideas from, directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize content from another source, cite your source.
A citation provides a source's basic identifying information, such as the four W's we discuss in "What to Cite: The Four
W's." As we encouraged in chapter 5, when in doubt, cite.

            Citing your sources strengthens your credibility because it reflects your competence (you did your homework)
and trustworthiness (you are making clear what sources you consulted). In contrast, passing off someone else's ideas
as your own (i.e., not citing your sources) is an act of academic dishonesty and plagiarism. As chapter 5's discussion
of ethics made clear, it is unethical to take credit for other people's ideas or work. You will lose your audience's and
instructor's trust. Furthermore, not citing your sources makes it more difficult for your audience to learn more about
your topic and take action. By citing your sources, you provide them with a path forward to further education and advo-
cacy.

Written and Spoken Citations

                                         When preparing a public speech, keep in mind two types of citations: written

                                         and spoken. Written citations are written down, typically in the form of a bibli-

                                         ography (perhaps called a Works Cited or References)--much like you might pro-

                                         vide with an essay you have written. Your instructor may require you to submit a

                                         written bibliography with your speech outline or manuscript. Alternatively, you

                                         may choose to provide your bibliography to a community group you are address-

                                         ing so they can further pursue the topic you discuss.

                                         Written citations should follow a style guide, or instructions for writing

Citation Needed by futureatlas.com, via  and formatting sources. Modern Language Association (MLA) and the American
Wikimedia Commons, CC BY.                Psychological Association (APA) both author style guides. Ask your instructor

                                         what style guide they prefer and consult Purdue University's Online Writing Lab

(known as "Purdue OWL") for help following it. Your library likely has access to both print and online style guides, and

your reference librarians can help you with citation questions. Alternatively, free software such as Zotero may prove

useful.

         Speakers should also use spoken citations, because audiences don't typically receive or read a bibliography, or

they don't see it (such as on a concluding visual aid) until after the speech is over. Consequently, speakers should use

                                         Finding and Documenting Research Sources | 111
spoken citations, which are vocalized during the speech. They can be integrated anywhere into a speech: as part of the
attention-getter, to establish the problem, to make a viable solution compelling, and so on. Wherever you include them,
say the spoken citation prior to summarizing, paraphrasing, or quoting the source. Announcing the source first allows
the audience to evaluate the information in light of its source.

What to Cite: The Four W's

While specific requirements differ based on the exact type of source, most written and spoken citations need you to
answer the four W's: who, where, when, and what.

   Who created the source? That is, who is the author of the article, post, or book, or who did you interview?
   Where was it published? What is the title of the journal or website, for instance, where the article or blog can be

      found? Alternatively, how did you conduct the interview (by email or in person)?
   When was the source published or made available, or when did you talk with your interview subject?

            Answering the three questions of "who," "where," and "when" is sufficient for a spoken citation, but a fourth
question--"what"--may also be necessary for a written citation in a bibliography.

   What is the name of the source? In other words, what is the title of the article, book chapter, or post? This is more
      specific than the publication ("where").

Box 9.5 Examples of Citing the Four W's

                                                            Notice the use of the words "quote" and
                                                "unquote" to orally indicate where the source's
                                                direct language begins and ends.

                                                            Notice both citations answer who, where,
                                                and when. Only the written citation additionally
                                                answers what and provides a URL (if relevant). Nei-
                                                ther of these are included in a spoken citation.

But What About Citing...?

A few situations are a little tricky to know when and how to cite, so we address them here. Specifically, we address citing
the use of AI, open access sources, and sources used to produce visual aids.

112 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
Citing the Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

We established that artificial intelligence (AI) is not a source but a compiler of information and sources--and that the
sources a chatbot offers may or may not actually exist. However, we also recognized there are valuable uses for AI in
developing a speech, such as brainstorming arguments and restating complex ideas more simply. If you make use of AI
in any way, you should cite it. That means if you paraphrase, summarize, or quote text produced by AI or if you use AI to
generate ideas, translate language, edit your work (including your word choices or grammar), or for any other task, you
should make that clear in your written citations. You can use box 9.6 for citation guidance, but please check with your
instructor as well as style guides, as norms are rapidly evolving.

          Box 9.6 Citing the Use of AI Tools
          To cite your use of AI, you should name the following elements in a written citation (not necessarily in
       this order):

             the AI tool and version you used (e.g., ChatGPT 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DALL-E 3.0),
             the company who made the tool (e.g., OpenAI, Google),
             the date you used the tool,
             what you used it for or what you asked it to do, and
             a URL to the tool.

                   For example, "Provide a list of harms caused by excessive waste" prompt. ChatGPT 4.5, OpenAI, 17
       April 2025, https://chatgpt.com/.

                   In a spoken citation, you only name the AI tool and version you used (what) and company who
       made the tool (who). For example, `As you can see in this list of harms generated by Open AI's ChatGPT 4.5 . .
       .'

                   Before following this model, check with your instructor as well as style guides for current recom-
       mendations.

Citing Open Access and Creative Commons Sources

Other potentially difficult types of sources are open

access and Creative Commons. As we explained earlier,

open access refers to online sources that are available

without the need to pay, either directly or via a library,

and generally do not include advertisements. Typically,     Creative Commons Logo by Creative Commons, Used per Creative
open access sources will designate a Creative Commons       Commons policies.
license to guide how they can be used or mixed into new

work. For example, CC-BY is a license that indicates you can use the work for any purpose as long as you credit the

creator, whereas CC-BY-NC-ND means that you must give credit to the creator, may only use the work for noncommer-

cial purposes, and cannot modify the work.

What this means is that you need to cite any open access materials you use (in addition to complying with any

                                                            Finding and Documenting Research Sources | 113
requirements dictated by their Creative Commons license) if you summarize, paraphrase, or quote them. Depending on
what kind of open access material you use and how you use it, you may need a written citation, a spoken citation, or
both. Ask your instructor for specific guidance.

          Box 9.7 Citing Open Access Materials with Creative Commons Licenses
          To provide a written citation of Creative Commons material, follow the TASL Method developed by the
       creators of Creative Commons licenses. That means your citation should identify the following:
          Title: If the written or visual material has a title, identify it. If not, ignore this.
       Author: Name the author (licensor) of the material, using the way they name themselves. Link to the
       author's profile page, if available.
       Source: Identify where the material can be found and link to it.
       License: Name the specific Creative Commons license and link to it.

                   For example, the picture in the next section of a person pointing at a visual aid could be cited this
       way in a written citation: "Whiteboard" by sumarni at the noun project, CC-BY 3.0.

                   In a spoken citation, you would only need to include the author (who) and source (what). For exam-
       ple, `In this picture by sumarni at the noun project . . .'

                   There is no one way to communicate the TASL information. We recommend you consult a style
       guide and your instructor for specific preferences.

Citing Sources Used to Make Visual Aids

                                      Finally, it can be difficult to know how to best cite sources you draw on to produce visual
                                      aids for your speech. As we will discuss in chapter 29, your visual aids might include a video
                                      clip you find, or they may visually display data, examples, photographs, or even testimony
                                      you discover from outside sources. Alternatively, you might create a visual aid using an AI
                                      tool such as DALL-E.

                                                  You can incorporate into your speech a spoken citation of the source or AI tool you
                                      used as you talk through the information or imagery shown. In most cases, however, you will
                                      likely prefer the less disruptive option of a written citation. In either case, we recommend
                                      you include written citations at the end of the slide deck or video (as a bibliography or credit
page) or on the visual slide itself or in the video as it plays. If you choose to include a written citation on the slide or in
the video, use a small font and a low positioning of the citation so it does not compete for the audience's attention. As
always, include the four W's (and follow a style guide) or use the guidance provided in "Citing the Use of Artificial Intel
ligence Tools" and "Citing Open Access and Creative Commons Sources." Including a written citation builds your credi-
bility by giving credit to the source who created the image or video or produced the information you are using.
            When you document your sources, both when speaking and in writing, you follow the best practices of excellent
speakers. You can feel pleased by how well you discovered, learned from, and utilized strong and diverse sources for
your speech.

114 | Finding and Documenting Research Sources
Summary

   This chapter has offered you specific techniques to find and document research sources.
     AI chatbots currently too often hallucinate research sources to be useful research tools. Even as these

        tools improve, speakers should always ensure the sources provided to a prompt actually exist and then
        find and read the information they offer.
     There are smarter ways to search Google than to simply type in search terms. We recommend you
        consider domain labels and open educational resources and use site-specific searches as well as special-
        ized search engines.
     Make use of the resources provided by your library if you are a college or university student. They
        include such helpful online resources as research databases and news sources as well as in-person guid-
        ance from librarians.
     Conducting an interview is an excellent way to ascertain people's opinions and experiences related to
        your topic. To ensure an interview is effective, you should follow basic instructions on how to make a
        contact, prepare for the interview, and conduct the interview.
     Ethical speakers give credit to all their sources through spoken and written citations.

     Discussion Questions
         1. Try searching for a topic using a basic Google search. Then try searching for the same topic on a spe-
             cialized Google search or an online database. How do the results compare? What did you learn in the
             process?
        2. Which databases and news sources do you have access to through your library's website? How have
             you used databases or news sources in the past?
        3. Who might you interview for an upcoming assignment? How could you research your local area to find
             a group or individual relevant to your topic? What questions might you ask?
        4. Which types of sources are the strongest in your opinion? Why?

10. Knowing Your Audience

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Differentiate between types of public speaking audiences.
          Analyze an audience according to three factors.

If asked to draw the act of public speaking, what would you sketch? A person--maybe a
stick figure--standing on a stage? Perhaps the figure would be holding a microphone or
have a speech bubble? Or would they be sitting at a computer screen or talking into a
phone? More importantly for this chapter, would you draw an audience? If so, how
would you feature them? When we ask our students to visually depict public speaking,
or rhetoric, they rarely think to include an audience. When they do, students typically
draw an audience much smaller than, or positioned lower than, the speaker. Such depic-
tions imply that public speaking is really an exercise of power over an audience by talk-
ing "at" them.

            Today we know that model of public speaking is old-fashioned even if it still is
a common first reaction. It simply doesn't respect the integral and powerful role audiences play in public speaking. Dis-
course is not the sole creation or property of a speaker. Public speech only has meaning in its relationship to an audi-
ence that listens and responds to it. Recall that in chapter 1, we claimed that the listener has a role of equal, if not greater,
importance than the speaker in providing rhetoric with meaning. As we stated there, meaning is ultimately negotiated
between a rhetor and an audience, often over an extended period and in many different forms. In short, audiences are
central to public speaking.

            Consequently, this chapter focuses your attention on your audience. It comes relatively early in the textbook
because good speakers take their specific audience into consideration at every stage of the speech process, including
research, organization, outlining, and delivery. We begin with the importance of audience analysis and then consider
the types of audiences to analyze, factors to consider, and the limitations of audience analysis in public speaking.

                                                                                                                                                   Knowing Your Audience | 117

             Box 10.1 The Ancient Roots of Audience Analysis
             We find references to audience analysis by ancient Greek
          philosophers and teachers such as Plato and Aristotle. In
          Phaedrus, Plato defined oratory as "the art of enchanting
          the soul" and encouraged speakers to "learn the difference
          among human souls" so speakers can alter their speeches
          accordingly.1 Several decades later, Aristotle gave the first
          description of audience types based largely on age, includ-
          ing their tendencies and likely beliefs, values, and motiva-
          tions. Aristotle instructed speakers to analyze their
          listeners and select appeals that will best speak to their
          experiences, knowledge, and desires.

              You experience audience analysis in your daily life,
  although perhaps not always with full awareness. If you read ESPN
  online, for instance, you are likely exposed to ads for athletic gear,
  sports betting, and technology. Peruse Glamour online, and you'll
  more likely find ads for food (especially sweet treats), medication, Aristotle by Alvaro Marques Hijazo via Wikimedia
  and stores like Target. The products reflect the presumed inter- Commons, Public Domain.
  ests of the magazines' target audiences. Increasingly, ads on the
  internet are individually tailored to you. If you have recently shopped for a pair of Converse shoes online, for example,
  then you might suddenly find them advertised on another website you visit. We don't find this surprising because audi-
  ence-targeted advertising (audience analysis and adaptation) makes intuitive sense. It also makes our lives easier, since
  we don't have to endure (as many) advertisements for products we don't want.

              Similarly, as a speaker you should critically assess your audience. However, we add a significant note of

   caution: Capitalist consumerism (like the advertisements we mentioned) and civic engagement begin from very different
   premises and can be at odds with one another. A speech is more than selling a product; ideally, it is about contributing to
   the public good. Just because something is effective, be it a marketing ploy or a persuasive message, does not guarantee
   that it is ethical. This differentiation influences our investigation of audience analysis, beginning with the multiple types
   of audiences you should consider.

 Types of Audiences

   We've referenced "the audience," but who, exactly, do we mean? Who should you analyze? The answer is more compli-
   cated than it may seem! To illustrate, we will make three types of distinctions: direct and targeted audiences, discrete
   and dispersed audiences, and implied and implicated audiences.

 Direct and Target Audiences

                                      Your direct audience refers to the people who are exposed to and attend to your speech. If you
                                      speak in person, that may be easy to determine. It is everyone at the location who can hear you
                                      and is paying attention.

                                                  Of course, a direct audience won't always be preassembled and ready to listen to you.
                                      If you're lucky, a civic organization will invite you to address its members, or fellow community
                                      members will quickly respond to a recorded speech you upload. Much of the time, however,
                                      you may have to find or even build a direct audience to hear your message. Your efforts can
                                      range from requesting speaking time at a local meeting, to creating a public event and making
   publicity efforts to draw an audience, to even convincing others to help you pressure leaders to meet with and hear
   from you.
               Once you have found or arranged a direct audience, it can be composed of people with diverse experiences and
   opinions. Thus, you might choose to focus on specific members who are more likely to be influenced by your appeals
   and/or more likely to act on them. We call them your target audience. If you are trying to
   convince your classmates to support a national ban on assault weapons, you might focus
   on--or target--those who adopt a more expansive or looser interpretation of the US Consti-
   tution's Second Amendment.

 Discrete and Dispersed Audiences

   A second useful distinction is between discrete and dispersed audiences.2 In traditional, face-to-face public speaking,
   the audience is often limited to those individuals who show up for the event at a particular day and time--the audience

is discrete. In other words, only the people who attended can see and hear the speech. Those who did not attend lose
out on the opportunity.

                                                 When speaking online, however, your audience may be dispersed, unlimited by loca-
                                     tion or, perhaps, time if it's recorded. A dispersed audience is more difficult to determine. If
                                     you become passionate about a local policy, for example, and upload a speech to YouTube and
                                     make it publicly available, the audience is dispersed because it's unclear who will click the
                                     link. Geographically, people from your hometown as well as folks across the nation or even
                                     around the globe could watch it. In terms of time, viewers could click the link as soon as it's
                                     available, and people could continue to find the speech as long as it remains a live, public link.
                                     With a dispersed audience, then, it can be difficult to make specific or timely references or
calls to action because geographic locations and time differences may alter what individuals are able to do.
            Reflecting on types of audiences can help you decide exactly who you should analyze and make adaptations
for. If your direct audience is dispersed, for instance, identify whom you might target or even attempt to draw to your
speech. If your direct audience is discrete, consider how you analyze the group while keeping in mind the subgroup(s)
you particularly want to target.

Implied and Implicated Audiences

A third important distinction is the implied and implicated audiences.3 An implied audience is a group that is repre-
sented in your message, and an implicated audience is affected by your message if it succeeds.

            Let's use a state congressional hearing as an
example. Imagine a group of congressional representa-
tives and experts meeting to deliberate a bill that
decreases environmental protections for a city in that
state. An expert advocates passionately for the bill's pas-
sage, noting that reducing the environmental protections
would allow more businesses in the area to flourish. The
speaker crafts an argument they think their target audi-
ence--the congressional representatives who are pre-
sent--will find compelling.

            However, there are also the

 implied audience of the business owners who are         NMSS Director John Lubinski at Congressional Field Hearing by
   being spoken for, or represented in, the speech; and   Nuclear Regulatory Commission via Flickr, CC BY.

 implicated audiences, those affected if the speaker is

successful, including not only those business owners but also people who work for them or are looking for

employment as well as residents who live in the area and local environmentalists. These audiences are important

because they are impacted by the results of the speech but might not be part of the direct or target audiences.

   120 | Knowing Your Audience
          Box 10.2 Determining Your Implied and Implicated Audiences
          To determine your implied audience(s), ask, Who are you speaking about or advocating for? Against?
       What are you saying about them or for them? How are you characterizing (explicitly or implicitly) a culture,
       group, or individual?

                   To determine your implicated audience(s), ask, If your goal of informing or persuading your target
       audience(s) is successful, what culture, group, or individual will be affected? If you are unsuccessful, who
       might be impacted?

                   These two types of audiences are not mutually exclusive!

            It may seem odd to consider audiences who may not be physically or digitally present for your speech. After all,
isn't the target audience who you're trying to inform or persuade? Yes, your target audience is important, whether they
are discrete or dispersed. But the way you represent or depict groups, cultures, or individuals has lasting impacts, even
outside your speech event. Similarly, the purposes you seek to fulfill, whether to inform or persuade the target audience,
will affect individuals, groups, or cultures, especially if you successfully fulfill your purpose. Whomever your audience,
we recommend you use the following guidance to analyze them.

Audience Analysis Factors

We've established that many types of audiences exist for any given speech. From this point on, we will refer again to
"the audience" for the sake of simplicity. But when we do, you can substitute any of the types explored in the previous
section. Paying attention to and learning about every audience will aid your speaking efforts.

            So what should speakers learn about their audience to help adapt their messages? Audience analysis includes
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors.

                                                                                                                                                   Knowing Your Audience | 121
Demographic Factors

   Demographic factors are personal characteristics that
are likely to shape the audience's views and perspectives
on a topic. Audience demographics are useful in providing
a sort of shorthand for audience interests and beliefs.

            The age of an audience, for example, is a proxy
for their experiences in life.

   If you attend a residential liberal arts college, the
      typical age of your classroom audience (eighteen to
      twenty-two years) means that few in your class likely
      have children or own their home. So if you want to
      address tax deductions, focusing on the child tax
      credit or mortgage deduction would probably be less Showing on Computer by Lauren Proffitt via Flickr, CC BY.
      relevant to this audience than examining deductions
      available for college tuition and school expenses. Likewise, a traditional college audience (ages eighteen to twenty-
      three) has a different range of experiences with the social world than more mature audiences.

   People in their sixties are more likely to be familiar with using pay phones or going to the library to access
      research sources. However, they are less likely to be familiar with TikTok, YouTube celebrities, or the most recent
      album by Harry Styles.

The point is that age is often a demographic signifier for a range of information about an audience, including experi-
ences, personal concerns and interests, and cultural knowledge or awareness.

          Box 10.3 Audience Demographic Factors
          As a speaker, it is valuable to consider the demographic characteristics of your audience as you plan your
       message. Relevant demographic factors may include the following:

             age
             gender
             race and ethnicity
             socioeconomic status
             culture--values and customs
             geography--where the audience is from and where you are speaking
             education
             occupation
             group memberships--religious and political affiliations, civic clubs, and so on

                   In using such information, ask yourself how the particular factor potentially affects

             the relevance of the topic to my audience,
             my audience's interest in the topic,
             my audience's knowledge of or exposure to the topic, and

122 | Knowing Your Audience
             my audience's likely perspective on and reaction to the topic.

            Other demographic characteristics can similarly be useful in thinking about how to approach a speech. For
example, if you shared the results of a study you conducted on narcissism, you would approach it differently for a class-
room of public speaking students as opposed to a room full of psychology professors at a national conference. The dif-
ference in their education would guide you toward altered language use (employing or avoiding specialized, scientific
vocabulary terms) and level of detail (including or excluding supporting literature or an explanation of your methodol-
ogy). The contrast in their education would give you hints about their likely interest in specific content and ability to
understand concepts or terms.

          Box 10.4 Who Is My Audience?
          When you do not know a great deal about your audience, there are several ways you can learn about their
       demographics and attitudes. Some of the most useful techniques are addressed in chapters 8 and 9 on
       research.
             Internet research: Do online research on the organization, location, membership, or event to gain

                more understanding of your likely audience.
             Questions: If you are giving an invited talk, ask questions of whoever extended the invitation to

                learn more about the speaking situation and audience.
             Observation: If you will be speaking to a particular group or at a particular location, try to observe a

                meeting or speaker at the location prior to your presentation.
             Interviews: Conduct interviews of group leaders or members to gain the perspectives of the likely

                audience. Also, interview several members of your implied and implicated audiences to get to know
                them better.
             Nontraditional sources (social media posts, blogs, etc.): Search new media sources to find locations
                that feature the voices and perspectives of your implied and implicated audiences.

                   Always remember that one person's perspective cannot be generalized as indicative of the entire
       group that shares their demographic features.

            Regardless of your topic, the questions to ask about your audience remain remarkably similar: What are the
likely demographics of my audience? How might those demographic factors be important to their awareness, interest,
needs, and predispositions on my topic? How can I use this demographic information to better relate to my audience,
make my presentation more relevant and accurate, and encourage them to understand my perspective?

                                                                                                                                                  Knowing Your Audience | 123
Limitations to Using Demographic Factors

                                     There are some limitations in demographics-based audience analysis. A key concern is how
                                     much you can reasonably generalize before you create stereotypes about the audience. A
                                     stereotype is a generic categorization of individuals and groups based on the inaccurate con-
                                     clusion that people sharing a particular characteristic will automatically possess similar qual-
                                     ities and beliefs. Remember that people--regardless of similarities such as age, gender, and
                                     race--are individuals. Thus, while there is some evidence that allows us to generalize possible
                                     views based on these sorts of demographic factors, any individual can defy that generalized
                                     pattern.
            Also, each of us has multiple demographic features that intersect in ways that influence
our standpoint. In chapter 7, we introduced standpoint theory, which suggests that our social
identities influence how we are treated and our knowledge of the world. We also introduced
intersectionality, or the notion that our identities consist of multiple features that combine in
meaningful ways to create intersecting forms of privilege and oppression--and sometimes in
seemingly contradictory ways that defy stereotypes. A Hispanic woman is likely to experience a
combination of racism and sexism, but significant wealth may give her access to resources--and
thus experiences--others with a similar background do not share. Reducing an audience to one demographic quality and
making subsequent assumptions about them is overly simplistic.
            Overly relying on demographic factors can also invite implicit biases, unreflective beliefs about a group of peo-
ple based on your background, personal experiences, and social stereotypes. Don't assume, for example, that a group of
women is interested in hearing about makeup rather than sports. Not only does that assumption rely on a stereotype of
women, but it is also likely informed by implicit biases about them.
            When you rely on stereotypes or implicit biases to analyze your audience, you risk drawing faulty conclusions,
harming your relationship with the audience, passing along misinformation about them, and hurting your speaking
effectiveness. These concerns are especially true for your implied and implicated audiences, who may not be present to
correct or add to your representation of them and their interests.
            Additionally, demographics generally encourage you to concentrate on the majority views of your direct or
target audience. This means you risk overlooking or marginalizing audience members who are exceptions to the pre-
dominant factors found in the audience. You might occasionally decide to not target audience outliers, but it is often
beneficial to include appeals that might connect with those in the audience beyond the demographic norm. Similarly,
the ability to account for audience demographics is complicated when the audience is dispersed. One example is a vide-
orecorded speech uploaded to YouTube, which will remain accessible to future, unknown audiences. In such a case, with
changing contexts, circumstances, and listeners, our ability to analyze our audience effectively is necessarily limited.

          Box 10.5 Analyzing Your Audience

             Demographic factors: Personal characteristics such as age, ethnicity, geographic background, reli-
                gious affiliation, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status

             Psychological factors: Interest and personal stakes in the topic, expectations of the speaker, knowl-
                edge about the topic, assumptions about the occasion

             Environmental factors: Time of day, audience size, physical layout of the venue or affordances of
                the digital medium

124 | Knowing Your Audience
Psychological Factors

                              Like audience demographics, speakers should consider how psychological factors may influence
                              reception of their message. Psychological factors are an audience's predispositions related to
                              their mental state, attitude, personal stakes, and interest in and experience with the topic, occa-
                              sion, and speaker. Many of these predispositions relate to demographics. If we think in terms of
                              standpoint theory, we know that an audience's social identities (demographic factors) influence
                              their experiences and thus their knowledge and views about the world (psychological factors).

                                          Psychological factors such as audience interest in the topic and personal stakes can influ-
ence how an audience reacts to a message. For example, we generally assume audience members who attend voluntarily
have more genuine interest in a topic. In contrast, when you address a largely captive audience--an audience that is
required to be in attendance (such as your classmates)--it becomes more important to engage them and make the pre-
sentation relevant.

            An audience's interest level is related to their personal stakes--each individual's financial, material, and/or psy-
chological investments that could be improved or worsened based on how a topic is addressed. People who attend a
speech voluntarily likely come with a sense of their own personal stakes. That is, they probably already perceive them-
selves as part of the implicated audience. Speakers can tailor their speeches accordingly. A captive audience, however,
may not automatically perceive the speech as meaningfully affecting their lives and be more inclined to disengage as a
result. Consequently, you might explicitly identify how your topic and its outcome affect them personally. Explain how
they are an implicated audience.

            Another psychological factor subject to audience analysis is the audience's familiarity with the speaker and
topic. Familiarity is the degree to which an audience already knows or is ignorant about the speaker and topic. Positive
familiarity can be a source of goodwill between a speaker and audience, which the speaker can capitalize on to build
credibility. In contrast, if a speaker has developed a poor speaking reputation or is unfamiliar to the audience, they will
need to work harder to build a positive relationship. Relatedly, speakers may need to spend time giving extensive back-
ground information to audiences who are ignorant about a topic but can save that time when audiences are already
knowledgeable.

            Finally, it is important that the speaker consider the occasion or purpose of the speech when shaping it for a
particular audience. This includes factors such as the expected formality of the event, its tone or mood, and its impor-
tance. As a speaker, you want your presentation to reflect the demands of the situation, and you should adapt accord-
ingly.

                                                                                                                                                  Knowing Your Audience | 125
Environmental Factors

                                                          As a speaker, you should also consider how environ-

                                                          mental factors impact your message. Environmental fac

                                                          tors refer to elements of the speaking situation such as

                                                          time of day, size of audience, and communication

                                                          medium. These factors can influence how the audience

                                                          receives the message.

                                                          For instance, the time of day a speech is

                                                          given--early, late, near mealtime--can affect the audi-

                                                          ence's attitudes and reactions. Anyone who has taken an

munication medium impacts expectations as well.

We might think of the medium in terms of whether it is in person or presented through a screen (what we will

call a "televisual delivery" in chapter 18). Even among televisual media, an audience's expectations may differ. We may be

content with slides during a live Zoom presentation but anticipate much more polished and highly edited visual aids in

a YouTube video. In each case, you want to change your speaking plans due to such factors--how long you speak, the

sorts of supporting media you use, your use of humor or seriousness, and so on.

To assist in doing so, try to learn as much as possible about your speaking environment. If speaking in person,

visit the location in advance to stand in the speaking space, test equipment, and so forth. If speaking televisually, play

around with the electronic platform you will use to better learn the opportunities and constraints it poses. Learn what

expectations audiences may have for your specific communication medium. Being flexible and adjusting to the environ-

mentally influenced needs of the audience will allow you to speak more effectively.

Summary

        This chapter stressed the importance of audience to your success in inspiring audience members to work
     together to improve your communal life. Public speaking actively involves both a speaker and an audience.

          Audience analysis, the practice of assessing audience factors that are likely to influence an audience's
             reception of a message, is an important resource for public speakers when developing their message.

          Audience can be conceptualized in many helpful ways. The direct audience consists of the people who
             are exposed to and attend to your speech, whereas the target audience are specific members you focus
             on because they are more likely to be influenced by your appeals and/or more likely to act on them.

          A discrete audience includes a finite amount of people, typically limited to those individuals who show
             up for a speaking event at a particular day and time. A dispersed audience is unlimited by location, or
             perhaps time, if it's recorded.

          An implied audience is a group that is represented in your advocacy. An implicated audience refers to a
             group that will be impacted by the results of your speech.

126 | Knowing Your Audience
     Audience analysis functions by considering three kinds of factors: demographic factors, psychological
        factors, and environmental factors.

     Audience demographic factors are personal characteristics of the audience that are likely to shape
        their views and perspectives on a topic. Common demographic factors include age, gender, race and eth-
        nicity, socioeconomic status, culture, geography, education, occupation, and group memberships.

     Psychological factors include the audience's mental state, attitude, personal stakes, and interest in the
        topic, occasion, and speaker.

     Environmental factors include elements of the speaking situation such as time of day, location, size of
        audience, and communication medium.

     Despite its utility, audience analysis is also subject to important limitations, including how well we can
        know our audience, how accurately demographic factors will predict predispositions, and what audience
        analysis means for audience members who fall outside the audience majority. To generalize about an
        audience too broadly risks stereotyping individuals and groups and/or relying on implicit biases about
        them.

11. Adapting to Your Audience

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Adapt specific elements of a speech for an audience.
          Construct a vision of who the audience can become as they strive with the speaker to create a better

             future together.

The previous chapter established audience analysis as the practice of assessing factors that are likely to influence an
audience's reception of a message. So what do you do with all the insights and information you gain about your audi-
ence?

            This chapter answers that question by considering audience adaptation, or the ways you alter your speech,
using audience analysis cues, to better achieve your speaking goals. We begin by establishing the importance of adapting
your speech to your audience. We follow with specific strategies you can use to connect with and engage your audience.
We end by addressing how rhetoric allows you, as a speaker, to work with your audience in imagining a more productive
future together.

The Importance of Audience Adaptation

Too often, student speakers make one of two mistakes when drafting and presenting their speeches. One mistake is that
they don't think enough about delivering it to an audience. They approach their speech similarly to writing an essay they
will submit only to the instructor. A second mistake is that speakers assume their audience is just like themselves. They
deliver a speech they personally find compelling and assume their classmates will too.

            Both mistakes result in similar consequences: speeches that fail to connect with the audience. They center the
needs and interests of the speaker rather than their audience. You might even call these speeches selfish or self-focused.
Accordingly, they do not create a sense of community or compel the audience to address communal issues.

            Adaptation corrects both mistakes. It approaches a speech as public address--that is, as communication with
and to a public audience. The audience is critical to a speech. Without an audience, there is no speech! Adaptation also
recognizes that your audience is not the same as you, the speaker. Your and your audience's demographic and psy-
chological factors (explored in the previous chapter) may overlap, but they also likely differ. Audience adaptation, then,
prompts you to adjust, or adapt, your speech to center the audience's needs. We next offer strategies for making such
adaptations.

                                                                                                                                              Adapting to Your Audience | 129
Audience Adaptation Strategies

What do we mean by adapting your speech? We offer seven specific strategies you can (and should) utilize in crafting
your speech: own your message, find common ground with your audience, use appropriate language, adjust the depth
and complexity of the content, appeal to deeply held values, use compelling supporting appeals, and select credible and
familiar sources.

            As we explore each strategy, we assume you will use these strategies mostly for your direct and target audi-
ences. Recall from the previous chapter that your direct audience are the people who are exposed to and attend to your
speech. Your target audience includes specific members of the direct audience who are more likely to be influenced
by your appeals and/or more likely to act on them. When appropriate, however, we note ways your adaptation efforts
should also be mindful of your implied audience (a group that is represented in your message) and your implicated audi-
ence (those affected by your message if it succeeds).

          Box 11.1 Strategies for Adapting to Your Audience
             Own the message.

             Appeal to deeply held values.
             Use compelling supporting appeals.
             Select credible and familiar sources.

Own Your Message

Though it may seem counterintuitive, one of the first strategies to remember when adapting to your audience is that
you, as the speaker, must continue to own the message. That is, your efforts at audience adaptation must not compro-
mise your voice and vision. Your intent is not to tell the audience what they want to hear or what is popular. Instead,
maintain your authenticity as you connect with the audience and make your message relevant to them.

Find Common Ground

                                                          At the center of audience adaptation is the effort to find

                                                          common ground or, as literary critic Kenneth Burke says,
                                                          to develop identification.1 Identification is the degree to

                                                          which individuals or groups find themselves joined or

                                                          linked. For Burke, identification is the primary means of

                                                          persuasion and occurs when audience members feel a

                                                          connection with the speaker. When we identify with

                                                          someone, we also can share a view of life, demonstrate

                                                          similar values, or develop a sense of trust.

                                                          In terms of audience adaptation, the speaker can

                                                          cultivate identification in several ways. You may explicitly

                                                          reference what you hold in common, such as demo-

                                                          graphic factors (your shared age, geographic region,

                                                          political affiliation, etc.) or psychological factors (your

                                                          shared personal stakes, knowledge about the topic, or

                                                          enthusiasm for the occasion). Alternatively, you can foster

                                                          identification more implicitly through your verbal style

                                                          (chapter 16), vocal and nonverbal delivery (chapter 18), use

                                                          of visual aids (chapters 28 and 29), and the other adapta-

                                                          tion strategies we will offer.

Image by Felipe Bustillo via Unsplash, Unsplash License.  You have undoubtedly experienced several

                                                          means of identification in everyday life. Perhaps you've

talked with a stranger wearing the hat of your favorite sports team or your college's T-shirt. The connection and sudden

comfort you felt came from identification. As a speaker, you hope to make adaptations, based on information gleaned

from analysis, that create a connection. Your adaptations should be authentic, though, or they could backfire. For

instance, a group of ranchers probably won't take seriously a city slicker who shows up wearing a cowboy hat and sud-

denly starts talking with a drawl.

Identification also occurs through division. In chapter 2, we discussed division as a quality of unproductive dis-

course when speakers highlight and accentuate differences with other participants and their positions. We can also

think about division, however, more positively as a tool you can use to adapt to your audience. People might identify

with each other through their shared distaste for (division from) a rival sports team or college, for instance. You might

build an audience through your joint frustration with the local school board.

Be careful with using division to foster identification with your direct or target audience, however. Division is

often built on the rejection of an absent implied or implicated audience. Calls to "strengthen" or "close" the US/Mexico

border, for instance, attempt to form identification among North American citizens by dividing them from migrants. In

this case, migrants (and others) form the implied and implicated audiences, because they will be impacted by these poli-

cies and are being indirectly represented in the discourse, but they are not typically part of the direct audience. Unethi-

cal speakers may capitalize on that absence, oversimplifying or even dehumanizing implied and implicated audiences to

connect with their target audience.

Ethical speakers, in contrast, recognize the power of their speech and adjust it to also account for the humanity,

experiences, motives, and actions of the implied and implicated audiences. They may still advocate for a more stringent

immigration policy (that is, they can still own their message), but they will find alternative ways to identify with their

   direct audience. They may also recognize and offer ideas for how we can aid immigrants who are escaping violence,
   exploitation, and abuse.

 Use Appropriate Language

   Another way to adapt to your audience is to use appropriate language for your direct and target audiences. Think for
   a moment about our common expectation that our teachers, doctors, lawyers, and religious leaders adjust what they
   teach or say to our level and specific needs and interests. We would be frustrated with a professor who spoke to a col-
   lege class with the same vocabulary with which they write a journal article for specialists. In speaking situations, you
   should adjust your language based on audience characteristics such as age, education, and knowledge. This means alter-
   ing the complexity of your language--the amount of technical language you use and even the possible use of popular
   slang terms--depending on the audience and situation. If you don't, the audience is likely to tune you out.

               Using appropriate language also regards your implied and implicated audiences.2 Asking yourself to be account-
   able to these audiences encourages you to use ethical communication, pay attention to power, and reduce stereotypes.
   For example, if a speaker advocated to intervene in a country through military means, they might argue, "The United
   States needs to intervene because, right now, the other country is exhibiting barbaric tendencies." First, ask, Who are
   the implied and implicated audiences in this example? A clear implied and implicated audience includes the non-US
   population or cultural group--that is, "the other country." Second, ask, How have these groups been represented? What
   kind of talk is being used to describe these implied and implicated audiences? You'll notice that "barbaric" was used to
   describe individuals in this culture. In this instance, "barbaric" seems to imply that the United States' intervention is jus-
   tified; barbaric seems bad, and alternatively, the United States does not exhibit those "barbaric tendencies," so the US
   may be best suited to intervene. However, this explanation is using ethnocentrism--or the belief that one's own culture
   is superior--as part of the argument. This type of talk should be avoided because it often represents other cultures in
   unethical, stereotypical, or unjust ways.

 Adjust the Depth and Complexity of Content

   Audience adaptation also means adjusting the depth of information presented on a topic and its complexity. Consider
   your direct and target audiences' familiarity with, or knowledge of, a topic as you assess how much background infor-
   mation is needed. Likewise, adjust the depth and complexity of your content based on situational factors such as the
   time available to speak and the purpose of the occasion.

               It is frustrating when a speaker spends significant time explaining an idea or event that the audience already
   knows about. In that case, the speaker squandered an opportunity to address what attracted the audience to the pre-
   sentation by rehashing common knowledge. Adapting to the needs and knowledge of the audience ensures your pre-
   sentation will be relevant and timely.

   132 | Adapting to Your Audience
Appeal to Deeply Held Values

Another way to adapt to your direct and target audiences is by appealing to values they identify as important. Demon-
strating in a speech how a problem violates or jeopardizes a deeply held value motivates an audience. Similarly, explain-
ing how a particular action or decision will advance an important value makes an audience more likely to lend their
support. Common values that work in such a fashion in the American context are freedom, justice, and equality. Value
appeals are explored in more depth in chapter 21's discussion of deliberation.

Use Compelling Supporting Appeals

One of the most effective ways to employ audience adaptation is through supporting appeals. In general, you want to
use diverse forms of evidence as discussed in chapter 26: examples, statistics, and testimony. However, you don't have to
use them in equal amounts. You might, for example, employ more numerical data if most of your direct audience--class-
mates in this case--are pursuing studies in the natural or social sciences. If you are speaking at a protest rally, however,
your direct audience might find quotes by several eloquent leaders about your cause to be more compelling.

            Whomever your direct or target audiences are, examples can be impactful if they reverberate with your listen-
ers. As defined in chapter 26, an example is a concrete instance that supports a broader point or conclusion. However,
if a selected example is unfamiliar to the audience or too obscure, it is unlikely to be effective. Similarly, an anecdote--a
story or extended example in narrative form--can nicely draw an audience in, but only if it's an already familiar story or
features values esteemed by the audience. Box 11.2 extends this logic to your use of metaphors.

          Box 11.2 Using Sports Metaphors to Support Your Message
          Metaphors compare two items or situations. Because of their popularity, sports are frequently drawn on
       to make comparisons:
             A heroic effort is characterized as "swinging for the fences."
             A successful effort is a "touchdown."
             An intense effort is described as a "full-court press."
             A desperate effort is labeled a "Hail Mary."

                   Sports metaphors can be very effective for some audiences but not all. Think about your audience's
       interests and the relevance particular metaphors may or may not have for them.

Select Credible and Familiar Sources

Finally, even your sources can be adapted to your direct and target audiences. As discussed in chapter 8, you should set
the evaluative standard, or bar, high when choosing research materials by judging each source by its BAARR: potential
bias, accuracy, authority, recency, and relevance.

            However, you should also consider which sources your audience likely holds in high esteem. It is one thing if
you use a source to support your claim, and it is quite another (and very helpful) if your audience knows and respects

                                                                                                                                              Adapting to Your Audience | 133
that source. Don't assume all groups value the same sources. Quoting the Bible or Koran, for example, may help sway
fellow members of your church or mosque, but these sources are less likely to compel classmates at a nonreligiously
associated university.

   Box 11.3 Sample Audience Analysis and Adaptation

   Lisa wanted to prepare a speech for class on the
benefits of community supported agriculture (CSA)
as a valuable source of local, organic food.

   Audience Analysis

 Demographic factors: Lisa realized most of

her audience members were eighteen to

twenty-three years old, lived in campus hous-

ing and were on a school dining plan, and had

minimal disposable income. Many were also

that they valued economic responsibility,            Image by congerdesign via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.
proximity, and health.

 Psychological factors: Through a class survey, Lisa also learned most of her classmates were from

urban areas and thus were likely unfamiliar with either growing their own food or CSAs.

 Environmental factors: Lisa knew her class met right before lunch, when her classmates would be

hungry.

Audience Adaptation

     Find common ground: Lisa referred to herself as a fellow student living in the residence halls who
        shared a desire for more healthy options on or near campus.

     Adjust the depth of the content: She gave a brief explanation of how CSAs work and why they got
        started before advocating that their college offer CSA shares to students as part of their meal plans.

     Use compelling supporting appeals: Lisa handed out several fresh fruits and vegetables she had pur-
        chased from the local farmers' market. She used them as examples of the kinds of produce available
        through a CSA.

            Lisa crafted specific appeals that engaged her peers and centered their needs and values. She prac-
ticed audience adaptation.

Adaptation, Not Manipulation

                                              Before leaving the strategies, we offer a final warning. Adaptation does not mean say-
                                              ing what the audience wants to hear or what is popular. Nor does it mean manipulating
                                              the audience to achieve your desired response. Ethical speakers do not mislead or prey
                                              upon their audience, whether by magnifying fears or promising the fulfillment of per-
                                              sonal desires.

                                                          Instead, we adjust our speech to help make messages more meaningful to our
                                              audience, centering their needs, stakes, and interests. As a speaker, you are speaking
                                              "with" an audience, not "to" or "at" them. Ideally, adaptations enable you to talk to and
                                              work with the audience to address issues together and improve your communities.
                                              The point is that speakers need to examine the ethics of their alterations and be mind-
ful that adaptation and manipulation are not the same, nor are they equally acceptable.

Imagining the Future Together

So far we have concentrated on adapting to an audience based on your analysis of who they are. Before closing, however,
there is another dimension of audience adaptation to consider, one that is particularly important in efforts at civic
engagement: who your audience wants to be and how you can all work together to accomplish that vision.

            That is, in considering your direct or target audience, you are not restricted to who they are now. Rather, you
can offer a vision of who they can become as they strive with you to create a better future together. The ideas you
address in your speech can be framed as opportunities for your audience to grow and thrive, thus making them more
attractive to subscribe to.

   Box 11.4 Public Figures Who Help Us Imagine the Future

   We can look to popular speakers and figures for
examples of people who help audiences imagine the
future together:

 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously shared

his "dream" of racial equality to help motivate

Americans to support civil rights legislation.

 Greta Thunberg offers contrasting visions

of the environment--one where climate

change has continued unimpeded and one in

which we have curbed rising global tempera-

tures--to advocate for conservation and

stewardship of our planet.

            These public figures don't just take audiences as they are; instead, they present a vision that imag-
ines what we can become by working and dreaming together.

                                                            In his essay "In Search of `the People': A Rhetori-

                                                            people" as a rhetorical construct that is called into being
                                                            by an advocate.3 In other words, a speaker can use

                                                            rhetoric to transform an audience from a mass of individ-

                                                            uals into a collective--"the people"--with a defined pur-

                                                            pose. As McGee explains, the people "are conjured into

                                                            objective reality, remain so long as the rhetoric which

                                                            defined them has force, and in the end wilt away, becom-

                                                            Your local community already exists. But it is

                                                            through rhetorical advocacy that its members might envi-

We the people by Navyatha123 via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY.  sion themselves as united together in brainstorming,
                                                            problem-solving, and imagining a better future. Through

speech, your community can envision themselves as "the people" or similarly, as we defined in chapter 2, a public: a

collection of people who are joined together in a cause of common concern.

Imagine, for instance, that your hometown wants to build a new school. To pay for it, the city needs to increase

property taxes, which requires local citizens to vote in approval. If you advocate for that cause, you will, of course, appeal

to parents of schoolchildren. However, to rhetorically activate "the people" to support the measure, your vision should

be broader. You can appeal to lifelong residents of the city, grandparents of schoolchildren, small-business owners, and

others by imagining what a new school might mean for their future: It could attract people to the town, help produce

engaged citizens and productive workers, lower crime rates, and so on.

If effectively drawn together during your persuasive campaign, volunteers would form a people--a collective

working on behalf of their common cause through phone calls, placement of yard signs, development of campaign lit-

erature, door-to-door canvassing of neighborhoods, and other activities. Once the vote was complete, this collective

would disperse, as the rhetoric that drew this diverse set of individuals together would cease to be a unifying force. As a

speaker, you too can lead your audience by offering a collective vision of their existence and future potential.

goals. Adjusting your message makes your speech more meaningful to your audience, so they can work with
you to improve your community.

     Audience adaptation ensures that you center the needs and interests of your audience rather than
        yourself as a speaker.

     Common audience adaptation strategies include owning your message, finding common ground, using
        appropriate language, adjusting the depth and complexity of material, appealing to deeply held values,
        using compelling supporting appeals, and selecting credible and familiar sources.

     When working with an audience, you are not restricted to who they are in the present. Rather, by
        engaging in brainstorming, problem-solving, and dreaming, you can work with an audience to imagine a
        better future together. Through rhetoric, a speaker can bring a people--a community--together in the
        service of a cause.

Thesis Statement

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Explain four goals of speech organization.
          Construct a strong thesis statement.
We all know the frustration of getting lost while someone else is speaking. When a speaker meanders, it is exhausting to
figure out what their point is, where they are in the speech, or how one idea relates to another. You might even give up
listening, start thinking about something else, or discreetly turn to your cell phone.

            These frustrations point to the importance of organization, which you learned in chapter 1 refers to how a
speaker orders the points in a speech and verbally connects those elements so their audience can follow. Inexperienced
or ineffective public speakers may believe that once they select and research a topic, the speech-writing process will
flow naturally. On the contrary! Skilled speakers know that selecting and organizing speech content requires time and
critical thinking. We will begin by discussing the purpose and goals of organization and then turn to the foundational
element of organization: thesis statements.

                                                     Since ancient times, scholars and practitioners of public
                                                  speaking have classified, studied, and practiced methods of
                                                  organization. During the fourth century BCE, for example,
                                                  Aristotle recognized that speakers who wish to capture and
                                                  hold an audience's attention must think about how to
                                                  arrange and connect their content. This and the following
                                                  two chapters draw on their wisdom so you may apply it to
                                                  your contemporary speech topics.

When we refer to the audience in this chapter, we are talking about your direct audience. In chapter 10, we defined the

direct audience as the people who are exposed to and attend to your speech. The needs of your audience, who are giving

you their time and attention, should motivate you to thoughtfully organize your speech. Clearly presenting complex or

unfamiliar issues enables your audience to better think through pressing public concerns.

        But how do you know when your speech is well organized? We'll next explain the four goals a speech fulfills

when it is well organized. Afterward, we'll consider how organizing your speech can help you tighten and hone your

ideas.

Four Goals of a Well-Organized Speech

There are at least four goals for a well-organized speech: make the speech easy to follow, coher-
ent, engaging, and well timed. You might think of these as benefits--for you as a speaker and for
the audience--when accomplished.

Easy to Follow

The first goal is to make the speech easy to follow. Audiences should be able to easily identify the thesis and distinguish
the speech's major elements--often an introduction, main points, and conclusion. Instead of laboring to figure out where
you are in a speech, your audience should be able to focus on your ideas instead. A well-organized speech also gives the
speaker confidence; you can more easily remember the main points because each is clear and distinct. Thus, you can
focus your energy on delivering the ideas, which allows you to give a more fluent and compelling presentation.

140 | Organizing Your Presentation with a Strong Thesis Statement
Coherent

Second, a well-organized speech should cohere as a presentation. That is, effective structure should draw connections
between ideas. Major speech elements should flow logically from one part to the next. The audience should easily under-
stand how the main points support or lead to the thesis. Speech content coheres when it makes sense together and
leads to a compelling conclusion. Furthermore, a well-organized speech improves the case you are making. If listeners
can easily see the connections between ideas, they may find your line of reasoning more convincing.

Engaging

Third, an organized speech is more engaging because it's more interesting and memorable for the audience. A cleverly
structured speech can offer the audience a new and interesting way of approaching an issue or understanding the mer-
its of a particular approach or solution. Similarly, taking time to carefully craft your introduction and conclusion can
effectively draw your audience in with a desire to learn more.

                                                                                      will provide: easy accessibility, free food, and
                                                                                      recognition of many students' financial pressures.
                                                                                      That might be easy to follow but rather boring.

                                                                                                   Alternatively, that same topic could be
                                                                                      organized by first establishing the prominence of
                                                                                      anxiety and depression among college students.
                                                                                      Next you could identify hunger caused by food

       Image by Aaron Doucett Kolar via Unsplash, Unsplash License. iety and depression. Following that you might offer
                                                                                      your solution of an on-campus food pantry. This
       three-point structure could more effectively intrigue the audience by drawing attention to the connections
       between food insecurity and mental health challenges.

            When a speech's organization is interesting, it is also typically memorable. An audience member may report
after listening to your speech, "She first explained the problem, then identified a cause of the problem, and advocated
for her preferred solution." Or "He started by sharing his own family's struggles with food insecurity, which immediately
drew me into the speech." A well-organized speech tends to enable active listening, whereas a jumbled speech tends to
elicit passive listening (at best) from an audience.

                                                                                              Organizing Your Presentation with a Strong Thesis Statement | 141
Well Timed

Finally, an organized speech is well timed. In other words, its length meets the audience's expectations and the require-
ments posed by the context. Speakers who talk without first organizing the content (in a "stream-of-consciousness"
fashion) are more likely to talk too long or too briefly, or they may misappropriate how they spend time within their
speech. Carefully attending to a speech's organization should avoid those pitfalls and satisfy the timing expected for the
occasion and by the audience.

          Box 12.3 Four Goals Accomplished by a Well-Organized Speech
           1. Easy to follow
          2. Coherent
          3. Engaging, because it is memorable and interesting
          4. Well timed

            The best speeches utilize organizational structures that meet all four goals. When any one goal is unmet, the
speech's success will suffer. A speech that is engaging and impactful but hard to follow, for example, may leave the audi-
ence wondering what they just heard. A speech that is easy to follow but poorly timed or boring, on the other hand, may
lose the audience's attention before it ends. Few speakers develop an effective organizational method the first time they
write or outline their speech. Instead, they typically follow a more recursive pattern.

The Recursive Nature of Organization

The remainder of this chapter, along with the next two chapters, provides steps to organize your speech. Although they
appear straightforward or linear, your process will likely be more recursive--that is, circular.
The process moves forward and backward; it circles back on itself. You may write a thesis
statement and then craft an introduction that leads up to it. You may develop your main
points but discover that your focus evolved and you need to go back and revise your thesis.

            Expect this recursivity as you draft your speech. The best speakers find themselves
honing or tightening their ideas throughout the process of organizing them. Whatever your
approach looks like, keep in mind that speeches need a clear purpose and central claim (the-
sis) to be successful. For this reason, we next turn to your thesis to build a strong foundation
for the rest of your speech.

Thesis Statements: Identifying a Clear Purpose

The thesis statement is the central statement of the speech. It states the key idea or claim the speaker wants the audi-
ence to accept or adhere to. It is the focal point of your entire presentation.

            All speeches should center on one key idea or proposition, ideally captured in a single sentence. That sentence

142 | Organizing Your Presentation with a Strong Thesis Statement
should be written as a declaration; that is, it should be a complete sentence that makes a single statement or expresses
an opinion or belief. Avoid a sentence that simply states facts, names a topic, provides a description, or asks a question.
Writing your thesis as a single declarative sentence that centers on one idea or proposition keeps the focus of your
speech straightforward, simple, and clear--for you and your audience. The rest of the speech should employ illustrations
and arguments that support this central idea.

            Fashioning a clear and concise thesis statement requires you to know the purpose of your speech. As you craft
your thesis, consider the following questions to determine your broad purpose:

   Is my purpose to explain how an instance of public discourse operated productively or unproductively?
   Do I want to inform my audience about relevant approaches to addressing a problem before they engage in a pub-

      lic deliberation?
   Am I writing a speech to advocate for a specific plan of action to address a civic issue?
   Do I want to convince my audience about how a specific public artifact functioned persuasively?

            The answers you give to these questions will influence the wording you use to articulate your thesis.
            Your thesis wording should reflect your overarching purpose, which, in this textbook, is likely to be either infor-
mative or persuasive.

   Notice in the prior questions how the words "explain" and "inform" cue the audience that your purpose is to edu
      cate them. Additional words that signal an informative goal include "teach" and "learn."

   Contrast those words with ones like "advocate" and "convince," which imply that your goal is to persuade the audi-
      ence. Similarly, words like "should" and "must" tend to suggest a persuasive goal.

            Try incorporating such cuing language into your thesis to signal your overarching purpose to your audience.
            Your more precise purpose will be narrower than informing or persuading your audience, of course. Your thesis
will need to articulate what you will inform your audience about or hope to persuade them of. Consequently, your the-
sis should also name the more specific claim or central focus you want your audience to accept. Specifying your exact
emphasis will help crystallize in your own mind what you want your speech to convey or advocate. It can then guide
your decisions about what material you include in your speech and what you should leave out. Chapters 21 and 24 will
further help you articulate your thesis for informative and persuasive speeches.

          Box 12.4 Suggestions for a Strong Thesis Statement

             State a single idea or claim.
             Require one sentence (two at most).
             Write a complete sentence that makes a statement or expresses an opinion or belief.
             Use cuing language that reflects your overarching purpose of informing or persuading your audi-

                ence.
             Make clear the exact idea you want to convey or the position you are advocating.

            We will end this chapter with expanded boxes that look at a couple speakers' attempts to come up with effec-
tive, appropriate thesis statements.

          Box 12.5 A Sample Thesis to Inform an Audience as They Prepare for Deliberation
       Javon was a member of his high school football
       team, and at the recent homecoming game, the star
       quarterback got a severe concussion. This was the
       fourth concussion of the season for Javon's team,
       and he was scared. He saw news stories about NFL
       players who were suing the league due to severe
       brain injuries. Some suspected recent suicides by
       former NFL players might also be linked to concus-
       sions. Something needed to change.

                   He noticed that community members
       advocated for different solutions but did not care-
       fully listen to each other's ideas. They were talking Image by Muyuan Ma via Unsplash, Unsplash License.
       past each other and getting nowhere. He felt that if
       they could sit down and discuss several perspectives and options, they might agree on a way forward. But
       first they would need to understand the potential solutions to the problem of concussions in high school
       football.

                   He decided to write a speech to inform community members about the options. His purpose was to
       ask his audience to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of several approaches before they deliberated
       together on a way forward.

          Javon's Draft Thesis for an Informative Speech
          Javon began with this thesis statement:

                  We need to stop judging one another and listen better. We need to hear what other people in the com
               munity think because this is a way to show respect.

                   Javon's draft thesis offers a fairly clear claim: We need to listen to and respect one another. But the
       thesis statement is also rather imprecise. He could say the same thing about any number of topics. The
       focus of his speech is not really about the importance of listening to one another but about the question he
       wanted his audience to consider more fully. After more thought, Javon rewrote his thesis so that it better
       aligned with his goals.

          Javon's Revised Thesis for an Informative Speech

                  The first thing we in Columbus need is a fuller understanding of the problem, as well as of multiple
               perspectives on addressing concussions in high school football, before we are ready to advocate and
               implement specific changes. With this goal in mind, the question that guides my speech this morning is,
               How can we best address the issue of concussions in high school football?

          This revised thesis, you will notice, is not a clearly stated argument; rather, it is a question. Remember
       that advocacy is not Javon's goal in this speech. His purpose is to inform his audience about a problem and
       possible solutions and to invite them to weigh options. (This is a necessary step before they move toward
       action in the future.)

                   To this end, Javon's thesis statement does offer a directly stated focal point for his presentation. It

144 | Organizing Your Presentation with a Strong Thesis Statement
is still the foundation on which the rest of his speech will be built. Not all thesis statements, then, are deci-
sive arguments or claims. This is important to remember because, as discussed in chapter 2, many partici-
pants in public debates make the point of arguing without acknowledging the complexity of the problem or
the competing interests of those they need to involve in addressing the problem. Often, productive civic
engagement must begin by weighing trade-offs before advocating a solution.

Box 12.6 A Sample Thesis for Persuasion

   Riley was passionate about the problem of animal
abuse and neglect, and they wanted to give a
speech on how to address this problem in their
local county. They first considered advocating for
changing local law to allow private or government
agencies to more easily intervene when abusive or
neglectful pet owners were identified. But Riley
decided that a legislative route would take too long
to have an effect.

            So Riley decided to write a speech that dis-  Image via Rawpixel, Public Domain.
couraged audience members from putting time into
legal reform but urged them to act in other tangible
ways to improve the lives of local pets.

Riley's Draft Thesis for a Persuasive Speech

Riley's first thesis read,

We should support local animal control agencies that care for abused pets in our county.

            The strengths of this thesis are that it states the solution Riley prefers, it is simple and direct, and it
offers a narrow focus for the action they advocate.

            This thesis does not, however, indicate exactly what Riley means by "support" or how the audience
might make that happen. Presumably, Riley would identify and explain those actions in the speech. Riley
may have liked that the thesis does not give everything away. But there is a risk here. The thesis might not
provide enough information, and consequently, Riley might lose some audience members until they name
specific actions within the speech.

   Riley's Revised Thesis for a Persuasive Speech

   Riley decided to experiment with a more detailed thesis:

   There are several ways to support our local animal control agency's power to remove and care for
abused animals in Montgomery County, but the most important thing you can do for neglected pets is
to increase awareness in our county so more people know what counts as abuse and how to report it.

                                                          Organizing Your Presentation with a Strong Thesis Statement | 145
                   This thesis is more specific than the first thesis because it names the ways audience members can
       support local agencies. They can increase awareness about what counts as animal abuse and how to report
       it. Here, audience members know exactly what Riley means by "support"--unlike before. With this revised
       thesis, the purpose and direction of the speech are very clear.

                   The advantage of this type of thesis is that it prepares the audience to hear Riley's request in a spe-
       cific way; they will probably listen to the entire speech with an ear for why and how they should increase
       awareness of what counts as animal abuse and how to report it.

            A well-crafted thesis identifies your purpose and focuses your and your audience's attention. Though succinct,
a thesis may take you several drafts to clearly articulate. Once you have crafted your thesis statement, you need to
determine the best way to develop and support your thesis for a given audience. It is time to develop your main points,
which the next chapter addresses.

     Summary

        This chapter covered the purpose and goals of organization as well as the foundation of any framework: the
     thesis statement. More specifically, this chapter covered the following:

          When organizing a speech, speakers should strive to build structures that achieve four outcomes: make
             the speech easy to follow, cohere as a presentation, engage the audience's interest, and ensure the
             speech's length meets the expectations of the audience and occasion.

          Though the steps to organizing a speech may appear to be straightforward, the actual process is more
             often recursive; it circles back on itself because speakers revise and alter speech elements as they
             develop their ideas and support.

          Strong thesis statements are critical to any good organization, because they succinctly and directly
             state the argument or central focus of the speech.

13. Organizing Your Main Points

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Organize the main points of a speech.
          Distinguish linear from nonlinear patterns of arrangement.
          Identify several patterns of arrangement for organizing main points.

The previous chapter stressed the importance of speech organization. It also helped you develop a strong thesis state-
ment. As a speaker, what's your next step?

            It's time to develop and organize the body of your speech, guided by your thesis statement. The speech body
is typically the largest or longest part of a presentation. It includes everything except the introduction and conclusion,
which we explore in the next chapter. Here we focus solely on your main points, or the major ideas or claims that com-
pose a speech's body and support the thesis statement. First, we will briefly provide pointers for initially finding possible
main points. Next, we will more thoroughly discuss several patterns of arrangement. Throughout our guidance, we will
reference your audience. In this chapter, the audience refers to your direct audience, who we defined in chapter 10 as
the people who are exposed to and attend to your speech.

Finding Possible Main Points

Look through your research and identify the information and evidence most pertinent to your thesis statement. Begin
grouping that information into one-sentence ideas or claims as best as you can. Then evaluate what you have. How
do they fit together--or what does not fit with the others? What relationships can you identify among these points?
Answering these questions can help you discover your main points. Then you can turn to a pattern of arrangement to
order the material in your speech.

            Alternatively, you might begin with a pattern of arrangement. Use it to help you sift through your research for
the most relevant or useful elements. The pattern can provide guidance and order the material simultaneously. Either
way, you'll find a pattern of arrangement very useful for finding and organizing your main points.

            In the next section, we share two types of patterns of arrangement. We recommend you approach these as
tools for identifying and constructing the type of speech you want to deliver.

Patterns of Arrangement

A pattern of arrangement is a specific guide, or template, for choosing and organizing the main points of a speech. The

148 | Organizing Your Main Points
arrangement helps determine both the content of the main points and their order. As you consider how to arrange your
speech body, spend some time thinking about the type of thesis you are making, the types of supporting materials you
are presenting, and the type of response you are asking of your audience. Knowing what you want your audience to
get out of the speech (or what an assignment asks you to demonstrate) will help you consider how best to arrange your
material.

            Interestingly, each of these patterns is not only reflective of a clear speech structure but also representative of
the most common ways we tend to think about or make sense of our world. We have divided the patterns into those that
follow a linear logic and those that adopt a nonlinear approach.

                                                     By linear, we mean a progression of main points that moves in a "straight
                                         line"--with one step logically leading to the next--all clearly in support of a thesis that is
                                         stated early in the speech. Consequently, linear patterns tend to value explicit statements
                                         of claims and evidence as support for the thesis. By prioritizing such explicit connections,
                                         however, linear patterns can seem unartful or dull, especially when poorly developed or
                                         for audiences more accustomed to nonlinear patterns.

                                                     In contrast, nonlinear refers to an approach that
                                         adopts a more circuitous or indirect route to, or in support
                                         of, a thesis. These approaches may circle around the thesis
through repetitive, but varied, main points, or their connection between the main points
and the thesis may not be immediately obvious. Because nonlinear patterns tend to value
vividness, they are more likely to incorporate stories, examples, and testimony to bring the
central focus to life. The detailed content of these supporting materials may be as impor-
tant as the "point" to be drawn from them. These patterns may build up to a thesis as the
final "a-ha" or culminating moment that pulls all the support together, though they can also
be thesis driven. As a result, nonlinear patterns can be very engaging and moving but can also be difficult to follow for
audiences more accustomed to linear patterns.
            While you might be tempted to see patterns of arrangement as simple organizational devices, recognize that by
using them, you are tapping into human logic and sensemaking at a deeper level. Keep in mind that there is not a single,
correct pattern of arrangement. You may decide on a different organizational structure depending on subject, specific
purpose, thesis, or audience.

Linear Patterns of Arrangement

Categorical Arrangement

A categorical approach uses a "category" of elements--such as parts, forms, functions, methods, characteristics, per-
spectives, or qualities of a topic--as its organizing principle. All the main points belong to that category. For example, a
speaker who wants to convince their classmates to volunteer time toward youth development could identify three types
of local programs they might join: after-school tutoring centers, mentoring programs, and sports teams.

            A word of caution about categorical arrangement: Novice speakers too quickly resort to this pattern of organi-
zation without considering other options more carefully. We suggest you use it as a last resort for two reasons. First, if
not approached with some creativity and imagination, this pattern is less likely to capture and sustain your audience's
interest in your topic. Second, this pattern runs the highest risk of seeming random or disorganized if you do not include
transition words (discussed in chapter 14) that clearly define the category that connects your main points.

                                                                                                                                            Organizing Your Main Points | 149
Chronological Arrangement

A chronological structure uses time as its organizing principle. Thus, a chronological speech often takes a past-pre-
sent-future approach, organizes its main points by historical era, or addresses issues as they unfolded through time.
If you are giving a speech requesting more funding for your community charity, you might persuade your audience to
donate based on a chronological pattern that shows the positive impact your agency has had over time. You might end
by stressing what the agency could do in coming months and years with more support.

Spatial Arrangement

A spatial structure is sequential, moving through a progression of elements. The pattern essentially demonstrates how
we get from point A to point B or what is similar and different as we move from point A to point B. Often overlooked by
speakers, this pattern can be a powerful tool if you want to show, for example, how different regions of the country are
affected by a particular policy or how different sites in a city appeared before and after a historical event.

Cause-Effect Arrangement

In the cause-effect arrangement, a speaker offers two main points:

   "Cause": Describes a source, reason, or existing condition
   "Effect": Identifies or predicts the effects of the cause named in the previous point

            For instance, if you want to increase people's concern about air pollution, you might first establish current pol-
lution levels and then explain their effects on physical health.

            Cause-effect arrangement is a particularly useful approach in showing the relationship between ideas or
actions. For example, you might use this pattern if you wish to show how a local organization has been positively affected
by a grant you seek to renew.

            A word of caution about this pattern: When talking about cause and effect, a speaker needs to avoid oversimpli-
fying a situation. Before you use this pattern, ask yourself whether there are multiple causes that should be considered
to do justice to the problem. Will your credibility and strength of reasoning be undermined if you address only one of
those causes?

Problem-Solution Arrangement

The problem-solution pattern is frequently used in persuasive speeches and proceeds by first documenting the nature,
extent, and source of the problem before advocating a solution. Like the cause-effect arrangement, this type of speech
typically has two main points that are succinctly divided between aspects of the "problem" and the "solution" advocated
by the speaker. Examples might include explaining a particular solution to the deteriorating middle school in your com-
munity or a plan for improving air quality in your city.

150 | Organizing Your Main Points
Problem-Alternatives-Solution Arrangement

An attractive alternative is the problem-alternatives-solution arrangement. This pattern includes a middle main point
that names and counters one or more alternative solutions before advocating for the solution the speaker sees as most
promising. This approach allows the speaker to address popular counterarguments and policies in the alternatives sec-
tion of the speech.

          Box 13.1 Sample Problem-Alternatives-Solution Arrangement
          Recall Riley's speech on animal abuse and welfare in the previous chapter. They ultimately chose the
       problem-alternatives-solution arrangement for their speech. The main points of their presentation include
       the following:
             Problem: Riley established the existence of animal neglect and cruelty in their county and state.
             Alternatives: Riley described a recent initiative to stiffen penalties for pet abuse and argued why

                that initiative was an ineffective solution.
             Solution: Riley advocated for their preferred approach of educating the public about animal abuse

                and how to report it, and they provided ways for the audience to spread the word.

Problem-Cause-Solution-Solvency Arrangement

A second alternative is the problem-cause-solution-solvency pattern. This pattern typically includes four main points:
   Problem: Identify the nature and extent of the problem.
   Cause: Address the source of the problem.
   Solution: Name the solution and emphasize how it directly targets the cause of the problem.
   Solvency: Discuss the practicality, or costs and benefits, of implementing the solution.

          Box 13.2 Sample Problem-Cause-Solution-Solvency Arrangement
          The previous chapter considered a speech that advocated for an on-campus food pantry. If the speaker
       adopted a problem-cause-solution-solvency pattern of arrangement, they could organize their main points
       this way:
             Problem: Establish the prominence of anxiety and depression among college students.
             Cause: Identify food insecurity as a contributing factor to students' anxiety and depression.
             Solution: Offer the solution of an on-campus food pantry.
             Solvency: Suggest where exactly the pantry could be located, identify where funding might come

                from, and cite the many other successful university food banks around the country.

                                                                                                                                            Organizing Your Main Points | 151
Refutative Arrangement

The refutative arrangement, sometimes called the negative method of arrangement, is best suited to a hostile or apa-
thetic audience. That is because it allows the speaker to focus on the counterarguments the audience brings to the
rhetorical occasion before making their appeal. This speech usually consists of three or four main points:

   In the first two to three points, the speaker acknowledges and refutes the strongest opposing arguments or most
      common solutions to the topic at hand. Each opposing argument and refutation constitutes one main point in the
      body of the speech.

   In the final main point, the speaker identifies their preferred solution and argues for its superiority.
            You might use this arrangement when you expect your audience's resistance to your proposal will be strong. For

example, a speech that calls for an investment in downtown recycling bins in a city that has shown little commitment to
recycling might be served well by this pattern of arrangement.

Monroe's Motivated Sequence

Monroe's Motivated Sequence was developed by Alan H. Monroe, a twentieth-century professor of communication. He
based it on the idea that when one feels psychological discomfort, one is motivated to resolve that discomfort through
some sort of action. The speaker who employs this sequence typically follows this pattern of five main points:

   Attention step (introduction): Catch the audience's interest.
   Need step: Convince the audience that something is presently wrong that needs their attention.
   Satisfaction step: Provide the audience with a solution that is within their power to correct the need.
   Visualization step: Let the audience see how the satisfaction step will really change things in the future and/or see

      how bad things will get if they fail to adopt your method of satisfying the need.
   Action step (conclusion): Ask the audience to participate and do something specific to satisfy the need.
Many commercials follow this effective sequence as well as speeches, as box 13.3 demonstrates.

          Box 13.3 Sample Monroe's Motivated Sequence Arrangement

152 | Organizing Your Main Points
   President Franklin Roosevelt's famous "War
Address" is a real-world example largely patterned
on Monroe's Motivated Sequence.1 He delivered it
on December 8, 1941, to a joint session of the US
Congress, just one day after Japanese forces
attacked Pearl Harbor and many other sites. This
speech marked the United States' entrance into
World War II.

 Attention step: FDR's famous opening line

caught listeners' attention as he described

the "infam[ous]" day "America was suddenly

and deliberately attacked by the naval and air

forces of the Empire of Japan."

 Need step: FDR went on to explain that the

Japanese government "deliberately sought to

deceive the United States" by striking while

claiming to be at peace with the US. He then

specified all the locations that Japanese

forces attacked.

 Satisfaction step: FDR built up to stating

how the attack will be met: "We will not only       Franklin D. Roosevelt Delivers 1943 State of the Union Address,
defend ourselves to the uttermost but will          The U.S. National Archives via Picryl, Public Domain.
make it very certain that this form of treach-

ery shall never again endanger us."

 Visualization step: FDR inspired listeners to view the future positively, promising, "We will gain the

inevitable triumph" over Japan "so help us God."

 Action step: FDR ended the speech by asking Congress to "declare" that "a state of war has existed

between the United States and the Japanese Empire" since their December 7 attack.

 Nonlinear Patterns of Arrangement

  Recall that nonlinear patterns of arrangement adopt a more circuitous or indirect route to, or in support of, a thesis.
  They place value on vivid stories, examples, and testimony they offer as evidence as much as on the main points (claims)
  themselves. Next we describe three examples of nonlinear patterns of arrangement: spiral, narrative, and triangle or
  star.

Spiral

   A spiral arrangement utilizes main points that circle around the thesis, building tension and
strength along the way.

   The initial main point identifies an aspect of the speech topic that is mildly concerning.
   A middle main point strengthens the magnitude of the issue.
   The final main point focuses on an element that is deeply alarming or greatly impactful for

      the audience.

            The content of the main points can focus on whatever aspects of the topic the speaker finds useful for their
audience--such as particular elements of the problem, types of stakeholders or victims, or even contexts or scenarios
that illustrate the issue. Typically, the main points should include similar types of content so that their growing intensity
or tension is more readily experienced. An advantage to the spiral pattern is its ability to help the audience increasingly
feel the urgency, importance, or magnitude of the issue.

   Box 13.4 Sample Spiral Arrangement

   A speaker advocating to their employer for a
company-wide four-day workweek might organize
their main points this way:

 Mildly concerning point: High infrastruc-

ture costs of lighting and heating/cooling for

a full five days (compared to four days)

 More worrisome point: The physical and

mental health risks related to a five-day week

(and the benefits and savings provided by

reducing one day)

 Most alarming point: Decreased revenue         Image by Elena Mozhvilo via Unsplash, Unsplash License.
   and higher employee turnover suffered by

companies with a five-day workweek (contrasted with higher revenue and lower turnover for a

reduced workweek)

Narrative

A narrative pattern tells a single detailed story to compel the audience to accept the speaker's thesis; that is, the speaker
uses the story to illustrate the thesis and make it compelling. Consequently, the main points typically draw on a chrono-
logical arrangement by moving audiences through the beginning, middle, and ending moments of the story. The begin-
ning might establish the people, setting, and conflict of the narrative. The middle can emphasize the climax of the story,
and the ending might offer resolution. Each main point offers rich details to establish and draw listeners into that part
of the story.

154 | Organizing Your Main Points
               While the story form naturally lends itself to testimony and examples, statistics can also be incorporated to
   support each main point or story moment. For instance, if the story focuses a main point on the major conflict or prob-
   lem faced in the narrative arc, statistics could be integrated to establish the commonality or impacts of the problem on
   people like those featured in the story.

               A narrative pattern is advantageous because human beings love telling and hearing stories. According to rhetor-
   ical studies scholar Walter Fisher, we use stories to make sense of information and to guide our decision-making.2
   Through a well-told story, a speaker can bring a community problem to life and elicit empathy by helping the audience
   walk in someone else's shoes. Narratives can emotionally move and compel listeners in ways that cold statistics alone
   cannot. In addition, a narrative pattern can flex to suit the speaker's needs. It may alter the audience's beliefs or atti-
   tudes about a problem by focusing the story's attention on the issue, or it may promote a desired policy by offering it as
   the resolution to the story. Narrative patterns can also communicate the speaker's own story or convey the experience
   of another person or group.

               Narrative patterns appear frequently in diverse speaking environments. In some Western religious contexts, for
   instance, speakers share personal testimonies about their spiritual awakenings to encourage similar kinds of discoveries
   or conversion for their listeners. In civic contexts, speakers seeking funding for policies and programs share how previ-
   ous grants helped their clients overcome major obstacles.

             Box 13.5 Sample Narrative Pattern of Arrangement
             Imagine being the director of a community program that helps adults earn their high school equivalency
          diploma. If you hope to persuade the city officials to help fund the program, you might use a narrative
          structure to organize your speech this way:

                Begin the story: Describe a client who dropped out of high school because of childhood trauma
                   and, consequently, could only qualify for low-wage jobs.

                Middle of the story: Explain how, due to generous financial support for your program, the client
                   enrolled for free and pursued their high school equivalency diploma.

                End of the story: Celebrate how the client earned their diploma and now works at a higher-paying
                   job.
                       You could develop each story point with statistics that establish the broader prevalence of chal-

          lenges like those faced by this client, the quality of support offered by your program, and the program's
          track record of success.

 Triangle or Star

   A triangle or star arrangement provides multiple main points--like the corners of a triangle or the tips of a star. The
   main points may appear disparate from each other, but all support the thesis. For instance, one main point may focus
   on a supporting claim that is particularly exciting, engaging, or entertaining for the audience. Another main point might

2. Walter R. Fisher, "Narration as a Human Communication Paradigm: The Case of Public Moral Argument," Communica
   tion Monographs 51 (1984): 1-22.
                                                                                                                                               Organizing Your Main Points | 155
make a controversial supporting claim, while a third main point may forward a proposition the audience likely already
accepts.

            We're calling this a triangle or star only due to the number of main points you need. Many speeches are short
and thus are served well by three main points (a triangle). Some presentations, however, are much longer. You might
think here of delivering a keynote address at a community event or an educational speech for a civic organization. In
these cases, five main points, or the star, may be more useful.

            As with a triangle or star, the ordering of the points is flexible. You can rotate a triangle or (a drawing of a) star
to the left or right without damaging the form. Similarly, a speaker using either can change the order of main points
without damaging the logic of the speech.

            Because of such flexibility, a triangle or star pattern can be easily adapted to different audiences and situa-
tions--even in the moment. These structures also encourage diversity in the content and tone of main points. Support-
ing material can range from deeply serious or even controversial to more lighthearted.

   Box 13.6 Sample Triangle Pattern of Arrangement

   A speaker advocating for their college to widely
adopt open educational (i.e., free) resources (OER)
might support that thesis with the following three
main points (or could add two more points and use
a star pattern):

 Serious point: Establish the increasingly

expensive costs to students of commercial

textbooks.

 Interesting point: Demonstrate the more

vivid formatting, pictures, and even online

interactive features of some OER books.

 Controversial point: Argue that requiring

commercial textbooks exacerbates wealth

inequality.                                          OER Logo by Markus Bsges (leomaria design) fr Wikimedia

Because of the diversity of supporting

material, the thesis plays the satisfying role of anchoring or tying all the main points together--in our exam-

ple, that would be to widely adopt OER materials. The thesis may be articulated in the introduction to help

guide the audience's understanding of the main points' connections, or it can be delayed until the conclu-

sion to provide an "a-ha" moment of the speech's primary claim and goal.

            Boxes 13.7 and 13.8 summarize the patterns of arrangement addressed in this section. They list the primary
strengths of each pattern of arrangement, offers examples of speech topics that could be potential candidates for this
pattern of arrangement, and suggests a possible outline of main points. Ultimately, the pattern of arrangement you
choose, and how you outline its main points, should be determined by your primary arguments and your purpose for
the speech rather than by our charts.

            As you select an arrangement to organize your speech material, think about which one will help you achieve the
desired outcomes of a well-organized speech. More specifically, pick the pattern that will help the audience track your
thinking and logic, making it both easy to follow and coherent. Remember to also consider which pattern may engage
your audience's attention because of the interesting connections it suggests between points. Finally, consider your time
restraints as you determine the number of main points you can reasonably develop and deliver.

Summary

   In this chapter, we focused on a speech's main points and common patterns of arrangement. More specifi-
cally, this chapter covered the following:

     Main points are the major ideas or claims that compose a speech's body and support the thesis state-
        ment.

     Patterns of arrangement can typically be categorized as linear or nonlinear. A linear progression of
        main points moves in a "straight line"--with one step logically leading to the next--all clearly in support of
        a thesis that is stated early in the speech. Examples include categorical, chronological, spatial, cause-
        effect, problem-solution, problem-alternatives-solution, problem-cause-solution-solvency, refutative,
        and Monroe's Motivated Sequence.

     A nonlinear progression of main points adopts a more circuitous or indirect route to, or in support of, a
        thesis. Examples include spiral, narrative, and triangle or star patterns of arrangement.

     Main points can be organized according to several patterns of arrangement. Each pattern has its own
        strengths and is not appropriate for every subject, thesis statement, or audience.

14. Organizing Your Presentation with an
Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Assess the functions of introductions and conclusions.
          Write effective transitions with signposts.

Now that you have developed a strong thesis (chapter 12) and organized your main points (chapter 13), you are ready
to develop the introduction and conclusion and add transitions. You might wonder why this chapter comes now, after
the previous two chapters on organization. Don't speeches usually start with an introduction? Why not begin with that,
then?

            It's hard to introduce something when you don't yet know what you're introducing. You need a working outline
of your thesis and main points before you write your speech's opening, or introduction, and closing, or conclusion. Sim-
ilarly, it's difficult to write transitions--connectors that move listeners from one point to the next--if you have not yet
developed the main points!

            In this chapter, we will begin by identifying the primary functions of introductions and conclusions. We will
then turn to transitions to help you communicate connections between the sections of your speech. Similarly to the
previous two chapters, when we refer in this chapter to the audience, we mean your direct audience: the people who
are exposed to and attend to your speech, based on our explanation in chapter 10.

Effective Introductions and Conclusions

How you begin and end a speech can have an outsized effect on how audiences respond to your speech. On the one
hand, most listeners make an initial decision about how seriously to take your speech or how much attention to give
based on what they hear in the introduction. On the other hand, what you say in the conclusion is what many audiences
will best remember.

            While there is no easy formula, there are principles and tools that can help you craft effective introductions
and conclusions. Of course, because each speech is unique, an approach that is well suited for one speech, audience, or
context may be ill suited for another. It can be useful, then, to have a series of tools in your rhetorical toolbox as you
craft the introduction and conclusion.

                                                                   Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions | 163
The Functions of Introductions

                                A popular internet meme declares, "Apparently it's rude to poke someone in the forehead and
                             say, `Skip Intro' when they start a conversation." The meme, of course, alludes to the option many
                             streaming services provide to skip the introduction of our favorite shows and immediately start an
                             episode.

                                          Reflecting, however, on why shows offer introductions and--perhaps more tellingly--why
                             we sometimes do watch their introductions highlights what a good introduction should accom-
                             plish. Whether for a television show or a speech, most introductions try to accomplish several
functions. That is, they try to provide compelling answers to the questions audiences ask themselves as they decide
whether or not to pay attention:

   get attention ("Does this sound interesting?")
   raise a need ("Will this address my interests or concerns?")
   establish credibility ("Is the person speaking worth listening to?")
   state your thesis or focal point ("What is this about?")
   preview the body of the speech ("What's coming?")

We address each of these functions in turn.

Get Attention

Your audience members have many things on their minds when you address them. As a speaker, you must find a way
to get their attention. To be effective, your method must be appropriate to the occasion, your topic, and the audience.
Avoid starting with "Uh, thanks, for, uh, coming" or "My topic today is..." or even "My name is..." These are too bland.
Instead, have a clear plan for how to grab their attention with your first words. Several specific strategies for attention-
getting introductions appear in box 14.1.

          Box 14.1 Strategies for Getting the Audience's Attention
             Use a quotation from a well-qualified or well-known individual.
             Make a joke--using tasteful and relevant humor, of course.
             Ask a rhetorical question or a series of questions to engage your audience.
             Tell a brief story or anecdote that introduces the topic of your speech in a compelling manner. This

                narrative should be connected to your topic in some way.
             Share your personal experience as it relates to some aspect of your speech.
             Make a brief (possibly ceremonial) reference to the occasion: "Mr. President, members of the board

                of trustees, family and friends of the graduates, and members of the graduating class of 2035..."
             Use a surprising statistic discovered in your research to awaken the audience's curiosity.

164 | Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions
Raise a Need

You are much more likely to hold your audience's attention if you articulate something they are interested in, need, or
are concerned about (broadly defined). You must convince them that they want to listen to your speech because they
will learn something important from it or will benefit from it in some way. Briefly but explicitly state what they will gain,
and make clear how that benefit directly relates to their interests or needs.

Establish Credibility

Assure the audience you are a credible source on the topic. This does not necessarily mean you are the foremost expert
on the topic, but your introduction can give them a sense that you have done your research and know and care about
the issue. You might explain that you studied the topic in a previous class, or you conducted multiple interviews with
several community leaders involved with the issue.

            You can, alternatively, build credibility by making your relationship to, or interest in, the topic clear. If you plan
to address child obesity, for example, you might share that you struggled as a child with health issues from being over-
weight. If you want to advocate to increase salaries for schoolteachers, you might explain that it always bothered you
that your favorite middle school teacher had to work a second job to stay afloat financially. When the audience under-
stands your investment in the issue at hand, they are often more willing to listen to what you have to say.

          Box 14.2 Strategies for Establishing Your Credibility
             State where, and possibly why, you have previously studied or researched this topic.
             Share how this topic relates to a hobby you have.
             Describe some of the research you conducted to prepare for this speech.
             Explain specifically why this topic matters to you.
             Identify your personal connection to the topic or how it relates to a close family member or friend.

State Your Thesis or Focal Point

Most speeches are thesis driven, meaning the thesis "drives" or determines the route the speech will take. As we dis-
cussed in chapter 12, the thesis guides what material stays in the speech and what goes. Consequently, the thesis should
be clearly stated in the introduction. Because it is the most important sentence in the speech, you don't want it to get
lost. Articulate it as its own sentence, using the wording you developed to clearly state your central focus or claim.

            There are exceptions to stating your thesis in the introduction. In what we might call thesis-seeking speeches,
the thesis is reserved for later in the speech. The introduction and main points build up to (or "seek") the thesis, which
comes toward the end. We discussed patterns of arrangement in the previous chapters. Some patterns that are more
likely to adopt a thesis-seeking approach include the refutative pattern of arrangement, some uses of Monroe's Moti-
vated Sequence, and several of the nonlinear patterns.

                                                                   Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions | 165
Preview the Body of the Speech

A preview statement elaborates on your thesis by announcing the main points of your speech in the order you will
develop them as the speech progresses. It is a clear indication of how, exactly, the speech will proceed. In many ways, it
tells the audience what to listen for.

          Box 14.3 Sample Preview Statement
          In the previous two chapters, we discussed Riley's speech about animal welfare. Here we return to that
       speech for a sample preview statement.

             Riley's thesis statement: There are several ways to strengthen our local animal control agency's power
          to remove and care for abused animals in Montgomery County, but the most important thing you can do
          is to increase awareness in our county so more people know what counts as abuse and how to report it.

             Riley's preview statement: In my speech, I will first establish the problem of animal neglect and cruelty
          in our county and state. Next, I will examine a frequently proposed solution and tell you why it will not
          make an immediate difference in the lives of our animal friends. Then I will advocate my preferred
          approach of educating the public about animal abuse, and I'll tell you specific ways you can help spread
          the word.

            The preview statement should allow audience members to anticipate the progression of your speech. When
they know where you are going, they begin to listen for how your main points build on each other instead of struggling
to determine your train of thought.

The Functions of Conclusions

                              Conclusions, like introductions, play an important role in your speech because they tend to be
                           what audiences remember. Consequently, conclusions share many characteristics with introduc-
                           tions; however, they tend to be shorter.

                                       There are three primary functions of conclusions. They should

                        summarize your main points
   restate your thesis or focal point
   end decisively

Again, we look more closely at each of these functions.

Summarize Your Main Points

Your audience hears your speech only once, but with the benefit of a summary, they hear your main points three times:
first in the introduction's preview, then in the body itself, and here again in the conclusion's summary. This repetition

166 | Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions
increases the possibility that they will remember your message. Active listening requires an audience's ongoing effort.
The final summary makes that task a little easier.

            What do we mean by "summarize"?

DO                                                                              Do NOT

Simply rename or restate each main point.                                       Do not reexplain each main point.

Express the summary in a single sentence.                                       Do not offer any new support.

"Today I explained A, B, C, and D."
   "I have described how W is largely caused by X, but Y can help if we do Z."

            The simple renaming briefly reminds your audience of what you said. Also, if someone was distracted during
part of your speech, the restatement of your points enables them to review the argument's progression.

Restate Your Thesis or Focal Point

Because your thesis statement captures the main point of the entire speech concisely and compellingly, state it again in
the conclusion. Do so even if you adopt a "thesis-seeking" pattern that holds off on stating your thesis until a main point
later in the speech's body. The thesis is still your central claim or focus. Restating it in the conclusion reinforces your
thesis before you finish speaking.

End Decisively

Conclusions should also be decisive. They should make clear that you are at the end of your presentation.

   Avoid ending by simply saying "thank you" or "thank you for your time." That is gracious but not terribly interesting
      or decisive.

   Instead, try crafting a unique ending to the speech that is decisive enough that audiences automatically know to
      begin their applause without needing to hear you say "thank you" or "that's it." Use the strategies named in box 14.4
      for ideas.

            You might think of the conclusion's decisive ending in relation to your introduction's attention-getter--like
"bookends" for your speech. Consider how your decisive ending might return to your attention-getting device in some
way.

    Box 14.4 Strategies for Ending a Speech Decisively

      Briefly share the implications of your presentation.
      If you opened your speech with a quotation, perhaps restate it or end with another arresting quota-

                                           Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions | 167
                tion.
             If you began your speech with a story, consider returning to and finishing that story.
             Offer inspiring last words that relate to your speech topic and thesis.

            Now that you see what your introduction and conclusion can accomplish, add transitions to aid the speech's
clarity and movement.

Clear Transitions

Listening to a speech is unlike reading text. When you read an article or book, you can always go back a few paragraphs
if you find your attention wandering, if you are interrupted by a text message, or if you did not catch the relationship
between ideas the first time through. We do not have this luxury when listening to a speech. We hear the words only
once, and if we miss something, we cannot go back and hear it again.

          Box 14.5 Speech Transitions Are like GPS Navigation
          Think about the way a GPS operates. As the com-
       puterized voice gives you driving directions, it says
       something like "In two miles, take a left onto Park
       Place" or "Continue 4.6 miles to exit 14 for Roosevelt
       Street." Then as you get closer to your exit or turn,
       you might get a reminder: "In half a mile, turn left
       onto..." If the GPS were to wait until you were at the
       exit and then say, "Get off here!" you would likely
       miss the exit. You were not prepared for the change
       in direction.

                   The same concept applies to public speak-
       ing. Transitions supply the verbal hints or signals
       that your speech is going to take a turn toward a
       new claim or emphasis.

            When you understand how easily listeners can GPS by Pixabay via Stockvault, Public Domain.
get lost during your speech, you also understand how to
help them: Include transitions. Recall we defined transitions as connectors that move listeners from one point to the
next. They help audiences navigate your presentation, often summarizing a main point they just heard or providing a
clue of where they are going next on their journey. Indeed, transitions typically consist of two elements. First, transitions
offer a brief internal summary of what was just said. Second, transitions offer a brief preview of what you will address
next.

168 | Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions
Box 14.6 Sample Transitions

   Let's return once again to Riley's speech about animal welfare. During their speech, Riley established the
problem of animal abuse and neglect. They then explained why legal reform was not the best approach to
helping pets in their county. At that point, Riley was ready to introduce their solution.

       To signal that shift, Riley added the following transition. It consisted of two parts.

Mini Summary of the Previous Point

"I have just critiqued a popular solution for decreasing animal abuse in Montgomery County."

Mini Preview of the Next Point

"Next, I will turn to my preferred approach."

       Riley stated the summary and preview together, as a single transition. They then shared their solu-

tion.

            We often use cuing language, called signposts, to
alert audiences to a transition. In Riley's example in box
14.6, words like "just" ("I have just critiqued") and "next"
("Next, I will turn to") notify listeners of what just hap-
pened and what's about to be focused on. Such cuing lan-
guage functions like actual signposts on the road that
indicate where you are within a larger environment. Box
14.7 provides additional examples of transitions with sign-
posting language.

   Box 14.7 Strategies for Writing Transitions and             Image by Charles Parker via Pexels, Pexels License.
Signposts

 Try numerical sequencing: First..., Second..., Third..., In conclusion..., or Next..., In addition...
 Stress relationships between elements: Just as we have...so we also have..., To the left...and to the

   right...
 Summarize what you have covered: In short..., To summarize..., To clarify..., That is..., Keep in

   mind..., Before I move on to the next point, take note of...
 Ask a rhetorical question: "You may ask, `What does this have to do with me?'" "You may wonder

   what caused this situation in which we find ourselves," or "How do we work through these conflicts?"

            When it comes to connectives like transitions and signposts, the bottom line is that your audience will thank
you for using them. They give your listeners handles to grab onto as they travel through your speech with you.

            Now that you have examined the goals of organization and the various elements of planning and arranging a
speech, in the next chapter we turn to the concrete principles of composing an outline.

                                                                   Organizing Your Presentation with an Introduction, Conclusion, and Transitions | 169
     Summary

        This chapter addressed the functions of introductions and conclusions and the importance of clear transi-
     tions. More specifically, this chapter established the following:

          Introductions and conclusions play critical roles in conveying your most important ideas and engaging
             listeners.

          An introduction should fulfill the following functions: get attention, raise a need, establish credibility,
             state your thesis or focal point, and preview the body of the speech.

          The conclusion should summarize your main points, restate your thesis or focal point, and end deci-
             sively.

          Transitions with signposts improve the flow of a speech and, just as importantly, help audience mem-
             bers navigate material they hear.

     Key Terms

15. Writing a Preparation Outline

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Identify the benefits of outlining.
          Employ the principles of outlining to visualize arguments and clarify thinking.
          Construct a preparation outline.

In the previous three chapters, we discussed the importance of organizing your speech. We also named elements to
include in your speech, such as an introduction, main points, and a conclusion. You may be wondering, "How will I know
if I've included everything I need?" or "How can I see if my points make sense together?"

            This chapter answers these questions by exploring the basics of outlining. An outline is a sketch or condensed
version of your speech. We will focus on the preparation outline, which is the draft you write as you plan and organize
your speech. It includes all your arguments, support, transitions, and citations. It helps you know if your points cohere
together and if there are any gaps. Much of the hard but rewarding work of speech writing occurs while constructing
and revising the preparation outline.

            We begin by considering the importance of outlining for you and your audience. When we refer to the audience
in this chapter, we mean your direct audience, who we described in chapter 10 as the people who are exposed to and
attend to your speech. Next we establish the principles to follow when crafting a Roman numeral outline. We conclude
by explaining what to include in a preparation outline. For your reference, Appendix A and Appendix B offer full models
of preparation speech outlines: one for an informative speech and one for a persuasive speech.

The Importance of Outlining

                                     You may be tempted to avoid outlining and instead write your speech in free form or as an
                                     essay. We urge you to reconsider. Writing a well-crafted outline offers at least three benefits
                                     for speakers and audiences: It makes your speech more compelling, helps you identify and
                                     improve problems, and aids your memory of your speech.

                                                 First, a preparation outline helps you arrange your ideas and supporting evidence in
                                     the most compelling manner. When you write a speech in free form, you can quickly lose your
                                     way and very quickly lose your audience too. Drafting your speech as an outline helps you
                                     focus on your thesis and visualize the linear or nonlinear arrangement you've chosen to sup-
port the thesis.
            Second, the preparation outline helps you diagnose and address potential problem areas in your speech. The out-
line form allows you to locate points of repetition, gaps in reasoning, or extraneous information. You can more quickly
determine if your main points are well balanced and if you have remembered to include an introduction and conclusion.
            Finally, a preparation outline provides a visual representation of the speech, which helps you learn the speech.

172 | Writing a Preparation Outline
  You can easily see your main points, so they become more memorable to you. You can also observe how transitions help
  you move from one point to another and how the introduction and conclusion open and close the speech.

              Time spent constructing, arranging, and revising your speech outline now can reward you later, when audience
  members join your cause and have a clear sense of how to proceed. Outlining is the work you do to learn your speech,
  to know it well, and to communicate that deep knowledge to your audience. If you put the time in, it will show.

             The presidential speechwriter Peggy Noonan said of speech preparation, "If you find yourself doing draft
          after draft, this is good. As you write and rewrite you are unconsciously absorbing, picking up your own
          rhythm and phrasing. This will show itself in a greater ease, a greater engagement when you stand up and
          give the speech. People will know that you know your text."1

              There are several specific guidelines that will help you write your preparation outline. Many instructors have
  strict requirements about how preparation outlines should look and what elements should be included, so be certain to
  check with your professor about their preferred format before you turn in your document. In the following section, we
  recommend general principles to follow when outlining.

 The Principles of Outlining

  The outlining system we present here is widely employed in public speaking courses, because it
  provides a visual representation of the structure of your speech. This visuality helps you see the
  relationship among your ideas, making the structure easier to develop and revise. Consequently,
  the principles are useful both for speeches that adopt a linear pattern of arrangement and for
  those that employ nonlinear patterns as discussed in chapter 13. Some instructors, however, may
  allow you to submit an outline that more visually matches a nonlinear pattern (i.e., appears as a
  star or as a spiral).

 Consistent Indentation and Symbolization

  Make sure your outline is structured with a consistent pattern of symbols and indentations. Adopt a pattern of symbols
  that helps you visually differentiate main points from subpoints and quickly count the number of each. Avoid bullet points
  because they make these tasks much harder. Instead, main points should be identified by increasing Roman numer-
  als, subpoints by sequential capital letters, and sub-subpoints by rising Arabic numerals. In addition, adopt a pattern of
  indentations to further distinguish types of points. Each Roman numeral should be flush left, each subpoint should be
  indented once, and sub-subpoints should be indented twice, as box 15.1 makes clear.

  Books, 1988), 24.
                                                                                                                                             Writing a Preparation Outline | 173
          Box 15.1 Sample Indentation and Symbolization
          Notice how each point uses sequential symbols (I, A, 1) and spacing (indentation or lack thereof).

                    I. First main point
                              A. First subpoint
                              B. Second subpoint

                    II. Second main point
                              A. First subpoint
                                         1. First sub-subpoint
                                         2. Second sub-subpoint
                              B. Second subpoint

                    III. Third main point and so on...

            Indentation and symbolization help you see the flow of your speech and the relationship among your ideas. You
can quickly observe, for instance, what your three main points are. You might discover an idea is not really a main point
and functions better as additional support for a main point. This visual relationship among ideas is built on the principle
of subordination.

Subordination

Subordination is the practice of making material that is less important, or primarily supportive, secondary to more cen-
tral ideas and claims. Material in your outline should descend in order of importance. That is, supporting ideas or evi-
dence should be listed under main points and indented.

            Noting subordination is much different than writing an essay where subpoints are typically written with the
claim they support as a single paragraph. Typically, paragraphs should be avoided when outlining. The subpoints instead
should be visually subordinated.

          Box 15.2 Sample Subordination
          As Javon worked on his deliberation speech, he wanted to list the "benefits" and "drawbacks" of each
       potential solution or approach to the problem of concussions. These points he labeled "B" (benefits) and "C"
       (drawbacks). Underneath each of these points, and indented, he gave more detail about what the benefits
       and what the drawbacks were. This portion of his outline read as follows:

                    B. This approach foregrounds two benefits.
                              1. It tries to address the unhealthy aspects of hypermasculinity within football culture, like

174 | Writing a Preparation Outline
                           ignoring pain and ignoring the recovery protocols that may slow the chances of repeated
                           concussion.

                              2. The education extends beyond players and coaches to include parents, fans, and commu-
                           nity members who often perpetuate attitudes that celebrate players for sacrificing their bod-
                           ies for the game.
                    C. But there are also drawbacks to this approach.
                   Here we see that points 1 and 2 are each listed under the claim "This approach foregrounds two
       benefits." That's because the individual examples of benefits (1 and 2) are subordinate to and support the
       claim that benefits exist (A). The drawbacks will similarly follow as points 1 and 2 under C.

Subordination is closely related to the next principle of outlining: coordination.

Coordination

Coordination is a visual representation of the proper relationship between ideas. It is related to subordination because
it stresses that ideas of similar importance should be on the same level of the outline.

                   Box 15.3 Sample Coordination
                    Here is an example from Riley's speech, discussing how members of the community can help
                 spread awareness about animal abuse:

                              1. Use social media to broadcast pet news in our county.
                                               a. Spread news about pet abuse and neglect to broaden awareness of this issue.
                                               b. Spread news about current laws protecting animals.
                                               c. Publicize agencies and phone numbers residents can call if they witness

                                            abuse or neglect.
                                               d. Follow the Montgomery County Humane Society on Instagram and "like"

                                            them on Facebook.
                               Here we see coordination in that the four ways for community members to volun-
                   teer at the local animal shelter are listed on the same level of the outline: Each has a lower-
                   case letter, each refers to subpoint 1, and each has identical indentation.

            After you have sketched the subordination and coordination in your outline, you can turn to another important
outlining principle: parallelism.

                                                                                                                                           Writing a Preparation Outline | 175
Parallelism

The parallelism principle dictates that you balance your points and subpoints as you divide them. Just as you cannot
balance two ends of a scale with only one object, each level of your outline needs at least two points to be in balance or
to justify the subdivision.

            To explain this concept another way, we often say when it comes to outlining, "every little one has a little two."
In other words, there must be at least two relevant and worthy subordinate ideas to make the subdivision; otherwise, the
division is not warranted.

                   Box 15.4 Sample Parallelism
                    Parallelism can best be illustrated through contrasting examples. Notice how the first example vio
                 lates the principle of parallelism twice. Both subpoint A and sub-subpoint 1 lack a pair for balance.
                 The second example provides such balance by adding subpoint B (to balance A) and sub-subpoint 2
                 (to balance 1).

                                                         Balance

                                                                                            The final principle of outlining is balance. Balance in
                                                                                            speech outlining dictates each main idea receives
                                                                                            roughly the same amount of time and attention in the
                                                                                            speech. If the first main point of your speech lasts
                                                                                            three minutes, the second main point lasts thirty-
                                                                                            seven seconds, and the final main point is four min-
                                                                                            utes, then the audience suspects that your second
                                                                                            "main" point really isn't that important. An outline
                                                                                            helps you visually detect such situations, because you
                                                                                            can see how much or how little support you have
                                                                                            included for each main point. If you find yourself with
                                                                                            unbalanced points, consider adding or subtracting
material to balance them.
            Now that we have explained the guiding principles that will help you construct a coherent outline, we turn to
the specific tasks of writing the preparation outline.

Constructing the Preparation Outline

As we said, the preparation outline is designed to help you think through and develop your speech. In a public speaking

176 | Writing a Preparation Outline
course, it is generally the version of a speech that you submit to your instructor, perhaps to receive feedback before you
deliver the speech. Your preparation outline will be too detailed to serve as the notes you use to deliver your final speech,
but writing a preparation outline is essential to the thinking and planning process. Unless your professor tells you oth-
erwise, preparation outlines should include the following elements.

State Your Specific Purpose

The purpose statement is related to, but not the same as, your thesis statement. Another way to think of the purpose
statement is as the overarching goal or objective for your speech. Since you are using this textbook, your purpose will
likely be either informative or persuasive, so the verb you choose should reflect the goal ("explain" or "inform" versus
"advocate" or "persuade"). Clearly label your purpose statement at the top of your outline. Here is Riley's purpose state-
ment.

            Purpose statement: To urge audience members to become animal welfare educators in our county.
            You will not state the purpose statement to your audience, but knowing and succinctly stating your purpose
can help you write a good speech. If you do not know what you want your speech to accomplish, there is a good chance
the rest of your speech will betray that lack of purpose.

Label Key Components of the Speech: Introduction, Conclusion, Thesis, Transitions

                                                         Visually highlight key components of the speech by

                                                         labeling them in the outline. This helps you easily find

                                                         them and better ensures they will fulfill their roles. The

                                                         key components include the introduction and conclusion

                                                         as well as the thesis and transitions.

                                                         First, clearly label the "Introduction" and "Con-

                                                         clusion" by writing those words with the Roman numeral

                                                         assigned to each. Do not add any other information to the

                                                         Roman numeral. Instead, the content of these points

                                                         should appear below the Roman numeral and be indented

                                                         to show subordination.

                                                         Second, label your "thesis" with that word when-

Image by Pixaline via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.  ever it appears in the outline. We discussed the charac-
                                                         teristics of strong thesis statements at length in chapter

12. In your outline, labeling your thesis clearly will help you (and your professor) diagnose whether your central idea is

well developed and is fully supported by the main points and subpoints.

The thesis's location may depend on whether your speech is thesis driven or thesis seeking as we distinguished

in chapter 14. If your speech is thesis driven, meaning the thesis "drives" or determines the route the speech will take,

then the thesis will likely appear within both the introduction and conclusion (and should be labeled in each). If your

speech is thesis seeking, meaning the introduction and main points build up to or "seek" a thesis, it is likely to appear

only within the last main point and/or conclusion.

                                                                                 Writing a Preparation Outline | 177
          Box 15.5 Sample Labeling of the Introduction and Thesis in a Preparation Outline
          Here is the introduction to Riley's speech on animal welfare. Notice that only the label "Introduction"
       appears with Roman numeral I. The same would be true for the Conclusion, but with a different Roman
       numeral. Also notice that the thesis is noted as such, since it is a major speech component.
          I. Introduction

                    A. In 2020, the Netflix documentary series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness aired and
                 became widely popular.

                    B. Many of you may have heard of or even watched Tiger King, or you may have laughed at paro-
                 dies and memes of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin. But how many of us focused on the animals who
                 were treated cruelly?

                    C. Today I want to talk about this issue that is of great importance to me and I know to many of
                 you as well. I'm an animal lover, and I became aware of pet abuse in our county through my volunteer
                 work at the animal shelter. I was saddened by the Tiger King story and was motivated to do some-
                 thing locally.

                    D. (Thesis) There are several ways to support our local animal control agency's power to remove
                 and care for abused animals in Montgomery County, but the most important thing you can do is to
                 increase awareness in our county so more people know what counts as abuse and how to report it.

                    E. In my speech, I will first establish the problem of animal neglect and cruelty in our county and
                 state. Next, I will examine a frequently proposed solution and tell you why it will not make an imme-
                 diate difference in the lives of our animal friends. Then I will advocate my preferred approach of
                 educating the public about animal abuse, and I'll tell you specific ways you can help spread the word.

            Third, label each "transition" between main points by using that word. Transitions are crucial to how an audi-
ence makes sense of and follows your speech as you progress. Labeling your transitions in a preparation outline ensures
that you include them and can find them easily. It also helps you evaluate the connections between main points and the
flow of your reasoning.

                   Box 15.6 Sample Labeling of Transitions in a Preparation Outline
                    Within their speech, Riley included this transition to shift from the problem to an alternative solu-
                 tion:

                         * (Transition) Having addressed the problem of animal cruelty in our county and
                         state, I will now turn to a potential solution to this problem.

                               Notice that "Transition" is explicitly labeled to draw attention to its presence and
                   function.

178 | Writing a Preparation Outline
Write Main Points, Subpoints, and Transitions in Complete Sentences

Except for the introduction and conclusion, which begin with only their labels, you should write every main point, sub-
point, and transition as a full sentence. This is only true for the preparation outline because it helps you plan and orga-
nize your speech. Writing full sentences at this stage is a way to discipline yourself to complete your thought and fully
prepare what you will say in your speech. Later, after you have developed your preparation outline and are ready to
create speaking notes, you can remove full sentences and use keywords and phrases instead. We provide guidance on
preparing speaking notes in chapter 19.

Include Spoken and Written Citations

                           As we explained in chapter 9, providing full citations for all your sources is a sign of ethical and
                           responsible speech writing. That starts with the preparation outline. Include spoken citations--the
                           source citations you plan to vocalize during the speech--in the outline itself. Add them wherever you
                           plan to orally cite a source. Refer to chapter 9 for the specific information to cite each time.

                                       In addition, include written citations within your preparation outline
                           and at the end of this outline. Within the outline, add a written citation when-
ever you orally cite or draw information from a source. Each such written citation will likely appear
similar to an in-text citation you might add to an essay. At the end of your preparation outline, on a
separate last page, include a bibliography (or it might be called Works Cited or References). Be sure
to check with your instructor about their preferred style guide (Modern Language Association,
American Psychological Association, etc.).
            Now that we have explained each element of the preparation outline, we encourage you to look at two full sam-
ple preparation outlines in Appendix A and Appendix B. One speech's purpose is to inform an audience about the mul-
tiple approaches to a shared problem as they prepare to deliberate together. This type of speech is one you will learn
more about in chapter 20. The other speech's purpose is to persuasively advocate a particular solution to a problem (like
you will learn more about in chapter 24).

     Summary

        This chapter stressed the importance of outlining and described general outlining principles that best pro-
     duce a visual depiction of your organizational structure. It also explained the usefulness of a preparation out-
     line and how best to construct one for your speech.

          Outlines have at least three benefits for you as the speaker: They help you arrange ideas in the best
             order for your purpose. They allow you to see where potential problems in evidence or logic emerge.
             They also help you learn the speech.

          Outlines should be written by following the principles of consistent symbolization and indentation,
             subordination, coordination, parallelism, and balance.

          Preparation outlines are full sketches of your speech, with ideas written in complete sentences to
             ensure complete thoughts. They label important elements such as the introduction and conclusion as

                                                                                                                                          Writing a Preparation Outline | 179
             well as the thesis and transitions. They follow outlining principles and include both spoken and written
             citations.

16. Using Style to Harness the Power of Language

Chapter Objectives

Students will:

  Assess a speech's style for how well it meets four core goals.
  Identify and distinguish common stylistic devices.
  Employ stylistic devices in a presentation.

                                                               If you live in the United States and speak English, do you

                                                               use the word "pop," "soda," or "coke" to refer to a sweet-

                                                               wear: sneakers or tennis shoes? When you want to get

                                                               others' attention, do you say "you guys" or "y'all"?

                                                                   These are just a few of the questions linguists

                                                               country in the early 2000s. Graphic artist Josh Katz

Many Cans of Soda by Freerange Public Domain Archives, Public  probably reflects the words you heard where you grew
Domain.                                                        up.

                                                                   Of course, geographic region is just one of many

factors that influence our word choice. Family upbringing, education, race, socioeconomic status, and age play roles too.

Have you ever used popular slang terms with older adults, and they scratched their heads in confusion? If so, you know

age contributes to language. What teenagers found "boss" in the 1960s, they called "rad" in the 1980s, "sweet" in the early

2000s, and "sigma" in the 2020s. That is, each generation develops its own style.

As defined in chapter 1, style is the language or expression we use--the words we

choose. Style can significantly influence a message's reception. To be an effective speaker, you

must adopt a speaking style that suits your audience and purpose.

In what follows, we discuss four goals for style in public speaking. We then explore a

few of the most helpful stylistic devices speakers can use to fulfill those goals.

 The Goals of Style in Presentations

   In everyday life, we often use style to mean how someone uniquely expresses themselves. Stylish people dress or walk in
   ways that exude sophistication, swag, or pizzazz. The same holds true for style in public speaking. A speaker who devel-
   ops their personal speaking style is more likely to grab and hold their audience's attention.

               However, style can and should accomplish much more in public speaking. In this section, we discuss four
   desired outcomes of style: to create clarity, to maintain audience attention, to construct an appropriate mood or emo-
   tional state, and to generate a perspective on a topic for the audience. When we refer to the audience in this section, we
   are talking about your direct audience (unless we indicate otherwise). In chapter 10, we defined the direct audience as
   the people who are exposed to and attend to your speech.

 Clarity

   Aristotle claimed that making ideas clear to the listener was the proper goal and result of all stylistic choices.2 If a speech
   is composed primarily of technical terms, puzzling language, or unfamiliar words, audience members will not under-
   stand nor act upon the information presented. They will also not likely listen for very long.

 Attention

   Our language should capture and hold the attention of audience members. You have probably experienced boring or
   dry speakers. To be sure, this can be a product of delivery, but it is also an element of style. A speaker must create
   interesting, engaging images in our minds through words, such as by sharing vivid anecdotes, statistics, quotations, and
   rhetorical questions.

 Emotion

   Stylistic choices also help shape the emotional element of communication. Language can encourage listeners to over-
   come apathy by creating a feeling of intensity. Style also has the power to bring us together by emphasizing communal
   values and using inclusive words and phrases. Such feelings of unity can increase the persuasiveness of the message.
   Consequently, speakers must be ethical and reflective about the creation and use of such emotional bonds.

 Perspective Creation

   Finally, word selection has incredible power. Language shapes perspectives on the world--an idea we have alluded to in
   previous chapters.

   182 | Using Style to Harness the Power of Language
            Most of what we know we've learned through words rather than firsthand experience. For example, many peo-
ple know a good bit about the country of China, including specific features of the topography such as the Yangtze River
and the Great Wall, the population size, and its dramatic economic development over the last several decades. However,
relatively few have traveled to China and seen any of this firsthand.

            Words even influence how we perceive and react to things we do experience firsthand. For example, students
sometimes describe their college education like a product they are purchasing from a business: "I need to get my
money's worth." "The cost of time and money will pay off for me after graduation." This metaphor turns students into
customers and professors into service providers. Their relationship becomes purely transactional (an exchange of goods
for payment) instead of potentially transformational to achieve a shared vision.

            The words you choose to label or characterize your topic invite your audience to adopt a perspective on that
issue. That means you must be especially thoughtful when talking about groups who are not part of your direct audience
(and/or who will be impacted by your message). In chapter 10, we labeled these groups your implied and implicated
audiences. The words you choose to describe them will shape your and your direct audience's perspectives about them.

            Style, then, is critical to forming your community's attitudes, thinking, and even desire to act. Read box 16.1 for
an example of how word choices shape your and your direct audience's perspectives and actions.

Box 16.1 Word Choices Shape Perspectives and Actions
Imagine a drunk man sleeping in public.

 A court judge walks by, sees this publicly
   intoxicated man, and thinks, "Criminal."

 A priest walks by, sees the same man, and
   thinks, "Sinner."

 A medical doctor passes by next and thinks,
   "Sufferer."

 A business owner walks by and thinks,
   "Loafer."

          Four different words are used to label the

same person in the same situation, and each of

these words is likely accompanied by a whole          Image by Laurent Fintonivia Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA.
vocabulary. For example, along with "sinner," the

priest might use words like "repentance," "forgiveness," "God," "weakness," "spirit," and "flesh." The doctor, on

the other hand, might adopt words like "blood alcohol level," "addiction," "healing," "patient," and "with-

drawal."

            Each label--and the vocabularies that accompany them--evokes a different set of attitudes and
likely encourages a different set of actions toward the man.

 The judge might fine or even incarcerate the man.
 The priest might attempt to bring the man to repentance to experience forgiveness and spiritual

   renewal.
 The doctor may medically examine him to help him physically recover.
 The business owner may simply walk past the man, determined to not hire him.

                   This example demonstrates the power of language to create each person's perspective about, and
       (in)action toward, another person or group.

            In sum, when chosen thoughtfully, your language choices should clarify your ideas, capture your audience's
attention, appeal to their emotions, and encourage them to adopt perspectives that facilitate community problem-solv-
ing. The next section examines specific devices you can use to help fulfill these goals.

          Box 16.2 Tips for Meeting the Goals of Style
          As you develop your speech, use this set of questions to reflect on and possibly revise your language
       choices. Doing so will help ensure your style fulfills the four core goals of style.
             Clarify the speaker's ideas: Are all or most of the words you plan to say familiar to your audience? If

                not, will you supply clear definitions for words new to them? If you are using technical language, is it
                appropriate for your audience? If not, can you restate the ideas in more common language? How
                might you express your ideas in creative or imaginative ways that might better help the audience
                understand them?
             Maintain the audience's attention: How well will your words themselves intrigue the audience? Can
                you communicate your ideas in interesting or engaging ways? How might language help the audience
                envision the problem or its solution?
             Evoke emotion: What words or phrases might help your audience feel strongly about the issue you
                will address? What forms of expression might move them to action? How might you adopt language to
                unify the audience in response?
             Create perspective: How might your labels and word choices shape the audience's perceptions of
                the issue and the people affected? What vocabulary do you plan to employ, and what aspects of the
                issue does it highlight? Obscure? Which alternative labels and vocabularies could you use instead, and
                how might they shape the audience's perceptions differently?

Stylistic Devices

Stylistic devices are language techniques and literary tools effective speakers use to present their ideas to their audi-
ence. These devices help fulfill the four goals previously covered by creating a sense of rhythm, providing visualization,
enhancing argumentation, and developing a sense of community.

184 | Using Style to Harness the Power of Language
Rhythm

        One effective function of stylistic language is to create a sense of rhythm in a speech. Rhythm
        helps maintain the audience's attention because it creates a familiar and inviting pattern or
        cadence. Rhythmic language also heightens the audience's emotions. There are several devices
        that develop rhythm, but here we briefly comment on four: parallelism, repetition, antithesis, and
        alliteration.

Parallelism

Parallelism is a series of ideas that is conveyed through language choices in a similar way. This can occur in a single
sentence or across successive sentences. When he took the first steps on the moon, for example, astronaut Neil Arm-
strong famously said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." His repeated use of "one" followed by
two words illustrated parallelism.

Box 16.3 Parallelism in Practice

                                                     An example of parallelism occurred in 2024 during a
                                                  campaign speech by former South Carolina Governor and
                                                  US Ambassador Nikki Haley when she ran for the Republi-
                                                  can presidential nomination. About halfway through her
                                                  speech, Haley shifted to the topic of national security:
                                                  "Now let's talk about national security. The world is on fire
                                                  literally. You've got a war in Europe. You've got a war in the
                                                  Middle East. You've got North Korea testing intercontinen-
                                                  tal ballistic missiles capable of hitting the US. You've got
                                                  China on the march. But make no mistake, none of that
                                                  would've happened had we not had that debacle in
                                                  Afghanistan."3

                                                  The four parallel phrases (each beginning with

                                                  "you've got") amplified anxiety about the country's vulnera-

                                                  country needs better leadership. Her final sentence bluntly

ended the rhythm by blaming President Joe Biden for the calamities when she referenced his decision to

withdraw US troops from Afghanistan in 2021.

Repetition

When using repetition, a speaker restates a word, sentence, idea, or theme. Repetition can emphasize a point and
improve its retention. We often hear political leaders, for example, sprinkle a repeated phrase throughout their com-
ments or even just within a sentence or paragraph.

Box 16.4 Repetition in Practice

In August 2020, civil rights protesters organized a

March on Washington in response to George Floyd

and other Black Americans who died at the hands of

police officers. During the event, Reverend Al

Sharpton addressed the crowd from the same spot

where Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in 1963 during

the original March on Washington. At one point,

Sharpton repeated a word to advocate for racial

justice and police reform: "They keep telling me

about how it's a shame that Black parents have to

have `the conversation' with our children, how we

have to explain if a cop stops you, don't reach for  Reverend Al Sharpton by Lorie Shaull via Wikimedia

versation. Well, we've had the conversation for

decades. It's time we have a conversation with America. We need to have a conversation about your racism,

about your bigotry, about your hate, about how you would put your knee on our neck while we cry for our
lives. We need a new conversation."4

            Sharpton's repeated use of "conversation" cleverly shifted responsibility from Black parents to the
broader country for keeping Black children safe during police interactions. It also created a sense of
urgency for reform and built a connection with the audience through shared frustrations.

 Antithesis

   Antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, typically in the same sentence. For example, in his inaugural address,
   former President John F. Kennedy famously stated, "Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do
   for your country."5 The contrasting commands ("Ask not" and "ask") and the flipped positioning of words ("country" and
   "you") are catchy to the ear and invite the audience to rethink a familiar idea.

                                      Civil rights activist and Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X delivered a
                                   famous speech, "The Ballot or the Bullet," in 1964. He used a powerful
                                   antithesis wherein he contrasted a hopeful and patriotic sense of America
                                   (and identifying as American) with a cruel and exploitative characterization
                                   of the country: "No, I'm not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black
                                   people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black
                                   people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy.

                                   flag-saluter, or a flag-waver--no, not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this
                                   American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't
                                   see any American dream; I see an American nightmare."6

Malcom X, Library of Congress via              The contrasting views of America climaxed in the last sentence
Picryl, Public Domain.             with the direct antithesis between the dream and nightmare. The "Ameri-
                                   can dream" was no doubt familiar to his audience, but the "American night-
                                   mare," he argued, was his and other African Americans' experience. His use
                                   of antithesis highlighted the difference between white and Black Ameri-
                                   cans' lives, bringing sharp clarity and emotional intensity to the distinction.

Alliteration

Alliteration is the repetition of a single consonant in a sentence or series of sentences. It's prominent in tongue twisters
such as "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers." Alliteration is also frequently featured in songs and poetry
because it can be melodic. In speeches, alliteration prompts us to repeat a phrase over in our minds.

Beginning in the 1960s, Dolores Huerta helped

farmworkers organize to advocate for better work-

ing conditions and payment. She cofounded the

United Farmworker's Association with Cesar

Chavez in 1962 and helped organize several grape

boycotts. In 1969, her proclamation of one such

boycott included the following: "We did not choose

the grape boycott, but we had chosen to leave our

peonage, poverty and despair behind....The boycott

was the only way forward the growers left to us. We

called upon our fellow men and were answered by

consumers who said--as all men [sic] of conscience

must--that they would no longer allow their tables

to be subsidized by our sweat and our sorrow:        Dolores Huerta by Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia Commons,
They shunned the grapes, fruit of our affliction."7  CC BY-SA.

Her use of "peonage" and "poverty" as well

as "subsidized by our sweat and sorrow" illustrates alliteration by the repeated use of the letters p and s.

These repetitions helped make the statements melodic and memorable, thus augmenting their persuasive-

ness concerning the plight of farmworkers at the time.

Visualization

               In addition to rhythm, stylistic language offers audiences visualization through vivid imagery.
               Such language heightens audience interest and helps an audience's understanding and reten-
               tion. Many stylistic devices can be used for visualization; here we highlight five: concrete lan-
               guage, visual imagery, simile, metaphor, and personification.

                     Concrete Language

Concrete language includes words that ground ideas in examples from the physical world. Good speakers move up and
down the ladder of abstraction as they discuss their ideas. We can take the concept of transportation as an example. We
can imagine a speaker discussing transportation and, as they do, also discussing automobiles, then American-made cars,
and finally, Ralph's beat-up 1975 metallic blue Ford Maverick. By moving "down" the ladder of abstraction, the speaker
will make the concept of transportation concrete and easier for the audience to understand.

   Box 16.7 Concrete Language in Practice

   We find a gripping example of concrete language in President Ronald Reagan's 1984 speech on the fortieth
anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy by American and Allied forces during World War II. He
spoke at Pointe-du-Hoc, where American Rangers climbed the one-hundred-foot cliffs under heavy fire to
take the strategic location during the invasion. Some of the surviving Army Rangers were seated before him
as he spoke.

            Reagan first described the events
abstractly as when "the Allies stood and fought
against tyranny" and the particular battle as when
the Rangers "began to seize back the continent of
Europe." But then he turned to very concrete lan-
guage to describe this battle:

   We stand on a lonely, windswept point on
the northern shore of France. The air is soft,
but 40 years ago at this moment, the air was
dense with smoke and the cries of men, and
the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire
and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the
morning of the 6th of June, 1944, 225 Rangers
jumped off the British landing craft and ran
to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission
was one of the most difficult and daring of the
invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate
cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies
had been told that some of the mightiest of
these guns were here and they would be
trained on the beaches to stop the Allied
advance.8

Visual Imagery

Visual imagery is a way to describe ideas with word pictures so your audience can see in their mind's eye a double-
decker bus traveling through downtown London or a seagull flying in the sky above the beach in Santa Monica, Califor-
nia. The idea is to help your audience see, hear, and even smell and taste what you describe.

   Box 16.8 Visual Imagery in Practice

   In his September 20, 2001, State of the Union
address to Congress, President George W. Bush
began with powerful visual imagery to help Ameri-
cans see the country's condition just nine days after
the terrorist attacks of 9/11:

   Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore,             President George W. Bush, The U.S. National Archives via
members of Congress, and fellow Americans,             Picryl, Public Domain.
in the normal course of events, presidents
come to this chamber to report on the state of
the union. Tonight, no such report is needed;
it has already been delivered by the American
people.

            We have seen it in the courage of
passengers who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground. Passengers like an exceptional man
named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me welcome his wife Lisa Beamer here tonight?

       We have seen the state of our union in the endurance of rescuers working past exhaus

tion.

            We've seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of
prayers in English, Hebrew, and Arabic.

            We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of
strangers their own.

            My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our
union, and it is strong.9

            Here President Bush used visual descriptions of actions his listeners could actually see in their
minds to capture an abstract idea--that the state of the union of the United States was strong.

Simile and Metaphor

Metaphors and similes compare things that are essentially different. Similes make the comparisons explicit through
keywords (e.g., "like" or "as"). For example, the great boxer Muhammad Ali described his boxing style in this way: "Float
like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Metaphors make comparisons implicitly. Box 16.9 provides examples of metaphors.

   Box 16.9 Metaphor in Practice               In 2024, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro

                                            isn't even the problem? What if there is a much bigger sub-

                                            ignoring the much bigger, more pressing cause.

Personification

Personification involves referring to an inanimate object or an abstract concept as if it were alive. Most often, personifi-
cation works by giving human characteristics or abilities to something that is not human. For example, "Tradition richly
rewards those who stick to the path she has set." Here tradition is characterized as a person with the power to reward.

   In 2020, then-Senator Kamala Harris made his-
tory by being the first woman to be elected vice
president of the United States. She was also the
first Black person and Asian American to be vice
president. In 2024, she became the first Black
woman and Asian American to be a major party's
presidential candidate.

In her victory speech given on November 7,

2020, Harris celebrated becoming vice president

and inspired children to recognize the US as a

"country of possibilities." She added, "And to the

children of our country, regardless of your gender,  Kamala Harris by Adam Schultz / Biden for President via

self in a way that others might not see you, simply because they've never seen it before. And we will applaud
you every step of the way."11

            In stating that the country had sent children a message, she personified the country to make the
positive message for young people more vivid. She presented the whole country as speaking directly to
young kids with dreams.

Argumentation

                               A third function of stylistic language is to enhance argumentation. In other words, style choices
                               themselves can help argue your case. Ideally, all stylistic language contributes to this end, but
                               some devices do this particularly effectively. Metaphor is one device we have already discussed.
                               Beyond metaphor, additional elements of style that directly advance argumentation include irony,
                               satire, and reference to the unusual.

Irony

Irony is the use of words in a way that is the opposite of their intended or normal use. For example, when someone says
to you "nice shot" in a basketball game when the ball entirely misses the rim and backboard, they have employed irony.
This technique functions as argument insofar as it offers an unexpected or surprising perspective on the underlying
thought.

          Box 16.12 Irony in Practice
          Frederick Douglass, an African American and former slave, was asked to speak in celebration of Indepen-
       dence Day in Rochester, New York, on July 5, 1852. His speech, "What to the Slave Is the 4th of July?" is rec-
       ognized as one of the greatest speeches in American history.

                   Douglass answered the question in the speech's
       title by noting that, ironically, it is a day that points out
       more than any other day of the year "the gross injustice and
       cruelty to which [the slave] is the constant victim." He called
       out the disparity between his white audience members who
       enjoyed freedom and African American slaves who experi-
       enced oppression and brutalization: "The rich inheritance
       of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed
       by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me." He continued:
       "This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I
       must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illumi-
       nated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joy-

                                                                                                           Wikimedia Commons, Public Doman.

            ous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking
            me to speak today?"12

                        Douglass ended this passage with an ironic question. He was not actually asking his audience to
            answer, and he presumably knew they did not mean to mock him. By employing irony, Douglass highlighted
            ongoing injustice and shifted the audience's emotions from celebrating America's freedom from British rule
            to shamefully condemning the country for hypocritically maintaining slavery.

  Satire

    Satire is a particular form of ridicule that is typically used to attack people or ideas or to highlight human vices and
    failings. Rather than a specific speech element, satire often characterizes the entirety of a piece of discourse.

               Box 16.13 Satire in Practice
               Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby frequently employs satire in their performances. In a 2024 Netflix
            Special called Gender Agenda, Gatsby showcased several queer comedians but opened the show with their
            own spot.

                        During their comedic monologue, Gadsby referenced public debates about transgender athletes
            and, in particular, some male critics' objections to trans female athletes participating in women's sports: "I
            think it's adorable how so many men are all of a sudden very concerned about women's sport. That's new.
            That's real new. The idea that men are transitioning to become women so they can dominate women's
            sports. Like, you know, pick up all those amazing perks you get in women's sports!...Women get all the
            perks. They get kisses and everything."13

                        Gadsby used satire to ridicule male critics' concerns as disingenuous and wrongheaded. The satire
            prompted laughter at the critics, but it also held up for scrutiny a broader cultural devaluing of women's
            sports. The comedian added irony to satire with the last sentence. It referenced the notorious kiss that for-
            mer president of Spain's soccer federation Luis Rubiales gave (without consent) to player Jenni Hermoso
            after her team won the Women's World Cup in 2023.

Reference to the Unusual

In making use of a reference to the unusual, a speaker includes an unbelievable story or a startling statistic or fact to
catch people's attention and interest. The uniqueness and often surprising nature of such references encourage audi-
ence members to process and reflect on the reference.

Box 16.14 Reference to the Unusual in Practice

   RuPaul Andres Charles (known simply as "RuPaul")
became nationally famous in the 1980s and 1990s as a drag
queen who appeared in films and television shows and even
recorded popular music. In 2009, he developed and starred
in the competition television show RuPaul's Drag Race,
which has aired for many seasons.

            In 2021, RuPaul hosted Saturday Night Live. During
his opening monologue, RuPaul introduced himself: "My
name is Ru which is short for RuPaul's Drag Race. Now, for
anyone who's not familiar with my show, how dare you? And
second of all, let me break it down for you in terms you can
understand. So our girls gag us with their eleganza, death
drop for the children, and slay the house down, boots. Make
sense?"14

unusual language for anyone unfamiliar with it. The vocabu
lary--"eleganza," "death drop," "slay," "boots," and so
on--likely piqued the curiosity and interest of novices as it
demonstrated the drama and playfulness of drag. It simulta-
neously enabled devotees of the show to feel like true insid-
ers of drag culture.

Community

           Finally, speakers can utilize stylistic devices to create or reinforce the idea of community. Such
           devices are used to bring audiences together for a common cause or concern or to create sepa-
           ration between one audience ("us") and an oppositional group ("them"). We might think about how
           speakers use stylistic devices to unite or differentiate their direct audience from their implied
           audience (referenced in the speech) and implicated audience (impacted by the message if it suc-
           ceeds). Language tools that accomplish such ends include the use of inclusive pronouns, gender-
           neutral language, maxims, and ideographs.

Inclusive Pronouns

Inclusive pronouns are pronouns that create community and unity between the speaker and their direct audience and
can be extended to include their implied and implicated audiences. Most prominently inclusive pronouns are the terms
we, us, and our. The terms are used to create identity and put the speaker in league with their audiences, expressing
shared purpose and concern, which can be particularly useful when a community experiences division.

Box 16.15 Inclusive Pronouns in Practice

                                                            In 2024, Steve Gleason won the Arthur Ashe Courage
                                                         Award at the ESPYs. The former football player was diag-
                                                         nosed with ALS in 2011 and later formed Team Gleason to
                                                         inspire other ALS sufferers to live meaningful lives. Gleason
                                                         delivered his award acceptance speech from a wheelchair
                                                         and through a speech-generating device.

                                                                     He quickly pivoted, though, from talking about his
                                                         own experience with ALS to "all of you who experience fear
                                                         and suffering." Referring to everyone in his direct, and pos-
                                                         sibly implied, audiences, he went on to say, "It's clear to me
                                                         that our ability to courageously share our vulnerabilities
                                                         with each other is our greatest strength. By doing this,

196 | Using Style to Harness the Power of Language
we're able to understand the issue compassionately, collaborate with each other to solve problems and
overcome fear."15

            In making use of the inclusive pronouns "our" and "we," Gleason abolished divisions between people
with ALS and people who have not developed ALS, and he bonded them together through shared experi-
ences of fear. He used that bond to encourage his audience(s) to work together in more compassionate and
collaborative ways in the future.

Gender-Neutral Language

Gender-neutral language refers to words that do not specify a particular gender. The meaning of

gender-neutral language expanded during the twenty-first century.

Initially, it referred to language choices that do not explicitly or implicitly favor one gen-

der over another. So, for example, instead of using terms like "policeman," speakers should say

"police officer" to avoid gendering the word as male. Speakers also should not make gender-biased

assumptions, such as referring to nurses as female and to doctors as male.

Today, gender-neutral language also includes pronoun use. The Purdue Online Writing

Lab, which many teachers and scholars turn to for guidance, explains:

He and she are not sufficient to describe the genders of all people, because not all people iden-

tify as either male or female. As such, the phrase "he or she" does not cover the full range of persons.

The alternative pronoun most commonly used is they, often referred to as sin

gular they. Here's an example:

            Someone left his or her backpack behind.  Someone left their backpack
behind.16

As part of adopting an effective and ethical speaking style, then, you should use a

person's preferred pronouns to refer to them--whether they are in your direct audience or

part of your implied or implicated audiences. If their pronoun is unknown, then default to

the neutral and singular "they." Using singular "they" avoids the risk of misgendering some-

one and/or creating divisions rather than unity within a community.                           Image by Kira Josie Murphy

If it sounds oddly new or incorrect to use "they" for an individual, it's not!

  The singular "they" first appeared in writing at least as far back as the fourteenth century.
  In 2019, Merriam-Webster added the singular "they" to the dictionary and made it the "word of the

     year."

Maxim

A maxim is a statement of a general truth or rule of conduct believed by a culture, such as "the best defense is a good
offense." A maxim makes a main point accessible and memorable for the audience. However, don't overuse this device or
else your speech may seem trite or vacuous.

what she believed is the most effective way to respond to untrue and hateful political claims: "When they go
low, we go high."17

            This pithy phrase captured an honorable approach to politics in a polarized environment. Though it
divided her direct audience ("we") from an implied audience ("they"), it did so to encourage listeners to take
the "high road" in politics and not return insult for insult. Listeners could extend her advice to interactions
with such implicated audiences as their coworkers, friends, and family members.

Ideograph

An ideograph is a culturally specific term that has great emotive power because it represents a deeply held value or
vice.18 Core positive ideographs in American culture include "equality," "freedom," "liberty," and "property." Core negative
ideographs include "terrorism," "communism," and "slavery." Appeals to such values and vices generally need little elabo-
ration and are accepted easily as rallying points for what is right or wrong even though their exact meaning is vague and
unclear.

Box 16.18 Ideographs in Practice

   During his 2024 acceptance speech as the Repub
lican presidential candidate, Donald Trump
employed both positive and negative ideographs.

            At one point he stated, "Today, our cities
are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being
squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are
taken. By the way, you know who's taking the jobs,
the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven
percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens."

The phrase "illegal aliens" functioned as an

ideograph that likely triggered strongly negative       President Donald Trump by Liam Enea via Flickr, CC BY-SA.
and judgmental reactions about this implied and

implicated audience. The label has become a kind of

            By fomenting fear and anger toward them, the ideograph helped Trump make a case for his needed return
            as president.

                        He later shifted to a positive ideograph when he proclaimed, "So tonight, whether you've supported
            me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American
            dream. That's what we're going to do. You don't even hear about the American dream anymore."19 The
            "American dream" represents a deeply, positively held vision and characterization of the country as a place
            of limitless possibilities. Trump's use of the phrase helped associate his candidacy with this vision.

                You can observe stylistic devices by examining the style of nearly any speech, from well-known presentations
    to everyday sermons and lectures. You may be surprised at the number and range of stylistic appeals in the discourse all
    around you.

          Summary

            In this chapter, we have addressed style, or the language or expression a speaker uses to communicate with
         an audience. Thoughtfully choosing words can help speakers engage their audience while clarifying the con-
         tent, eliciting listeners' emotions, and shaping their perspective. More specifically, this chapter has made the
         following clear:

               The stylistic use of language serves the important goals of creating clarity, maintaining audience inter-
                  est, evoking emotion, and creating perspective.

               Stylistic devices are language techniques and literary tools that can be used to create a sense of rhythm
                  (e.g., parallelism, repetition, antithesis, alliteration), enable visualization (e.g., concrete language, visual

17. Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and
Memory

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Compare and contrast four common modes of delivery.
          Define communication apprehension and identify strategies to manage it.
          Characterize delivery as an individual skill that is situational and constantly evolving.

When most people think about public speaking, they probably focus mostly on delivery and memory. Delivery, as you
learned in chapter 1, is how a speaker physically conveys words and ideas, both vocally and nonverbally, to the audi-
ence. When a speaker uses an electronic medium of communication, delivery also regards the speaker's use of televisual
elements, such as the camera, lighting, and background, to communicate. We described memory in chapter 1 as how a
speaker stores and recalls the information shared in a speech, such as whether and how much they depend on notes.

            Delivery and memory are two of the most visible elements of public speaking. Consequently, it's easy to equate
speaking success with animated gestures, energetic volume, and sustained eye contact. These elements do make a dif-
ference, and rhetoric teachers have developed principles and practices to use them effectively.

            However, delivery and memory should be placed alongside the many other components of public speaking.
Indeed, our positioning of delivery and memory in this book--in the middle--underscores their roles as two of many
elements of public speaking rather than a primary focus of attention. In other words, don't place so much focus on your
delivery that you neglect your research, audience adaptation, organization, or verbal style.

            At the same time, cultivating skills in delivery and memory is very important. If you have ever listened to a
speaker say "like" and "you know" after every sentence, or watched them stare at their notes the entire time, or seen
them constantly move in and out of the screen's frame, you understand why. This chapter begins with the goals of
speech delivery, followed by a focus on memory and four associated modes of delivery. We then turn to the anxiety that
often accompanies speech delivery and offer ways to address it. We conclude by discussing several principles of delivery
to keep in mind as you prepare your speech.

                                                                                                     Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory | 203
Delivery Goals

                                    The ultimate objective of speech delivery is to communicate with your direct audience effec-
                                    tively and clearly. Recall we defined the direct audience in chapter 10 as the people who are
                                    exposed to and attend to your speech. To that end, effective delivery should achieve three
                                    goals: engage this audience, enhance your ideas, and strengthen your credibility.

                                                First, well-executed delivery helps your audience feel connected to you as a speaker
                                    and invested in your speech topic. Ineffective delivery may result in disengaging the audience
                                    instead.

                                                Second, delivery also supports your speech content without becoming the focus of
attention. Poor delivery can distract from your ideas and instead draw attention to your repetitive use of gestures or
excessively fast rate of talking.

            Finally, delivery aids your credibility with the audience, or ethos. As discussed in previous chapters, ethos refers
to an audience's perceptions of a speaker's public character or persona. Effective delivery can bolster an audience's
sense of your goodwill, trustworthiness, competence, and dynamism, but poor delivery can undermine their perception
of these qualities. Next we discuss four modes of delivery you can use to achieve these goals.

Memory and Modes of Delivery

Again, memory is how one stores and recalls the information that is shared in a speech. That means delivery and memory
go hand in hand. Beginning speakers often find that their delivery improves when they increase their ability to remem-
ber their material. As with many aspects of public speaking, how we use our memory is dependent on the expectations
and constraints of the speaking situation.

            Public speaking scholars commonly recognize four modes of delivery, methods by which a speaker delivers
their information. Each approach has its merits in particular situations. We begin discussion of modes of delivery by
considering an extemporaneous delivery and then address impromptu, memorized, and manuscript deliveries in turn.

Extemporaneous Delivery

In an extemporaneous delivery, a speaker uses trimmed-down notes to recall the speech's structure, key ideas, and any
direct quotations or source citations. We say "trimmed down" because the notes only include the outline structure and
prompting words and phrases; they do not include every word you plan to say (unlike a preparation outline discussed in
chapter 15). We call these notes a presentation outline and offer fuller instructions in chapter 19.

            Because you cannot rely on your notes for exact wording, an extemporaneous delivery demands a sense of
spontaneity as you choose most of your language in the moment. You may want to memorize a few ideas with more
precision, such as the introduction (including your thesis and preview) and conclusion to help you begin and end the
speech smoothly. With the exception of these elements, however, your delivery will vary each time you practice or give
the speech. That keeps the speech fresh.

            An extemporaneous delivery enables speakers to maintain a more conversational and energetic delivery while
connecting with direct audience members. You are less tied to your notes, which allows you to be present in the situa-
tion and potentially make eye contact with the audience more easily. The flexibility offered by extemporaneous speaking

204 | Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory
also allows you to adjust to audience feedback, be that an unexpected audience reaction, a question posed during the
speech, or when you detect the need to add or remove material based on audience feedback.

            Extemporaneous delivery particularly suits pub-
lic settings that discuss issues of community importance.
In such situations, elements like setting, audience, and
the time available for presentation can change without
advanced notice. Relatedly, comments made by other par-
ticipants before your chance to speak may influence what
you plan to say or how you say it. This mode of delivery
allows you to alter your remarks in the moment. Thus,
extemporaneous speaking capitalizes on your advanced
preparation while enabling you to respond to the needs of
a given situation as they arise.

                                                                                              Image by Open Government Project via Flickr, CC BY.

          Box 17.1 Using an Extemporaneous Delivery to Quickly Adapt to the Situation
          What would you do if you found out, moments before giving a speech, that you had half the time to speak
       than you had anticipated? Could you make cuts within seconds? Would your speaking notes easily accom-
       modate those cuts?

                   Each of your textbook authors has been invited to speak in public settings. In one case, one of us
       was asked to deliver a twenty-minute presentation at a specific time. Upon arrival, however, she discovered
       the event was running late and the audience was growing tired. The person running the event told her she'd
       have ten minutes before the audience had to leave. She had to cut her speech in half to only the most salient
       points.

                   Fortunately, she had planned to speak extemporaneously, and her speaking notes consisted of a
       trimmed-down outline of keywords. That made it fairly easy to make significant adjustments on the fly. She
       marked out one main point and several subpoints, and she was ready to go. The audience likely never knew
       how drastically she changed her plan because of the flexibility an extemporaneous delivery provided her.

Impromptu Delivery

You have probably heard of the mode of delivery frequently called impromptu speaking. In an impromptu delivery, you
rely on instant recall because it refers to a situation in which you speak publicly without advance preparation or warn-
ing. Your delivery is integrally linked to what you can recall and articulate about a topic on the spot.

            This form of speaking comes with a rush of adrenaline as you either are thrust unexpectedly into a speaking
situation or feel compelled to suddenly, voluntarily enter a discussion of an issue. As such, it is a reactionary form of
speaking, often characterized by high energy and spontaneity while featuring less polish and being more prone to vocal
fillers.

                                                                                                     Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory | 205

                                                                 mentally prepare, and jot down notes.

                                                                 First, take a breath! While you will not have time

                                                                 your thoughts. Write down two or three keywords, each

                                                                 Second, remember the organizational principles

you learned in chapters 12, 13, and 14 because they are helpful even in impromptu speaking. Begin your remarks by stat-

ing your central point, perspective, or position. Follow that with a short series of brief supporting ideas, probably no

more than two or three. You might number the ideas or offset them with transitions to keep the points distinct. Where

possible, offer detail in support of your claim in the form of specific examples or illustrations. When you conclude, offer

a summary of what you have said.

        Third, be prepared. That undoubtedly sounds paradoxical, but there are ways you can mentally prepare for the

prospect of impromptu speaking. Most importantly, practice ethical listening as discussed in chapter 6. By being pre-

sent and engaged in a communication setting, listening actively, and being mentally alert, you will be better prepared to

speak if desired or called on.

        Lastly, have a way of taking notes (pen and paper, tablet, etc.) so you can jot down ideas during the discussion.

This too will spark your thinking and allow you to formulate a response or question to contribute to the ongoing dia-

logue.

Memorized Delivery

As its title suggests, in memorized delivery you memorize the speech word for word with the intent of precisely recall-
ing and delivering its content without the aid of notes or a manuscript. This mode of delivery emphasizes your memory,
requiring extensive practice to recall not only ideas but the exact words prepared for the presentation.

            As you can imagine, effective memorized speaking is difficult, particularly for lengthy presentations. It also
comes with substantial risks, including "blanking" on what you plan to say, needing to rebound from a lapse in memory,
and finding the flexibility necessary to adapt to a challenging situation or adverse audience feedback.

        Box 17.2 Disadvantages of a Memorized Delivery

206 | Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory
          Have you ever tried to memorize a lengthy text? One of your textbook authors
       competed in their high school's speech and debate club. They researched, wrote,
       and frequently delivered a ten-minute informative speech completely from mem-
       ory, with no notes! That feat was impressive when they succeeded. On one occa-
       sion, however, they suddenly lost their place about four minutes into the speech.
       Instead of picking up where they stopped, they had to start the speech over--from
       the very beginning. That was the only way they could recite it fully. Talk about
       embarrassing!

            A final concern for memorized speaking is the adoption of a mechanical delivery and a vacant or distant
look--one that lessens engagement with the audience--that can result from the strain of recalling the words. This sort
of "canned" presentation--one that is fully prepared in advance--can result in the speaker losing touch with the moment
during the presentation.

            Memorized speaking should be used sparingly, though it can be valuable in particular situations. Crises, for
instance, can call for specific, prepared language that informs or comforts a community. A memorized delivery in these
cases allows the speaker to visually connect with listeners instead of looking down at a manuscript. It also prevents the
speaker from inadvertently saying something that prompts additional uncertainty or harm.

                                                                                                   Speeches given routinely may also benefit from
                                                                                      memorization, such as a university campus tour speech,
                                                                                      because the guides can look where they are walking while

Manuscript Delivery

   Finally, in manuscript delivery, the speaker writes the entire
address in advance and utilizes the text in delivering the speech.
Depending on the technology available (e.g., a teleprompter, video
conference), the use of a manuscript may not be readily apparent.

            A skilled manuscript speaker achieves the goals of an
effective delivery. That is, they engage the audience, enhance their
ideas, and strengthen their credibility. Such success requires
preparing your manuscript in ways that free you from monoto-
nously reading your text. We provide tips for preparing a manu-
script in chapter 19.

            Manuscript speaking is best suited to formal situations
with a large direct audience. This includes formal platform speak-
ing and some televised or recorded speeches with a large viewer-
ship. Manuscript speaking also aids occasions where precise
wording matters and you have given particular attention to the
artistry and style of the speech. Finally, manuscript speeches are
common for lengthy addresses. They have the advantage of letting
you know more precisely how long your speech will take to deliver.

            Every mode of delivery offers both opportunities and constraints. We encourage you to make a thoughtful
choice based on your speaking situation, audience, and personal comfort and strengths. Whatever mode of delivery you
choose, you will likely experience some degree of nervousness and anxiety. We turn to that challenge next.

   Box 17.4 Choosing a Mode of Delivery for Civic Engagement

   Opportunities to speak in your community can greatly differ by audience, situation, location, medium,
timing, occasion, and purpose. It's important you choose a mode of delivery that best suits each opportu-
nity, features your strengths as a speaker, and aids your purpose. The following are a few potential civic
speaking engagements to help you reflect on available modes of delivery.

     Meeting or public event organized by a civic organization or group: An extemporaneous delivery is
        ideal if you are invited in advance to address the group, but you will need to rely on an impromptu
        approach if you are spontaneously asked or suddenly decide to comment. If you are speaking at an
        event where you will interact with the broader public, an impromptu delivery can provide you with
        maximum flexibility while keeping a few talking points in mind.

     Ceremonial gathering (dedication, celebration, memorial): For a large, formal ceremonial gather-
        ing, a manuscript or memorized delivery will enable you to carefully plan your comments for the
        occasion and do so with a thoughtful use of verbal style. Choosing between using a manuscript or
        memorizing your comments may depend on your personal preference and the audience's expecta-
        tions. If the gathering is a bit more casual, then an extemporaneous approach can give you more flexi-
        bility and informality in your delivery.

     Protest, march, or rally: If you are helping to lead a protest, march, or rally and plan to address
        attendees at a particular moment, a memorized delivery can ensure you communicate your message
        precisely while maintaining a visible connection with participants. An impromptu approach may be
        required if you are suddenly called on to address attendees.

     Publicity for a community event: An extemporaneous or manuscript delivery can work well to
        share specific information about an event, such as when invited as a guest on a local radio station or
        when recording a podcast.

Communication Apprehension

challenge. The fear or anxiety that arises when you antic-
ipate public speaking is referred to as communication
apprehension. Most people know it as "stage fright." Such
feelings of anxiety emerge for many reasons. You may feel
general nervousness about being in front of public audi-
ences or feel stress over the importance of a particular
situation. Perhaps you are poorly prepared, feel uneasy
about the subject matter, worry about the audience's
reaction, or fear failure. No matter how much preparation
this textbook provides, you will ultimately have to navi-
gate a variety of feelings to deliver a speech.

            There is good news. Nervousness before, and
even during, the act of public speaking is normal. You are

                                                            Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory | 209
not strange or alone in experiencing communication apprehension, and the practices promoted in this chapter can help
mitigate its effects. Also, remember that your audience will want you to succeed, especially if you are all in a public
speaking class together. They are "rooting" for you because they feel nervous about speaking too. Also, seeing a speaker
deliver a speech comfortably makes the audience more comfortable as well.

          Box 17.5 Common Symptoms of Communication Apprehension
             feeling that your heart is "racing"

             feeling a "knot" in your stomach
             having a slight sense of nausea
             mind going "blank" while speaking

             speaking too quickly
             fidgeting
             frequently touching face and hair

                               These symptoms may be manifestations of your speech anxiety. Even when they
                   are not, these behaviors reflect conduct that audiences can perceive as signs of anxiety,
                   regardless of how you actually feel.

            The best way to manage communication apprehension is to focus on the skills and preparation techniques
described in this textbook. Experience is also an antidote; your level of speech anxiety will likely decrease naturally
over time. Still, you are unlikely to completely eliminate speech anxiety--and that can even work to your advantage. An
absolute lack of anxiety can actually cause a speaker to sound bored or flat to an audience. In contrast, the energy and
passion conveyed by the slightly anxious speaker can encourage the audience to assume the speech topic must be wor-
thy of excitement.

210 | Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory
Strategies to Use Prior to a Speech

   Some of the most effective techniques for responding to com-
munication apprehension are the preparation practices dis-
cussed earlier in this book: researching your topic thoroughly,
analyzing your audience, constructing a sound outline, and
familiarizing yourself with the speech's location or medium.
These steps will give you confidence as you anticipate what to
expect.

            You can further reduce communication apprehension
prior to your speech if you do the following:

 Learn your introduction particularly well, helping to make

sure the speech starts smoothly.

 Practice the speech several times. You might consider

working with a speaker's lab, speech tutor, or friend to help

identify and limit any distracting physical mannerisms or

signs of anxiety.

 Remember to relax or unwind in advance of the speech.

Rather than enter the speaking situation tense and on

edge, take a little time for yourself, be that by practicing

meditation, engaging in light exercise, working on a logic

game, or undertaking another activity that you enjoy and

releases tension.

 Visualize yourself giving a successful speech. Close your

eyes. Then imagine yourself walking to the front of your

classroom or turning on your camera and delivering your

speech confidently while interested audience members

smile and nod their heads. It may sound silly, but positive

visualization can strengthen your confidence by mentally         Image by Kei_Therapeutic_Artvia via Pixabay, Pixabay
going through the motions.                                       Content License.

 If you have the option to deliver your speech as a prere

corded presentation, consider doing so. Prerecording requires significant time to set up, record, edit, and convert

into a file or URL you can easily share. However, it allows you to watch yourself and rerecord until you are happy

with the outcome. That option can be particularly advantageous for speakers who greatly struggle with communi-

cation anxiety as well as those who have a speech impediment or for whom English is a second language.

   Box 17.6 Managing Speech Anxiety Associated with Civic Engagement
   Civic engagement settings are often more flexible and hence less predictable than other public speaking
opportunities. They also more often involve informal, impromptu remarks. Nonetheless, there are several
steps you can take to lessen your anxiety when speaking before a civic group or at a public forum.
     Try to meet the organization's leaders or forum organizers in advance to ask about the likely audi-

                                                                                             Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory | 211
         ence.
       When speaking in person, visit the location of the meeting in advance to learn about the speaking

         environment.
       When speaking online, ask the people running the event what communication platform will be used

         and how.
       If it is a recurring meeting, attend a gathering in advance of your speech to gain an understanding

         of its normal operation.
       If you are giving a formal presentation, discuss the expectations and constraints with the organiz-

         ers.
       Speak with people who will attend the meeting or have attended the meeting in the past to gain

         their insights.
       Plan your remarks in advance, forming a speech outline and notes if it is a formal presentation.
       For less formal situations, fill out note cards identifying key points on the topics you are most inter-

         ested in and most anticipate raising in discussion.

Strategies to Use During a Speech

   You can also employ strategies during the speech to
help control your anxiety and limit its visual manifesta-
tion. You might try the following:

 Look directly at your audience. It is normal to avoid

eye contact when feeling nervous, but if you are able,

you may find that looking at your audience--physi-

cally sitting in front of you or shown through cam-

eras on a screen--can actually calm your nerves.

You'll likely notice facial expressions that express

interest and attention, which may build your confi-

dence.

 Adopt good posture if you are physically able to; avoid  Public Speaking by JohnDiew0107 via Flickr, CC BY.
   leaning on a podium or table. Pulling your shoulders

back, lifting your chin, and centering or balancing your weight can make you feel and appear more confident.

 Avoid gripping the podium or table (if either is present), as these behaviors can exacerbate and communicate anxi-

ety.

 Remind yourself to breathe to calm your nerves, perhaps using pauses to catch your breath or even making nota-

tions on your speaking notes to assist with this.

 Pause if you notice yourself speaking too quickly or falling into a physical pitfall. Do not draw the audience's atten-

tion to the behavior ("Gosh, I'm really nervous," or "I guess I'm pacing a lot"). Instead, pause for a moment, take a

breath, subtly correct your delivery, and keep going.

 Trust yourself and remember the perfect speech will never be given. Being perfect is an impossible expectation

that will only heighten your communication apprehension.

212 | Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory
Strategies to Use After a Speech

   Just because the speech is over doesn't mean you
should stop working to address speech anxiety. Post-
speech reflective exercises will help reduce future anxi-
ety. Soon after your speech, therefore, we recommend
the following:

   Take notes on how the speech went. Reflect on the
      positive elements of the speech while also noting
      areas you can improve.

   Get reactions from your peers. You are typically your
      harshest critic. Oftentimes, what feels like obvious
      signs of speech anxiety to you--the speaker--are
      barely noticeable to the audience.

   Carefully consider instructor feedback. They will likely
      highlight strengths to continue into the next speech
      and suggestions for how to improve weaker areas.
            Taking a few steps before, during, and after you

speak will help you improve your delivery and reduce
your anxiety. Your communication apprehension may fur-
ther decrease by keeping a few delivery principles in
mind.

Delivery Principles

We will end this chapter by inviting you to consider three comforting insights about delivery: (1) no one manner of deliv-
ery is right for all speakers, (2) delivery is situational, and (3) your skill in delivery will develop over time.

                                                                                                      Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory | 213
Find a Delivery That Works for You

   You can undoubtedly think of speakers with great deliveries. However, that
doesn't mean you should emulate them. You must find a style of delivery that
works for you as an individual. What works for someone like James Charles will
not necessarily suit you. What worked for John F. Kennedy or Kamala Harris
probably won't fit you well either. To be effective as a speaker, you must develop
a delivery that is consistent with who you are as a person and adapted to your
personal capabilities and constraints.

Delivery Is Situational

It might sound logical to think a speaker should always speak with energy and       Kamala Harris by Gage Skidmore via
passion, incorporate movement, and smile. However, those behaviors aren't           Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA
always appropriate or effective. Instead, vary your delivery based on the dictates
of the situation.

CC BY.                                         unchanged, his tone, background, use of eye contact, and
                                               distance from the camera varies based on whether he is
                                               recording videos for his "MrBeast Gaming" channel, for
                                               instance, or his "Beast Philanthropy" channel.

                                                           The gaming videos are more casual and relaxed,
                                               with attention devoted to the game being played. MrBeast
                                               tends to record himself for these videos with headphones
                                               on, his head and shoulders imposed onto a screen corner
                                               over a moving image of the game he's playing, and eye con-
                                               tact directed away from viewers (assumed to be on the
                                               game itself).

                                                           The philanthropy videos are more solemn and seri-
                                               ous, so MrBeast typically records himself making eye con-
                                               tact with the camera, showing his upper body, often located
                                               on the scene of where he is doing the philanthropy, and
                                               adopting a more serious tone.

214 | Engaging Your Audience Through Delivery and Memory
            The contrasts in MrBeast's deliveries reflect the differences in the public speaking situations he is
recording.

            Situational factors such as the speech's purpose,
timing, location, and audience composition and size will
require adjustments to your tone, volume, and possible
movement (all discussed later in chapter 18). Dr. Martin
Luther King's delivery of his "I Have a Dream" speech is
remarkable, but it's suited to a large audience and signifi-
cant occasion, not to a boardroom presentation or for a
speech honoring the accomplishments of a departing
coworker. The situations are different, and so too will be
the delivery.

            Likewise, conditions such as your immediate
physical setting, use of visual aids, and communication
medium (in person or through a camera) may constrain
the type of delivery you can use. You'll find suggestions in
the next chapter for how to adjust your delivery for a
camera, for instance. In chapter 29, we provide guidance
for how to deliver your presentation with visual aids in
ways that enrich, rather than distract from, your speech.

Finally, realize your delivery will develop over time. As you gain more experience, you will learn what works for you and
what does not. You will discover the ideal amount of notes for you, effective and natural gestures or facial expressions,
and if you can tell a joke (and when to tell it). When you finish your public speaking class, your delivery will be different
than it is now, and it will change again in the months and years ahead. There is always room to improve delivery, even
for the best speaker. The target is constantly moving because the subject matter, occasion, audience, available media,
and historical moment are also in motion. This is why public speaking is more of an art than a science.

Summary

   This chapter addressed the importance of delivery and memory to public speaking. While aiding speech con-
tent in important ways, these two concepts are more attuned to issues of form, or how one conveys messages
to the audience. Specifically, we observed the following:

     Delivery is a means of engaging the audience, enhancing your message, and bolstering your credibility

             with the audience.
          Each of the four common modes of delivery--extemporaneous, impromptu, memorized, and manu-

             script--has its benefits and limitations.
          Communication apprehension, or speech anxiety, is common but can be effectively managed with

             strategies employed before, during, and after a speech.
          Delivery is a fluid and constantly developing skill that changes over time and according to the situation

             and personal abilities. With experience you will find a form of delivery that is most natural and comfort-
             able for you.

18. Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and
Televisual Delivery

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Identify the most important elements of vocal delivery.
          Assess specific elements of nonverbal delivery.
          Demonstrate the thoughtful use of televisual delivery elements.

The previous chapter established desired outcomes of an effective delivery: engaging the audience, enhancing your
message, and strengthening your credibility. This chapter offers three sets of specific tools or techniques to achieve
these goals: vocal delivery, nonverbal delivery, and televisual delivery.

            Keep in mind that not every speaker is physically, psychologically, neurologically, or culturally comfortable with,
or capable of, using every available delivery element. Use the elements that play to your strengths and abilities.

            This chapter begins by identifying vocal and nonverbal elements of delivery. We then move to additional televi-
sual components of mediated delivery. Throughout the chapter, we focus on delivering a speech to your direct audience.
As defined in chapter 10, these are the people who are exposed to and who attend to your speech.

Vocal Delivery

Vocal delivery refers to how the voice and mouth are used to deliver words. Different vocal techniques can draw
the audience into a speech and even encourage audience participation and discussion. Key elements of vocal delivery
include volume, tone, rate, pauses, articulation, pronunciation, and avoidance of vocal fillers.

Volume

                              Volume, or vocal amplification, refers to the loudness of your voice. If you fail to be heard while
                              speaking, nothing else will matter. When determining what volume is reasonable, consider the
                              needs of people who are hard of hearing and may require a louder volume than others. Of course,
                              you should avoid yelling at or overpowering your audience.

                                          Further volume modification is required based on factors such as the setting, audience
                              size, and type and quality of audio equipment you may be using. Speaking outdoors, which is com-
                              mon for rallies and many civic events, requires more vocal projection to overcome background
noise, particularly when a microphone or other amplification is unavailable. The same may hold true when speaking

218 | Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery
through a screen while sitting in a busy or noisy area. When using a microphone in person or speaking through a screen,
test the equipment in advance whenever possible. If you are uncertain about your volume, ask the audience for feedback
and adjust accordingly.

            Additionally, the size of the audience and your distance from them requires adjustments to your volume. Large
and distant audiences demand a louder volume when speaking in person but likely not when addressing them through
a screen.

            Finally, your volume can also be used strategically. Speaking particularly loudly at key points can reinforce their
importance and signal passion for the topic. You can also underscore the significance of information or suggest its sen-
sitivity and confidentiality by using a whisper or drop in voice.

Tone

                                       Vocal tone refers to the sound of your voice or its pitch. You might think of it as the place-
                                       ment of your voice--its highness or lowness--on the musical scale. There is great variety
                                       among humans in the tones we adopt for speaking, and you probably have a typical pitch at
                                       which you speak. Indeed, most of us naturally stay within a small range of pitches on the
                                       musical scale when we speak--that is, most of us speak rather monotonously. Unfortunately,
                                       a monotonous pitch can become dull and boring to an audience over time. They may disen-
                                       gage from your message and even wrongly assume you are not excited or passionate about
                                       your own message.

                                                   Therefore, if you are able, work on speaking with more variety in your vocal tones
over the course of a presentation. You might practice with a friend, at a speech lab, with a speech tutor, or by recording
yourself. Focus on occasionally raising and lowering your pitch beyond your typical tone. Consider strategically varying
your tone to emphasize particular points or to underscore your thesis, particularly compelling evidence, or your con-
clusion.

            Be mindful, however, to not go too far in strategically timing your intonations or varying them so much that
you sound almost robotic or fake. As we mentioned in the previous chapter, an ineffective delivery draws attention to
itself rather than enhances the message, and that can occur when speaking too monotonously or too strategically. If you
are capable, strive for what we might call a "conversational tone"--that is, a voice that varies in pitch like it might more
naturally when you're having an animated conversation with friends.

            Finally, consider how your vocal tone can potentially alter the meaning of what you say. For instance, ending
declarative sentences with a higher pitch, like you might when asking a question, can suggest you are unsure of yourself.
Using vocal tone to emphasize different words can change the meaning of a word or phrase. Saying "My mom moved to
TEXAS in 2020" communicates something different than saying "My mom moved to Texas IN TWENTY TWENTY." Being
aware of how tone can alter meaning is particularly important when leading a public discussion. In a deliberative dis-
cussion, as we discuss in chapter 21, one's vocal tone or pitch should be used to frame topics in a vocally neutral fashion
that welcomes diverse participant contributions.

                                                                                                 Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery | 219
Rate

                                     Rate is the speed at which you speak. You should speak at a pace that is comfortable for you
                                     and the audience. In seeking that comfortable rate, be mindful of adopting a speed that is
                                     neither too fast nor too slow. If you speak too quickly, the audience will struggle to compre-
                                     hend the information, particularly more complex material. You also risk overpowering the
                                     audience with a rapid-fire style. On the other hand, if you speak too slowly, you might lose
                                     the audience's attention. As listeners, we typically process words faster than a speaker can
                                     say them, leaving time for the mind to wander.

                                                 You might selectively increase your rate of delivery when covering less important
material. Rate can also be adjusted to add verbal emphasis (slowing down, for instance) or to provide a sense of energy
or enthusiasm (increasing your rate at particular points). Changes in rate can be especially effective in situations urging
civic action--using your rate to establish urgency and to convey excitement in rallying support for a cause. The takeaway
is to vary your rate based on what is comfortable for the audience, the material in your speech, and the occasion.

Pauses

                                A pause refers to the strategic choice not to speak and to allow a momentary silence instead.
                                Pauses fix the attention of the audience on what you just said, inviting them to ponder an idea
                                for a moment. A pause also allows the audience to catch up with you or to anticipate what you
                                will say next. Additionally, a pause can help indicate a transition, often in conjunction with a ver-
                                bal signal. However, be mindful of pausing too frequently or at awkward moments. Doing so can
                                make the presentation choppy, result in unintended divisions in content, and create perceptions
                                of nervousness.
            You can learn to use pauses as a means of incorporating audience feedback and reactions. For instance, if the
audience laughs in response to something you say, pause. Otherwise, your next thought will be lost in the laughter. Make
similar allowances for audience applause and the occasional "aha" moment when you have made a significant point. Your
ability to incorporate such audience feedback will also encourage their participation, whereas talking over their reac-
tions will do the opposite. Practice your presentation with others to help identify moments in your speech that are likely
to provoke laughter or applause.

Articulation

                                   Articulation refers to speaking each word with clarity. Poor articulation--mumbling--under-
                                   mines the clarity of a speech. If you struggle with articulation, try monitoring your speaking
                                   rate. When you speak too quickly, you risk running words together, thereby decreasing your
                                   clarity. Articulation is an issue to particularly monitor in settings or venues with poor acoustics
                                   or when you are using equipment with poor sound quality. In such situations, clear articula-
                                   tion, a slow rate, and purposeful volume will increase your clarity.

                                               A facet of articulation called enunciation refers to the fullness of articulation (or lack
                                   thereof). Your enunciation can depend on the situation and audience. For instance, some cul-
tures and communities have a shared habit of dropping the endings from words, such as words ending with "ing" ("run-
nin" instead of "running," for example) or mashing words together ("gonna" instead of "going to"). If you are a member of

220 | Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery
a community, already share the habit, and are addressing them, your enunciation may be fitting, depending on the occa-
sion. It may detract from your message, however, if you are addressing a group that enunciates words differently or if
you are not a member of that group. Strategically adopting an enunciation you do not typically use can appear fake or
manipulative.

Pronunciation

Pronunciation is the way particular words are spoken or given sound. Proper pronunciation shows command of vocab-
ulary, while mispronouncing terms (particularly when done multiple times) may cause an audience to question your
understanding of the word or concept. Pronunciation can also be an issue of (dis)respect and (lack of) cultural aware-
ness if we consistently mispronounce a person's name or cultural custom. Of course, what is considered proper pro-
nunciation can alter based on one's culture, community, or geographic region. The word "advertisement," for instance,
is pronounced very differently by Americans than by the British. You can adapt your pronunciation to your audience if
you can do so in a way that flows comfortably.

Vocal Fillers

                                Vocal fillers, also called nonfluencies, are sounds ("um" and "er" most prominently) and words
                                (e.g., "like," "you know," and even "and") spoken repetitively that do not add content to a speech.
                                They are typically used due to nervousness, out of habit, or to fill the silence while finding your
                                next words. A few "ums" are understandable, but when used too often, nonfluencies become dis-
                                tracting to the audience, who may begin to anticipate the filler rather than listen to the speech
                                itself. As you practice your speech, try to break yourself of the habit of using vocal fillers. Learn
                                to pause instead, because a small space of silence is much more effective than hearing a nonflu-
ency.
            The conclusions to draw regarding vocal delivery have been addressed in Chapter 17: find a delivery that suits
you, remember delivery is situational, and recognize your delivery will develop over time. Your goal is to use your voice
to enhance your content and build your credibility while encouraging audience attention. Through practice in front of
people or by recording yourself, you can refine your vocal delivery to best achieve your goals.

                                                                                                 Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery | 221

Nonverbal Delivery

Nonverbal delivery refers to how the body is used to communicate. The audience reads or interprets nonverbal cues just
as they do a speaker's vocal delivery. Consequently, nonverbal delivery can engage or distract an audience, underscore
or undermine the message, and strengthen or weaken the speaker's credibility. Important nonverbal elements include
eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movement, and appearance.

Eye Contact

                                                                    We understand that maintaining eye contact--looking

                                                                    dependence, to differences in culture, status, and neurol-

                                                                    ogy. In some cases, eye contact may be too physically,

                                                                    psychologically, or culturally uncomfortable--or even

                                                                    painful--to maintain, or it may simply be impossible due

                                                                    their attention to developing other elements of vocal and

                                                                    cans associate eye contact with truthfulness and sincer-

ity, regardless of whether these perceptions are grounded in reality. Maintaining eye contact also helps the audience

feel connected with you, and it provides you with an excellent way to gain audience feedback. As we mentioned in the

previous chapter, by looking at your audience (whether in person or through their images on a screen), you can notice

signs of positive reception that will lessen your anxiety or signals that you need to move on or slow down.

To make meaningful eye contact as you speak in person, try to look at specific people in the audience, establish

and hold eye contact with them for several seconds at a time, and then move to someone else. Include people through-

222 | Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery
out the space rather than concentrating on a particular location where you find one or two familiar, friendly, or inter-
ested faces. Similarly, do not direct too much of your eye contact toward a visual aid--keep most of your focus on your
audience.

            When speaking through a screen, focus your gaze on the camera or cameras. In such instances, looking else-
where on your screen will make it appear as if you are avoiding eye contact. You can occasionally glance at the images
of your audience members, however, to help alleviate anxiety and to receive their nonverbal feedback to your speech.

            Finally, whether you are speaking in person or through a screen, avoid constantly looking at your notes, such as
by bobbing your head up and down or reading them on the screen. Neither behavior results in meaningful eye contact,
which typically requires holding eye contact with a person or the camera for several seconds as you speak.

Facial Expressions

                                                              One of your most expressive physical attributes can be

                                                              reactions--can help clarify the meaning of your message.

                                                              Think for a moment of how difficult it can be sometimes

                                                              if the message is serious or sarcastic, because it lacks the

                                                              vocal tone and facial expressions that can give it meaning.

                                                              It's telling that we've developed emoticons and emojis that

                                                              often feature facial expressions to clarify our meaning. If

Of course, we also send unintended messages through our facial expressions. As a speaker, think about what

message you might send if you never smile during a speech (or if you smile all the time). In a civic context, be mindful

of how you interact with other participants through your expressions. You can encourage a participant to contribute or

continue talking, for instance, with a warm facial expression or with a nod of the head. In contrast, a flash of anger, a

dismissive look (like rolling your eyes), or an expression of frustration may make participants feel less valued or inter-

ested in continuing the conversation.

Gestures and Movement

   Movement of your hands (gestures) and the positioning
and motion of your body (body movement) can both pos-
itively impact your speech. While these nonverbal ele-
ments are most readily available to uninjured and able-
bodied people, many of us can still make use of one or the
other. A speaker who is born without arms or loses the
ability to use them, for instance, may still be able to walk
or alter their posture. A person who cannot stand or move
their lower body may be able to gesture with their hands
or move a wheelchair while speaking. We encourage each
speaker to thoughtfully consider how they may incorpo-
rate their available physical motion into their speeches.

            Well-placed gestures can draw emphasis to your Image by Picture Alliance for DLD via Flickr, CC BY-NS-SA.
main points, provide another form of audience engage-
ment, and even assist with transitions. Gestures can also accentuate words by almost physically drawing objects and by
illustrating actions. However, repetitive gestures should be avoided, as they are distracting for the audience. Consider
leaving your arms relaxed at your sides or on a table when not gesturing. The challenge is to strike an effective balance
between random or repetitive gestures on the one hand and overly rehearsed (and thus artificial) gestures on the other.

            When offering gestures, think about their visibility, meaning, and situation. If you are standing behind a lectern
or sitting at a table, your gestures must be high enough to be seen by the audience. If you are speaking to a large crowd
in person, your gestures must be large enough to be visible. If you are speaking through a screen, your gestures must be
small enough to be seen within the camera's frame.

          Box 18.2 The Meaning of Gestures
          Not all gestures mean the same thing to all people or in every situation. A gesture may be interpreted
       quite differently across cultures or even over time. In the United States, for instance, the gesture that used
       to only mean "OK" became widely adopted by white supremacists to promote their racist agenda. In 2019,
       the Anti-Defamation League classified the "OK" gesture as a symbol of hate. Speakers must be aware of
       what their gestures might communicate to their audience, given the context.

224 | Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery
            Along with gestures, a speaker can strategically
use body movement to aid the message. When speaking,
you might reposition yourself to mark major transitions
and to give the audience an opportunity to reset their
attention. Such strategic movement can also help you
engage different segments of the audience, can possibly
release nervous energy, and is much preferred to random
pacing.

            Another element of movement to consider is
body positioning. When talking in person, be cognizant of
the physical distance between you and the audience. Sit-
uating yourself too close to the audience may make them
feel anxious by violating their space. Positioning yourself Alondra Berber Donde by Mexicanosenazulvia Wikimedia Commons,
too far away, such as at the back of a platform or near the CC BY-SA.
back wall, can increase a sense of separation and make
you appear uncomfortable. In general, it is best to locate yourself in a central position rather than to the side of the
room or speaking platform. If possible, try occasionally repositioning yourself over the course of the speech to ensure
all audience members can see you.

Appearance

Appearance regards how you look while speaking. We can control some factors more than others. An element of physical
appearance in your control is attire. The way you dress should be fitted to the occasion, the audience, your topic, and
you as a person. Dress conveys the formality of the situation and is seen as a sign of speaker competence.

organization gathering, or public rally. Each of these settings and situations likely calls for very different types of attire;
you need to consider that expectation and dress accordingly.

Televisual Delivery

   Many of our speaking opportunities today occur
through a screen using videoconferencing platforms such
as Apple's FaceTime, Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft
Teams, though their popularity and names change over
time.

            When we present a public speech through a
screen, we call that a televisual delivery. Nearly all the
vocal and nonverbal elements previously discussed hold
importance for a televisual speech delivery, and we have
drawn attention earlier to when and how you should adapt
those elements for the screen. In what follows, we con-
sider additional delivery components that are unique to a
televisual medium: camera framing, angle, and distance;
lighting and background; and camera steadiness.

            Keep in mind that when you speak through a
screen, your televisual delivery may reach different kinds
of audiences. As described in chapter 10, if you record and
make your speech widely available, your speech may
extend beyond a discrete audience (limited to those indi-
viduals who show up for your speech event at a particular
day and time) to include a dispersed audience (a group of
people, unlimited by location or time, who can view your
speech). You should consider your speech's audiences as
you use televisual delivery to achieve desired delivery out-
comes.

cally adopt a low or high camera angle to accentuate a
point or reengage the audience. In general, however, you
want the camera more directly in line with your eyes to
replicate the experience of talking to someone face-to-
face. Doing that focuses attention on your face and gen-
erates a sense of connection and equality with your
audience. You can accomplish a direct camera angle by
raising the height of your electronic device. Stack some
books or boxes on a table, for instance. The audience
won't see what you use to raise your device, so it does not
have to look good for the camera.

                                               Your camera distance is the length of space

                                               between you and your camera. It, too, affects what the

                                               audience sees and notices. A far camera distance (also

                                               called a long or full shot) enables an audience to see more

                                               of your body, gestures, and background, and it may pro-

                                               eyes. However, it leaves little room to see gestures, and it

with a far or close camera distance to meet your delivery goals. Typically, however, as a speaker, you should opt for a

medium or medium close-up camera distance that allows viewers to comfortably see your head, shoulders, and upper

body from the waist or chest up.

Lighting and Background

Like on any television or movie set, attention should be given to your lighting and background when using a televisual
delivery. Both impact what the audience sees and notices, and they can also enhance or hurt your message. Lighting
refers to the amount and placement of brightness or darkness on the speaker. When thinking about lighting, try to opt
for brightness so it is easier to see your face through the screen. Avoid shadows or uneven lighting when possible.

            An inexpensive way to achieve good lighting is by speaking in front of a window on a sunny day. If those condi-
tions are unavailable to you, then you might sit in front of a white or brightly painted wall. Then direct a lamp toward the
wall so that light "bounces" off the wall and back onto your face. That indirect approach is typically softer looking than
aiming light directly onto you. You might also use two table lamps, perhaps in addition to an overhead light, to better
balance the lighting in your space. Relying on an overhead light alone will produce harsh shadows on your face.

            Your background refers to everything the audi-
ence can see behind or around you within the camera's
frame. To maintain the audience's attention on your
speech, strive to speak in a setting that is quiet both audi-
bly and visually. That is, avoid settings where people may
need to walk or move around in the background. Even if
they stay silent, their presence will distract the audience.

            You may opt for a very simple background, such
as in a classroom against a bare wall or even a clean sheet.
Alternatively, you may strategically choose your setting to
enhance your message. If you are advocating for hunting
as a means of environmental conservation, for instance,
you might locate yourself in an outdoor setting or adopt a Image by RDNE Stock project via Pexels, Pexels license.
virtual background that replicates the outdoors.

            Indeed, virtual backgrounds (and visual effects) are increasingly available and easy to employ. Used strategically
or creatively, high-quality backgrounds and effects can enhance your message and strengthen your credibility--and hide
a messy room or office. However, many virtual backgrounds and visual effects are of poor quality, excessively busy (e.g.,

                                                                                                Effectively Using Verbal, Nonverbal, and Televisual Delivery | 229
animations, lots of colors), and/or corny. They are more likely to distract viewers from your message and detract from
your credibility, especially if the background has no clear connection to your purpose, topic, or occasion.

Camera Steadiness

When televisually delivering a presentation, speakers should be mindful of their camera's steadiness, or the motion or
stillness of the camera's frame. If you set a laptop on your lap while speaking, for instance, the camera will move around
as you gesture and speak (not to mention that your camera angle will be too low). You are unlikely to notice the move-
ment as you speak, but it will be very distracting and possibly uncomfortable for your audience to view. The same may
occur if you pound the table on which your electronic device is resting as you speak. To avoid distracting camera move-
ment, place the electronic device on a solid surface and try not to touch that surface while speaking. A desk or folding
tray table can work well, especially if you are stacking boxes on top to raise your camera angle.

unintended and damaging messages about us as speakers
or our attitude toward the audience. Tune into the open-
ing skit (or "cold open") for any Saturday Night Live tele-
vision episode, and you're likely to see the show's
comedians exaggerate the worst delivery elements of the
public figures they are parodying. These mocking depic-
tions often imply that the figures have poor morals, low
intelligence, or little public appeal. Fortunately, you can
use the tools described in this chapter to improve your
delivery and aid your public speaking efforts. Remember
that experience and practice will help you find the deliv-
ery style that works best for you.

Summary

   This chapter addressed three sets of tools you can use to achieve an effective delivery. Though not every tool
is available for every speaker, each person can use the techniques that play to their speaking strengths. More
specifically, we observed the following:

     Vocal delivery, how a speaker uses their voice and mouth to deliver words, is important in engaging an
        audience. Key elements of vocal delivery include volume, tone, rate, pauses, articulation, pronunciation,
        and avoidance of vocal fillers.

     Nonverbal delivery, how the body is used to communicate, can enhance or distract from the message.
        Important nonverbal cues include eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movement, and appear-
        ance.

     Televisual delivery, presenting a speech through a camera and screen, can influence a speech's effec-
        tiveness. Key elements of televisual delivery include camera angle, distance, and framing; lighting and
        background; and camera steadiness.

    1. Name three excellent speakers. What makes their delivery effective? How do these speakers differ from
        one another in terms of their vocal, nonverbal, and (if appropriate) televisual delivery?
   2. Think of speakers you've heard who spoke very poorly. What specific vocal and nonverbal delivery ele-
        ments hurt their performance? What exactly did they do, and how did it affect you as an audience mem-
        ber? What might they have done differently?
   3. Recall effective speakers who use a televisual medium almost exclusively, such as popular YouTubers or
        other influencers. What have you noticed about how they adapt their delivery to the camera and televi-

19. Preparing a Presentation Outline or Manuscript
for an Effective Delivery

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Use a presentation outline for an extemporaneous delivery.
          Create a manuscript for a manuscript delivery.
          Choose a medium for speaking notes or text that suits the situation and their personal comfort.

When you are ready to practice delivering your speech, you might wonder what to include in your speaking notes. The
answer depends on what kind of delivery you plan to adopt.

            In chapter 17, we described four modes of delivery: extemporaneous, impromptu, memorized, and manuscript.
Two of these typically require no speaking notes. Speakers delivering impromptu speeches develop their speeches as
they speak, though they might jot down a note or two just before speaking. Memorized speeches should, by definition,
be committed to memory and thus similarly require no speaking notes.

            The other two modes of delivery--extemporaneous and manuscript--do necessitate written words to speak
from. As we defined in chapter 17, in a manuscript delivery, the speaker writes the entire address and utilizes the text in
delivering the speech. In that same chapter, we defined an extemporaneous delivery as when a speaker uses trimmed-
down notes to recall the speech's structure, key ideas, and any direct quotations or source citations.

            This chapter focuses first on how to prepare speaking notes for an extemporaneous delivery. We then offer tips
for preparing a manuscript for a manuscript delivery. We end by helping you consider what medium to use for your
notes or manuscript.

                                                              qualities in use, there is a sample presentation outline in
                                                              Appendix C.

Maintain Visual Cues from the Preparation Outline

Recall that in chapter 15, we talked about your preparation outline, or the draft you write as you plan and organize your
speech. We instructed you to adopt specific outlining principles for that outline and to include labels for such key com-
ponents as the introduction, conclusion, transitions, and thesis.

            The presentation outline keeps these visual cues and labels. Specifically, it visually shows the structure of your
speech by retaining the outlining symbols and indentations. That way, you can quickly glance at the page, locate your
place in the speech, and find the information you are looking for. The visual structure can also provide a brief reminder
of where you are going next. If you don't maintain symbols and indentation, you are forced to read through dense text
or a full paragraph to find the section you are looking for.

Strive for Brevity

The presentation outline replaces full sentences with keywords or phrases that jog your memory about your points or
information, as box 19.1 demonstrates. That means you find your specific wording or expression in the moment. The key-
words are simply there to prompt the ideas so you can choose your wording as you go. Consequently, your wording will
change slightly each time you deliver your speech using your presentation outline.

   Box 19.1 Sample Presentation Outline Excerpt
   Imagine delivering an extemporaneous speech on the subsection "Maintain Visual Cues from the Prepara
tion Outline." The presentation outline for that section might look like this:

             A. Maintain visual cues from preparation outline

                                                                     Preparing a Presentation Outline or Manuscript for an Effective Delivery | 235
                              1. Preparation outline: principles, visual labels
                              2. Presentation outline:

                                         a. Keep principles, labels
                                         b. Visually show structure by outlining symbols, indentation
                                         c. Can glance, locate information; find where to go next
                                         d. If not, forced to read
                   Notice how few words appear on each line--just enough to prompt the speaker's memory of what
       point or idea they want to convey.

            Choosing brevity prevents you from reading your speech and encourages you instead to connect with your
audience. Otherwise, if you write too much down, the temptation to read can be overwhelming, especially when you
feel nervous.

Write Out Minimal Elements

Even in a presentation outline, you will still want to fully write out a few elements of the speech. These include your
thesis, quotations, and spoken citations because accuracy is particularly important for each. In the sample presentation
outline in Appendix C, you will notice several occasions where these elements are written out. Just keep to a minimum
the speech elements you fully write out or, again, you will likely end up reading your speech.

Include Delivery Notes

As you practice your speech, you may receive feedback that you consistently mumble a phrase or you tend to read quo-
tations too quickly for an audience to follow. You may find you have trouble pronouncing a word or you leave out one
subpoint repeatedly. All this information is useful as you write your presentation outline.

            You can include delivery notes to help yourself through problem spots. Highlight the point you tend to skip.
Write out the difficult word phonetically. Remind yourself to "slow down here!" or "pause" in places where those ele-
ments of delivery will help your audience absorb the full impact of your words. Again, you can find examples of this in
the sample presentation outline in Appendix C.

            If you observe the four qualities of a presentation outline, you will more likely succeed in delivering your speech
extemporaneously. A presentation outline might even help you with other types of deliveries. You could use it in case
your memory goes blank while delivering a memorized speech or to jot down some ideas a few seconds or minutes
before delivering an impromptu speech. If delivering a manuscript speech, however, you should approach your speech
text differently.

236 | Preparing a Presentation Outline or Manuscript for an Effective Delivery
Preparing a Manuscript for a Manuscript Delivery

A manuscript delivery requires a manuscript--a fully written-out version of your speech. Unlike a presentation outline,
a manuscript typically looks more like an essay. Thus, it will likely include paragraphs rather than indentations, outlining
symbols, or labels.

            A manuscript delivery may seem rather easy. Just read your text. However, you still need to achieve the three
goals of an effective speech delivery established in chapter 17: engage the direct audience, enhance your ideas, and
strengthen your credibility. If you don't adequately prepare your manuscript, simply reading your speech is more likely
to bore your audience, distract from your ideas, and harm your credibility.

            How, then, can you prepare a manuscript for an effective delivery? We recommend you alter your manuscript
in the following ways to aid your success (and as demonstrated in box 19.2):

   Double-space the typed text and use a larger font (16, 18, or 20 point) so you can find your place more easily when
      you look down.

   Use such visual cues as underlining, bolding, or highlighting keywords or sentences to help draw your attention to
      them. Such cues enable you to maintain some eye contact with the audience while reducing the risk of losing your
      place.

   Include prompts or reminders in the manuscript to enhance your vocal and nonverbal delivery, such as your pro-
      nunciation, tone, volume adjustments, and pauses.

          Box 19.2 Sample Manuscript Excerpt
          If you delivered a manuscript speech of the very first paragraph of "Preparing a Manuscript for a Manu
       script Delivery," the manuscript might look like this:

          A manuscript delivery [LOUDER]

          likely include paragraphs rather
          than indentations, outlining
          symbols, or labels.

Choose the Medium for Your Presentation Outline or Manuscript

With the evolution of technology, it is hard to recommend one preferred medium or means of communication. Should
you print your presentation outline or manuscript onto paper or note cards? Or should you read or glance at them from
a tablet, phone, or laptop?

            To decide, learn as much about your speaking situation as possible:

   Will you have a podium? If so, note cards can rest easily and rather noiselessly there.
   Will it be a windy, outdoor setting? Perhaps a tablet or paper printout is better.
   Will you speak from a seated position, such as at a conference? Then speaking from a laptop might be ideal.

            In general, we recommend against using your phone for speaking notes, since the screen size is harder to read
and can fit less text, prompting you to continually look at your phone and scroll down.

            In addition to the speaking situation, consider what you find most reliable and comfortable. Perhaps you prefer
note cards for a presentation outline because their size forces you to include brief notes. Maybe you like speaking from
sheets of paper (especially tucked inside a professional-looking folder) so you don't have to change pages as often. Some
speakers like the convenience of a digital tablet so they never worry about getting their note cards mixed up or losing a
page. Whatever medium you choose, it is important to practice using your notes or manuscript.

Practice with Your Chosen Notes and Medium

It is hard to exaggerate the importance of practice, especially when sharpening your delivery. Practice with the medium
you have chosen for your notes or manuscript. The experience of speaking from your laptop can be very different from
printed pages you hold. Practicing ahead of time will help you find the best medium for you.

            Also practice with your presentation outline or manuscript. When delivering from your presentation outline,
you may discover you need to add words because you are forgetting your points. Perhaps, instead, you need to remove
words because you are relying too much on your notes. You might find one section overly confusing and need to rethink
it. Similarly, practicing with your manuscript will help you find the easiest font size for you to read from and where you
need to add or remove visual cues.

            Practicing with your presentation outline or manuscript ahead of your actual speech delivery leaves you time

238 | Preparing a Presentation Outline or Manuscript for an Effective Delivery
to make necessary adjustments. If you wait until just before your speech to produce your speaking notes or manuscript,
you may run into difficulties while delivering it for your audience.

     Summary

        This chapter discussed presentation outlines and manuscripts. It provided guidance on what to include in
     your speaking notes or manuscript and how to use it for an effective speech delivery. Specifically, it covered the
     following:

          Presentation (keyword) outlines are brief. They avoid full sentences in most places so you are forced to
             speak extemporaneously from your outline. They still maintain the visual cues of the preparation outline
             so you may find your way if you lose your place. It is a good idea to include delivery notes in your presen-
             tation outline.

          Manuscripts include every word you plan to say during your speech. They are typically written in para-
             graph form, but they are written in a larger font size, with visual prompts to aid your vocal and nonverbal
             delivery.

          Choose the medium for your presentation outline or manuscript--printed paper, note cards, tablet, or
             laptop--based on your speaking situation and personal comfort. Avoid using your phone.

          Practice your delivery using your presentation outline or manuscript in your chosen medium. Doing so
             will help you make necessary adjustments to ensure a smoother delivery on your actual speaking day.

20. Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative
Presentations

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Contrast different types of informative speaking.
          Explain the role of deliberative presentations in engaging public controversies.
          Demonstrate steps in the process of forming a deliberative presentation.

The number of US school shootings in recent years has
many Americans alarmed and calling for change. But fig-
uring out what should change, how, and who is responsi-
ble are difficult questions to answer. Should we tighten
security measures at schools? Better drill students and
staff for such emergencies? Increase the number of police
officers and enhance their training? Decrease classroom
sizes? Provide affordable and easy access to mental health
services? Stiffen background checks for purchasing guns?
Ban assault weapons?

            Difficult cases rarely offer one right answer or
one universally satisfying way forward. Instead, they raise

possible options, and opposing perspectives before mak-
ing decisions. In this chapter, we turn to a form of speech that effectively meets that need: informative speaking.

            In what follows, we first broadly outline the major features and types of informative speaking. The remainder of
this chapter and the following chapter focus on one version of informative speaking: the deliberative presentation. We
will define and explain the deliberative presentation as an especially useful way to address public controversies. We will
then explore the first three steps of preparing a deliberative presentation: selecting a wicked problem, researching the
problem, and discovering a range of approaches that address the wicked problem. Chapter 21 will discuss the remaining
steps of framing and organizing the problem for deliberation.

Informative Speaking

In informative speaking, a speaker educates their direct audience about a topic without leading them toward a particu-
lar position, conclusion, or outcome. Recall from chapter 10 that the direct audience consists of people who are exposed
to and attend to your speech.

                                                                                                 Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations | 241
            In this type of speaking, you set your personal preferences aside and present a neutral, fair, and inclusive under-
standing of the topic. Of course, none of us can remain completely impartial, and staying impartial does not prevent you
from sharing relevant, personal experiences. The goal is to do your best to keep your opinions in check to allow audience
members to arrive at their own conclusions.

                                                     The need for informative speaking in civic affairs may not be self-evident. After
                                         all, information has never been easier to obtain for people with access to the internet.
                                         However, the material provided through the internet can quickly become overwhelming,
                                         and not all of it is reliable.

                                                     Few of us have the time--or, at least, take the time--to thoughtfully discover, eval-
                                         uate, read, and process information from multiple sources. Instead, we may glance at
                                         headlines or articles in our social media feeds or even abandon the effort altogether. It can
                                         be tempting to leave civic affairs to public officials and specialists to save ourselves the
                                         trouble. Consequently, we remove ourselves from decision-making that may directly
impact our quality of life.
            Informative speaking, then, is critical to democratic participation. An informative speech empowers listeners by
drawing attention to public concerns, presenting relevant and reliable information from credible sources, and helping a
community make sense of that information.

Types of Informative Speeches in a Civic Engagement Context

Different kinds of informative speeches enable civic engagement in various ways. In this section we briefly describe
three types of informative speeches that aid democratic participation: instructional speeches, problem-focused
speeches, and deliberative presentations.

Instructional Speeches

An instructional speech explains or teaches an audience about a process, concept, or entity to help community members
participate in civic affairs more easily and confidently. This type of informative speech stops short of actively promoting
involvement or prescribing particular actions. Such advocacy becomes persuasion and is the focus of chapters 24 and
25. Instead, you simply lay the groundwork for involvement should an audience member choose to take part.

          Box 20.1 Instructional Speech Topics
          In instructional speeches, speakers provide information so audience members can better understand and
       participate in the community's affairs. For example,

             How does a meeting run? You might educate new members of an organization about the rules. Sev-
                eral of this textbook's authors, for instance, have delivered an instructional speech to new professors
                about the parliamentary procedures used during faculty meetings. We sought to educate new mem-
                bers so they could understand what was happening during a meeting and more easily participate.

             What are club expectations? You might deliver an instructional speech about the history, member-

242 | Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations
        ship, and expectations of a club or organization you belong to at your school.

            Notice that in both examples, speakers would not explicitly advocate for participation in faculty
meetings or campus organizations.

Problem-Focused Speeches

                                                                 Problem-focused speeches identify, describe, and
                                                              explain a civic problem. The goal is to help an audience
                                                              understand the issue and possibly prepare them to
                                                              address it. Most typically, a problem-focused informative
                                                              speech will explain the problem's history, impacts on
                                                              those affected, probable cause(s), and major components.
                                                              Such a speech avoids naming or advocating a solution,
                                                              though it might explain previous efforts to address the
                                                              problem.

                                                                 The emphasis of a problem-focused speech can
                                                              vary based on your audience:

 If your audience is unaware of a problem, you might highlight and explain it.

        Example: A dangerous intersection in town you notice on your commute to campus but your
            peers miss because most live on-site.

 If your audience is aware of the problem but perceives it as too minor to merit immediate action,
   you can increase your audience's sense of urgency about a problem.

        Example: The overpopulation of animals at your community's animal shelter. Most people are
            aware that animal shelters fill up with stray animals. However, they may not appreciate exactly
            how many animals are left at the shelter daily, the stress animals experience in tight quarters
            due to overcrowding, and the high costs associated with supporting (or, sadly, terminating)
            unwanted animals.

 If your audience misunderstands a well-known problem, you should strengthen and even correct
   their knowledge about it.

        Example: The rising cost of college tuition. An issue like this is broadly recognized as problem-
            atic, but some community members may know little about why your college raises tuition or

                                                              Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations | 243
what trade-offs it must make to avoid doing so. A problem-focused speech could verify, supple-
ment, and possibly correct popular beliefs about the problem.

Deliberative Presentations

A deliberative presentation strives to fairly and evenhandedly describe a civic problem and multiple approaches to
solving it. Emphasis is placed on the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. A deliberative presentation functions
as the setup or preparation for a deliberative discussion, which is a group conversation through which a community,
guided by one or more moderators, examines a complex public problem and a range of available solutions to ultimately
arrive at a choice or conclusion. Together, the deliberative presentation and subsequent discussion form the delibera
tive process (also referred to simply as deliberation). The deliberative process involves a presentation of a problem and
multiple options and a subsequent moderated discussion of those options (though the format and timing of both parts
can vary).

Box 20.3 The Deliberative Process

244 | Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations
The nature and emphasis of the deliberative process is

educational. We want to better understand the problem

and investigate each solution in the most open manner

possible. Note the emphasis on probing and contrasting

solutions to the problem, unlike a problem-focused

speech.

         Indeed, the ultimate end goal--and a key distin-

guishing feature of the deliberative process--is that the

participating community chooses the option it wants to

pursue or at least outlines the next steps required. Ideally,

the process results in consensus on a way forward, but

that may not always be the case. Eventually, traditional

persuasive efforts and/or voting may be appropriate.           Image by geralt via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.

                          The deliberative process

         is ideally suited to address a public controversy, or what others have called a wicked prob

         lem--that is, an issue that is difficult to resolve because it involves diverse values and perspec-
         tives about what the problem is, who is responsible, and how it should be addressed.1 A wicked

         problem is widely acknowledged as a problem and draws broad concern locally, nationally, or

         even internationally. It may be persistent, such as the issues of gun violence and immigration; or

         it may become prominent at certain moments and then die down only to resurface again later,

such as controversies over oil spills and nuclear power. The point is that wicked problems are never completely resolved;

they can only be gradually improved. In contrast, tame problems are simpler issues that can be solved with expertise.

variables that evolve in unpredictable ways. Thus, the effects of any decision made about a wicked problem cannot be
fully anticipated.

          Box 20.5 The Contingent Nature of Wicked Problems
          What are the answers to these questions about how to end or reduce school shootings?
             Will increasing security at schools lessen school shootings and bring them to an end more quickly?

                Or will such measures traumatize kids or make them feel like criminals?
             Would stronger background checks for gun ownership and bans on certain weapons decrease

                shooters' access to weapons? Or will they leave kids and teachers more vulnerable to attacks?
             Might providing more affordable mental health services steer possible shooters toward more pro-

                ductive outlets? Or will that provision shift necessary funding away from police staffing, training, and
                protective gear?

                   We cannot know the answers to questions like these with absolute certainty because too many
       unpredictable variables influence the outcomes. If we knew the answers with certainty, disagreements and
       discussion would be unnecessary because the best decision would be self-evident.

            Because informative speaking is educational, it typically takes place before we select or advocate for any solu-
tion, conclusion, or belief. Communities need to know and understand before they can select and decide. Whatever the
type of speech, informative speaking should result in an improved understanding of the topic addressed. In the case of
deliberative speaking, audience members should also have a thorough review of several possible solutions. Because of
the importance of deliberative presentations, we will focus the remainder of this chapter and the next chapter on the
steps involved in producing and delivering such an address.

Preparing a Deliberative Presentation

The specific steps you should take to prepare a deliberative presentation include selecting a wicked problem, research-
ing the problem, discovering a range of approaches, framing the issue for deliberation, and organizing the presentation.
This chapter will explain the first three steps, and the next chapter will focus on framing and organization.

                    Specify the value(s) that motivate each approach.
          5. Organize the deliberative presentation.

Selecting a Wicked Problem

Developing a deliberative presentation begins with identifying a wicked problem. Your instinct may be to shy away from
difficult issues, particularly those you know little about. This reaction is natural, but try to resist it. Take the initiative
to educate yourself. Effective democracies rely on participants who learn and help make decisions about civic mat-
ters--and who do not shy away from conflicting viewpoints. In fact, democracy thrives on diverse views and on rea-
soned, thoughtful discussion. As a student of public communication, learn to embrace productive conflict as a healthy
element of democracy. You cannot avoid conflict without also avoiding participation in democratic governance.

          Box 20.7 Identifying a Wicked Problem
                    1. List all the communities of which you are a part: your college, hometown, church, employment,

                 online activity, state, and so on.
                                        a. Think about the problems each group is facing. Write them down.
                                        b. Look over your list. Which of the problems you identified meets the definition of a

                                     wicked problem: It is difficult to resolve because it involves diverse values and per-
                                     spectives about what the problem is, who is responsible, and how it should be
                                     addressed.
                    2. Ask yourself, "What's important to me? Which issues really matter to me? What is upsetting to
                 me?" Write down your answers.

                                        a. Do other members of your community share these concerns?
                                        b. Which of the problems you identified meets the definition of a wicked problem?

Researching the Wicked Problem

                                                                    Once you have selected a wicked problem, use the
                                                                 advice provided in chapters 8 and 9 to research the issue
                                                                 and to identify and correct misinformation and disinfor-
                                                                 mation--particularly about the problem, its background,
                                                                 impacts, and contributing factors.

                                                                    Box 20.8 Researching Information About the

                                                                 If you focused your deliberative presentation on

Image by Nick Morrison via Unsplash, Unsplash License.           school shootings, what kinds of information should
                                                                 you find in your research? What would the audi-

ence need to know so they could base their opinions on accurate knowledge rather than presumptions,

guesses, or misinformation? We would recommend you research the following:

 previous school shootings (how many, their locations, their nature [targeted or as a result of a dis-
   pute])

 number of victims
 demographic information about the shooters
 whether and how the number is trending compared to previous years
 past responses to school shootings (by police, medical personnel, legislative bodies, schools and

   students themselves)
 prevention efforts (such as wellness and security measures taken by schools)

       What else might you include?

            Factual information alone, however, cannot resolve a wicked problem. You must
also consider the people impacted by, and invested in, the issue. In chapter 10, we identified
the implicated audience as people affected by your message if it succeeds. We also intro-
duced the concept of personal stakes, which are an individual's financial, material, and/or
psychological investments that can be improved or worsened based on how an issue is
addressed. A slight variation on implicated audiences and personal stakes is the idea of
stakeholders, or groups and organizations that have vested interests in a wicked problem
and its outcome because of the impact on their lives.

            Every public issue impacts many different groups, so you should also research mul-
tiple stakeholders. Discovering their needs, lived experiences, values, and preferences can help you better under-
stand--and inform your direct audience about--the issue from multiple angles.

248 | Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations
                                             You might also be a stakeholder yourself in the wicked problem you've chosen. If so,
                                 reflect on your own experiences and interests to inform your presentation. Relying too much on
                                 your own knowledge, however, will likely blind you to aspects of the problem you have never expe-
                                 rienced or considered because of your standpoint. Recall from chapter 7 that standpoint theory
                                 suggests that our social identities influence our knowledge of the world and our perceptions of
                                 what is true or normal. In the case of school shootings, for example, our identity is likely to influ-
                                 ence our perceptions of shooters, guns, gun violence, and police officers. If you are a white person
   who lives in a rural setting, for instance, you are more likely to associate school shootings with troubled kids and asso-
   ciate police officers and guns with offering potential safety and protection.
               By researching and discovering additional stakeholders, you will discover not only additional perspectives but
   also how stakeholders are differently impacted by the wicked problem. Indeed, we recommend you research how
   inequity plays a role in the wicked problem and who it particularly impacts.

             Box 20.9 Researching Stakeholders in the Wicked Problem of School Shootings
             Stakeholders that quickly come to mind for school shootings include stu-
          dents and their families, teachers, and school staff members. You might count
          yourself among these stakeholders as a student who practiced drills in high
          school, knows a victim of gun violence, or has experienced gun violence first-
          hand. Consider what insights you can bring from your experience.

                       Recognize, however, that not all students (or teachers or families)
          experience the problem similarly. You will find the following, for example:

                People associated with wealthier, rural, and mostly white-populated
                   schools are more likely to fear school-targeted shootings because they largely occur in those settings.

                Students, teachers, and families associated with urban, poor, and mostly minority student bodies
                   are more likely to fear shootings related to disputes and accidents, which occur more frequently at
                   these settings and much more often than school-targeted shootings. Nearly half (47%) of shootings at
                   K-12 schools from 2009 to 2019 were caused by disputes or accidents; only 14% were "school tar
                   geted," such as in Parkland, Florida.2 Accordingly, students who are minorities are more likely to be
                   victims of school shootings, yet they are less likely to receive news coverage, since "the most violent
                   (and least common) stories [about school shootings] make the headlines."3

                Recognizing the differences will help you and the direct audience to better identify the issue's com-
                   plexity and avoid conflating one stakeholder's experience with another's.

                       Also ask yourself, Beyond students, teachers, and their families, who else has a stake in the issue of
          school shootings and how it's resolved? You might include the following stakeholders:

             police officers who are expected to respond swiftly and effectively to anyone inflicting harm on
                students

             organizations that have a somewhat narrower stake in how the use of guns is addressed, such as
                reform advocates like Moms Demand Action and rights activists such as the National Rifle Associa-
                tion, not to mention owners of businesses that sell guns and those who promote and teach gun safety
                   If you pushed yourself even more, you might add stakeholders such as the following:

             legislators who provide school funding, hold police forces accountable, and pass laws that govern
                gun rights

             news media reporters who make decisions about how to report school shootings
             gender studies educators like Jackson Katz and Richard Majors and Jennifer Mancini Billson who

                research and teach about connections between masculinity and violence

            Your thinking about stakeholders should not result in telling your audience a laundry list of groups. Instead,
use this work to clarify for your audience how the wicked problem differently affects the lives and interests of diverse
groups and thus why their preferences might conflict. For instance, include examples of differing stakeholders when
educating your audience about the wicked problem. As you discover and explain diverse approaches to the problem--a
task we turn to next--specify which stakeholders are benefited and harmed by each approach and how.

Discovering a Range of Approaches

Once you have selected a wicked problem and researched its elements and stakeholders, identify a range of approaches
to improving the issue. As discussed in chapter 2, we tend to divide issues into two sides, often "for" a policy change
and "against" it. This binary approach is popular, but it reduces complicated issues to tidy, oppositional dichotomies as
if everyone on each side is in complete agreement and no one from opposing sides agrees on anything.

          Box 20.10 Avoid Two Opposing Approaches to the Wicked Problem
          The issue of school shootings can easily become a two-sided debate over gun regulation. People are iden-
       tified as being either

250 | Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations
for                        or                        against gun regulation

                           which is assumed to mean

total prohibition of guns  vs.                       unrestricted gun access

            Of course, few people hold such extreme views either way. Generally speaking,

     those in favor of gun regulation do not propose that all guns be removed or banned from law-abid-
        ing citizens, and

     those against gun regulation are not in support of all persons having unlimited access to all types of
        weapons.

            When we oversimplify positions as one extreme or another, we tend to lose sight of our common
problem: "How do we best ensure our children's safety?" We also overlook more moderate and nuanced
options. These could range from waiting periods and increased background checks and registration to "red
flag" laws, permits, and legislation based on factors like age, criminal record, or intellectual ability.

            Try to avoid getting caught up in two-sided policy debates. Do not make two of your approaches the extremes
in a debate and the third approach a halfway measure or compromise between them. Such a setup prompts a debate
rather than a deliberation, or it encourages most participants to choose the third option.

            Instead, seek a much wider range of approaches. As box 20.11 advises, brainstorming, considering stakeholders'
interests, and researching will help you find suitable and diverse approaches. You might, for instance, discover how
inequity or systems of oppression contribute to the wicked problem and focus one approach on targeting such inequity.

   Box 20.11 Discovering at Least Three Approaches to a Wicked Problem

   The challenge of discovering at least three approaches for a deliberative presentation can be overcome by
following a few tips:

     Brainstorm: Write down all the pertinent beliefs, opinions, and specific public actions that come to
        mind. You can even imagine additional approaches or possible actions that others may not have con-
        sidered.

     Consider stakeholders: Return to the research you conducted on the stakeholders in this contro-
        versy. What policies and approaches did each advocate? Consider interviewing several key stakehold-
        ers, following the guidelines provided in chapter 9, to learn more about their experiences,
        perspectives, and preferred approaches.

     Research the issue: Focus particularly on sources that express public opinions and perspectives,
        such as letters to the editor or opinion editorials, news interviews, YouTube videos, podcasts, blogs,
        websites devoted to advocating a group's perspective, and opinion polls.

            As you gather perspectives, preferences, and policy ideas, refrain from evaluating their merit. The sole criterion
is that all ideas listed are reasonable. Options that no one in their right mind would choose are not useful for a delibera-
tive presentation.

            Then look for repetition or similarities across the ideas so you can sort them into three approaches to present
to your audience. By approach we mean a broad category of similar opinions on how to address a wicked problem, typi-
cally gathered around a shared logic and value. A single approach should be broad enough to include several, and possi-
bly conflicting, actions by multiple actors.

Box 20.12 Sample Approaches to the Wicked Problem of School Shootings

the logic that if it is more difficult to bring or
hide a gun on school property, there will be
fewer shootings there.

tors at entrances, and hire
more on-site security officers.

   2. Improve youth wellness. Such an
approach poses the logic that if communi-
ties know and attend to young people's

then they will be less likely to resort to
shooting each other.

   b. All these ideas are included in one approach because they emphasize youths' men
tal health and wellness, though people attracted to this approach might disagree on
which specific sample actions will be most effective.

3. What might be a third broad approach?

252 | Speaking Informatively Through Deliberative Presentations
            Rest assured there is no one right set of three approaches for any wicked problem, and you might even want
to present four or five. Your goal is simply to provide a set of truly divergent approaches that account for most, if not
all, of the concerns and opinions you discovered about the wicked problem. Everyone in the community who hears your
deliberative presentation should be able to find their own outlook somewhere in the approaches you provide.

     Summary

        Informative speaking educates an audience about a topic without biasing them toward a particular position,
     conclusion, or outcome. It helps provide the understanding necessary for productive public exchanges and
     decision-making to follow. Specifically, this chapter covered the following:

          By providing an audience with reliable information about public affairs, informative speaking helps
             community members participate in civic concerns more confidently and actively.

          Two common types of informative speeches include instructional speeches, which teach an audience
             about a process, concept, or entity, and problem-focused speeches that describe and explain a civic
             problem.

          A third type of informative speech is a deliberative presentation, which fairly and evenhandedly
             describes a wicked problem and multiple approaches to solving it with an emphasis on the benefits and
             drawbacks of each approach.

          Three of the five steps to form a deliberative presentation are selecting a wicked problem, researching
             the problem, and finding a range of approaches.

21. Framing and Organizing Deliberative
Presentations

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Recognize framing in a public speech.
          Practice deliberative framing for a deliberative presentation.
          Organize a deliberative presentation.

The previous chapter introduced deliberative presentations as a type of informative speech. As we explained, in a delib-
erative presentation, the speaker strives to fairly and evenhandedly describe a wicked problem and multiple approaches
to solving the problem. This presentation prepares a community for a deliberative discussion in which participants
examine the problem and approaches to ultimately decide, together, how best to address the issue.

            Preparing a deliberative presentation involves five steps. The previous chapter discussed the first three steps:
choosing a wicked problem, researching the problem, and discovering a range of approaches that address the problem.
This chapter picks up with the fourth and fifth steps: framing and organizing the deliberative presentation. We'll first
explain framing as a rhetorical concept and differentiate persuasive framing from deliberative framing. We will then
explain how to frame a deliberative presentation, followed by advising you on how to organize a deliberative presenta-
tion. The chapter ends by reflecting on the limitations and benefits of informative speeches.

Framing

Framing refers to the use of language to order and make sense of the world. That is, framing is how we employ language
to help shape perceptions of reality. Consequently, you should be conscious of the language you employ when discussing
public issues. For any complex and controversial social issue, your words can influence what an audience notices and
thinks about, as well as what they overlook or downplay, when drawing conclusions.

            The framing of any civic issue typically consists of three parts: It identifies or defines the
problem (i.e., what's wrong), its cause (i.e., who's to blame), and the solution (i.e., what should be
done). Every issue-specific frame includes--and typically promotes--these three elements, whether
they are explicitly stated or merely implied.

            You can use framing strategically when trying to persuade an audience, but framing for
deliberation should strive for neutrality and fairness. We'll explain this distinction next.

                                                                                                            Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations | 255
Box 21.1 Framing as a Rhetorical Concept

                                                            To better understand framing, consider a more
                                                         typical use of the word. Think about the frames you
                                                         use to border pictures or pieces of artwork. The
                                                         size, color, and pattern of a frame can influence
                                                         what you see or notice in the picture or art itself.

                                                         inside the frame and what parts to exclude (or crop
                                                         out) significantly affects what viewers see and
                                                         notice in the resulting framed image. Discursive
                                                         framing (i.e., frames created by language) functions
                                                         similarly.

                                                         Many of our disagreements result from conflicting frames

                                                         for the same issue. Persuasive framing, then, occurs

when a speaker strategically names or defines an issue in a way that sets up their desired outcome as effective and rea-

sonable. Box 21.2 provides examples. Persuasive framing also typically involves stressing the advantages of the speaker's

preferred solution and downplaying or ignoring its drawbacks. We will further explore this type of framing in chapter 25

when we discuss persuasion.

   Box 21.2 Sample Persuasive Framing

   When it comes to illegal immigration, speakers' language choices often signify their persuasive framing of
the issue. For example, compare two different uses of language to describe unlawful immigration:

     "Illegal aliens" points to immigration as the problem, blames the immigrants for entering the coun-
        try unlawfully, and typically promotes the solutions of deportation and securing our borders.

     "Undocumented workers" or "unauthorized immigrants" implies the problem is the lack of proper
        documentation or authorization (such as a certificate of citizenship), blames the long delays and sig-
        nificant costs immigrants face when applying for legal US citizenship, and typically promotes the
        solution of legislative reform to the citizenship process.

            Notice how the problem, cause, and solutions identified in both frames correspond with each
other; they compose an internal logic or coherent point of view.

256 | Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations
Deliberative Framing

Since deliberative presentations are informative rather than persuasive, a speaker must establish the problem and pos-
sible solutions as clearly and neutrally as possible. Deliberative framing, then, occurs when a speaker names or defines
the issue in a way all parties can agree upon and encourages the fair and direct comparison of approaches. By adopting
deliberative framing, you enhance the audience's ability to make a group decision about how best to move forward.

            Deliberative framing can be tricky, however, because each of the approaches you explore likely offers its own
persuasive framing that defines the problem in a way that leads the audience to its preferred solution. Avoid adopting
persuasive framings so you can encourage the public to consider more than one way of solving the problem.

            How do you do that? We now turn to the work required to successfully frame a wicked problem for deliberation:
define the problem fairly, identify the trade-offs of each approach, and specify the value or values that motivate each
option.

Defining the Problem Fairly

It is critical that you define the wicked problem fairly; otherwise, the language you use can bias the audience in favor of
one of the approaches. To depict the problem fairly, we recommend you adopt a common definition, phrase the problem
as a "how" or "what" question, and avoid language used by proponents of any one approach.

            First, find a common definition of the problem that all interested parties can agree upon--one that identifies
the core issue all the approaches are trying to solve. To do so, you typically want to articulate the problem at a greater
level of abstraction or generality than the definition offered by any one of the groups involved. That means presenting
the problem as bigger than any specific actor (person, group, organization, or institution) or action. Doing so captures
the ultimate focus of all interested parties, invites a variety of perspectives to be expressed, and enables a community
to compare them more easily.

            Second, phrase the problem as a "how" or "what" question, because these questions invite multiple answers.
Avoid using "should," "does," or "is" to begin your question because they invite only two sides (for and against, or yes and
no).

            Finally, avoid language that is used by advocates for any one approach or else the conversation will unfairly
favor that preference and unhelpfully narrow the issue. Box 21.3 offers an example of a problem definition that follows
these suggestions.

            By following these guidelines for defining the problem, no one cause of the problem is stated or clearly implied.
Instead, any number of causes could--and should--be identified, revealing the complexity of the wicked problem and
opening the door to numerous solutions or approaches as reasonable.

          Box 21.3 Defining the Problem for a Deliberative Conversation About School Shootings
          To help explain how to define the problem fairly for deliberative framing, let's take the wicked problem of
       school shootings. Compare the following appropriate and inappropriate ways of defining the problem and
       asking about the problem.

decrease school shootings?"
                                   search students' backpacks?"  restricting gun ownership?"

Identifying Trade-Offs

In addition to defining the problem fairly, deliberative framing requires you to identify the trade-offs of every approach.
                                   Trade-offs are the relative advantages and disadvantages that accompany every approach to a
                                   wicked problem. Each solution offers certain benefits and drawbacks, prioritizes some people's
                                   needs and neglects or diminishes others, and poses challenges for implementation. Making
                                   wise choices requires understanding the drawbacks to each approach as well as the benefits.
                                               The emphasis on trade-offs contrasts with persuasive framing, which typically only
                                   stresses the advantages of the speaker's preferred solution. Deliberative framing encourages
                                   us instead to comprehend that every wicked problem has multiple sides and no magic solution
                                   exists--one choice that stands out as the most obvious, that defeats the opposing views, or

that will result in 100% agreement.

258 | Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations
          Box 21.4 Discovering the Trade-Offs of Each Approach
          To discover trade-offs, answer the following questions by going back through your research and thinking
       on your own:

                    1. What are the benefits of this approach?
                    What advantages are gained?
                    Which stakeholders benefit from this approach, or whose needs are prioritized by this

                        approach?
                    2. What are the drawbacks of this approach?
                    What disadvantages are incurred?
                    Which stakeholders are hurt by this approach, or whose needs are neglected or devalued?

                        Recognize that a single approach can simultaneously benefit one stakeholder while hurting
                        another.
                    3. What challenges might arise when implementing this approach?
                   Example: Returning to the example of school shootings, we can predict that increasing the fre-
       quency and realism of security drills at schools would likely mitigate the damage and end a shooting more
       quickly.
                   But...
                   It would simultaneously scare children who experience the drills as if they were real, which could
       decrease their ability to learn and flourish.

Weighing Competing Values

Further frame your topic for deliberation by identifying the value or set of values that motivates each approach. A value
refers to a principle or quality that human beings are committed to and on which they base their thinking and decisions
for important issues. Values tend to be central to our self-identity and to our community's identity.

            To understand more clearly how values function in public controversies, we need to establish several principles:
(1) we agree generally upon the attraction of basic values, (2) our value hierarchies typically shift from issue to issue and
sometimes from case to case, and (3) even when we agree to prioritize the same value for a specific case, we may define
or apply the value differently. Let's briefly explore each principle.

   1. We agree generally upon the attraction of basic values, such as loyalty, freedom, and equality. Speakers, however,
often imply they support a value (freedom, for instance) while their opponent does not. That is rarely the case.

   Instead, though we agree on most values, we rank them differently. A value hierarchy is a list of values ranked
      from the most to the least important.

                    Example: If you and another person create a value hierarchy for equality, responsibility, freedom, family,
                    cooperation, and creativity, you might each, for your own reasons, designate distinct orders. If that occurs

                                                                                                            Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations | 259
                  with a group of just six values, imagine how much you would diverge when ranking a significantly larger
                  number of the hundreds of values that exist!

 When you and another person prioritize different values, a value dilemma emerges. A value dilemma represents a
   difficult choice among competing values, especially those associated with policy options.

   Box 21.5 The Value Dilemma over the School Shooting in Parkland, Florida

   On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz walked into
his former school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High
School, in Parkland, Florida, and began shooting. He
killed seventeen people and wounded fourteen
more. Reactions to this horrific incident reveal the
value dilemma it presented as stakeholders priori-
tized diverse values to address it.

 Security: Scot Peterson, the sheriff's

deputy assigned to protect the school, did

not enter the school building during the six-

minute massacre. He was charged with (but        Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School sign by Coral Springs
later acquitted for) child neglect and culpable  Talk via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY.
negligence because of his alleged failure to

provide security for the kids.

 Life: Cruz used an AR-15-style semiautomatic weapon to murder classmates. About a month later,

on March 24, 2018, survivors of the shooting organized March for Our Lives to protest gun violence

and demand legislators pass gun control measures. Florida representatives responded by raising the

age required to buy firearms in Florida and passing a "red flag" law to remove guns from potential

threats.

 Freedom: The National Rifle Association sued Florida, saying the increased age requirement to own

a gun violated the freedom granted in the Second and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States

Constitution. President Trump made similar comments and called to arm teachers with firearms

instead.

 Health: Cruz suffered from depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism, lead-

ing Trump to comment on Cruz's mental health. Florida's legislature increased funding for mental

health assistance at schools.

            What do you think? Which value(s) would you prioritize to address a US school shooting? How does
that choice impact the other values listed here? What other current wicked problems are creating tensions
between multiple values?

2. Our value hierarchies typically shift from issue to issue and sometimes from case to case. Changing your value hierarchy
does not mean you lack principles or consistency. It simply means you recognize the contingent nature of public con-
troversies.

             Example 1: A person who prioritizes "life" in the abortion controversy (and thus opposes most or all abortions)
          might prioritize justice over life in the case of capital punishment (and thus favor the death penalty even though
          it means terminating a life).

260 | Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations
             Example 2: Someone who generally favors capital punishment might oppose it when the criminal has an intel-
          lectual disability or is underage, thereby placing fairness (in that these criminals cannot be held fully responsible
          for their actions) over justice.
   3. Even when we agree to prioritize the same value for a specific case, we may define or apply the value differently. There-
fore, a speaker should not merely name the value prioritized by an approach but explain how it is defined and applied to
the problem.

             Example: Regarding school shootings, many people argue that safety is important. But what is considered
          "safe"? Arming teachers sounds to some like it will increase safety. That same action to others, however, sounds
          unsafe because of the increased likelihood of accidental shootings and the possible differential treatment by
          police toward Black teachers who carry a weapon compared to white teachers.

            In sum, value dilemmas play a critical role in our conflicts, but too often rhetors speak in ways that hide or sim-
plify them. Part of your job is to help your audience recognize, understand, and ultimately discuss the value dilemmas
that undergird their disagreements. Doing so will provide the foundation they need to understand their conflicts and
find creative ways to move forward together. But how can you present your findings and information in ways that facil-
itate such progress? We turn next to the final step of preparing a deliberative presentation.

Organizing the Deliberative Presentation

For your presentation to serve its purpose, it must also be clearly organized. Refer to chapters 12 through 14 to recall
why clear organization is important, how to organize main points, and how to develop an introduction, conclusion, and
transitions. Here we will suggest ways to tailor an introduction, main points, and conclusion for a deliberative presen-
tation.

            In addition to an attention-getter, the introduction might include a central idea (rather than a thesis statement).
For a deliberative presentation, your central idea should name the wicked problem as a "what" or "how" question since
this question is the presentation's focus. Your introduction might also include a preview statement that indicates the
main points or sections. See Appendix A for an example of these suggestions.

            You may find it useful to structure your main points using the problem-alternatives-solution pattern of
arrangement discussed in chapter 13 without the solution step included. That means the body of a deliberative presenta-
tion could include four main points:

   one main point that explains the problem and
   a main point devoted to each of the three approaches explained. These are the options or alternatives offered for

      the audience to compare and contrast.
   Notice there is no main point focused on a preferred solution, since that would make the speech persuasive rather

      than deliberative in nature.

The main points devoted to the approaches could explain the logic of each approach in addressing the problem, its ben-
efits and drawbacks, and the value(s) it prioritizes.

            You can conclude by restating the wicked problem and three perspectives and inviting the audience to engage
the information you provided through a deliberative discussion.

          Box 21.6 Deliberative Presentation Media

                                                                                                            Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations | 261
          A deliberative presentation can be delivered through at least three different media:

             A speech delivered by an individual or group of people. Often the same person or people who
                deliver the speech then function as moderators of the deliberative discussion (discussed in chapter
                22).

             A short film or video. A video can more easily humanize the issue by including video clips of people
                affected by the problem and/or people voicing support for each of the approaches.

             A written booklet. The National Issues Forum has made what it (and now others) call "issue books"
                popular. Such booklets are typically concise, yet dense, explanations of a wicked problem and three
                approaches, though their precise format varies.

                   Of course, a deliberative presentation can be delivered with two or more of the media listed. Some
       deliberation practitioners, for instance, provide an issue book to the public in advance of a deliberative dis-
       cussion and then show a short video right before the discussion to remind them of the options and to edu-
       cate anyone who did not read the booklet.

            Ultimately, creating a deliberative presentation using the five steps outlined in this and the previous chapter
will help you prepare an audience for a deliberative discussion. A successful deliberative presentation in any form helps
create an environment in which participants are able and willing to listen to each other.

Limitations and Benefits of Informative Speaking

                                          Informative speaking can empower ordinary people to participate in public concerns
                                          more knowledgably and actively. However, if done poorly, informative speaking can leave
                                          an audience confused, overwhelmed, and even less likely to become active in civic affairs.
                                          You might think of a speech you heard that simply regurgitated piles of information.
                                          Maybe the speaker stated statistic after statistic, or maybe they simply compiled a list of
                                          facts or quotations. The speaker needed to help the audience make sense of the informa-
                                          tion, such as by clearly organizing the speech and more effectively explaining how the
                                          pieces of information related to each other.

                                                       Informative speaking can also manipulate or con-
                                          strain an audience. When dishonestly developed, a speech
can disguise itself as educational when it actually promotes a particular viewpoint, solution,
or action. We might think of the example of infomercials, so called for presenting them-
selves as informative programs but functioning as commercials to sell products. Audiences
must always be wary of informative speeches that rely on biased sources, fail to provide
more than one perspective, present overly simplistic depictions of alternative viewpoints,
or identify only the positive points of a perspective.
            Even given these limitations, the benefits of informative speaking in general and
deliberative presentations in particular far outweigh the dangers. Well-researched, fair, and balanced informative
speeches equip ordinary community members to take an active and influential role in civic affairs.

262 | Framing and Organizing Deliberative Presentations
Summary

   The process of forming a deliberative presentation involves the steps of framing the topic for deliberation
and organizing the presentation. Specifically, the chapter covered the following:

     Framing is the use of language to make sense and shape perceptions of the world. The framing of any
        civic issue typically consists of three parts: It identifies or defines the problem, its cause, and the solution.

     Deliberative framing of a problem requires a speaker to fairly define the problem so all parties agree
        with its characterization, identify trade-offs for every approach, and identify the competing values
        among the approaches.

     Organizing a deliberative presentation is likely to draw on the problem-alternatives-solution pattern of
        reasoning without the solution step included.

     If done poorly, informative speaking can endanger civic engagement by overwhelming or confusing an
        audience. If presented dishonestly, informative speaking can actually advocate a particular solution or
        perspective.

advantages over debate. It improves participants' under-
standing of an issue's complexity, helps them find com-
mon ground among competing interests, and enables
them to make hard choices. This chapter will help you
better understand the nature of a deliberative discussion
and how to lead and participate in one.

            We will begin this chapter by identifying the
major goals of a deliberative discussion. We will then
introduce you briefly to the history of deliberative discus-
sions in the United States. Next, the chapter will identify
five intellectual virtues that participants in deliberative
discussions should adopt to help ensure productive con-
versations. The chapter will end by considering the gen-
eral benefits and limitations of deliberative discussions.

Goals of Deliberative Discussions

In chapter 20, we defined a deliberative discussion as a group conversation through which a community, guided by
one or more moderators, examines a complex public problem and a range of available solutions to ultimately arrive at
a choice or conclusion. We explained that the deliberative discussion nearly always follows some type of deliberative
presentation (though both may vary in format and timing). Together, the deliberative presentation and subsequent dis-
cussion form the deliberative process, or what some people refer to simply as deliberation.

            A deliberative discussion strives to produce both public knowledge and public judgment. Let's talk briefly about
each goal.

Public Knowledge

Public knowledge refers to participants' shared and improved understanding of the wicked prob-
lem and possible solutions as they offer and hear multiple points of view. Recall standpoint theory
from chapter 7, which posits that our social identities influence our knowledge of the world and
our perceptions of what is "true" or "normal."

                                                   By hearing and genuinely considering viewpoints, experi-
                                       ences, and values from participants with differing standpoints, delib-
                                       erative discussion shifts us from our individual, partial knowledge to a
                                       shared, public knowledge that is more robust. Public knowledge develops as we, together,
                                       better recognize the complexity of problems, the merits of alternative views, and the
                                       demerits of our originally preferred solution.

             produce public judgment: the community's thoughtful choice about its desired approach or next
                steps to address the problem based on the public knowledge developed during the discussion

Public Judgment

A deliberative discussion's ultimate goal is to produce public judgment. Public judgment
is the community's thoughtful choice about its desired approach or next steps to address
the problem. Public judgment is based on the public knowledge developed during the
discussion.

            Two elements are worth noting here: First is that the group's choice comes after
they have produced public knowledge. That timing helps prevent what modern psychol-
ogy scholars call groupthink, which is a phenomenon that occurs when members' desire
for harmony outweighs their willingness to critically examine alternative perspectives.
Such critical examination (including scrutiny and disagreement) is required in a deliber-
ative discussion.

            The second aspect worth noting is that a deliberative discussion seeks to move participants to choice making.
The ultimate goal of a deliberative discussion is for participants to choose the next best step(s) to solve the problem and
ease the controversy, having considered the trade-offs of at least three broad approaches.

            The next steps chosen can vary widely, such as adopting a particular approach, exploring new options, or find-
ing answers to questions raised during the discussion. Naturally, participants in a deliberative discussion will not always
come to an agreement about the next step(s) to take. But because they have thoughtfully considered the options and
competing interests together, each will be prepared to advance a thoughtful proposal.

The "Public" in Public Knowledge and Public Judgment

Keep in mind that the "public" in public knowledge and public judgment signals that a public is required to produce
each together as a group. Recall from chapter 2 that a public refers to a collection of people who are joined together in
a cause of common concern. Thus, public knowledge and public judgment can only be achieved by such a collection of
people. These goals cannot be attained by individuals working alone. Box 22.2 offers an example of a public that engaged
in deliberative discussion. In the next section, we look back historically to recognize the long legacy of deliberative dis-
cussions to aid public decision-making.

   A deliberative discussion occurred in Indiana in
2022 to address the management of a local water-
shed. A watershed is an area of land that directs
rainfall and snowmelt toward local creeks, streams,
and rivers. In this case, the watershed spread
across four Indiana counties. The discussion was
sparked by widespread concern over the poor qual-
ity of water entering a nearby creek due to a variety
of pollutants, including E. coli from manure spread
on adjacent farmland, contamination from improp-
erly installed septic tanks, and litter from people
who recreate on the creek. However, stakeholders
disagreed about how to best improve the water
quality or who to blame.

for a variety of residents and local organizations
across the counties. During their discussion, partic-
ipants produced the following:

 Public knowledge about the issue's complexity, such as recognizing that both farmers who own
   nearby land and recreators who canoe on the creek are impacted by the water quality and contribute
   to its pollution.

 Public judgment when they agreed on an educational approach to preserving the watershed's
   health. They determined that educational efforts should also attend to related concerns like soil
   runoff and animal welfare versus only targeting water quality.1

          In the seventeenth century, New England colonists
       developed town hall meetings. These meetings were
       informally structured, met on an ad hoc basis, and
       included citizens, town officials, and magistrates. As
       colonists grew dissatisfied with British rule, town hall
       meetings became a place to discuss their situation
       and to deliberate possible actions.

                   During the nineteenth century, new efforts
       arose in the United States to promote public discus-
       sions and educate our young country's citizens. The
       Lyceum movement emerged in the 1820s and lasted
       until just after the Civil War in the 1860s. Teacher and
       scientist Josiah Holbrook started the movement and
       named it after Aristotle's school in ancient Greece. It
       provided adult education and a place to discuss public
       issues.

                                                                                                  Francestown, NH Meetinghouse by Magicpiano via

            The Open Forum movement developed around the
same time as the Chautauqua movement. Starting from
such established open forums as the Cooper Union in New
York City (1894)2 and the Ford Hall Forum in Boston (1908),3
the Open Forum movement gained popularity across the
country during the 1930s. It utilized community discussions
to educate and engage adult citizens in social and political
topics.

During this same period of the 1920s and 1930s,

American academics also grew interested in the role of

public discussions. These years correspond with the after-

math of World War I; the Progressive Era when many social

reformers attempted to strengthen national democratic

practices; and the Great Depression. Some college profes-

sors of speech responded to societal concerns by teaching     The Cooper Union's Foundation Building by Ajay
students how to engage in discussions.4 This added focus      Suresh via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY.

increased and extended through the mid-1950s but largely faded out of university curricula by the 1960s.5

            Enthusiasm for deliberative discussions arose again near the end of the twentieth century and
into the twenty-first century. During the 1980s, increased social fragmentation, political disaffection, and
even illiteracy in civic affairs prompted nonprofit organizations like the Charles F. Kettering Foundation and
National Issues Forum to focus on teaching, researching, and advancing deliberative discussions. In 2002,
the National Coalition for Dialogue & Deliberation became a meeting place for practitioners. As the twenty-
first century progressed, several universities and colleges established centers and initiatives to promote
deliberative conversations on and off their campuses.

            Despite ongoing interest, however, few US residents today have been trained in or experienced a deliberative
discussion. Instead, unproductive discourse, which we characterized in chapter 2, seems to dominate mainstream com-
munication. Consequently, we focus this chapter on instructions for effectively participating in deliberative discussions.
The next chapter offers guidance for leading deliberative discussions.

Participating in a Deliberative Discussion

All participants in a discussion play a role in the outcome. Those who dominate the discussion, block the ideas of others,
seek attention for themselves, or engage in excessive sarcasm obviously harm the discussion. Those who participate in
the discussion with an open mind, frankness, and sensitivity to others help the discussion thrive. In the following table,
we highlight five intellectual virtues--and ways you can adopt them--to practice good participation in a deliberative dis-
cussion.

Active listen   Seek to understand others' comments. When ideas are unclear,         "Could you help me understand what
ing                 ask questions.                                                        you mean by that?"

                 Check the accuracy of your understanding by briefly                  "So it sounds like you're saying..."
                    paraphrasing what a speaker has said.

Intellectual     Make clear the limitations of your knowledge and perspective.        "From what I understand...but I could
humility and     Seek new knowledge, understanding, and a broader perspective.           be wrong."
doubt
                                                                                       "That's new to me. Can you say more
                                                                                          about that?"

Inclusiveness    Ensure all perspectives are heard fully and fairly.                  "I think we're missing farmers' voices.
                 Invite all participants into the discussion.                            I wonder what they'd think about this
                                                                                          issue."

                                                                                       "I'm interested in hearing from
                                                                                          Marcus."

Imagination      Entertain and develop ideas that might not be realistic when first   "What if..."
                    presented but can be made more practical with a little creative    "Maybe we could try..."
                    thinking.

Reflectiveness   Think in new and constructive ways.                                  "I never realized that before."
                 Be willing to challenge even long-held beliefs or ideas.             "What might be an argument against

                                                                                          this idea?"

            Notice that employing the virtues requires actively taking responsibility for the discussion. That might sound
surprising. After all, when you are not leading the discussion, it can be tempting to zone out, go along with what others
say, or slyly scroll on your phone. Even as a participant, however, you can and should help shape the conversation. That
means paying attention, listening ethically (as discussed in chapter 6), and speaking up in ways that embody the five
intellectual virtues. When you accept such responsibility, you ensure the group will reap the benefits of deliberative dis-
cussions, to which we turn next.

 Benefits and Limitations of Deliberative Discussions

                            The importance of deliberative discussions can hardly be exaggerated. Public deliberation provides us
                            the invaluable opportunity to engage in discussion with those whose opinions differ. When discussing
                            a problem of mutual concern, we realize those who disagree with us are reasonable, engaged individ-
                            uals. We may even learn that how we characterize such people is untenable.

              Box 22.4 Humanizing the Opposition
              Imagine being a participant in a deliberative discussion about water quality, similar to the Indiana discus-
           sion explored in an earlier example. Perhaps you walk in, ready to argue against small-town inhabitants and
           against environmentalists.

                       You may discover the following:

                The "local yokel," for example, turns out to be a third-generation farmer--say, Marcus--who is trying
                   to shift from using chemical pesticides to living organisms to control pests but cannot find sufficient
                   funding.

                The "tree hugger" may be a woman--say, Amanda--who wants to improve water quality so she and
                   her kids can continue to enjoy canoeing together.
                       When the opposition is given a name and a voice to explain the reasons for their position, we can

           better connect as people and find more productive ways forward.

               Also, while deliberative discussions are hard work, if done well, they result in better decisions. In contrast to
   when experts or officials make decisions on their own, deliberative discussion allows the public to directly influence
   community agenda-setting and choices. That is, ordinary residents can influence what topics community leaders attend
   to and how. Deliberative discussions also help community members avoid the pitfalls of unreflective bias and group-
   think. A wiser set of decisions results from sharing opinions and experiences as well as from systematically considering
   the benefits and drawbacks of every approach.

               Deliberative discussions, however, incur limitations as well. From chapter 4, you
   may recall philosopher Nancy Fraser's critique of the public sphere--a theory developed by
   sociologist and philosopher Jrgen Habermas.6 While the public sphere is meant to be a
   gathering of community members to discuss public issues as equal participants, it can actu-
   ally privilege members with higher social status and increased knowledge of participation
   norms--such as how the group expects you to talk and behave during a deliberative discus-
   sion.

               As we further discussed in chapter 4, talk or behavior that falls outside expectations
   may be shut down or excluded because it's deemed inappropriate. The inappropriate talk or
   behavior is often accused of being uncivil. We defined uncivil speech in chapter 4 as rhetoric that violates decorum

  because it is disrespectful, angry, and/or impolite. Censorship of uncivil speech can stop discussions from becoming
  unproductive or divisive, but it can also be abused by shutting out people with lower social status.

               Typically, people in power get to decide when expectations have been violated. What that means is what counts
  as appropriate behavior for deliberation is not universally or objectively agreed upon, so those in power typically get to
  decide where to draw the line.

               In chapter 4, we explained that lines, or standards of decorum, are drawn through policing discourse, which
  is the use of rhetoric to determine preferred or appropriate ways of talking together when deliberating public issues.
  Policing discourse aims to censor the speech of people who challenge the social order.

             Box 22.5 Calls for Decorum That Silence Dissent
             It's not hard to find historical examples of people in power accusing others, typically with lower social
          status, of violating "civil speech" or "decorum" to silence their disagreement.

                                                                                                      For example, in 2016 former professional

                       In 2023, Montana Representative Zooey Zephyr, the
           first transgender lawmaker in Montana, argued against leg-
           islation that would restrict transgender health care for
           youth, warning that the bill's supporters would have "blood
           on their hands." Montana House Majority Leader Sue Vinton
           called the comments out of order and then led a vote that
           banned Zephyr from attending or speaking during future
           floor sessions.8

                       In both examples, calls for respectful behavior and
           civil discourse censored dissenting perspectives instead of
           engaging with, or even debating, their merits.

               When used to quell disagreement, policing discourse Zooey Zephyr by Pax Ahimsa Gethen via Wikimedia
   strategically shifts attention away from the dissent raised (in the Commons, CC BY-SA.
   cases in box 22.5, against racism in the legal sphere and transpho-
   bia in the legislative context) and toward the individuals or groups protesting (Kaepernick and Zephyr). Consequently,
   such rhetoric implies that the individuals need to change (or be "civilized") and that the status quo, including existing
   systems of inequity, should be maintained.

              NPR's Karen Grigsby Bates goes so far as to argue that "pushing back against the status quo will be seen as
           inherently uncivil by the people who want to maintain it. And there are always higher standards expected of
           those people pushing back."9

               Deliberative discussion leaders should, therefore, proceed with sensitivity in light of these limitations and his-
   torical abuses.

      One suggestion, which we explore more in the next chapter, is to invite participants to "call out" problematic lan
         guage while keeping participants in the conversation. In other words, deepen and widen the conversation instead
         of shutting it down or censoring voices.

      Also, encourage participants to expect a productive discussion to make them uncomfortable. It is likely their
         assumptions and values will be challenged. They will likely hear perspectives they had not considered and realize
         their conclusions need to change. They may hear language that makes them upset and need to articulate why.
         They may also need to listen to others express anger about things they say or solutions they prefer.

            If leaders take appropriate steps and participants allow themselves to be uncomfortable, deliberative discus-
sions can model and teach the civic skills people need to productively contribute to their communities. Participating in
a discussion teaches participants to listen as much as they talk; to ask questions as well as advocate ideas; to recognize
the drawbacks, and not just the benefits, of their ideas; and to consider the consequences of any choice upon a wider
range of community members than only themselves.

     Summary

        The ability to discuss civic concerns productively with your fellow residents is an integral aspect of public
     speaking. This chapter offered you an explanation of the nature, benefits, and US lineage of deliberative discus-
     sions. It also provided guidance on how to effectively participate in such discussions, and it warned against
     calls for civil speech that silence dissenting voices.

          A deliberative discussion is a group conversation through which a community, guided by one or more
             moderators, thoughtfully and thoroughly examines a complex public problem as well as the range of
             available solutions to ultimately arrive at a decision or conclusion.

          The ongoing importance of civic-centered discussions is demonstrated through several historical US
             movements and organizations dedicated to public discussion and adult education.

          Productively participating in a deliberative discussion requires exhibiting several intellectual virtues,
             including active listening, intellectual humility and doubt, inclusiveness, imagination, reflectiveness, and
             responsibility for the quality of the discussion.

          Leading or participating in a deliberative discussion can result in better decision-making, potentially
             help you connect with people whose opinions differ from your own, and teach civic skills that people
             need to productively contribute to their communities.

          The norms of participating in deliberative discussions can be used to exclude community members,
             particularly with marginalized positionalities, by accusing them of violating "civil speech" or breaching
             "decorum." Such accusations can function to maintain the status quo and systems of inequity.

23. Facilitating Deliberative Discussions

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Recognize the stages of a deliberative discussion.
          Explain what it means for a deliberative discussion group to talk through an issue as opposed to talking

             about an issue.
          Fulfill the tasks of an effective deliberative discussion leader.

The previous chapter helped you appreciate and participate in deliberative discussions. It explained the goals, historical
uses, benefits, and limitations of such discussions. It also described five intellectual virtues participants should adopt to
ensure productive conversations.

            But how do you lead deliberative discussions? This chapter provides detailed instructions for facilitators. The
chapter will first identify the basic structure a deliberative discussion can follow. It then explores one of the most impor-
tant facilitation tasks: asking effective questions. Next, we provide instructions for helping participants talk through an
issue instead of talking about it. The chapter ends with additional specific tasks that discussion leaders should fulfill.

Deliberative Discussion Structure

How should you begin a deliberative discussion? What should you spend the most time on? How might you conclude
a discussion? Facilitators often use a template or structure for guiding participants through a deliberative discussion.
We will adopt a structure inspired by the National Issues Forum (NIF). It includes five major stages: personal stakes,
approach one, approach two, approach three, and reflection period. This structure can and should be adapted to suit a
specific community's problems and needs, and the structure itself evolves as NIF and related scholars and practitioners
develop adaptations.

          Box 23.1 NIF's Five Stages of a Deliberative Discussion
           1. Personal stakes
          2. Approach one
          3. Approach two
          4. Approach three
          5. Reflection period

278 | Facilitating Deliberative Discussions
Personal Stakes

Deliberative discussions often begin with introducing personal stakes by inviting participants to
state their connection to the issue. In chapter 10, we defined personal stakes as an individual's
financial, material, and/or psychological investments that could be improved or worsened
based on how an issue is addressed. In chapter 20, we explained the related concept of stake-
holders, or groups and organizations that have vested interests in a wicked problem and its
outcome because of the impacts on their lives. Ideally, participants in your deliberative discus-
sion include a variety of stakeholders.

            As a facilitator, you can invite discussion participants to self-disclose their personal
stakes in the issue. Ask if they are comfortable sharing their connections to the problem and even how it has impacted
them or people close to them.

            This stage serves several functions. It encourages discussants to empathize with one another and gravitate
toward shared concerns and interests. It also immediately moves the discussion from an abstract consideration of the
topic to something more tangible and personal. Finally, this opening helps equalize participants because it avoids formal
introductions that could emphasize differing degrees of societal power.

          Box 23.2 Facilitation Questions About Participants' Personal Stakes

             Why are you concerned about this issue?
             How have you witnessed or experienced the problem in our community?
             How has this issue impacted you or people you know?

Approaches

                                       After the personal stakes stage, a deliberative discussion

                                       group typically explores each of three or more approaches,

                                       one at a time. Recall from the previous chapters that the

                                       deliberative presentation and the deliberative discussion

                                       work hand in hand. In setting up the discussion, the delib-

                                       erative presentation identifies and explains the problem

                                       and each of the approaches that participants will consider

                                       during the discussion.

Image by Dan Moyle via Flickr, CC BY.              Deliberative discussions explore every approach
                                       with the goal of building public knowledge. In the previous

chapter, we defined public knowledge as participants' shared and improved understanding of the wicked problem and

possible solutions as they offer and hear multiple points of view.

To build such knowledge, facilitators encourage participants to share their perspectives on each approach, con-

sider and possibly generate specific actions that fall within that approach, invite consideration of what stakeholders

stand to lose or gain from the approach, and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks (i.e., trade-offs) of the approach.

Discussion leaders also ask participants to weigh approaches, specific actions, and values against one another.

                                                                    Facilitating Deliberative Discussions | 279
Such weighing requires discussants to really talk through the problem and confront tough choices rather than simply
talking about each approach independently. We'll more fully explore this task in a later section about the groan zone.

          Box 23.3 Facilitation Questions About Approaches
          Questions About the Benefits of an Approach or Sample Action
             What are the benefits of this approach or action for our community?
             How might someone argue on behalf of this idea?
             Why do you find this approach or action attractive?
          Questions About the Costs or Challenges of an Approach or Sample Action
             What are the drawbacks to this approach or action?
             What might be an argument against that suggestion?
             What will the consequences of this approach or action likely be for our community?
          Questions About the Value Dilemmas and Trade-Offs
             Who are the major stakeholders, and what do they stand to lose or gain from this approach?
             What is the central trade-off between these two actions? Within this approach? Between these two

                approaches?
             What values conflict among the approaches?

          Box 23.4 Case Study: Facilitation Questions During a Deliberative Discussion
          The organizer of an Indiana deliberative discussion about a local watershed (introduced in the previous
       chapter) focused their deliberative presentation on the water quality, land use, and management of the
       watershed. They identified the three approaches:
           1. Limiting river access for recreationists
          2. Educating stakeholders on how to improve the river and its use
          3. Addressing environmental contamination from farm runoff

                   They chose these approaches based on survey results of various groups' awareness of the issue,
       concerns, and openness to options.

                   During their deliberative discussion, when facilitators focused participants on the third
       approach--addressing environmental contamination from farm runoff--they asked participants to discuss
       the sample action of giving farmers and landowners full authority over watershed maintenance. To prompt
       discussion, the facilitators asked participants

             to consider the benefits of this sample action,
             which stakeholders would be privileged and which would be marginalized in that scenario (such as

                recreators who don't own the land but are also affected by the creek's water quality), and

280 | Facilitating Deliberative Discussions
             what the drawbacks would be of such marginalization.
                   This set of questions helped participants consider the trade-offs of empowering any one group

       with addressing the water quality issue. It also encouraged them to reflect on which stakeholders would
       stand to gain or lose from implementing the approach.

Reflection Period

A deliberative discussion usually ends with a reflection period. This stage allows discussants
to reflect on the conversation they just had and shifts them toward public judgment. We
defined public judgment in the previous chapter as the community's thoughtful choice about
its desired approach or next steps to address the problem based on the public knowledge
developed during the discussion.

            As a facilitator, it is typically not helpful to use the reflection period to merely repeat
what was said during the discussion. Instead, it is more useful to highlight or invite partici-
pants to name the common ground and key tensions that arose during the discussion.

          Box 23.5 Facilitation Questions About Common Ground and Key Tensions
             What can you all agree about X (the problem, a particular approach or action, etc.)?
             What trade-offs are you all willing to accept? What trade-offs do you agree are unacceptable?
             What trade-offs do you most strongly disagree about?
             What important value dilemmas emerged among you?

            By recognizing common ground and key tensions, the reflection period helps the group identify which
approaches and actions they prefer and the next steps to address the issue. They should try to name actions appropriate
for a wide range of actors, including ideas for community members in addition to elected or appointed officials or
experts. While the group may not achieve consensus about the actions it prefers, the members should decide the next
steps to take to continue their momentum.

          Box 23.6 Facilitation Questions About Future Actions and Steps
             Having discussed several approaches to solving the problem, which do you prefer? Why?
             What actions would you prioritize? Who should do them? What might ordinary community mem-

                bers do to address this problem?

                                                                                                                                 Facilitating Deliberative Discussions | 281
             What way might we proceed that would address everyone's most serious concerns?
             What are the next best steps to keeping momentum moving forward on this topic?

            Talking through all five stages of a deliberative discussion can be time-consuming and tiresome. Indeed, it's not
always possible when time does not allow. In those cases, you may need to truncate the stages, such as by shortening
the personal stakes stage or even spending time on two approaches instead of three. However you progress through the
discussion, asking effective questions is critical to a productive deliberative discussion.

Asking Effective Questions

Asking effective questions is crucial to facilitating a deliberative discussion. Questions drive discussions. Knowing when
to narrow or broaden questions and what type of questions to ask are skills a discussion leader must learn over time.

Use Broad and Narrow Questions During the Deliberation Stages

Starting Questions

Early in a discussion, relatively broader questions--that is, questions that are not overly narrow or specific--tend to help,
especially about participants' personal stakes in the issue. Box 23.2 includes examples of broad questions. You want par-
ticipants to learn about one another, and such questions invite a wide array of responses.

            Broader questions are also best when you start a conversation about each of the approaches. Beginning that way
allows discussants, rather than facilitators, to determine what specific ideas or trade-offs they want to consider.

            If you begin a conversation about an approach with questions that are overly specific, the discussion can
become mired in details and, consequently, lose participants. On the other hand, if questions are too broad or unclear to
begin with, the discussion will suffer from confusion. Box 23.7 illustrates this tension with a specific example.

          Box 23.7 Starting Questions That Are Too Specific or Too Broad
          Let's return to the Indiana watershed deliberative discussion. Imagine a facilitation leader started a con-
       versation about a specific approach with the following questions:
             Too specific: "Which kinds of trees will best prevent pollution from flowing into the water?" Notice

                how this question too quickly narrows the conversation to a very specific action. Only those who are
                drawn to this approach and know the differences among trees could meaningfully participate.
             Too broad: "What should we do?" or "What do you think?" These questions are so general that

282 | Facilitating Deliberative Discussions
   respondents would not know where to start.
 Just right: "What are the advantages of this approach for our community?" This question is broad

   enough to invite numerous responses, yet it also initially focuses participants' input on advantages.

Midway Questions

As discussion about each approach progresses, somewhat more specific questions work well to guide participants. For
each approach, consider following this sequence of questions:

   A discussion leader can start with a broad question about an approach's benefits.
        Then they can follow up with somewhat more specific questions, such as why or which stakeholders are advan-
            taged.
              Next the leader can narrow participants' attention to particular sample actions and ask even more specific
                  questions: Which sample action does the group find most appealing? Why? For whom?
              The facilitator can do the same as they turn to the approach's trade-offs. Which trade-offs are most con-
                  cerning? Why? For whom?
        The leader can end discussion of an approach by asking rather pointed questions: Do the benefits of this
            approach outweigh the drawbacks for our community? Why or why not? Is this approach more or less desir-
            able than other approaches? Why or why not?

Ending Reflection Questions

The reflection period can be a time to return to broader questions to encourage participants to reflect on the entire issue
and think ahead to the next steps. Boxes 23.5 and 23.6 provide examples of broad questions.

            Whenever facilitators ask questions, they should keep in mind several considerations in addition to how broadly
or narrowly to word them.

Question Forms and Directions

Discussion leaders should also consider both the form and the direction of their questions. Typically, you should ask
open-ended and indirect questions.

Question Forms

There are two major forms of questions: open and closed.

                                                          Facilitating Deliberative Discussions | 283
            Open questions call for more than a one-word response, making possible a range of answers.

   "What are your reactions to...?"
   "For what reasons do you believe that...?"
   "How do you feel about...?"

            Open questions are usually the best type of questions to generate discussion because they allow a wide variety
of responses.

            Closed questions prompt a single, one-word answer--usually yes or no.

   "Is this option your favorite choice?"
   "Would you agree that...?"
   "Can we conclude, then, that...?"

            Closed questions can be helpful for shifting the focus of discussion, for stopping someone from going on a tan-
gent, or for preventing someone from dominating the discussion. However, closed questions should be used sparingly
because they tend to shut down conversation. You should almost always avoid "Don't you think...?" questions because
they are actually veiled arguments.

Question Directions

A question can take at least four directions: indirect, direct, reverse, and relay.
            Indirect questions target the entire group and tend to stimulate thought. They are very useful for deliberative

discussions.

   "What might be the consequences of choosing this solution?"

            Direct questions target one individual and should be used sparingly to draw out timid group members.

   "Tim, how do you respond to what Joan just said?"

            Reverse questions reflect a question back to the group and are especially helpful in preventing the discussion
from turning into a question-and-answer session.

   After Tim has asked which approach the leaders like best, you could respond by asking the whole group, "Well,
      how would you all answer Tim's question?"

            Relay questions encourage group members to share experiences. This can help ground the conversation in
personal examples and better understand where someone is coming from.

   "Nia, what experiences have informed your perspective?"

            Ultimately, keep in mind that good discussion leading is both an art and a science. That means a good leader
prepares for a discussion as much as possible. For example, develop a list of questions for each of the five stages of the
discussion, anticipate how the discussion is likely to unfold given the topic and specific participants, and think through
how you might respond to potential difficulties, such as members who dominate, withdraw, or try to debate.

            At the same time, the art of discussion leading lies in the following abilities: remaining present during the actual

284 | Facilitating Deliberative Discussions
  discussion, listening closely to the participants' comments, observing nonverbal communication, and guiding the dis-
  cussion accordingly. The discussion may take a totally different direction than anticipated and unforeseen challenges
  may arise. A good discussion leader adapts to the situation as it develops. They also use questions to guide participants
  into the groan zone.

 The Heart of a Deliberative Discussion: Working Through the Issue

                                              When a discussion leader is executing their role well by asking effective questions and
                                              adapting to the group's needs, participants will raise numerous conflicting perspectives
                                              on the problem, approaches, and specific sample actions. That experience typically leads
                                              participants to encounter what Sam Kaner and associates have labeled the groan zone.
                                              The groan zone is a stage of confusion and frustration that results from the broad repre-
                                              sentation of viewpoints, opinions, and ideas shared.1 Put simply, this is when participants
                                              groan and say, "Ugh! This problem is too complicated and hard!"

                                                          Effectively dealing with this zone requires participants to work through diverse
                                              perspectives and not simply name them. As we mentioned earlier, they must weigh
                                              options against one another, confronting tough choices--and working through the con-
  flict such confrontation brings--rather than simply talking about each approach independently. That means probing
  more deeply to explore their conflicting reasons and values. The objective of deliberative discussions, after all, is to dis-
  cover and discuss the real underlying sources of conflict so the group can ultimately move through the groan zone into
  shared public judgment.
              Due to the discomfort of the groan zone, deliberative discussion participants may try to skirt around it. This
  section will explore three common ways a group might avoid the groan zone and specific strategies you can use in each
  case.

                                      their preferred option.

When Participants Claim They Need More Information

                                    Some groups may claim they need more information before discussing the issue. Of course,
                                    there is some truth to this. In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of research-
                                    ing and correcting misinformation and disinformation when preparing a deliberative presen-
                                    tation. However, wicked problems result from deep disagreements over underlying values and
                                    trade-offs rather than a lack of sufficient information.

                                                Thus, if requests for information emerge and the discussion leader cannot easily ful-
                                    fill them, then the leader should encourage discussants to temporarily set their questions
                                    aside and gear their conversation, instead, toward the larger issues involved.

When Participants Emphasize Their Differences

Alternatively, groups may try to avoid the groan zone by solely emphasizing their differences from one another, perhaps
due to misconceptions they have about one another. To work through the issue, participants can be asked to identify
their relevant common ground. Common ground refers to any perspectives, interests, values, or concerns shared by
some or all members of the discussion. Even discussants with opposing perspectives are likely to agree on important
core values, fundamental aspects of the problem, or particular needs.

            Sometimes participants' disagreements are reflected in their use of very different labels, phrases, or metaphors
to discuss the problem or the people affected. Some of these terms may be off-putting or even offensive to other par-
ticipants, driving them further apart as well as away from the groan zone.

286 | Facilitating Deliberative Discussions
                                                    Consequently, facilitators should draw attention to such divisive or controversial
                                        rhetoric and invite participants to discuss and even contest its meaning and implications. This
                                        invitation "calls out" the language while "calling in" participants to share why they used or
                                        objected to it.2 It avoids shaming or silencing participants while also enabling frank conversa-
                                        tions around divisive language. Such direct conversations can give participants a chance to
                                        explain why certain catchphrases or metaphors are dehumanizing, are unfair, or even draw
                                        on histories of oppression. The discussion can also reveal where and why participants per-
                                        ceive the problem differently. A facilitator can use those insights to guide participants
   through the groan zone, likely after they have asked the group which phrases and labels they will agree to use or avoid.

 When Participants Quickly Agree

   In contrast to emphasizing differences, groups may try to avoid the groan zone by too quickly
   agreeing. They may, for instance, agree on the best solution before exploring its trade-offs or
   additional stakeholders' perspectives, or they may simply state preferences without offering
   reasons behind them.

               In cases like this, a discussion leader should probe participants for the reasons, values,
   and personal experiences that inform their conclusions. A discussion leader may also ask the
   group to consider the costs, challenges, and trade-offs of their preferred option to encourage
   the exploration of possible disagreements.

             Box 23.9 Example of Strategies to Use When Participants Avoid the Groan Zone
             Let's return to the Indiana deliberative discussion about a local watershed again. In the following sections,
          we consider how facilitators guided participants into the groan zone rather than avoiding it.
             When Participants Wanted More Information
             Problem: What did leaders do when some participants got hung up on how much money the county gov-
          ernments had to spend on water treatment and cleanup initiatives?

                       Strategies: Leaders encouraged participants to identify their values and then reflect on how those
          values could translate into a plan of action. Spending too much time on the missing information would have
          narrowed their vision and distracted them from other possible options.

             When the Group Emphasized Their Differences
             Problem: Participants at the Indiana watershed deliberation disagreed about the trade-offs they were will-
          ing to accept.

                       Strategies: Facilitators asked what participants could agree on. The group discovered that they
          agreed that private landowners and farmers should be part of the solution to improve water quality. This

                                                                                                                                     Facilitating Deliberative Discussions | 287
       was based on a common understanding participants reached that landowners and farmers were often the
       ones perpetrating pollutive practices.

                   Problem: Fortunately, this did not occur, but you can imagine that if some people at the Indiana
       watershed deliberation derided farmers as ignorant "yokels" or recreators as liberal "tree huggers," then
       such language would have further emphasized differences among the group. It also would have made some
       (maybe many) participants feel hurt and angry.

                   Strategies: In that case, discussion leaders could have drawn attention to those problematic labels
       and asked the group for their reactions to the language. They could have also asked what concerns or frus-
       trations were implied through the labels and invited the group to directly discuss those experiences and
       perspectives.

          When Participants Stressed Their Agreements
          Problem: Several groups at the Indiana watershed deliberation agreed on the second approach of educat-
       ing those around the watershed on how to improve the river and its use.

                   Strategies: Rather than ending the conversation, facilitators pushed the group to define what they
       meant by "education." Who is being educated? By whom? About what?

            Ideally, as the discussion progresses through the groan zone using the strategies provided, participant invest-
ment increases. Discussants begin explaining their reasoning, listening to others, and weighing options. Participants
shift from their individual perspective ("I") to using collective terms that reflect their broader shared community ("we").
Encouraging participants to talk through the groan zone requires discussion leaders to create an inclusive environment.

Creating an Inclusive Environment

The discussion leader is responsible for creating an inclusive environment in which all participants can contribute. That
means facilitators must seek to engage all participants, help quieter members join, excite discussants to want to partic-
ipate, and allow the conversation to flow.

Engage All Participants

First, discussion leaders seek to engage everyone in a productive manner, no matter their ideological, political, or per-
sonal perspectives. That means facilitators should do the following:

288 | Facilitating Deliberative Discussions
 Avoid answering questions themselves and withhold their own
   opinions. As discussed in chapter 20, a discussion leader may share
   personal experiences related to the wicked problem if/when relevant,
   but you should avoid dominating the discussion or swaying opinions
   toward one solution.

 Function like a referee at a football game or soccer match. The leader
   is not focused on who wins or loses but rather on how the game is
   played. They should refrain from taking sides.

 Intervene if any participant is personally attacked or ridiculed.
 If a group repeatedly asks them questions, leaders should redirect

   the questions back to the discussants to answer.

Help Quieter Members Join the Discussion

Second, discussion leaders should also create an inclusive environment by
helping quieter members get involved. For example, facilitators can try the
following:

 Invite multiple participants to respond to a single question.              Image by Keith Johnston via Pixabay, Pixabay
 Redirect the conversation outward if one or two people dominate.           Content License.

 Allow silence after asking a question and even after hearing a couple

of responses, since discussants need time to consider their input, and some need more time than others.

 Rephrase the question or even direct it toward a specific person if no one responds after a period of silence.

Excite Discussants to Participate

Third, getting diverse participants engaged also means creating an atmosphere in which members want to participate.
That means that as facilitators, you should do the following:

   Ask questions with enthusiasm, maintaining eye contact with group members if that is comfortable or possible for
      you.

   Be conscious of your facial expressions and posture. Your body may communicate messages you don't intend to
      send (disgust, disinterest, anger, etc.).

   Express gratitude when a participant shares something personal or vulnerable.

                                                                             Facilitating Deliberative Discussions | 289
Allow the Conversation to Flow

                                                                 Finally, facilitators allow the conversation to flow if it is
                                                              on topic. Sticking too strictly to a prepared list of ques-
                                                              tions may squelch discussants' interest and wrest too
                                                              much control away from them. With that said, it is OK to
                                                              get the discussion back on topic if a string of irrelevant
                                                              tangents arises.

                                                                          Remember, participants will naturally look to the
                                                              leader for cues, so if you are positive and welcoming, you
                                                              can succeed at drawing multiple participants into a pro-
                                                              ductive and healthy conversation.

Informal Business Meeting by Jack Moreh via Freerange Stock,  Specific Discussion Facilitation Tasks
Equalicense.

In addition to creating an inclusive environment, deliberative discussion facilitation consists of several important tasks.
Typically, at least two facilitators lead a deliberative discussion: a moderator, who sits with the group and asks questions
through the stages of a discussion, and a recorder, who takes notes of the group's conversation. It is very difficult to
guide a group's discussion and take notes simultaneously.

            Further dividing facilitation tasks among a small group of discussion leaders enables each person to focus on
just one or two jobs, yet it also necessitates a greater degree of cooperation among group members. However many
people facilitate a discussion, the tasks listed in box 23.10 should be accomplished to help ensure its success.

     Summary

        Leading a discussion is an important task. This chapter taught you how to guide participants through the five
     stages of a deliberative discussion, from personal stakes through the reflection period. It encouraged you to
     help the group work through the groan zone along the way.

          For our purposes, a deliberative discussion consists of five stages: an offering of personal stakes, during
             which participants share why they attended the discussion and what concerns they have about the prob-
             lem; a discussion of each of three approaches to solving the problem, one at a time, during which partici-
             pants consider the benefits, challenges, and trade-offs of each approach and specific actions within
             them; and a reflection period, during which participants reflect on the problem and approaches, naming
             the preferred actions and next steps.

          The discussion leader develops questions with consideration to their direction and form and to the
             stage of the discussion.

          Ideally, participants in a deliberative discussion enter the groan zone, during which they may feel over-
             whelmed and uncomfortable as they work through multiple viewpoints and options.

          An effective deliberative discussion leader creates an inclusive environment and accomplishes many
             other facilitation tasks. These can be shared by two or more discussion leaders.

Attitudes, or Courses of Action

Chapter Objectives

Students will:

  Explain the importance of persuasion for civic engagement.
  Select a specific persuasive goal for a particular issue.
  Identify a clear means for an audience to enact the persuasive goal.

Have you been asked to give a persuasive speech but are struggling to find a topic? You might initially think about large,

seemingly intractable issues like abortion, immigration, and gun violence--and feel reluctant to weigh in. While there

are ways to engage such issues, you might find momentum in tackling more local problems in your community.

Ask yourself, What bothers me about my hometown or city or about my college experience? Who is struggling

or suffering, and how can I advocate to improve their situation?

courses of action of an audience. It is the form of communication most closely associated with rhetoric--and the form

of communication we most often hear. In this chapter we first explain the importance of persuasion for civic engage-

ment. We then turn to the persuasive process and provide instructions for the first three steps.

The Importance of Persuasion for Civic Engagement

                                  Persuasion is a necessary and important aspect of civic engagement for at least three reasons:
                                  It helps audiences make decisions, more fully explore ideas, and enact democracy.

                                              First, in many cases, diverse audiences will not arrive at a consensual decision after
                                  reviewing the facts, trade-offs, and value dilemmas of a complex and difficult issue. Advocacy is
                                  necessary to move audiences toward a position or conclusion. Persuasion can play a critical role
                                  in how communities decide a city might best address sanitation challenges, how a jury resolves
                                  a legal dispute, or how citizens choose who to vote into office.

                                              Second, advocacy often helps us see the greatest advantages--and disadvantages--of
an idea. Listening closely to someone passionately argue for a position can help us appreciate an idea more fully, or it
can crystallize our reasons for rejecting it.

            Third, as we established in chapter 1, rhetoric (and persuasion as a subset) is necessary for democracy. Rather
than "shoot it out," we "talk it out." We advocate for what we believe is the public good, and we try to convince fellow
community members that our ideas are meritable. Persuasion is, ultimately, how we enact democracy, such as Priyanka's
attempt to convince her audience to improve gender equity in sports.

            Persuasion, however, can be negatively perceived as a form of manipulation--a perception that has plagued
persuasion, and rhetoric more generally, since at least the classical period. Given the goal of persuasion--attempting to
influence others--it is easy to understand why it has been subject to special scrutiny.

          Box 24.1 Ethical Concerns About Persuasion in the Classical Period

                                                                In his Socratic dialogue titled Gorgias, Plato demeaned rhetoric. He
                                                             characterized it as a mere knack akin to cooking and as a form of flat-

tery without substance. In other words, he warned that rhetoric was a simple ability that could be used
unethically to manipulate people.2

            In contrast, Aristotle defined rhetoric more fundamentally as
the ability, in each particular case, to see the available means of per-
suasion.3 In other words, he taught that rhetoric was about develop-
ing the ability to discover or see the elements of persuasion in
specific situations. This placed rhetoric in an ethically neutral place.
That is, it can be used in an ethical or unethical manner.

            Greek teachers along with Romans in the classical period
expressed concern over the practice of rhetoric and, consequently,
developed ethical expectations for rhetors. These expectations
included the following:

 Plato's depiction of a true rhetoric in the Socratic dialogue    Aristotle by Alvaro Marques Hijazo via
   Phaedrus, whereby philosophers lead people toward truth         Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.

 Isocrates's vision of rhetoric as a civic art that improves the
   community

 Cicero's and Quintilian's vision of rhetoric as the joining of
   wisdom and eloquence by the good person speaking well

            We contend, however, that ethical persuasion is essential for civic engagement for the reasons we have pro-
vided. To help you deliver an ethical persuasive speech, we turn next to steps you should take to develop your presen-
tation.

The Persuasive Process

Taking an idea and developing it into a compelling persuasive appeal can be envisioned as a six-part progression, enu-
merated in box 24.2. We will provide you with guidance in this chapter on the first three steps. The next chapter will
offer you instructions on the last three steps.

          2. Select a persuasive goal.
          3. Empower your audience to act.
          4. Invent the content of your speech by using heuristics and three modes of proof.
          5. Frame your persuasive efforts by demonstrating the issue as worthy of attention and emphasizing

                the superiority of your response.
          6. Refute counterarguments.

Audience Analysis and Adaptation

The persuasive process begins with studying your direct audience and tailoring your speech to them and the environ-
ment where the speech will occur. In chapter 10, we defined the direct audience as the people who are exposed to and
attend to your speech. Review chapters 10 and 11 for help with analyzing and adapting to them. As you take each step in
developing your persuasive speech, make choices that consider this audience.

            Your direct audience is central to your persuasive presentation. In fact, if you were to deliver the same ideas to
two different direct audiences, then you would prepare two different speeches. The more the two groups diverge, the
more distinct your speeches would need to be because what is likely persuasive for one audience in a particular envi-
ronment may not be effective for another group in a different setting.

Persuasive Goal

A speaker must keep their goals clearly in mind when crafting a speech. You might think about achieving multiple goals:
to advocate for change, to seek the public good, and to convince your audience to adopt a specific belief, attitude, or
action.

Advocate for Change

                                 The goal of persuasion is change. That might seem obvious, but it's a major contrast from the
                                 goal we discussed in chapter 20, which covered informative speaking with a particular emphasis
                                 on deliberation. When speaking informatively or deliberatively, you strive to educate your audi-
                                 ence fairly and robustly. This chapter focuses on persuasion. Consequently, your goal now is to
                                 convince your audience to adopt your desired belief, value, or action. That means you must push
                                 your audience to change.

                                             Do not choose a goal your audience is already fulfilling because then persuasion isn't
                                 necessary. For instance, it's likely that Priyanka's audience already agrees that girls should be
encouraged to play sports. It's less likely they all agree that colleges should focus on hiring more female coaches as role
models in men's and women's athletics.

Seek the Public Good

Even when focused on the goal of persuasion, you'll want to keep in mind your overarching goal
of improving your community and the public good. A speaker motivated solely by personal gain
may say anything to persuade their listeners, and their presentation will seek to directly bene-
fit themselves. Think of a stereotypical used car salesperson who manipulates customers into
buying defective cars because the salesperson earns a commission.

            In contrast, a speaker motivated by the public good will aim for outcomes that benefit
the whole group--not only themselves and their direct audience but also their implied and
implicated audiences. In chapter 10, we defined an implied audience as a group that is repre-
sented in your message and an implicated audience as those affected by your speech if it is persuasive. You should keep
both groups in mind by continually asking for whom or what you are speaking. It is easy to begin with the best of inten-
tions and then get caught up in winning or only advantaging yourself as you develop and deliver your speech. When that
happens, you are likely to reinforce the qualities of unproductive discourse discussed in chapter 2.

Specify the Belief, Attitude, or Course of Action You Want the Audience to Adopt

In addition to advancing the public good and striving to persuade, you must identify your more specific persuasive goal.
This goal should shape--and be reflected in--your thesis statement. (Look back to chapter 12 for a discussion about the-
sis statements.) We offer three types of persuasive goals to kickstart your thinking: speeches that attempt to persuade
the direct audience to adopt a particular belief, attitude, or course of action.

            One type of specific persuasive goal is to target an audience's belief: their conclusion about, or confidence in,
what is or is not true or real. Scholars of public speaking and debate call this a "fact" proposition. The following are
examples of thesis statements that target beliefs:

   Global warming is caused by human activity.
   Excessive exposure to social media worsens mental health.

Notice how the wording of both examples focuses attention on convincing the audience that a particular belief or con-
clusion is true or real. Alternatively, you can convince an audience to reject a belief they hold that is not true or real. For
instance, you may claim that sugar does not make kids hyperactive.

            A second type of specific persuasive goal is to change an audience's attitude: their feeling or moral judgment
about what is good or bad, right or wrong. Scholars refer to this as a "value" proposition. In chapter 21, we defined a
value as a principle or quality that human beings are committed to and upon which they base their thinking and deci-
sions regarding important issues. A speaker might propose, for example, the following:

   Tattoos and piercings are healthy forms of self-expression.
   Oklahoma's penalties for carrying or consuming small amounts of marijuana are too harsh.

You can hear the emphasis on a value or attitude with words like "healthy" and "too harsh."
            A third type of specific persuasive goal strives to impact the audience's course of action: their choice, behavior,

or support for specific policies or procedures. Scholars also call this type of claim a "policy" proposition. The following
are examples:

   Public high schools should be required to offer students a financial literacy course.
   We should use the word "unhoused" instead of "homeless" to describe people without a physical address.

                                                                    Persuading an Audience to Modify Their Beliefs, Attitudes, or Courses of Action | 299
While you don't have to use "should" to indicate a course of action, that word is an easy way to communicate your
emphasis on affecting behavior or policy.

                   Box 24.3 How to Choose Your Specific Persuasive Goal
                    Your persuasive goal will--and should--change depending on your audience. To determine which
                 goal to target, ask yourself a set of questions about your direct audience.
             Beliefs: Does your audience believe the problem exists? Do they draw the same conclusions as you
                about the facts? If not, then target their beliefs. If so, then consider their values or attitudes about the
                issue.
             Attitudes: Is your audience apathetic about the issue, or are they too worried about a nonissue? If
                so, then target their values or attitudes. If not, then reflect on their current actions or inaction.
             Courses of action: Is your audience already doing something about the issue? Have they adopted
                your desired policy or behavior? If not, then convince them to change their course of action. If yes,
                then it sounds like your audience doesn't need to be persuaded on this topic since they already share
                your beliefs, attitudes, and courses of action! Best to alter your topic or focus on a different aspect of
                it.

            Whatever specific goal you choose, work on its wording. Your goal (and thesis statement) must clearly commu-
nicate what you are targeting and how you want your audience to change. As you determine your goal, also decide what
specific actions the audience should take to empower them to enact that change.

Empower Your Audience: Provide a Means to Act

                                          Whenever possible you should empower your direct audience by giving them a means to
                                          enact your goal. Your audience should not just accept your thesis; they should act on it.
                                          This means offering listeners clear options they can take to reinforce or act on their
                                          beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action.

                                                      The type of action you advocate depends on your specific persuasive goal. If your
                                          objective is to change your audience's beliefs or attitudes, then you might ask the audience
                                          to participate in an activity that will help accomplish that goal. Very often that activity will
                                          be educational in nature. Such activities further expose audience members to a support-
                                          ive point of view without yet requiring them to actively back a change in policy or change
                                          their daily behaviors.

                   Box 24.4 Empowerment in Practice
                    Let's return to Priyanka's persuasive speech. How might she empower her audience to act? To
                 decide, she should consider her specific persuasive goal.

300 | Persuading an Audience to Modify Their Beliefs, Attitudes, or Courses of Action
             Beliefs: If she wants her audience to conclude that women's sports are as exciting and interesting as
                men's, then she might do the following:
                    insist that audience members attend the next women's basketball game at their college
                    motivate the audience to attend a WNBA game when one or more top athletes will be playing

             Attitudes: If she wants her audience to value women's sports equally with men's, she may do the fol-
                lowing:
                    encourage them to watch such documentaries as Women of Troy (about the University of
                        Southern California's women's basketball team in the 1980s), The Founders (about female golfers
                        who created the Ladies Professional Golf Association), or Under Pressure: The U.S. Women's
                        World Cup (about the US women's soccer team)
                    invite them to attend an upcoming lecture that is relevant to the topic

             Courses of action: If Priyanka wants her audience to help create gender equity in college sports, she
                might do the following:
                    ask them to participate in an upcoming rally to pressure the athletic director to hire more
                        women onto athletic staffs
                    volunteer to coach a local girls' team

            If your goal is to influence the audience's course of action, then ask them to help you enact your policy or plan.
Encourage them to adopt the desired behavior, help put the procedure into action, or assist with laying the groundwork
to enact the policy.

                   Box 24.5 Factors to Consider When Empowering Your Audience to Act
                      Your Specific Persuasive Goal

             If you target your audience's beliefs or attitudes, then you might ask the audience to participate in
                an educational activity that will further expose them to the preferred belief or attitude.

             If you target your audience's courses of action, then ask them to help you enact your policy or plan.
                      What Options Are Available

             Already existing opportunities: Discover these on campus or in your local town or city and encour-
                age your audience to participate in them.

             Opportunities you create: Use your imagination and creativity to develop specific ways your audi-
                ence can make a difference.

            Whatever your goal, keep in mind that most actions are of two types: already existing opportunities and oppor-
tunities that you create.

            First, there are already existing opportunities that you need to discover and then encourage or enable your

                                                                    Persuading an Audience to Modify Their Beliefs, Attitudes, or Courses of Action | 301
audience to participate in. For instance, if you are concerned with girls dropping out of sports, not having sufficient role
models, or suffering from stigma if they continue to play sports, you can do the following:

   You might ask the audience to volunteer to mentor local youth.
   With a little searching, you will likely discover several such mentoring programs already existing at your school and

      the surrounding area (Boys and Girls Club, tutoring programs, community centers, etc.). You simply need to con-
      tact the organization to assess their needs and discuss the details about how to get involved.

            Second, there are opportunities that you create. Sometimes you need to use your imagination and creativity to
offer your audience a chance to get involved. For example, you might want the audience to increase the budget for your
college's women's basketball team.

   You could ask your audience to help organize and execute a donation drive on campus.
   Or you might invite the audience to join you in a meeting with the athletic director to solicit more funding.

            Whenever possible, find or create an opportunity close at hand for the audience--whether that is on campus or
in your city or town. Your audience will be more likely to take advantage of the opportunity, and doing so will help them
notice ways to directly improve their local community.

            Of course, finding or creating local opportunities can seem challenging at first. To help, we recommend you
become familiar with the nearby community:

   Talk to local residents about opportunities.
   Search for your issue on the local visitors' bureau web page or government websites. Such searches are likely to

      identify local organizations and groups devoted to the issue.
   Watch for announcements of upcoming events in the local news and on campus.
   When you find a local connection, interview someone associated with it. People regularly involved with the issue

      are likely to offer great insight and provide ideas about ways citizens can get involved.

            Once you have chosen a specific action to advocate, give the audience the detailed information they need to
participate. The key is to reduce the burden on your audience and prove they can truly make a difference.

          Box 24.6 Empower Your Audience with Detailed Actions
          To empower her audience to act, Priyanka decided to convince them to help local kids' sports teams.
       However, she used overly vague language when she first drafted this part of her speech.
          First Draft: Too Vague
          You can encourage girls to stay in sports by helping coach a local kids' team.
             Please donate your time.
             No prior experience is needed.
             Call the local Boys and Girls Club or YMCA.

                   The ideas here are a good start, but they lack the details needed to convince her audience to take
       action. The speaker is relying upon the audience to do the work, which is unlikely.

302 | Persuading an Audience to Modify Their Beliefs, Attitudes, or Courses of Action
                   After getting feedback from her teacher, Priyanka revised her language by providing pertinent
       information.

          Second Draft: Sufficiently Detailed
          You can encourage girls to stay in sports by helping coach a kids' team at our local Boys and Girls Club.
             This fall the club will organize youth soccer leagues that could use your assistance.

                    Each team needs a head coach and an assistant coach. No experience is required to be an
                        assistant coach.

                    The season goes from September through November. Teams typically practice one evening a
                        week and have a game on Saturdays.

                    Mary Green is responsible for the soccer program and would be happy to speak with you.
                        Their number is (333) 333-3333, or you can email them at ourtownbgc@gmail.com to see how
                        you can help. You can visit the club at 111 Main Avenue.

             So please visit, call, or email to find out more information about the available opportunities.
             I plan to volunteer again this fall and can provide a ride if you'd like to go with me.

            If you begin the persuasive process by analyzing your audience and then thoughtfully choosing your goal and
empowering your audience to act, you will be on your way toward producing a persuasive speech that will compel your
audience and aid your community.

     Summary

        This chapter explained persuasion as the strategic use of verbal and nonverbal symbols to influence the
     beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action of an audience. We explored its importance for civic engagement and
     steps to take in the persuasive process.

          Persuasion is important to civic engagement because it helps audiences make decisions, more fully
             explore ideas, and enact democracy.

          There are six steps in the persuasive process, though this chapter spent the most time on the second
             and third steps. After considering the audience (step one), the second step is the selection of a persuasive
             goal. That goal should focus on advocacy, strive to promote the public good, and encourage the audience
             to change a specific belief, attitude, or course of action.

          The third step in the persuasive process is to empower your audience by providing a particular means
             to act. Suggested actions may differ based on the speaker's specific persuasive goal and what existing
             opportunities exist nearby.

                                                                    Persuading an Audience to Modify Their Beliefs, Attitudes, or Courses of Action | 303

25. Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through
Invention, Framing, and Refutation

Chapter Objectives

Students will:

  Use the elements of invention to produce persuasive appeals.
  Persuasively frame an issue to lead the audience to the desired solution.
  Refute counterarguments to a preferred position.

The previous chapter introduced persuasion as the strategic use of verbal and nonverbal symbols to influence the
beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action of an audience. In that chapter, we established persuasion's importance for civic
engagement and identified six steps you should take when developing a persuasive speech. We then explored the first
three steps: (1) consider audience analysis and adaptation, (2) select a persuasive goal, and (3) empower your audience to
act. Basically, we suggested you start by knowing your audience and then, using that information, determine what you
want them to think, believe, or do and give them the means to carry that out.

            This chapter picks up with the next (and last) three steps to prepare your speech: (4) invent the content of your
speech, (5) frame your persuasive efforts, and (6) refute counterarguments. Together, these steps will help you develop
the speech content that fulfills your speech goal. We will explore each step, beginning with invention and then turning
to framing and refutation in turn.

Invention: The Substance of Persuasion

Image by Pete Linforthvia Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.     Invention, as you learned in chapter 1, is the process of
                                                             investigation and thought that produces the content of
                                                             your speech. This designation originated in rhetoric's
                                                             ancient past, but we still use the term. It emphasizes that
                                                             when we speak, we make up or "invent" arguments
                                                             intended to persuade. Of course, when done prop-
                                                             erly--and ethically--your words and arguments will be
                                                             based on thorough research and credible sources that
                                                             you credit through citations as described in chapters 8
                                                             and 9. Ultimately, though, you come up with what you say
                                                             in your speech.

                                                                         How do you stimulate your thinking? How do you
                                                             overcome writer's block to construct your speech? This is
                                                             precisely what the canon of invention is designed for. We

                    Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation | 305
  will begin by considering how you can use available strategies, or heuristics, of invention to develop ideas. Second, we
  will guide you through central proofs or means of invention you can adopt to develop the substance of your persuasion.

 Heuristics

  Imagine a legal pad or computer file with pages of information and evidence you collected from your research. What
  can you do with all this information? Thinkers and speakers in the past turned to heuristics: specific strategies for gen-
  erating new ideas.

             Box 25.1 The Greek Origins of Heuristics
             Also referred to as topics, loci, and lines of argument, the term "heuristic" comes from the Greek word
          heuriskein, which means "to discover." The Greek term topos means "place" and seems to have referred to
          the spot or place on a scroll wherein a particular common pattern of argument was written. The first formal
          presentation of heuristic devices occurs in Aristotle's Rhetoric, book 2, under the heading of topics. There he
          outlines twenty-eight heuristic devices for constructing arguments.

              Heuristic devices stimulate your intellectual discovery as you think through your topic, formulate arguments,
  and structure your speech. Box 25.2 contains a selection of the most commonly used strategies of rhetorical invention,
  or heuristics.

             Box 25.2 Selected Heuristic Devices
              1. Definition: What is it?
             2. What are the parts, and how are they related?
             3. How can the subject and object be reversed or how can the order of ideas be reversed?
             4. How does an idea or physical entity compare with another?
             5. How does an idea or physical entity contrast with another?
             6. Has something happened or not happened? Will something happen or will it not happen?
              7. Is one item greater or is it smaller than another item?
             8. Is something possible or is it not possible?
             9. What is and what is not?
            10. How big is something and how far does it reach?
             11. In the past, what was something like?
            12. In the future, what will something be like?1

speech? In many ways, they are comparable to the stun-
ningly successful--and always enjoyable--original Play-
Doh Fun Factory. The device took a blob of Play-Doh and
turned it into a spaghetti-type noodle, a star, or a light-
ning bolt. Somewhat like when using cookie cutters, there
were perhaps twenty or thirty different shapes you could
mold the Play-Doh into.

            Heuristic devices make use of your research in
much the same way; they show you various ways to shape
that information and those ideas for your audience into a
thesis statement, supporting arguments, or even organi-
zational structures (like those discussed in chapter 13).
The best thing to do is to try several, see what they gen-
erate, and then select from your creations, taking into
account your audience, goals, and context.

   Box 25.3 Heuristic Devices in Practice

   In the previous chapter, we introduced you to Priyanka, who decided to advocate for gender equity in
women's sports. As she prepared her speech, she researched positions that have been taken on the subject,
relevant court cases and rulings, statistics on college women's participation in sports and female employees
on athletic staffs, and testimonials from administrative bodies like the NCAA. Then she used the following
heuristic devices (drawn from box 25.2) to develop arguments:

     #5: Contrast: The average budget, travel accommodations, and equipment provided to men's colle-
        giate basketball teams versus women's teams.

     #4: Compare: Basketball with other sports teams or compare gender equity in amateur and profes-
        sional athletics.

            Priyanka could use contrast and comparison to establish the broader existence of inequity in sports
and argue for specific changes.

     #11: How things used to be: In terms of resources for women's sports in the United States, she
        could use this to argue the impressiveness or disappointment of the growth. We know that resources
        for women's participation differed before Title IX became law in 1972, for example, but how well has
        equity been achieved over fifty years later?

     #1: Definition of "equity": What do participants in the conversation mean when they use that
        word? She might discover the word has different meanings to different people and argue for a partic-
        ular definition.

Modes of Proof: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos

Another aspect of invention, also formally presented by Aristotle, includes three artistic modes of proof: ethos, pathos,
                                                                   Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation | 307
and logos. By modes of proof, Aristotle simply meant the ways people are persuaded or what they find persuasive. In dif-
ferentiating the modes, Aristotle explained that

   ethos is found "in the character of the speaker,"
   pathos relies on "disposing the hearer a certain way," and
   logos depends on "the thing itself which is said, by reason of its proving, or appearing to prove, the point."2

In each case, the proof is the persuasive appeal you share with your audience. Depending on the goal, audience, subject
matter, and occasion, you will vary the proof you use.

            Whatever your specific persuasive speaking goal, you should employ all three aspects of invention--namely,
logos, ethos, and pathos--to accomplish it. In the previous chapter, we explained that your specific persuasive goal will
be to change your audience's beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action. Some students mistakenly think speeches that tar-
get beliefs rely solely on logos while speeches that try to change attitudes only utilize pathos and so on. Such thinking
confuses the end goal with the means used to achieve it (i.e., tools of invention). Whatever your end goal is, you can and
should make use of all three available modes of proof. Let's turn briefly to each next.

Logos

       Sound persuasion is based on evidence and valid reasoning. In Aristotle's words, this is the work
       of logos. Logos is the logical or reasoned basis of an appeal. Thus, for our purposes, logos refers
       to the argumentative substance of the presentation. Argumentation constitutes a type of proof
       to convince audiences to accept your message. Because this aspect of public presentations is
       fundamental, we have made it the focus of the next two chapters. However, argumentation is
       only one mode of proof.

Ethos

Persuasion is also a matter of credibility or ethos. As described in chapter 5, ethos is drawn from
the audience's perception of the speaker's credibility. When an audience perceives you as cred-
ible, or "worthy of confidence," they are more likely to be persuaded by you. In other words, your
credibility functions as another form of proof of the validity of your argument.

            Notice, however, that your ethos exists only to the degree that your audience perceives
you as credible, and their perception is based on how you present yourself in and through your
speech. You may have established a public reputation that precedes your speech, but you must
further develop, reinforce, and/or improve your ethos in and through each presentation you
make.

            According to Aristotle, speakers can develop their ethos by demonstrating one or more of the following four
qualities through their speech:

   competence (expertise, preparation, intelligence)
   trustworthiness (moral standing, integrity)

2. Aristotle, Rhetoric, in Aristotle's Treatise on Rhetoric, trans. Graduate of the University (London: Oxford, 1823), 10.
   308 | Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation
      goodwill (having an audience's best interests at heart)
      dynamism (charisma)3
   We are persuaded by advocates and sources that best display these qualities. Consequently, Priyanka, for example, might
   stress her experience as a lifelong athlete and member of the basketball team (competence) as well as her desire for all
   student athletes at her college to be treated fairly (goodwill).

               It's important you spend time cultivating your ethos because, according to Aristotle, moral character (ethos)
   offers the most effective means of persuasion.4 You might consider why and whether you agree with him.

  Pathos

                                             Finally, there is the role of emotion or pathos. Recall from chapter 5 that pathos is con-
                                             cerned with the psychological state of the audience and rests upon effective, ethical
                                             appeals to their emotions and motivations. Practically speaking, pathos is a measure and
                                             reflection of the extent to which we are moved by and feel invested in a topic and a mes-
                                             sage. Those feelings constitute another form of proof of the validity of the speaker's case.

                                                         Feelings may be appealed to or cultivated in a multitude of ways. Aristotle makes
                                             the intuitive argument that we desire emotions that result in pleasure and want to avoid
                                             emotions that result in pain. A speaker can use this observation when crafting their mes-
                                             sage:
      Perhaps they associate the problem they are targeting with painful emotions. Aristotle listed such painful feelings
         as anger, fear, shame, shamelessness, contempt, pity, indignation, and envy.
      A speaker can elicit pleasurable feelings in relation to their desired solution. Aristotle named such pleasurable feel-
         ings as patience, friendship, confidence, and kindness.
               Of course, these are only a sampling of possible emotions you can elicit and ways you can use them in your
   speech.

   The effective use of pathos can be seen in Notre Dame

women's basketball coach Muffet McGraw's April 4, 2019,
response to a reporter's question.5 The question was

prompted by an interview published earlier in which

McGraw critiqued the prominence of men hired as coaches

in women's sports, especially college basketball, and
defended her own all-female coaching staff.6 On this occa-

sion, the reporter asked her, "How seriously do you take

being that voice," referring to being a voice for women.

            McGraw answered by eliciting indignation about      Muffet McGraw by Sphilbrick via Wikimedia

number of women running for office and winning and, still,
we have 23% of the House and 25% of the Senate. I'm get-
ting tired of the novelty of the first female governor of this
state; the first female African American mayor of this city.
When is it going to become the norm instead of the excep-
tion?"

            She then expressed anger and shame about the state of things: "Girls are socialized to know when
they come out, gender roles are already set. Men run the world. Men have the power. Men make the deci-
sions. It's always the men." Moving from broader society to sports, McGraw offered hope that athletics could
help improve conditions for women: "When these girls are coming out, who are they looking up to tell them
that that's not the way it has to be? And where better to do that than in sports?...Wouldn't it be great if we
could teach them to watch how women lead? This is a path for you to take to get to the point where in this
country we have 50% of women in power."

            Her use of hopefulness was then joined by confidence in her practice of hiring women and a return
to anger about the problem. McGraw's response exemplifies the range of emotional appeals available to a
rhetor when advocating for a policy change and, especially, the effective association of painful emotions
with the status quo.

               Clearly, appeals to pathos are potentially very powerful. Consequently, it is this dimension of rhetoric--emo-
   tional appeal--that has caused some scholars to distrust rhetoric. The concern is that rhetoric can obstruct good deci-
   sion-making by displacing reason with emotion. We have certainly seen examples of speakers who rely excessively on
   emotional appeals and frequently on the emotion of fear. For instance, we see scare tactics in accusations of immigrants
   overrunning our borders and committing crimes or claims that our legal system is persecuting innocent officials and
   turning a blind eye to guilty leaders. Although emotion can be overused, it is a valuable part of deliberation and a cor-
   rective to an idealized, coldly rational perspective.

   310 | Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation
the next several steps in the persuasive process. In other words, use heuristics and modes of proof to help you frame
your persuasive efforts and refute counterarguments.

Framing Persuasive Efforts

Recall from chapter 21 that framing is the process by which people use language to present and make sense of their
world. We identified three parts to any framing of a civic issue. Every frame identifies or defines

   the problem (i.e., what's wrong),
   its cause (i.e., who's to blame), and
   the solution (i.e., what should be done).
We also discussed how to use deliberative framing to set up a deliberative presentation. We concluded that since such
presentations are educational, a speaker must frame the problem and possible solutions as clearly and fairly as possible.

            You will now be involved with advocacy, however, whereby you will try to influence your direct audience's
beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action. Therefore, you should employ persuasive framing in your speech. As we explained
in chapter 21, persuasive framing occurs when a speaker strategically names or defines a problem (and its cause) in a
way that sets up their desired solution as effective and reasonable. Indeed, you will need to frame the civic issue you are
addressing as worthy of the audience's attention and your solution as a reasonable and superior response to the prob-
lem.

Demonstrate the Issue as Worthy of Attention

Unless you can convince your audience of the issue's seriousness, they won't have reason to change their beliefs, atti-
tudes, or courses of action. You can demonstrate seriousness in a few ways: Characterize the problem as a violation of
the audience's shared values, narrow your focus, offer compelling evidence of the issue's existence, and illustrate how
the problem affects your audience's lives.

Violation of Values

First, it is often effective to depict the problem as a violation of the audience's shared values or commitments. In chapter
21, we defined a value as a principle or quality that human beings are committed to and upon which they base their
thinking and decisions for important issues. You can employ the power of values in persuasion by explaining how the
problem is violating your audience's values and commitments. This strategy is effective whether your specific goal is to
influence the audience's beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action.

                                                                    Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation | 311
   A good example of persuasive framing can be found in the rhetoric we considered earlier by McGraw.
Recall she had said earlier that as head coach for Notre Dame's women's basketball team, she only hired
female coaches. That statement stirred controversy, resulting in her being asked more about her policy.

            When prompted by a reporter, McGraw could have presented her argument in terms of its effec-
tiveness (her team was headed to the Final Four) or the disproportionate amount of male staff in college
sports.

                                                                   Instead, she framed her case in light of
                                                       national gender inequity. She opened by referring
                                                       to the US government's failure to pass the Equal
                                                       Rights Amendment (ERA). As she reminded the
                                                       audience, the ERA was introduced in 1967 to make
                                                       sex discrimination unconstitutional, but it failed to
                                                       gain sufficient state support to pass.

                                                       She then turned to congressional and local

                                                       leadership by noting how few women are in the

                                                       House of Representatives or Senate or are even

                                                       governors or mayors. At that point she asked, "How

Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) banner Susan Ruggles via  are these young women looking up and seeing
Flickr, CC BY.                                         someone that looks like them, preparing them for

                                                       the future? We don't have enough female role mod-

els. We don't have enough visible women leaders. We don't have enough women in power."

            McGraw established the problem as a vast breach in fairness and gender equity nationally and
locally. By establishing the disparity in female leadership as a national and enduring violation of shared val
ues, McGraw's practice of hiring female staff for women's sports teams seemed both reasonable and practi-
cal--a small place to start, so to speak. Notice, too, that framing her hiring practice as helping alleviate the
problem depicted McGraw as a kind of innovative problem-solver and encouraged the audience to identify
with her desire for equality and fairness.

Narrow Focus

Second, narrow your focus so your audience perceives themselves as capable of making a
change. Avoid making an issue seem so immense or difficult that you give the impression
that nothing can be done. For instance, it would be a tall order to convince your audience
in ten minutes that all women's sports should be funded equally to men's sports. It would
be more realistic to whittle the problem of gender inequity in sports down to a topic like
pressures on girls to quit sports in larger numbers than boys or on the relative lack of
media attention to women's sports compared to men's.

312 | Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation
Compelling Evidence

Third, further demonstrate the issue as worthy of your audience's attention by offering high-quality, tangible evidence
of the problem or community concern, whether that be through a reliance on

   logos, which demonstrates the scope of a problem through statistics;
   pathos, which appeals to the emotional and human toll of an issue and highlights specific examples; or
   ethos, which is generated when a subject is explained through credible sources and testimony.

Ideally, a combination of all three types of appeals and evidence forms the strongest presentation.

Direct Effects

Finally, relate the issue directly to your audience by showing how and where it is evident in their lives and communities.
Such an approach will not only create audience understanding but also heighten audience identification with the issue.

Emphasize the Superiority of Your Response

Another element of framing is to present a good way to respond to the problem. It isn't enough to demonstrate that the
issue is worthy of the audience's attention. You must persuade them of the change in belief, attitude, or course of action
you want them to adopt in response. Here you clearly restate your thesis and emphasize the superiority of this response
to the issue.

            Spend time explaining how the desired belief, attitude, or course of action would address the problem. What
will it improve, solve, or help? How might recognizing the reality of internet addiction enable sufferers to get help? How
would eating locally grown produce improve the city's economy and possibly the health of its residents?

            As you explain, support your explanation of how the desired outcome will improve the problem with evidence
derived from examples, statistics, and testimony. Don't make the audience take your word for it. Use the research meth-
ods we discussed in chapters 8 and 9 and employ the argumentation skills we will provide in chapters 26 and 27 to
strengthen your case.

            Also, ensure that the solution aligns logically with your presentation of the problem. Somewhat like the rela-
tionship between a question and an answer, you must frame the issue so that the problem (and its cause) sets up your
solution as effective and reasonable.

The Ethics of Framing

You might read our instructions to persuasively frame your topic and wonder, Is this ethical? Is it morally acceptable to
strategically present a topic so the audience is more likely to accept my solution? Let's address these important con-
cerns.

                                                                   Developing Your Persuasive Speech Through Invention, Framing, and Refutation | 313
Framing as Necessary and Helpful

On one hand, framing is ethical, because it is necessary and helpful for audiences. Frames help people absorb and make
sense of facts and information. A more typical use of the word "framing" may clarify this point.

   Think of the wood frame constructed to build a house. That frame is built directly on top of the foundation, and it
      creates the solid structure upon which the rest of the housing materials (drywall, roofing tiles, window panes, etc.)
      hang.

   Similarly, persuasive frames form the basis or context on which we hang or make sense of information. Facts and
      statistics alone are meaningless to us without a frame or context to give them significance, somewhat like drywall
      is useless without a wood frame on which to hang it.

            In other words, framing in and of itself is not unethical; it is simply the way our minds and human language
work. By thoughtfully framing public issues, speakers enable community members to make sense of otherwise mean-
ingless facts or to make order out of seemingly incoherent information.

Box 25.6 Using Framing to Help Your Audience Make Sense of Information

                                             If you tell your audience that US Customs and Border Protection
                                          had 2.47 million encounters with people illegally crossing the south-
                                          west border in fiscal year 2023, they probably wouldn't know what to
                                          conclude from that statistic. If, instead, you frame these crossings as
                                          illustrating a "border crisis" and explain that the number is 40%
                                          higher than fiscal year 2021--as the US House Committee on Home
                                          land Security did7--that would invite the audience to conclude that
                                          illegal immigration is a problem and that border policies are inade-
                                          quately addressing it.

ingly, the audience would be encouraged to view illegal immigration as an issue that is being successfully

addressed by border policies at the time.

  Honest Versus Dishonest Framing Efforts

   On the other hand, we can borrow Will Friedman's work to distinguish honest from dishonest ways of "framing to per-
   suade." Friedman defines honest framing efforts as "sincere rhetorical advocacy" in which the speaker says, "`I believe
   this because' and...means it." Such framing efforts attempt to persuade the audience in an ethical, open, and trustworthy
   manner with the public good in mind.

               In contrast, dishonest framing efforts manipu-
   late facts and promote disinformation. Motivated almost
   solely by a desire to win the argument by any means nec-
   essary, dishonest persuasive framing prioritizes personal
   gain over the public good.

               We have all seen, for example, how attack ads
   during an election season can take the statements of an
   opponent (an implied audience or person represented in
   a speech) out of context, feature unflattering pictures,
   and publicize rumor as if it's truth. Such framing harms
   public debate and fosters the vices of unproductive public
   discourse discussed in chapter 2.9

               We invite and strongly encourage you, then, to
   advocate a position as skillfully and passionately as possi-
   ble. Use persuasive framing strategically to make your Image by tswedensky via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.
   solution look attractive but do so with honesty and
   integrity for the benefit of the public good. Maintain such ethical standards as you identify and rebut arguments
   opposed to your thesis.

 Refute Counterarguments

   By its very nature, a persuasive presentation will encounter resistance. You are attempting to persuade people to think
   or act in a way that is counter to what they are presently doing. Listeners generally have reasons they disagree with your
   perspective--some good, some bad.

               To persuade an audience to change its mind, you must address their reasons. If you ignore common counter
   arguments, or claims and reasoning that oppose your own, the audience is more apt to ignore you. They will feel like
   you haven't challenged their perspective and may think you are uninformed about the topic. As a result, an important
   component of nearly every persuasive speech is attention to counterarguments.

               One option available is to explicitly acknowledge a counterargument by stating it and then refuting it--that is,
   giving the reasons why you think it is invalid or weak. You might even devote a main point of your speech to refuting
   one or more counterarguments. This occurs when you discuss alternative solutions to a problem, such as in the prob-
   lem-alternatives-solution or the refutative patterns of organization discussed in chapter 13.

               The benefits of acknowledging counterarguments are many: It makes your argument more persuasive to those
   with opposing views, it shows you are prepared and thoughtful, and it demonstrates you are willing to confront difficult
   choices.

            However, acknowledging counterarguments can backfire if you commit two common mistakes:
 1. First, while you have a responsibility to refute counterarguments, don't feel obliged to make the counterargument.

      That is, don't provide evidence that proves the opposing position. Too often this reinforces the opposing view held
      by those in your audience. This is an additional way persuasion differs from deliberation.
2. Second, avoid adopting the language or phrases used by people who argue against your position. Otherwise, you
      will unwittingly reinforce the counterargument. For example, if you argue on behalf of undocumented workers but
      refer to them as "illegal aliens," it will be difficult for your audience to think of them as anything other than viola-
      tors of the law who deserve to be punished. Once you adopt the words of a counter perspective, you are arguing at
      a disadvantage. Instead, find a different language to express the counterargument and your refutation.

            Between this and the previous chapter, we have outlined six steps in the process of developing a persuasive
speech. While the steps by no means compose a comprehensive template, they do cover the basics of the persuasive
process as you move from analyzing your listeners to refuting popular counterarguments.

     Summary

        This chapter covered the last three (of six total) steps in the persuasive process:
          The fourth step is the invention of effective persuasive appeals and arguments. In the process of inven-

             tion, speakers can draw on heuristic devices as well as the three primary modes of proof--logos, pathos,
             and ethos--to generate ideas and specific arguments.
          The fifth step of the persuasive process involves framing your persuasive efforts. Speakers should use
             framing in honest and ethical ways to demonstrate their issue as worthy of attention and to emphasize
             the superiority of their desired response.
          The final step is refuting counterarguments. To strengthen advocacy, speakers should acknowledge and
             refute one or more counterarguments to their proposal.

Review Questions

    1. How do heuristic devices help speakers and writers form their ideas?
   2. According to Aristotle, what are the three modes of proof for advocating an idea or claim?
   3. What are counterarguments, and why should speakers refute them during their speech?

Discussion Questions

    1. Aristotle asserts that ethos is the most important of the proofs. Do you agree with this assessment?
        Why or why not?

   2. For Aristotle, the modes of proof were to be used in combination but with the special instruction that
        pathos not be used as the sole means of persuasion. Why do you think Aristotle objected to basing per-
        suasion solely on pathos? Do you agree with that instruction? Why or why not?

   3. Think of a public issue and identify several ways of framing it. For each frame, name its definition of the
        problem, to whom or what it assigns blame for the problem, and the solution it supports. Which is the
        most persuasive? For whom?

   4. Do the means of persuasion ever justify the ends? That is, as long as the belief, attitude, or course of
        action that you convince an audience to accept is in their best interest, does it matter how you convince
        them to do it? What about when a political candidate uses dishonest framing to win an election--but then
        ultimately governs well?

26. Building Sound Arguments Through Quality
Evidence

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Construct sound arguments.
          Analyze arguments for their strengths and weaknesses.
          Evaluate common types of evidence to assess their quality.

Every day you make and encounter a variety of arguments. You might make an argument to your school's student gov-
ernment to start an esports club. On a video chat with your parents, you might present an argument for why they should
purchase you a car for school or send (more) spending money. Later that night, your friends might seek to convince you
that LeBron James, rather than Michael Jordan, is the best basketball player of all time.

            We also routinely encounter arguments about important civic matters. We might
read a letter in the newspaper by a school board member arguing why a local property tax
increase is necessary to improve area schools. On news programs and in public speeches,
we daily hear politicians and political operatives advance arguments about the best way to
run the country.

            With so many different arguments competing for our adherence, how do we make
decisions about personal matters, about what is best for our local community, and about
what the nation should do on vital issues of the day?

            This chapter enables you to think carefully about logos. Logos is the logical or rea-
soned basis of an appeal (i.e., argumentation), and it is part of the rhetorical canon of invention (as explained in chapters
1 and 25). By learning more about argumentation, you will improve your ability to make sound decisions and critically
analyze public options. You will also learn about speechmaking, since most speeches are based on a series of arguments.
In this chapter, we examine two fundamental issues related to reasoning in public speaking: the structure of argument
and the selection and evaluation of evidence.

The Structure of Argument

An argument is the advocacy of a belief, attitude, or course of action that is supported by evidence. An argument (or
series of arguments) gives reasons why a listener should agree with the perspective being advocated. We begin by con-
sidering the development of what is known as the Toulmin model and some limitations to the practice of good reason-
ing.

Box 26.1 Classical Reasoning

                                                     Aristotle advocated the syllogism as the proper form of
                                                  argument.1 A syllogism is a three-step proposition that
                                                  consists of two premises and a conclusion. If the premises
                                                  are valid, then the conclusion must be true. This is also
                                                  known as deductive reasoning, reasoning that moves from
                                                  valid premises to a specific conclusion. The classic example
                                                  of a syllogism is the following:

                                                  All men are mortal. (major premise)
                                                  Socrates is a man. (minor premise)
                                                  Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)

                                                     If the two premises can be proven true, then it follows

                                                  that the conclusion must also be true. This is also the

                                                  process of formal logic, which relies on the certainty of the

                                                  offered premises to reach what is considered an unques-
                                                  tioned, or true, conclusion.2

                                                  Syllogism is a valid argumentative form--as is

                                                  deductive reasoning generally. However, in regular conver-

Aristotle by Alvaro Marques Hijazo via Wikimedia  sation, we rarely have premises and conclusions that are
Commons, Public Domain.                           accepted as absolutely true. Just as often, some premises

                                                  are omitted from an argument. Observing such tendencies,

Aristotle coined the enthymeme as a rhetorical syllogism.

            An enthymeme is an informal, incomplete syllogism in which a speaker relies on an audience to use
its knowledge and experience to supply missing information that completes the argument. Take, for exam-
ple, the underdeveloped argument, "Tax incentives for electric vehicles are justified because they will slow
climate change." Its central, unstated premises include "tax incentives influence consumer behavior" and
"vehicle emissions contribute to climate change." The enthymeme expects listeners to supply the missing
reasoning that completes the argument.

            However, these premises can also be debated or argued. Even if, as an audience member, we can
supply a missing premise, we might still reject the argument. In this case, we might reject that "vehicle
emissions contribute to climate change" or that the government should intervene in the free market. The
contingent nature of premises in enthymemes allows for disagreement on public matters and policy deci-
sions.3 Exceptions and counterarguments to premises and conclusions result in complex arguments that
defy categorization in classical syllogistic form.

 The Toulmin Model

   In the 1950s, Stephen Toulmin developed an approach to reasoning that is accepted by many as the standard in argu-
   ment studies.4 This approach, popularly known as the Toulmin model, provides a way to understand and critique argu-
   ments. In its full form, the model consists of as many as seven parts (see box 26.2); however, we primarily focus on its
   three most central components: claim, data, and warrant.

 Claim

   The claim of an argument is what you are attempting to prove and want an audience to accept. Examples of claims
   include the following:

                "I should study chemistry this evening."
             "My education will provide a good return on investment (ROI)."
             "My public speaking professor is the best."

               Your thesis statement is the most important claim in your speech. For instance, in a
   persuasive speech, you might offer the thesis "Greek organizations' new member recruit-
   ment should be improved." Each main point--each reason for changing Greek recruit-
   ment--is also a claim that supports your thesis. These are what we call subclaims because
   they are subordinate to the larger argument.

             Box 26.2 The Toulmin Model
             Born in London, Stephen Toulmin (1922-2009) studied mathematics and physics before turning to philos-
          ophy and a focus on ethics, logic, and reasoning after World War II.5 While Toulmin authored several books
          and taught at multiple US institutions, he is best known for the model of argument that came to be identi-
          fied with his name.

                       In his 1958 book The Uses of Argument, Toulmin originally outlined an argument as consisting of six
          parts, but following the work of argumentation scholars Richard D. Rieke, Malcolm O. Sillars, and Tarla Rai
          Peterson, we offer the full model as containing seven elements:

                Claim: The idea one is trying to prove and wants an audience to accept.
                Data: Material or evidence that supports the acceptance of the claim. It answers the question

                "Why?" or "What have you got to go on?"
             Warrant: A statement that justifies the connection between data and claim. The warrant is often

                implied and answers the question "How do you get there?"
             Backing: More specific evidence that reinforces data or the warrant. It explains the data or warrant

                as being "On account of."
             Qualifier: A term that modifies the strength or certainty of the claim such as "might," "usually," or

                "always."
             Reservation: A condition or exception when the claim would not be advocated. A reservation is

                noted by terms like "except" or "unless."
             Rebuttal: A basis for challenging the validity of the claim.

Data

A claim alone is not an argument. A claim offered without reason, support, or data is merely an assertion, a term previ-
ously introduced in chapter 5. An assertion fails to qualify as an argument because no reason is given for why it should
be accepted. This is why data, or material and reasons supporting the acceptance of the claim (also commonly called
evidence), are essential in forming a valid argument. Note that "data" here refers to all types of evidence, not solely sta-
tistics and facts.

            Data fill in the "why" or "because" for your claims. For your thesis that Greek organi-
zations' new member recruitment should be improved, data could consist of the following:

   statistics on recent challenges to new member recruitment
   testimony about unfair recruitment practices
   examples of problems with the recruitment system

            Each piece of information allows you to better support the claim and more convinc-
ingly persuade an audience to accept your argument. Data are typically found throughout your speech.

Warrant

Finally, a valid argument rests upon an acceptable warrant. The warrant provides justification
for using the data to support the claim. In essence the warrant is a bridge, often in the form
of a value statement, that connects the data with the claim, reinforcing their relationship.

            Warrants are typically implied rather than stated; however, at times it is important to
state your warrant as well, particularly when an audience may not readily agree with the link
between claim and data that you are otherwise asserting.

            Consider the following example to understand how a warrant functions:
                                 Claim: I should replace my old truck with a new hybrid vehicle

                              Data: because hybrid vehicles produce significantly less environmental pollution.

                                                                                                         Building Sound Arguments Through Quality Evidence | 321
                        The warrant wants to answer how we get from the data to the claim or explain what makes
            this data a reason to accept the claim.

                                 Warrant: Reducing automotive emissions is environmentally responsible.
                        It is likely that this warrant would be implied, relying on enthymematic reasons supplied by
            an audience. Presumably, the positive contribution to the environment is a strong enough incentive
            to cause the person making this argument to take action. However, there could be counterarguments
            or rebuttals that might cause this person to reject the claim (the cost of a new vehicle, for example).
            A more developed argument would consider these possibilities by providing backing for the warrant
            and/or data in quantifying the environmental benefits.

          Box 26.3 Visualizing the Toulmin Model
          The Toulmin model provides a layout to visualize or diagram arguments.

                                                                                                   Example argument: I should replace my old
                                                                                      truck with a new hybrid vehicle because hybrid
                                                                                      vehicles produce significantly less environmental
                                                                                      pollution.

                                                                                                   The Toulmin model is more than a way of dia-
                                                                                      gramming arguments--it is a way of improving how you
                                                                                      think about arguments. It allows you to conceptualize and
                                                                                      diagnose your own arguments and those produced by
others. Putting an argument into the Toulmin form can allow you to

   see what the claim is and if it is reasonable;
   consider what the data are, if there is enough, and the data's quality; and
   evaluate if there is a reasonable warrant, or one can be inferred, that connects the data and the claim.

Because the model promotes clearer thinking about how we reason together, it is a way of enriching our civic engage-
ment and the messages we send and receive about democratic participation.

Arguments and Their Limits

Rhetorical arguments are powerful but inexact. Audiences can weigh arguments on public issues and come to signifi-
cantly different conclusions about their merit. Such is the case in the difficult issue of abortion access as different peo-
ple hold different views on the issue, and different states have vastly different laws.

            Some audiences may also refuse to reason. As the example in box 26.4 illustrates, some appeals, urges, and
habits overcome reason, and not all decision-makers weigh competing arguments the same way.

322 | Building Sound Arguments Through Quality Evidence
              Box 26.4 Limitations on Arguments Against Smoking
              Think about this abbreviated (and asserted) causal argument: "People should not smoke because scores of
           scientific studies have proven that smoking has significant adverse health effects, including death." In a
           Toulmin form, the argument would appear as follows:

                       A wealth of valid backing for this argument
           is available from the Centers for Disease Control
           and Prevention and other sources. Yet many people
           who hear the strong evidence against it still smoke.
           The American Cancer Society reports that as of
           2019, approximately thirty-four million people in
           the United States (14% of the population) smoke.6
           The reasons are no doubt varied, including value hierarchies that justify the decision to smoke, challenges to
           the evidence concerning the impacts of smoking, and the difficulty of kicking the habit.

 Evidence and Its Evaluation

   Evidence is data and backing in the form of examples, statistics, and testimony that are used to support a claim. The key
   is finding not just any evidence but the best evidence to support your argument. When you use weak evidence, your data
   will generally be insufficient to convince an audience of your argument's validity.

               To discover strong evidence, begin by selecting credible sources using the guidance in chapter 8. Then draw
   from your sources to find and evaluate evidence. Use the instructions provided next for choosing examples, scrutinizing
   statistics, and selecting testimony.

  Choosing Examples

   An example provides a concrete instance in the form of a fact or occurrence. An example seeks to make a claim tangible
   to an audience. Examples generally take one of three forms: specific, hypothetical, and anecdotes.

Specific Examples

The most valuable type of example is a specific example. A specific example is factual, one that has actually happened or
is being experienced. A specific example prompts an audience to recognize that the claim (or a similar claim) has been
demonstrated or proven true on a prior occasion.

   Box 26.5 Specific Examples in Practice

   In a 2023 commencement address at the University of
Chicago, Bret Stephens, a New York Times columnist and
Chicago graduate, gave a speech that argued for the value
of "speaking your mind when other people don't want you
to." One way he supported his thesis was through the use of
a series of specific examples in which conventional wisdom
proved incorrect and it would have been beneficial to inter-
rogate the ideas of allies or superiors, including the follow-
ing:

   Why were the economists and governors at the Fed-
eral Reserve so confident that interest rates could
remain rock bottom for years without running a seri-
ous risk of inflation?...Why were so few people on Wall
Street betting against the housing market in 2007?
Why were so many officials and highly qualified ana-
lysts so adamant that Saddam Hussein had weapons of
mass destruction?...and why did so many major polling
firms fail to predict Donald Trump's victory in 2016?7

            The effectiveness of Stephens's examples was in     [Bret Stephens] by Grant Wickes via Wikimedia
their succinct expression of a series of specific instances     Commons, CC BY.
where most experts were ultimately proven incorrect and
more dissenting voices would have been valuable.

 Hypothetical Examples

  A less powerful but still useful type of example is a hypothetical example. A hypothetical example is based on a plausible
  event or occurrence but does not represent a specific, actual instance. This sort of example allows an audience to visu-
  alize the claim, but it lacks the concrete data of a specific example.

   Box 26.6 Hypothetical Examples in Practice

   In 2023 when former South Carolina governor and US
ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced
her intention to run for the 2024 Republican presidential
nomination, she spoke of her desire to create a country
where "anyone can do anything and achieve their own
American dream." To illustrate her claim, Haley pointed to a
plausible range of American experiences, without naming
any one individual in particular as possessing the experi-
ences:

   The college student who's paying too much and get-
ting too little from her education. The young adult in
his first real job wondering how he'll ever afford a
mortgage or start a family. The single mom working
two jobs and three times harder than anyone else....I'm
fighting for all of us because all of us have to be in this
together.8

            Haley used hypothetical examples that allowed her
audience to visualize themselves within the America she
was seeking to lead.

                                                               Nikki Haley by Renee Ittner-McManus via

Anecdotes

Finally, anecdotes, which we defined in chapter 11 as stories or extended examples in narrative form, are more elaborate
examples that include additional detail. Often presented in the form of personal narratives, these examples seek a
deeper connection with the audience. While powerful, these take time for a speaker to develop and present.

   Box 26.7 Anecdotes in Practice

   An effective illustration or personal narrative is again found in Nikki Haley's presidential campaign
announcement. Three times in that speech Haley returned to her status as "the proud daughter of Indian
immigrants" to illustrate the relevance of her personal experience in leading "a new generation" of Ameri-

           cans "into the future." The extended example peaked near her conclusion where she underscored her expe-
           riences a final time. Speaking about the "country's renewal," she shared:

                     I'm more confident than ever that we can make this vision real in our time because that's what I've
                  seen my entire life. As a brown girl growing up in a black and white world, I saw the promise of
                  America unfold before me. As the proud wife of a combat veteran, I saw our people's deep love of
                  freedom and our determination to defend it. As governor I saw our state move beyond hate and vio-
                  lence and lift up everyone in peace....The time has come to renew that spirit and rally our people.
                  Our moment is now....Let's save our country...and move forward together.9

                       Here Haley offers an illustration of her life experiences that is richer than any specific accom-
           plishment she has had as a politician and provides insight into her life.

               Not all examples are equal, and thus you must carefully evaluate their selection. A poor example fails to justify
   your claim and risks damaging your credibility and persuasiveness.

               Here are a few considerations (also found in box 26.15) that you should make when selecting and evaluating
   examples:

      Is the example representative, or typical, of the broader situation or experience?
      Are a sufficient number of examples used to prove the claim?
      Have negative examples (counterexamples) been addressed?
      Is the example compelling in its detail, clarity, and vividness?

               Consider these questions when evaluating the strength of an example, though an example may not meet all of
   these standards and still be satisfactory.

              Box 26.8 Examples as Evidence
              An example provides a concrete instance in the form of a fact or occurrence. It seeks to make a claim tan-
           gible to an audience. Examples generally take one of three forms.
                Specific example: A specific example is factual, an example that has actually happened or is being

                   experienced.
                Hypothetical example: A hypothetical example is based on a plausible event or occurrence but does

                   not represent a specific, actual instance.
                Anecdote: Anecdotes, extended examples, or illustrations are more elaborate examples that contain

                   additional detail.

Scrutinizing Statistics

Statistics, a second common form of evidence, represent information in numeric form according to size, quantity, or
frequency. In public speaking, statistics are most commonly used to demonstrate public opinion, capture common expe-
riences and behaviors, and efficiently express the distribution and allocation of resources.

            Speakers love statistics--and with a little searching, it seems we can find a statistic for just about anything, from
the number of pieces of mail processed and delivered every day by the US Postal Service (318 million) to the percentage
of people who believe in extraterrestrials (about 65% of adults in the United States).10

            Because statistics have an air of tangibility, appear to be exact, and seem authoritative, we too often accept
them as true. In reality, statistics should be carefully scrutinized. As American author and satirist Mark Twain is pur
ported to have once said, "There are lies, damned lies, and statistics." Nonetheless, statistics are a useful basis of proof
in many speeches.

   Box 26.9 Statistics in Practice

   In his April 3, 2024, remarks at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Jerome H. Powell relied on statistics in
advancing his case that the nation's economic out-
look was continuing to improve after a period of
stubbornly high inflation. Powell supported his
contention by pointing to improvements in infla-
tionary trends and continued job growth.

 Specifically, Powell noted that inflation had

slowed from an annual rate of 5.2% in the

prior year to only 2.5% in the twelve-month

period leading to February 2024.

 Moreover, three million new jobs had been

created in 2023 as inflation declined, and an       Governor Powell by Federalreserve via Wikimedia Commons,
average of 265,000 new jobs were added in           Public Domain.

the previous three months.

 Due to such changes, the Federal Open Market Committee predicted continual, if "sometimes bumpy,"

progress toward the Fed's goal of 2% annual inflation.

   These statistics, which reflect the use of raw numbers, trends, and averages, were some of the primary
data offered by Powell as he addressed the overall health of the US economy.11

            Four of the most common forms of statistics called upon by public speakers are averages, raw numbers, trends,
and polls.

Average

An average is a common and seemingly benign statistic that is frequently used by speakers. In principle it represents
what is typical--what is average--and in box 26.9, we see Federal Reserve Board Chair Powell making use of the average
number of new jobs being added to the economy on a monthly basis--265,000. However, an average may be more com-
plicated than it initially appears because there are at least three methods for determining an average--through mean,
median, or mode.

            The most common method for representing an average is the mean. A mean is derived by summing all the data
and dividing the total by the number of data points. The median, in contrast, is the data point that appears in the exact
middle of a sample, and the mode is the result number that appears most frequently.

Box 26.10 Limitations of Using the Mean to Find an Average

   Suppose you were leading a discussion about the low working wages available for college students seeking
summer employment. A statistic you might find valuable is the amount earned by the average student
worker in your class during the previous summer (this would be a small sample but a relevant one to your
audience).

                                                            If you had access to all the financial data,

                                                      you could determine the mean income by adding

                                                      together the total dollars earned by your class-

                                                      mates and then dividing it by the number of stu-

                                                      dent workers. If twenty-five students had combined

                                                      wages of $150,000, the mean student income was

                                                                  However, what if you found that this

included $50,000 earned by a single student in an astoundingly successful entrepreneurial venture? How

does this change the average, and what does it do to the value, meaning, and accuracy of this statistic for

your speech?

Raw Number

A second common statistic is a raw number. In the student wages example in box 26.10, the raw number was $150,000
(the total wages earned). In box 26.9, Jerome Powell made use of a raw number as well--three million jobs added in the

    previous year. We use raw numbers when we want to draw on the power of the magnitude of a number. An average may
    make a number seem small or insignificant, but by giving the entire scope of the data through a raw number, an audi-
    ence may gain a better grasp of the situation.

                However, the opposite may also be true: A raw number can make a problem look much worse than it actually is
    because it combines all the data into a single representation. Box 26.11 provides an example.

               Box 26.11 Limitations of Using Only Raw Numbers
                                                            If you were to learn that the Biden administration proposed a $34 billion

                                                         increase (a raw number) to the United States' 2025 defense budget, you
                                                         might be concerned about the seemingly large budget increase. However, if
                                                         you also were provided with a trend statistic clarifying this represented a
                                                         budget increase of only about 4.1%--and that after accounting for inflation
                                                         over the prior two years the spending power of the defense budget experi-
                                                         enced a 3% decline--you might perceive the raw number differently.12

  Trend Statistic

    When a speaker wants to demonstrate a change that has occurred over a period of time, the statistic that is most often
    used is called a trend. A trend statistic emphasizes change in a clear and meaningful way by providing two points of
    comparison. As the Powell example in box 26.9 demonstrates, trend statistics are important to economists. Trend sta-
    tistics for inflation, gross domestic product, unemployment, and interest rates can provide a more focused and efficient
    evaluation of the immediate economic climate.

Polling Data

Finally, perhaps the most popular type of statistic is polling data. A valid, scientific poll measures the opinions or beliefs
of a large group of people by collecting data from a representative random sample that is similar in its demographics to
the rest of the population and then generalizes the results.

            Polling data is collected on a variety of topics, ranging from whom one intends to vote for in a presidential elec-
tion to what is the best movie ever made. One of the oldest and most recognized polling researchers is Gallup, a global
analytics firm that has measured public opinion for nearly a century. Gallup regularly tracks opinions on various topics,
such as consumer confidence, presidential approval, and the future of Medicare and Social Security. While polling data
must be carefully analyzed, it is valuable in giving your audience an indication of what a larger public thinks. That is,
while the majority may not always be right, their opinion can be influential.

            However, not all polls are equally valid, and in selecting polling data, there are several items you should con-
sider:

   In particular, you should verify that the poll is based on a representative random sample. This can be determined by
      examining how the poll was conducted--who was polled, how they were polled, how many people were polled,
      when they were polled--and what the margin of error is. The margin of error is the uncertainty or potential varia-
      tion in a polling result. It reflects the sampling error or margin in which there is less confidence about the accu-
      racy of the survey result.

   Also, be careful how you use nonscientific internet polling that asks website visitors their opinion on an issue. Such
      polls have a selection bias in terms of who chooses to take the poll. For example, The Athletic's daily sports
      newsletter, "The Pulse," periodically gives sports fans the opportunity to express their opinion on various sports-
      related issues and events. Such polls are interesting to sports fans and do show something of popular opinion, but
      be mindful that the results are not statistically valid.

          Box 26.12 The American Freshman
          The Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) Freshman Survey, administered by the Higher
       Education Research Institute at UCLA, is taken by tens of thousands of first-time full-time college students
       each fall. In 2019, 126,642 new students from 178 four-year schools participated in the survey. Ninety-five

        dents.

     A personal goal of being well-off financially was indicated by 84.3% of respondents.

 What other information would you want to know about the data before deciding whether to use it?
 How useful might this information be to a speaker planning a presentation on a related topic?
 How might the information be misused or overgeneralized?
 What information do these results leave out?

                In sum, it is crucial that you carefully scrutinize statistics. You should closely consider how a statistic was
    derived so you have a good grasp of its validity. It is ethically suspect to simply report a number without some under-
    standing of how it was derived. Similarly, as a listener, be skeptical of statistics presented without enough information

or context to evaluate their credibility. A statistical conclusion is only as good as the method used to arrive at it. For that
reason, here are a few questions (also in box 26.15) you should ask when selecting and evaluating statistics:

   If the number is an average, is it the mean, the median, or the mode? Is it representative of the data, or is it skewed
      by an extreme data point?

   What was the sample size: the number of people used to determine the average or polled?
   If using polling data, what is the margin of error or reliability? Polls that have a margin of error greater than a few

      percentage points are suspect, particularly if the margin of error is greater than the difference between the polling
      result options.
   What do you know about the sample? Was it randomly selected? Are there factors about the sample population
      (age, gender, geography, etc.) that make the data suspect?
   When was the data collected? Public opinion, averages, and raw numbers can change with time.

          Box 26.13 Statistics as Evidence
          A statistic represents information in numeric form according to size, quantity, or frequency. A statistic has
       an aura of certainty and exactness while being able to efficiently express public opinion, capture common
       experiences, or show the scope of an issue. Statistics may be expressed in several forms.

             Raw number: A single number or figure that captures the breadth of an occurrence.
             Trend statistic: A trend statistic represents meaning over a specific period of time.
             Polling data: Polling data seeks to represent the opinions or beliefs of a large group of people by

                collecting data from a representative random sample.
             Average: An average seeks to numerically represent what is a typical or common experience. An

                average may be derived in three different ways.
                    The mean is calculated by adding together all the data and dividing the sum by the total num-
                        ber of data points. Within the mean might be outliers--experiences that are either much larger
                        or much smaller than what is typical.
                    The median seeks to compensate for outliers by representing the data point that is in the
                        exact middle of the sample; it is the middle result from among all of the data points.
                    The mode is the data point that appears most frequently in the sample.

Selecting Testimony

Testimony is a third common form of evidence that serves as data and backing for arguments. Testimony is facts or
opinions drawn from the words, experiences, and expertise of another individual. Testimony is used to supplement our
own opinions and experiences.

            Testimony should come from authoritative sources on an issue. In chapter 8, we recognized three types of
source authorities. Subject authorities are sources with trained expertise on the topic. Societal authority emphasizes
a source's power to control outcomes based on their position within a society or organization. Authority can also be
accrued through special experiences.

            Suppose you are giving a speech on US immigration from Venezuela. You may have sensible ideas, but your

332 | Building Sound Arguments Through Quality Evidence
audience is unlikely to accept your opinions alone. Instead, you should build your credibility by supplying well-informed
testimony as data for your claims. Perhaps you could draw on testimony from the following:

   subject authorities such as Dr. Christopher Salas-Wright, whose research focuses on Latin American migrants
   societal authorities such as the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization
   authorities from special circumstances like a Venezuelan who immigrated to the United States

            Testimony from such figures about the wisdom of your proposal would significantly aid the power of your argu-
ment.

            Effective testimony provides explanation and analysis. Make clear how and why the source is authoritative on
the issue. Then offer a sufficient amount of testimony to make the evidence compelling. For example, saying that an
economic analyst declared "The current economic recovery will not continue" does not say much. The testimony fails to
provide an explanation or analysis for why this perspective is justified.

   Box 26.14 Testimony in Practice                In a 2011 speech on voter registration and rights,
                                               then-Attorney General Eric Holder used testimony to sup-

                                                           Near the start of his address, Holder quoted former
                                               President Lyndon B. Johnson as saying, "The right to vote is

                                               in 1965 signed the Voting Rights Act into law.

                                                           In turn, to establish that there was a threat to this
                                               essential right, Holder drew from US Congressman John
                                               Lewis, a civil rights leader from the 1960s with firsthand
                                               knowledge and experience of the struggles over voter reg-
                                               istration and voting rights. Holder quoted Lewis to supply
                                               testimony that voting rights are "under attack...[by] a delib-

            As with the other forms of evidence, there are some considerations to make (also in box 26.15) when selecting
and evaluating testimony:

   Is the source a qualified authority due to their subject expertise, societal position, or special circumstances? The
      testimony will strengthen your speech only if the source can truly add insight based on their status as a qualified
      authority on the topic being addressed.

   Does the source have firsthand knowledge of the issue? Ideally, the testimony is based on experience rather than
      opinion, and the source has had close dealings with the issues you are addressing.

   Does the source have excessive personal interest in the issue? A conflict of interest might overly bias the source's
      testimony.

   What assumptions are made in the testimony? Consider what the source assumed when they made the comments
      and consider whether those assumptions are consistent with your own assumptions and argument.

            Examples, statistics, and testimony are necessary components of valid arguments as they provide the substance
used to demonstrate claims. Effective speakers use all three types of evidence in their presentations. Box 26.15 sum-
marizes useful guidelines for selecting and evaluating examples, statistics, and testimony as you build and listen to
speeches and arguments.

     Summary

        Arguments form the basis of decisions we make daily; thus, the ability to produce high-quality arguments is
     of vital concern to public speaking and civic participation. In this chapter you have learned the fundamental
     elements of argument and how to support them.

          An argument is the advocacy of a belief, attitude, or course of action that is supported by evidence. An
             argument (or series of arguments) gives listeners reasons for adopting or agreeing with the perspective
             advocated.

          The Toulmin model of argument is a seven-part model that provides a way to conceptualize, verify, and
             critique arguments so that one can more effectively understand and evaluate public arguments.

          The central elements of the Toulmin model are claim, data, and warrant. The claim of an argument is
             what the speaker seeks to prove and wants an audience to accept. Data are material and reasons that

334 | Building Sound Arguments Through Quality Evidence
   support the acceptance of the claim. The warrant provides the justification for using the data to support
   the claim, acting as a bridge between the two concepts.
 Evidence is data and backing in the form of examples, statistics, and testimony that is used to support a
   claim. Evidence is vital in providing support, and without evidence or data, a speaker is left only with
   assertion.
 An example is evidence that supports a claim by providing a concrete instance in the form of a fact or
   occurrence. The principal forms of examples are specific examples, hypothetical examples, and anec-
   dotes. When selecting and evaluating examples, speakers should judge if the example is representative, if
   a sufficient number of examples have been provided to prove the argument, if negative examples have
   been accounted for, and if the examples have been expressed with sufficient detail and clarity.
 Statistics represent information in numeric form according to the size, quantity, or frequency of an
   idea, outcome, or occurrence. Four common forms of statistics are averages, raw numbers, trends, and
   polls. When selecting and evaluating statistics, pay attention to how an average was derived, observe the
   selection and size of a sample population, review margin of error or reliability for polling data, and con-
   sider the source and date of the statistics.
 Testimony is facts or opinions derived from the words, experiences, and expertise of another individ-
   ual. When selecting and evaluating testimony, speakers should use a qualified authority with clear exper-
   tise, firsthand knowledge of the topic, and a minimum of personal interest or bias. It is also important to
   understand the assumptions of testimony in order to be confident it is utilized in a fair and accurate
   manner.

     Review Questions

         1. What is an argument?
        2. What are the primary parts of an argument according to the Toulmin model? What function does each

             element of argument serve?
        3. What are the primary forms of evidence? What tests should you perform in evaluating the quality of

             each type?

     Discussion Questions

         1. What is required to make a "good" or "quality" argument? Why do people sometimes reject "good" argu-
             ments?

        2. What is the value of the Toulmin model?
        3. Test your ability to identify arguments by analyzing an editorial from The Wall Street Journal or The

             New York Times. First identify the thesis, the subclaims, the data, and the warrants. Second, identify what
             types of data (i.e., examples, statistics, testimony) are used. Third, assess the quality of the data to create
             an overall assessment of the editorial--is it a good argument?
        4. As you watch television or read a magazine, think about the advertisements. Are the advertisements
             arguments? Do some of them present a claim and data? How do they compare with the arguments you
             find in speeches and essays?

27. Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies

Chapter Objectives

Students will:

  Construct sound arguments.
  Identify reasoning patterns.
  Test for common reasoning fallacies.

In the previous chapter, you learned about the meaning and structure of argument and how to select high-quality evi-
dence in order to build strong, valid arguments. In this chapter, we continue our exploration of argument by more
broadly considering how arguments function. We do this by examining two interrelated concepts: patterns of reasoning
and reasoning fallacies.

            This chapter begins by explaining both terms and their relationship. We will next explain five patterns of rea-
soning and their related fallacies. The chapter will end by introducing you to a few additional fallacies.

Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies

When developing arguments in a speech, you can choose from several available approaches or patterns of reasoning.
A reasoning pattern is derived from what kind of data or evidence is selected and how that data or evidence is used to
prove a claim.

            Generally, patterns of reasoning reflect the practice of inductive reasoning, a form of reasoning in which a
speaker uses a series of examples, instances, or cases to support the likelihood of a conclusion. Inductive arguments are
judged based on the strengths (or weaknesses) of the observational data offered in support of a claim. For example, an
inductive argument might be based on a series of examples (the most common form of inductive reasoning), analogies,
or even signs that collectively suggest the likelihood of a particular conclusion.

            Working in concert with reasoning patterns is attention to reasoning fallacies. A reasoning fallacy refers to a
flaw or defect in reasoning that undermines argument validity. A fallacy:

NO                     YES

Does not exist simply  Does occur when a reasoning pattern is used incorrectly or ineffectively. This incorrect use is generally
because we disagree    due to poor evidence or an implied warrant that is faulty. Recall from chapter 26 that a warrant is a
with an argument.      statement that justifies the connection between data (evidence) and claim.

We will next introduce you to several reasoning patterns and their corresponding reasoning fallacies.

                                         Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies | 337
Types of Reasoning Patterns and Related Fallacies

This section will introduce you to five patterns of reasoning: reasoning from example, reasoning from analogy, reasoning
from cause, reasoning from sign, and reasoning from authority. It will also consider how these patterns are sometimes
used ineffectively, resulting in reasoning fallacies.

Reasoning from Example

The first type of evidence we discussed in chapter 26 was examples. The effort to prove a claim through examples,
also understood as inductive reasoning, is called reasoning from example or generalization. That chapter's discussion of
examples as evidence identified several ways to evaluate reasoning from example.

   If an example passes those tests and there are a sufficient number of examples to prove the claim, then you can
      reasonably conclude that you have presented a valid argument (or at least that this portion of your argument is
      valid).

   If, however, the example(s) violates those conditions, it isn't representative of the larger situation, or an insufficient
      number is presented, then a reasoning fallacy has been committed. This reasoning fallacy is known as a hasty gen
      eralization.

          Box 27.1 Reasoning from Example: Sample Arguments
          Consider reasoning from example through these two brief arguments:

                   Example 1: President Donald Trump's inaccurate claim that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine
       could be used to effectively treat COVID-19 proves that all presidents mislead the public.

                   Analysis: Is this example representative? Are there a sufficient number of
       examples to prove the claim that "all presidents mislead the public"? Is there enough
       detail to make this example believable or to prove the president made misleading
       statements? While one can always ask a variety of questions about an argument, this
       singular, brief example is insufficient to prove that all presidents mislead the pub
       lic. This is an example, then, of a hasty generalization.

                   Example 2: President Trump's inaccurate claim that hydroxychloroquine
       could effectively treat COVID-19, President Obama's broken promise that people could maintain their exist-
       ing health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, President George W. Bush's administration's inaccurate
       claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, and President Clinton's denial of a relationship
       with White House intern Monica Lewinsky prove that all recent presidents have misled the country in pub-
       lic statements.

338 | Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies
                   Analysis: While certainly one could challenge the lack of detail in explaining
       the individual situations, overall, this argument is stronger. Rather than presenting only
       one example, four examples are offered, which would seem to be a sufficient number.
       By limiting or qualifying the claim to "recent" presidents instead of making a claim
       about all presidents, this argument is initially of sufficient strength to avoid being con-
       sidered a fallacy.

Reasoning from Analogy

A second common form of argument is to reason from analogy. When using reasoning from analogy, also known as ana
logical reasoning, you attempt to prove a claim by comparing two situations or cases.

          Box 27.2 Reasoning from Analogy: Sample Argument

                                                                                                                     Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies | 339
   In June 2024 when Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, then-surgeon
general of the United States, advanced the claim, "It is time
to require a surgeon general's warning label on social media
platforms, stating that social media is associated with sig-
nificant mental health harms for adolescents," he supported
his argument through analogical reasoning:

   Faced with high levels of car-accident-related
deaths in the mid- to late 20th century, lawmakers
successfully demanded seatbelts, airbags, crash test-
ing and a host of other measures that ultimately made
cars safer. This January the F.A.A. grounded about 170
planes when a door plug came off one Boeing 737 Max
9 while the plane was in the air. And the following
month, a massive recall of dairy products was con-
ducted because of a listeria contamination that
claimed two lives.1

            Analysis: In this statement, Dr.                   Vivek Murthy, Surgeon General by United States
Murthy demonstrates the principle of                           Department of Health and Human Services via
analogical reasoning. He asked readers                         Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.

and, ultimately, Congress to support

issuance of a surgeon general's warning label on social media platforms on the basis

that the harms being caused by social media were analogous to the level of harm that

justified actions and regulations to protect safety in other instances. He reasonably

compared a new situation (regulation of social media) with past situations where regulations were used to

address public problems (seat belts, airline safety, product food safety).

            In testing analogies, speakers and listeners need to examine the similarities and differences between the impli-
cated circumstances. In doing so, you might ask,

   Are the situations reasonably comparable?
   Do the situations possess more similarities than differences?

            If you answer yes to these questions, then you should feel comfortable with the analogy. If, however, you find
that the answer to both is no, then you have discovered a fallacy known as a faulty analogy or faulty comparison.

  340 | Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies
             Box 27.3 Faulty Analogy: Sample Argument
             Consider another example of reasoning from analogy through this brief argument:

                       Just as the United States has reduced smoking rates and related health harms through regulation
          and public health advocacy, it can similarly reduce drug-related harms. Regulation and public health promo-
          tion have worked in Canada and Portugal, so surely it will work in the United States.

                       Analysis: The first sentence provides the claim and the initial inspiration for
          the claim. The second sentence provides the data intended to explain why the policy
          will be successful. What would the warrant be? The United States is similar enough
          to Canada and Portugal that what has worked there will work in the United States
          ("so surely it will work in the United States"). Is this warrant, and hence this analogy,
          valid? If not, this is an example of a faulty analogy.

 Reasoning from Cause

                                    Another popular pattern of reasoning is reasoning from cause. Also known as causal reasoning,
                                    reasoning from cause is used when a speaker claims an event is caused by a particular circum-
                                    stance or action. When a direct link between an action and a consequence is exhibited, then a
                                    causal argument can be very effective.

                                       Box 27.4 Reasoning from Cause: Sample Argument
             An increasing public health issue is the rise of obesity among children and adolescents. Seeing a potential
          association between soft drink consumption and increasing levels of adolescent obesity, some communities
          have raised the cost of sugary drinks. Consider the following causal argument related to this relationship:

                       By placing new taxes on sugary drinks, cities can discourage the purchase of products that con
          tribute to youth obesity. After new 'soda taxes' raised purchasing costs by an average of 33% in Boulder,
          Philadelphia, Oakland, San Francisco, and Seattle, retailers also saw purchases of such drinks decline by
          33%.2

                                                Analysis: This is a cause-effect argument that offers data (related to product
                                    purchases) to support the claim that taxation resulted in a particular effect (reduced
                                    purchases). The argument may need additional development to withstand heavy
                                    scrutiny, but in this form, it appears to draw a reasonable cause-effect relationship.

            In determining whether a causal argument is valid, consider the following criteria:

   Does the fact that the effect has occurred after the cause reasonably signify a relationship between the two
      events?

   Are there important alternative reasons or causes that have been ignored?

When a speaker is guilty of attributing a cause-effect relationship between two items that are not connected, they have
created a faulty cause fallacy. When the faulty attribution of cause occurs only after the fact (e.g., in hindsight), the rea-
soning error is more specifically known as a post hoc fallacy.

          Box 27.5 Post Hoc Fallacy: Sample Argument
                                                                             Consider the following example heard from a discouraged

                                                                          New York Mets fan: "I never watch the Mets on television
                                                                          because they always lose when I do." If we call back to the

                                                                          that the reasoning flaw in this causal argument rests in the
                                                                          implied warrant: "What I do determines whether the Mets

Slippery Slope Fallacy

                                                    Relatedly, speakers sometimes attempt to use causal
                                                 reasoning to argue that a single event or action will lead to
                                                 a chain reaction of cause-and-effect events, typically end-
                                                 ing with a catastrophic outcome. To effectively make such
                                                 an argument, the speaker would need a significant
                                                 amount of evidence to support the idea that one cause-
                                                 and-effect sequence will lead to another, then to another,
                                                 and to another. When speakers advance such arguments
                                                 without providing necessary support, they commit a fal-
                                                 lacy known as a slippery slope. They suggest that if a first
                                                 step is taken, then we will slide all the way down the slope
                                                 to the very bottom.

                                                 Box 27.6 Slippery Slope Fallacy: Sample Argu

ment

   In more closely considering how a slippery slope fallacy operates, consider this brief argument about the
expanded use of artificial intelligence in the workplace:

            If we start relying on AI to perform basic tasks, next we will use it for more complex jobs. Quickly,
we will be unable to do the work ourselves, and AI will replace almost all human workers, leading to mass
unemployment and poverty.

            Analysis: This argument advocates we not make any use of AI because if we
do, we will slide down a slope toward employee obsolescence and economic chaos.
What is provided, however, are only asserted assumptions about what a basic use of
AI might lead to--total reliance and mass elimination of jobs. Although that outcome
is possible in a dystopian future, nothing is provided to suggest that it is likely or
imminent, hence it reflects the fallacy of a slippery slope.

Reasoning from Sign

Reasoning from sign relies on circumstantial evidence, or signs, to demonstrate a claim.
                                                                                                                      Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies | 343
               For instance, a driver might notice a dashboard warning light indicator and say, "There must be something
   wrong with my car. The check engine light is on." They have made a sign argument:

      Their claim ("There must be something wrong with my car") is based on

      sign data ("The check engine light is on").
      The implied warrant to the argument is that "vehicle warning lights signal a possible problem." The warning light

         indicates to the driver that the car should be checked by a mechanic.
   Note, however, that the engine light is not the cause of the problem, nor is it the problem itself; it is only a sign, or indi-
   cator, of it.

               It is important to note, however, that it is possible to commit the mistake of misreading a sign. This happens
   when one assumes that a certain sign is a reliable indicator of something else when it is not.

             Box 27.7 Misreading Signs: Sample Argument
                                                            In the wake of the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, there was a

                                                         national debate over the meaning of his clothing--a hoodie--and if it could
                                                         be reasonably interpreted by George Zimmerman, who killed Martin, as a
                                                         sign of Martin being a threat or a gang member. The hoodie became a

   https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/03/17/trayvon-hoodie-in-smithsonian/. Others debated if the sign
   caused George Zimmerman's actions, transforming the sign into evidence in a causal argument. For instance, Geraldo
   Rivera stated on Fox News, "I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin's death as George Zimmer
   man was." Further, in an interview, then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly said, "The reason Trayvon Martin died was because
   he looked a certain way and it wasn't based on skin color. If Trayvon Martin had been wearing a jacket...and a tie...I
   don't think George Zimmerman would have any problem. But he was wearing a hood and he looked a certain way. And
   that way is how `gangstas' look." Erik Wemple, "Fox News's Bill O'Reilly Blames Trayvon Martin's Death on Hoodie,"
   344 | Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies
                   Analysis: Making faulty associations between circumstances (Martin's
       sweatshirt) and an outcome (Zimmerman's assumption of Martin's intent to harm
       him) is what we mean by "misreading signs."

            Thus, in considering a sign argument, you should scrutinize the connection being
made between the claim and the data.

   If the sign evidence is an accurate referent or indicator and/or if you can expect that the events reasonably occur
      together (but one does not cause the other), then you have a valid basis for a sign argument.

   If the sign is an unreliable indicator or referent and/or if you cannot reasonably associate events to occur together,
      then you are in danger of misreading a sign.

Reasoning from Authority

                            A final reasoning pattern is reasoning from authority. Reasoning from authority occurs when a
                            speaker supports a claim with the testimony or credibility of a qualified source. The use of authority
                            is common in argumentation.

                        Box 27.8 Appeal to Authority: Sample Argument

   In a June 2024 essay in The Wall Street Journal, Gerald F. Seib argued the
perils of mounting debt to the continued prosperity of the "American
Empire." Seib based his argument on the authority of scholars who had
studied the impact of debt on past civilizations:

 He quoted historian Niall Ferguson on lessons offered by Habsburg            [Gerald Seib] by Center for
   Spain, France, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire.                  Strategic and International

 He drew on the analysis of J. H. Cullum Clark, director of the George
   W. Bush Institute-Southern Methodist University Economic Growth
   Initiative, in his study of the spending of the Roman Empire.

 He recounted the lessons of Yale historian Paul Kennedy's well-
   known The Rise and Fall of Great Powers.

                    Analysis: In each case, Seib used the subject authority of public intellectuals
        as support for his argument on the threat posed by growing debt.4

                    In the last chapter's discussions of testimony, we considered several ways to evaluate
        reasoning from authority. The use of authority must pass those tests for the argument to be

valid:

 The source is a qualified authority due to their subject expertise, societal position, or special circumstances.
 The source has firsthand knowledge of the issue without undue bias.
 The source's assumptions match your own.

            When a source of authority does not pass these tests, then basing a conclusion on evidence from that source
can produce an appeal to authority fallacy.

        Box 27.9 Appeal to Authority Fallacy: Sample Argument

           When Dr. Robert Jarvik promoted the popular cholesterol drug
        Lipitor in a national television campaign, parent company Pfizer and
        Dr. Jarvik were questioned over the use of Jarvik's authority. In the
        commercial, Jarvik is accurately credited as the inventor of the artifi-
        cial heart and is ostensibly shown rowing across a body of water.
        Jarvik goes on to speak about the wonder of the heart and the risks
        associated with excess cholesterol while verbally and visually offering
        an argument from authority:

           Claim: "When diet and exercise aren't enough, adding Lipi-
        tor significantly lowers cholesterol."

           Data: Jarvik's endorsement of the drug, and his performance
        of the physical activity of rowing.

   346 | Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies
                       Analysis: The argument would seem to be a reasonable one at the surface--a
          nationally renowned doctor who has studied the heart endorses a drug as improving
          health. However, Dr. Jarvik is a medical researcher rather than a cardiologist, and he
          is not licensed to practice medicine or prescribe medication. Furthermore, it turns
          out Jarvik doesn't row, and the commercial featured a body double to simulate his
          physical activity. On the whole, the commercial reflects an appeal to authority fallacy
          for how it used Jarvik, something that eventually caught the attention of Congress
          and resulted in Pfizer ending the campaign.5

               A sharp understanding of reasoning patterns can help you participate more effectively in the civic realm. Using
   a variety of reasoning patterns can enhance your ability to convince an audience to accept your thesis.

      For example, suppose you discover that your entire speech is based on sign argument. That means you have relied
         extensively on circumstantial evidence, and it is likely there is a lot of statistical data throughout the speech.

      It might be helpful to balance the speech by including reasoning from authority through the use of testimony--to
         add a human dimension and gain source credibility--as well as an example or two to which an audience can relate
         (reasoning from example or reasoning from analogy).

   Such balancing creates stronger arguments by broadening the speech's overall appeal to your community.

Reasoning from cause: In this pattern, a speaker claims an
event is caused by a particular circumstance or action.

                                                                Slippery slope: This fallacy occurs when a speaker seeks to use

Additional Common Fallacies

   Although you can find many more examples of fallacy types in argumentation and logic courses,
we limit our further consideration of the topic to five additional common fallacies: appeal to pop-
ularity, appeal to common practice, begging the question, ad hominem attack, and false dilemma.6

6. Scholar Douglas Walton, in particular, is known for his work on argument fallacies. His books on the subject include Ad
   Hominem Arguments (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998); Argument from Ignorance (University Park: Penn
   sylvania State University Press, 1995); Slippery Slope Arguments (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992); and Begging the Ques
   tion: Circular Reasoning as a Tactic in Argumentation (New York: Greenwood Press, 1991).

   348 | Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies
Appeal to Popularity

Do you remember your parent asking, "If everyone else jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?"
This was their way of introducing you to the appeal to popularity fallacy, even if they didn't identify
it as such. The basic idea is that popularity alone doesn't make for a good argument.

            Example: The success of Barbie as the top-grossing movie of 2023 proves that it was the best
film from that year.

            Analysis: The only basis this argument offers for being "best" is popularity. That might be one
relevant piece of data. Basing the claim only on popularity, however, commits a fallacy, because it equates popularity
with being the best.

Appeal to Common Practice

                            This fallacy is also called an "is/ought" fallacy because the speaker suggests that just because some-
                            thing is a certain way, it ought to be that way. Whereas an appeal to popularity relies on people's
                            positive feelings about, or approval of, a statement or activity, an appeal to common practice relies
                            on the commonality or tradition of the belief or activity as justification for its validity.

                                         Example: I know many professors look down on using ChatGPT to help write essays, but
                            most students use it, so it must be OK.

                                         Analysis: The only justification offered for the action (use of ChatGPT) is its asserted status
as a common habit of students. However, as explored in chapter 5's discussion of ethics, original work and the ability to
understand the principles of speechmaking are important expectations for learning and operating professionally.

Begging the Question

When begging the question, the speaker fails to provide evidence for their claim and, instead, restates the claim in place
of additional data. This fallacy is also known as circular reasoning.

            Example: Reading is fundamental to a good education because an educated person needs to be able to read.
            Analysis: In this example the claim (reading is fundamental to a good education) and data (an educated person
needs to be able to read) are nearly identical, with no offer of proof or independent support beyond a slight restatement
of the claim.

                                                                                                                      Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies | 349
Ad Hominem Attack

                              An ad hominem fallacy occurs when the person, rather than the argument, is attacked. Certainly,
                              on occasion, character is an issue in an argument, and in those cases questioning a person's char-
                              acter is not a basis for deeming an argument fallacious. However, when the substance of a dis-
                              agreement is ignored in favor of a blatant attack, an ad hominem fallacy has been committed.

False Dilemma

You have probably heard a variation of the phrase "You're either with us or against us." This familiar ultimatum, like all
false dilemmas, eliminates alternative options by suggesting there are only two conclusions available when additional
possibilities exist. It is possible to side "with us" but be "against" particular ideas or tactics.

            Example: We must either ban all cars immediately to stop pollution or accept that the planet will be destroyed
by climate change.

            Analysis: The statement suggests only two possible outcomes--banning cars or planetary destruction--while
ignoring other potential solutions related to electric vehicles, emissions regulations, promoting public transportation,
or taking other actions that would protect the environment.

          Box 27.12 Additional Common Reasoning Fallacies
             Appeal to popularity: occurs when the validity of the claim is based on its popularity alone without

                any more specific offering of proof
             Appeal to common practice: occurs when the validity of the claim is based on the commonality or

                tradition of a belief or activity without any more specific offering of justification
             Begging the question: occurs when the data is little more than a restatement of the claim with no

                additional offer of independent proof
             Ad hominem attack: occurs when the person making the argument, rather than the substance of

                the argument itself, is attacked and character is not relevant to the validity of the argument
             False dilemma: occurs when it is suggested that there are only two conclusions available when, in

                reality, other possibilities or options exist

            Understanding reasoning fallacies will make you a more skilled student of argument and a more effective par-
ticipant in public discussions. If you can identify faulty reasoning, you should also be able to avoid it. Likewise, you can
identify and explain reasoning flaws in other speakers' messages about public issues.

     Summary

        The ability to produce multifaceted arguments that call on diverse reasoning types is a vital skill for public
     speaking and civic participation. In this chapter you have learned a range of reasoning patterns that will
     improve your ability to make valid arguments and to critically analyze public discourse presented by others.

          In inductive reasoning, a series of examples or instances are used to support the likelihood or probabil-
             ity of a generalized conclusion.

          A pattern of reasoning reflects what kind of data or evidence is used in an argument and how that data
             or evidence is used to prove a claim. Prominent patterns of reasoning are reasoning from example, rea-
             soning from analogy, reasoning from cause, reasoning from sign, and reasoning from authority. Effective
             speeches use a variety of reasoning patterns in urging acceptance of the thesis.

          A reasoning fallacy is a flaw or defect in reasoning that undermines the validity of an argument. There
             are many different reasoning fallacies, some of which are associated with the faulty use of particular rea-
             soning patterns. Among the most common reasoning, fallacies are hasty generalization, faulty analogy,
             faulty cause or post hoc fallacy, slippery slope, appeal to authority, appeal to popularity, appeal to com-
             mon practice, begging the question, ad hominem attack, and false dilemma.

Discussion Questions
    1. Test your ability to identify reasoning patterns and reasoning fallacies by analyzing an editorial from
        The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times. Remember that to do so, it is first necessary to identify
        the thesis, the subclaims, the data, and the warrants in the discourse. Second, identify what types of data
        (i.e., examples, statistics, testimony) are used and what types of reasoning patterns are employed. Third,
        assess the reasoning for potential fallacies. Finally, based on your analysis, create an overall assessment of
        the editorial--is it a good argument?
   2. As you watch television or read a magazine, think about the appeals made in the advertisements. Are
        the advertisements arguments? Do some of them present a claim and data? Do they employ fallacies?

                                                                                                                Identifying Reasoning Patterns and Fallacies | 353
28. Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:

          Name the goals of using visual aids in public speaking.
          Distinguish the advantages and challenges of three types of digital visual aids.
          Identify how visual aids can promote or hamper civic engagement.

Reflect on the last YouTube or TikTok video you watched, the last meme you viewed on social media, or even a lecture
you heard that used presentation software like PowerPoint. Now try to think of a public speech you heard that did not
include any visual aids--no photographs or video clips, no infographics or charts, no virtual backgrounds, and no words
or symbols visually imposed onto a screen. It's hard to do, right? Imagining public speaking today without visual aids is
increasingly difficult.

                                       We define a visual aid as anything optical that enhances speech or even functions as speech.
                           This definition can encompass aspects of nonverbal delivery (think of a speaker's clothing choices,
                           for instance) and televisual delivery (such as a speaker's use of lighting or camera angles), both of
                           which we explored in chapter 18. In this chapter, we will focus on additional types and uses of visual
                           aids, primarily spotlighting such digital options as presentation software, video, and audience-inter-
                           active visual aids.
            In many cases, visual aids enhance speech by supplementing or illustrating what is being said. Think, for exam-
ple, about how a line graph might visually illustrate a speaker's claims about changes in college tuition rates over the
past four decades.
            Visual aids can also function as speech them-
selves, however. To demonstrate, reflect on why so many
US political candidates feature the American flag in their
advertisements. They hope to associate themselves with
what the flag can communicate: liberty, justice, and patri-
otism. Indeed, in our multimedia-saturated culture, audi-
ences are inundated with visual images that attempt to
shape their perceptions and actions. In that sense, such
images "aid" speakers by communicating with and for
them rather than simply by enhancing speakers' words.
            In this chapter, we introduce you to visual aids
for public speaking. We first establish the desired goals of
using visual aids. We then review three of the most com- Image by waggtime via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.
mon types of digital visual aids: presentation software,
video, and audience-interactive visual aids. The chapter ends by considering how visual aids can promote or hinder civic
engagement.

354 | Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement
            With this guidance, you will be ready to choose the types of visual aids you want to use and establish goals for
doing so. The next chapter will help you effectively design the visual aids and use them during your speech.

Goals of Using Visual Aids

You may find it easier to create visual aids for your speech if you first identify what you hope to accomplish with them.
We suggest you consider at least four goals for your direct audience (or those who are exposed to and attend to your
speech): increase the clarity of your message, enhance audience attention and recall, strengthen your credibility, and
improve your attempt to inform or persuade the audience.

Increase Clarity

Visual aids have the power to make your ideas clearer to your audience. Many audience members

are visual learners, and well-designed visual aids help them comprehend what you are saying.

Infographics, for instance, are named as such because they clearly communicate (often numeri-

cal) information through visual means.

                                                                   Similarly, a visual aid can

                                                                   help your audience comprehend

                                                                   an abstract concept or complex

                                                                   event. Indeed, some photographs have become iconic

                                                                   because they clearly sum up a complex historical

                                                                   moment. Examples include photographs of the bombing

                                                                   of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, or a

                                                                   photograph of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon.

                                                                   Beyond that, it is likely in our increasingly glob-

                                                                   alized world that members of your audience may have dif-

                                                                   ferent levels of fluency with the language you speak.

                                                                   Furthermore, depending on the content and your profes-

                                                                   sional specialty, audience members will have different

                                                                   can help define terms and clarify concepts and ideas.

Improve Audience Attention and Recall

Visual aids can also help hold or increase your audience's attention. If members of the audience find their minds wan-
dering--or if one or two listeners glance at an incoming text message--the introduction of a new image or the change of
a slide can draw their attention back to your speech. Well-planned and well-designed images make your speech more
interesting. When someone later asks an audience member what your speech was about, a person might recall a visual
image from your presentation. The image assists the audience in remembering your message after the fact.

                                                                   Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement | 355
Strengthen Your Credibility as a Speaker

Also importantly, effective visual aids can increase your credibility as a speaker. They illustrate to your audience how
carefully you researched, crafted, and incorporated visual aids into your speech. Proper citations of images or charts you
adopt further enhance your credibility. Remember, however, that the inverse is also true: A hastily prepared or poorly
cited visual presentation can undercut an otherwise well-prepared speech.

            Additionally, good visual aids foreground your ideas. An effective visual aid increases your credibility precisely
because it helps your audience grasp what you want to communicate. "That person was a great communicator!" some-
one might say when recalling your speech. "Their points were very clear."

Improve Your Effort to Inform or Persuade

Ultimately, visual aids should serve your speaking goal, whether that is to inform your audience or to persuade them.
Think of your visual aids as another form of support for your thesis or main points. When integrated smoothly into a
speech, visual aids can strengthen your explanations and evidence. However, poorly designed or executed visual aids
can distract or confuse an audience, hurting your ability to inform or persuade them.

            In addition, recall that visual aids not only enhance communication
but also can function as speech themselves. Earlier we mentioned the Ameri-
can flag as an example. We might also think of such resonant visual symbols as
a dove or peace sign, a rainbow, or even a skull and bones. In such cases, the
visual images can aid your attempt to inform or persuade by communicating
meaning or even emotions.

            You might draw on these four goals to guide your creation of visual
aids and to evaluate whether and how well they function after you've designed
them. Use your evaluation to revise or even cut visual aids from your speech
when they do not serve clear ends.

Types of Visual Aids

There are several analog (nondigital) visual aids available for public speaking, such as handouts, props, or charts. In
today's world of omnipresent technology, however, most people use digital visual aids, particularly presentation soft-
356 | Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement
ware, video, and audience-interactive visual aids. In this section, we will consider each of these digital visual aids, focus-
ing on their advantages and challenges for speakers. Use these insights to determine which type(s) best serve your
needs.

Presentation Software

You are likely already familiar with presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Canva Pre
sentations. Such programs are designed as digital slide shows, and thus, presenters tend to
refer to their digital visual aids as "my slides." A slide deck is your set of digital visual aids, no
matter which software brand you use. Presentation software offers many advantages to
speakers.

Advantages

Presentation software is popular for a reason. It is incredibly versatile. Using this software, you can typically
   import images,
   create graphs,
   embed audio and video content into your slides, and
   give your slides a uniform design for a more coherent and polished appearance.

Indeed, presentation software allows you tremendous control over the following:
   The look of your slides, including the placement of each item.
   The timing of each slide. As a speaker, you choose when to show each slide and for how long simply by choosing
      the slides' order and deciding when to "click through" to the next slide.
   When an audience no longer sees any slides. If you want a blank screen during part of your speech, simply include
      a blank slide to achieve that effect.
            Learning how to design and use slides effectively takes some work. Fortunately, tutorials and advice are freely

available online. You can find video tutorials for all the presentation software previously mentioned--Microsoft Power-
Point, Google Slides, and Canva Presentations--by searching in a web browser for its name and adding the word "tuto-
rial." Similarly, searching for "presentation software dos and don'ts" results in several websites, blogs, and videos with
helpful advice.

                                                                                                                        Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement | 357
Challenges

                                                  While advice is readily available about using presentation

                                                  software well, so, too, are endless jokes and cartoons about

                                                  misusing slide decks. Many jokes poke fun at lulling the audience

                                                  to sleep by overly relying on presentation software.

                                                  Most of us dread a speaker who loads their slide deck

                                                  for a short speech and has forty slides lined up. Not everything

                                                  you say needs to have a corresponding slide!

                                                  Remember you are giving the speech and should be

                                                  able to communicate vocally without always relying on visual

                                                  aids for help. Use slides only when they fulfill the four goals pre-

                                                  viously mentioned. Otherwise, too many slides will obscure

                                                  rather than clarify your points, overwhelm your audience rather

Image by Oliver Tacke via Flickr, Public Domain.  than aid their attention and recall, weaken rather than
                                                  strengthen your credibility, and hurt rather than aid your effort

                                                  to inform or persuade.

A related challenge of presentation software is that it tends to lure speakers into featuring too much text

(words), often in an outline or bulleted lists. Speakers may even be tempted to use their slides as speaking notes. Stop

yourself from falling into this trap!

 Utilize the techniques discussed in chapter 14 to vocally (not visually) communicate your thesis, main points, and
   transitions.

 Turn to chapter 19 to prepare and use a presentation outline or manuscript--not your slides--as your speaking
   notes, depending on your selected mode of delivery.

 Rely on your slides, instead, to feature optical elements you cannot achieve through words alone. You might
   include a photograph that clarifies your point, a visual symbol that aids your persuasion, a short video clip that
   helps the audience recall your thesis, or a correctly cited graph that increases your credibility.

            As you find or create visual elements for your slides, avoid using the first photograph, chart, or infographic you
find. Too often students think they should wholesale copy and paste a visual aid they locate online, perhaps because it
relates to their topic and looks attractive. However, not only should you be wary of copyright infringement--something
we turn to in the next chapter--but you should also evaluate how well the visual element suits your needs.

            When you find an image you like, ask yourself if it supports your specific speaking goal, thesis, or point. If a
visual aid features more than what you really need, consider changing it. You might do the following:

 Adapt the preexisting visual aid (such as cropping a photograph you find).
 Re-create the parts you need (such as reproducing a bar chart with only the bars you want the audience to focus

   on--like we demonstrate in box 28.2).
 Use the preexisting visual aid to inspire your own visual production. Can you take a photograph that will better

   feature what you want the audience to see or notice locally? Can you create an infographic that visually demon-
   strates the main statistic you want to emphasize?

   Box 28.2 "Ready-Made" Versus Customized Visual Aids
   Imagine a student's speech is about teenage alcohol consumption, and they want a slide that conveys rel-
evant statistics.

            Slide A: The following chart is a "ready-made" image the student might find online. It includes
information about teenage alcohol use (the blue and gray bars) but much more irrelevant information (for
their topic) as well. Audiences would struggle to focus only on the teenage consumption visualized in the
chart.

                                                                                           Slide B: In this slide, the student made
                                                                               their own customized version of the chart in slide
                                                                               A. Notice how much more effectively it focuses the

                                                        We offer several more design and usage princi-
                                            ples in chapter 29 that apply to presentation software. For
                                            now, we end with a caution about using features like tran-
                                            sitions and animations. These have the tendency to look
                                            more amateur than professional. They also typically dis-
                                            tract and confuse the audience instead of clarifying
                                            points. We believe visual aids are most effective when
                                            they are elegantly simple.

Public speakers today frequently draw on video, or a recording of moving images, to visually
aid their presentations. Some incorporate short video clips or animated GIFs into their
speeches. Others record themselves speaking and edit the video to visually enliven their pre-
sentation, such as by creating split screens or showcasing picture-in-picture. Still others
stitch together visual images and video clips while narrating their speech through voice-over.
Of course, these three uses of video are not mutually exclusive! Consider some of the more
sophisticated YouTube channels you watch; you likely see all three in one presentation.

                                                 If you want to use video as a visual aid, several software

brands are available to help you record and edit videos. A few notable examples are iMovie, Adobe Premiere (Pro and

Rush), Microsoft Clipchamp, ScreenPal, and Screencastify. Some are completely free, while others are premium, mean-

ing they cost money to use. Still others, referred to as freemium, allow users to freely use a few basic features but

require payment to access more sophisticated or advanced tools. Check your college or university resources to learn if

they provide students free access to software that would otherwise cost money to use. Choosing video as a visual aid,

whether by using your phone or specialized software, offers speakers several advantages and challenges.

Advantages

Video can be an engaging and powerful visual aid. A video clip reignites the audience's interest because it introduces
something new to listen to and watch. Somewhat similarly, an animated GIF can offer humor and draw in your audience
through a popular culture reference.

            Video can also function as powerful support for your speech. Using video, you can

   literally show your audience examples of the problem, place, or people you are describing;
   showcase a person offering emotionally moving testimony about their personal experience; or
   feature an expert explaining a concept or finding, which should strengthen your argument and credibility.

            Perhaps one of the greatest advantages of using video, however, is the creativity it offers, especially if you pre-
record your presentation. Even if you simply record yourself speaking, you can do so in ways that are visually clever or
inventive.

   Recall in chapter 18, when explaining televisual delivery, we mentioned you might record yourself in
strategic settings or backgrounds--virtual or real--to accentuate your points.

360 | Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement
            If you want to incorporate more traditional visual aids into a prerecorded speech, you might leave space in the
camera frame while recording to later edit in photographs, charts, or graphs. As we demonstrate in box 28.4, you might
even gesture to that open space as you talk about the visual aid in the recording (a little like using a green screen).

          Box 28.4 Leaving Room in a Video Frame for a Visual Aid
          The top image exemplifies a still shot from a prerecorded speech about texting while driving. Notice how
       the student purposefully left room in the shot and gestured toward the contrasting visual aids that he later
       edited into the shot, which you can see in the bottom image.

            If you are more creatively ambitious, use video software to layer tracks, such as
                                                                                                                        Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement | 361
   a video track focused on you speaking,
   a track of your audio alone (likely extracted from your

      video track with the software's help),
   a track of relevant audio clips you import, and
   a track of alternative visual aids you produce.

You can edit the video strategically to choose which tracks
viewers see and hear as the video plays.

            Alternatively, you might animate your video by
drawing pictures that visually illustrate or bring your ideas
to life while narrating your points through an audio record- Pitivi Video Editor by Linux Screenshots via Flickr, CC BY.
ing. Whatever forms of video you choose, the options for
creating visual aids are almost as broad as your creativity and imagination allow.

            If you prerecord your presentation, another advantage of using video for your visual aid is the ability to review
and redo it. You can adjust the placement of your images or the timing of your animations, for instance, for maximum
impact. If you give yourself enough time, you can ensure that your visual aids appear sleek and professional, increasing
your credibility.

Challenges

Time is a major challenge when using video for your visual aid:

   At a minimum, a speaker who shows a video clip during their presentation must first produce or find the clip and
      then leave time during their speech to introduce, show, and draw conclusions from it.

   At a maximum, a speaker who prerecords their speech must set up their shots, audio clips, and other images;
      record themselves; layer their tracks; edit the video; finalize the video when satisfied; and upload it to the internet
      or download it as a file before it's ready to be viewed. Students are often shocked at how long that process
      takes--much longer than they anticipate.

   Furthermore, impactful speakers practice or review their presentation and adjust their video visual aid if needed.
      That could entail altering when you begin or end a video clip or even rerecording and reediting your presentation.

            Another challenge when using video as a visual aid is the temptation to use clips, animations, or backgrounds
that are attention getting but do not actually serve your speech. Too often students throw in a funny or fast-moving video
or GIF that elicits an initial reaction from the audience but ultimately leaves them (or your instructor) confused and dis-
tracted. Your visual aids should directly support your thesis or main points, not just relate loosely to your topic.

            Finally, using video well can be difficult. It requires extra setup when speaking synchronously (live). You have to
make sure the clip is accessible and ready to play and/or able to be seen and heard accurately (especially when sharing
your screen while speaking remotely).

            When prerecording your presentation, it is especially difficult to create a video that is professional looking.

362 | Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement
Social media influencers and celebrities make it seem easy, because they typically employ people who work behind the
scenes to produce their final products. Fortunately, you can improve the look of your videos by learning from free tuto-
rials online, which are available from most software brands and vloggers that teach the basics.

            If you put in the time to learn the software, practice with it, and revise your work, you will likely produce video
visual aids that make your speech compelling.

Audience-Interactive Visual Aids

                                                             We are referring to a third kind of digital visual aid as audi
                                                          ence-interactive because they rely on the audience's input in
                                                          real time to produce imagery. They can be used when speaking
                                                          in person or remotely through a screen, but they require an
                                                          audience who is watching synchronously.

                                                                      As examples of audience-interactive visual aids, a
                                                          speaker might

                                                           poll the audience and then visually display the results,
                                                           ask and then show the audience's answers to a question, or
                                                           display a word cloud that results from descriptive words the

   Alternatively, a speaker might invite audience members
watching remotely to provide real-time reactions that the
speaker shows and incorporates into their speech. For
instance,

 A speaker might invite audience members to send a

chat that is visually overlaid into the video "live" as

the speaker streams their speech.

 If using video conference software like Zoom, a

speaker might ask the audience to

                                                 look to Twitch, a global streaming service that offers over
                                                 100,000 live broadcasts at any one time in over thirty lan-
                                                 guages. While Twitch is typically associated with video
                                                 games, some Twitch streamers provide commentary on
                                                 civic issues.

                                                             Streamers such as Hasan Piker (who goes by
                                                 HasanAbi) and Morgan (who goes by Frogan) use their pop-
                                                 ularity to engage political affairs and public health concerns
                                                 (respectively). Their broadcasts typically incorporate visual
                                                 displays of viewers' live chats, including negative and criti-
                                                 cal comments, many of which they respond to immediately.

                                                             This audience-interactive visual aid helps make the
                                                 experience more meaningful for viewers because their
                                                 comments directly influence what the speaker says as their
                                                 speech unfolds. Such influence helps them feel more con-
                                                 nected to the speaker and lends a greater sense of authen-
                                                 ticity to their exchange.

            As discussed in box 28.5, Twitch lends itself to audience-interactive visual aids, but so do many other tools.
Examples that may be used whether you speak in person or remotely include Mentimeter, Socrative, and PollEv
erywhere. As with video, software for audience-interactive visual aids ranges from premium (payment required) to
freemium (payment necessary to use advanced tools) to free. Check with your university or college to discover what
software it might give you access to for free. Using audience-interactive visual aids offers many advantages.

Advantages

Speakers who use audience-interactive visual aids recognize the audience's active role in cocreating meaning. Recall that
in chapter 10, we discussed the audience's central role in negotiating meaning with a rhetor. Using audience-interactive
visual aids is one way of honoring the audience's centrality to public speaking and acknowledging the important part
they play in coproducing communication. Audiences typically appreciate such recognition and empowerment.

            By allowing the audience to have such direct input, audience-interactive visual aids additionally provide speak-
ers with useful insights.

   On the one hand, you can learn from your audience. Their ideas and views can develop your own understanding of,
      and thinking about, your topic or thesis. You might be surprised, for instance, at the words they choose for a word
      cloud or by their answers to a poll.

   On the other hand, you can learn about your audience and better adapt your speech to them. Their responses can
      help you make on-the-fly adjustments to how you find common ground with them or the supporting appeals you
      feature.

   Relatedly, your audience members can learn more about one another, which may clarify their understanding of

364 | Choosing Visual Aids for Civic Engagement
      their community and how the issue affects them.

            Finally, audience-interactive visual aids are simply fun. They tend to enliven a group as audience members
switch from primarily listening to the speech to "talking back." It's enjoyable to discover how everyone responded and
to watch the speaker react to the feedback. When handled well--that is, when a speaker takes the time to process the
audience's feedback in the visual aid and alter their speech accordingly--their credibility is strengthened.

Challenges

The advantages named already hint at the challenges with audience-interactive visual aids. First, they require time dur-
ing a presentation to execute and process. Novice speakers typically underestimate the amount of time it takes to
explain what you want the audience to do, have them do it, and then read and respond to the resulting visual aid.

            Consequently, if you need to deliver a short speech with a strict time requirement, as is often the case for class
assignments, we discourage the use of audience-interactive visual aids. You will likely spend too long on the visual aid,
preventing you from meeting other core requirements for the assignment.

            If you deliver a longer presentation with sufficient time, then we strongly recommend practicing the speech
with the audience-interactive visual aid. Ask several family members or friends to listen to your speech and participate
in the visual aid. That should give you a more realistic sense of the time you will need.

            Second, effectively using audience-interactive visual aids requires speakers to talk impromptu in response to
the audience's input. Their feedback may result in a visual aid that looks very different from what you expected or prac-
ticed. As we mentioned, that surprise can be beneficial, but it can also be challenging, as you must respond and adjust
in the moment. Box 28.6 explores an example.

          Box 28.6 Incorporating a Word Cloud into Your Speech
          Imagine giving a speech on performance-enhancing drugs and asking your audience for three words that
       come to their minds. If their input resulted in the following word cloud, what might you point out about the
       visual aid? How might you use their input to argue a position?

                                                                                                   Finally, as with presentation software and video,
                                                                                      avoid the temptation to overuse audience-interactive

                                                                                      and audience emoji reactions just because you can. Use

                                                                                      achieve your communication goal.

Visual Aids and Civic Engagement

This chapter began with the claim that visual aids enhance communication and even function as communication them-
selves. Consequently, we must tackle questions of the ethical and unethical use of visual aids. Like any rhetorical act,
visual aids can be used to clarify and inform, or they can be used to obscure and mislead. As you produce visual aids for
your presentation, then, it is important to use them in ways that promote productive discourse and civic engagement.

            In chapter 3, we outlined nine qualities of productive discourse that enhance and promote civic engagement.
Three qualities are particularly important to keep in mind as you select visual aids: learning, lateral communication, and
imagination.

   Learning: As you select images, choose ones that help your audience learn about the issue at hand rather than
      merely entertain. As a speaker, one of your goals is to encourage your audience to participate in public issues, and
      you can do this by using visual means to strengthen their grasp of the topic and its relevance to their lives.

   To prompt lateral communication--that is, multidirectional communication among members of the public--design
      and select visual aids that distill information or do not require highly technical knowledge to discern. That way
      audience members with different levels of knowledge or background can converse with one another on a more
      level playing field. Select visual aids that help clarify issues. Avoid images that are more likely to exclude or con-
      fuse.

   Imagination: Notice that the word "imagination" is related to the word "image." Your visual aids should do more
      than present the facts to the audience; they should help audiences see the issue and creative ways forward. Pro-
      ductive discourse helps audiences visualize new possibilities or imaginative solutions; it prompts them to build a
      new vision for understanding one another and addressing controversies. When you use visual aids, design and
      select images and videos that help the audience imagine the public issue or themselves in a different way.

            Chapter 2 outlined the qualities of unproductive discourse that impede civic engagement. Visual aids can pro-
mote the unproductive qualities of division, combativeness, and certainty when they oversimplify complex issues.

   Division: Visual aids that highlight the main points of a complex issue can inadvertently suggest the issue is sim-
      pler than it really is. A list of bullet points, a singular image, or an animated GIF, for instance, can make conclusions
      appear obvious. Such oversimplification can imply that alternative points of view are ill-informed or silly and thus
      promote division. Audiences are encouraged to distance themselves from--rather than better understand--people
      with different interpretations.

   Combativeness: Unethical speakers can use visual aids to overly simplify and belittle their detractors' positions.
      Such intentional oversimplifications are themselves a form of combativeness, as they unfairly represent and impact
      the implied and implicated audiences (as discussed in chapter 10). Their use can further promote combativeness
      with people who argue for alternatives or offer more nuanced analyses.

   Certainty: Images that present data as decisive, when conflicting data or alternative plausible interpretations exist,
      can leave the audience with a false sense of certainty. The oversimplification in this case can lead the audience to
      feel assured that there are simple solutions to problems they have not fully thought through.

            As a presenter, you have an ethical obligation to construct visual aids that promote civic engagement by offering
clarity and enabling lateral communication and imagination. You should opt for visual aids that treat topics, evidence,
and alternative points of view fairly. Avoid oversimplifying them and inadvertently promoting such hallmarks of unpro-
ductive discourse as division, combativeness, and certainty.

Summary

   Visual aids offer many advantages to speakers when they are well designed and effectively incorporated into
a speech. However, when poorly crafted or mishandled, visual aids can do more harm than good.

     Visual aids enhance communication, and they can function as communication when they influence and
        persuade audiences.

     Speakers should use visual aids to clarify their ideas, improve the audience's attention and recall,
        strengthen credibility as a speaker, and improve the effort to inform or persuade.

     Three types of digital visual aids are presentation software, video, and audience-interactive visual aids.
     All three types of digital visual aids offer many advantages to speakers but also bring several challenges

        that must be overcome. Presentation software is versatile and offers users significant control over design
        and timing, but speakers can rely too heavily on slides and overly fill slides with text. Video can be a very
        engaging, powerful, and creative visual aid, but it is time-consuming to use well, and speakers can be
        tempted to include attention-getting, but irrelevant, clips and GIFs. Finally, audience-interactive visual
        aids offer fun ways to acknowledge the audience's active role in public communication and to learn from
        and about your audience; however, they use valuable speaking time, and speakers must be prepared to
        respond to audience input in the moment.
     Because of the communicative power of visual aids, it is important that speakers use them ethically, in
        ways that promote civic engagement. Visual aids that clarify issues, promote lateral communication, and
        prompt imagination can promote civic engagement. In contrast, visual aids that oversimplify complex
        issues can promote division, combativeness, and certainty, which discourage civic engagement.

29. Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an
Audience

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Construct visual aids that fulfill eight design principles.
          Use visual aids effectively during a speech by following five usage principles.

The previous chapter introduced you to three types of visual digital aids: presentation software, video, and audience-
interactive visual aids. Understanding the strengths and drawbacks of each is helpful. However, knowing how to design
and use them effectively is essential.

            This chapter gives you specific advice--dos and don'ts--for designing and using visual aids. Much of what fol-
lows applies to any of the three types of visual aids, and we will highlight how as we go. We begin with designing or
preparing visual aids. We then turn to using or incorporating visual aids into a presentation.

Design Principles

In the previous chapter, we established four goals for visual aids: increase the clarity of your message, enhance audience
attention and recall, strengthen your credibility, and improve your effort to inform or persuade the audience.

            How do you produce visual aids that help accomplish these goals? We offer eight design principles--or advice to
follow--to guide your preparation: visual aids should be visual, less is more, consider spacing and positioning, use color
strategically, consider what your visual choices suggest, consider readability for all audience members, strive for high
quality, and follow copyright and academic honesty rules.

Visual Aids Should Be Visual

We begin with the design principle--and reminder--that visual aids should be visual. If you are tempted to put blocks of
text or bulleted lists into presentation software or a video, stop yourself. Ask if that same information can be communi
cated visually. For example,

   Can you show a photograph of the person you are quoting rather than simply typing the quote?
   Can you display a fraction, like , by displaying four stick figures and coloring three of them blue and one green

      rather than just writing ?
   Can you illustrate your point through a visual metaphor? Consider the example in box 29.1.

                                                                                                       Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an Audience | 369
   Box 29.1 Making Visual Aids Visual

   Notice the following difference between a visual aid that presents information about plastic waste in tex-
tual form (on the top) and a visual metaphor (on the bottom).

                                                                         As you design your visual aids, reduce the num-
                                                             ber of words wherever possible and think of ways to visu-

                                                             Less Is More

                                                             not to be afraid of

if it is not overcrowded with information.

As you put together your visual aid, ask yourself, What is its central message? Will the audience have their eye

drawn to that message?

 On slides, for instance, avoid putting multiple images--say, two charts and a photograph--on one slide. Instead,
   choose the single most impactful image to communicate the message. Give each image its own slide or moment if
   they make different points.

 In video, avoid adding multiple cuts, visual effects, and animation to a single segment. Allow for some degree of
   stillness so your audience can focus on the footage itself.

 When using audience-interactive visual aids, beware of pairing them with additional visual aids. It can be very diffi-
   cult, especially for an older audience, for example, to skim viewers' live chats while also watching a video clip.

Consider Spacing and Positioning

Third, consider spacing or positioning when designing visual aids by paying attention to alignment and proximity. Align
ment is the deliberate placement of the elements within a given slide or frame. Alignment includes how photos, text,
and captions are lined up with one another (center them, left-justify them, etc.). You don't want anything to look ran-

370 | Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an Audience
domly placed. When elements on your slide or in the camera's frame, like corporate logos or titles, have visual similarity
in where they appear and in relation to one another, your presentation looks more professional.

            Proximity says that items that are similar should be placed next to one another. Placing items together creates
a visual unit, and the eye readily understands that these elements are part of a group. If you are talking about the advan-
tages or drawbacks of a particular solution, for instance, the proximity principle says,

The advantages should appear together,  and

            Mixing or randomly placing these elements confuses rather than clarifies. The purpose of proximity is to help
organize the material for the audience.

   Box 29.2 Using White Space and Alignment in Visual Aids

   Imagine a student who wants to deliver a speech that advocates the ecological benefits of hunting.

            Slide A: This slide was hastily designed. It offers a confusing and crowded collage of images associ-
ated with hunting. The audience would not be sure what to focus on or what conclusions to draw from it.

            Slide B: This slide more effectively sup-
ports the student's message because it strategically
incorporates white space and aligns images in a
meaningful way.

ally different as well. For example, imagine using the fol-
lowing:

An orange background for images of trash contrasted with...

a green background for images of recycling.

 Gray tones for items that cannot be recycled, contrasted with...

 bright colors for items that can be recycled.

Contrasting colors can create a visual "pop" and quickly help the eye determine what is important or different.
            Visual harmony, on the other hand, is the pleasure produced by colors that complement or go well together.

You generally want all the colors you choose on a given visual aid or within a video, even when contrasting, to produce
harmony (thus, orange and green work nicely together even as they contrast). When color choices are disharmo-
nious--such as if you pair canary yellow with neon green--the resulting visual aid can produce discomfort and distract
the audience.

Consider What Your Visual Choices Suggest

Fifth, consider what your visual choices suggest. Rhetorical scholar Sonja K. Foss writes that we can understand and eval-
uate the nature of an image by paying attention to both its presented elements and its suggested visual elements. Pre
sented visual elements are the "major physical features of the image," such as size, color, shapes, form, background, and
372 | Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an Audience
  so forth. Suggested visual elements are "the concepts, ideas, themes, and allusions that a viewer is likely to infer from
  presented elements."1 In other words, suggested elements may help us determine how audiences receive and under-
  stand the image.

              Many types of visual choices communicate information to audiences:
     We already mentioned that alignment and proximity can suggest similarities or distinctions among visual elements.
     Size differences can allude to distinctions such as inferring the superiority of large images compared to the weak

        ness or inferiority of smaller images.
     Certain colors can suggest emotions and associations. We relate red with anger, passion, and danger, for example,

        and pink with femininity. In Western cultures white connotes purity (the origin of the traditional white wedding
        dress), whereas in China, white is associated with death and is the color of mourning. Chinese brides wear red, a
        color that signifies good fortune.
  Cultural contexts may be important to keep in mind as you anticipate what your visual choices suggest to your audience.
  For an example of how to use presented visual elements effectively to suggest information that supports your point,
  read box 29.3.

             Box 29.3 Visual Elements Function Rhetorically
             If you delivered a speech about the harms of firearms for children in the US, which slide would better
          communicate your message?

                      Slide A: This slide presents disharmonious colors, making it unpleasant to look at. Also, its visual
          layout suggests that all causes of child mortality are equal even though the percentages indicate otherwise.

                                                                                                     Slide B: Notice how this slide makes use of
                                                                                         differences in positioning, size, and harmonious col

                                                            Sixth, consider readability for all audience members.

Right-click image to enlarge in a new tab.                  Remember that what is clear and visible on your com-
                                                            puter screen may translate well for viewers watching

                                                            through a screen remotely, but not for an in-person audi-

ence when projected onto a screen. Yellow, for instance, can be very difficult to read when projected, especially against

a white background.

Remember, too, that audience members may have varying

quality of vision. Thus,

 As you choose images and fonts, go larger than you might other-       Ishihara chart via Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY.
   wise and avoid overly fancy or embellished font styles.

 If you are showing video and want audience members to see par-
   ticular elements, pause the video and point to those elements or
   also use (possibly enlarged) still shots taken from the video to
   ensure everyone can see the crucial parts.

 Know, too, that a fair number of people have color vision defi-
   ciency (frequently referred to as being color blind), meaning they
   struggle to see differences between colors. Two of the most
   prevalent forms of color blindness are between red and green and
   between blue and yellow. So if you want to contrast colors, opt for
   alternative combinations.

Strive for High Quality

Seventh, strive for high quality in your visual aids. While it may seem unfair, nothing undercuts the impact of a carefully
prepared speech like a typo in your visual aid. Audience members read such seemingly small errors as marks of careless-
ness or lack of preparation. Thus you should read and reread your visual aids for spelling or grammatical errors before
your presentation.

            Similarly, a low-quality image can hurt your credibility. This is especially true when presenting in person. An
image needs to be large enough for the people in the back of the room to see, and it should not be blurry or pixelated
when projected.

            Creating your own visual aid better ensures a high-quality image. In the previous chapter, we explained that
making your own visual aid also ensures it is customized to your specific speech's needs. The final usage principle will
add that using your own image avoids copyright concerns.

374 | Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an Audience
Follow Copyright and Academic Honesty Rules

Finally, follow copyright and academic honesty rules. It can be difficult to navigate copyright laws, especially when speak-
ing in an educational context. Therefore, we provide guidance both for the images or video clips and for citing them.

Creating or Borrowing Images and Video

To be safe, whenever possible, create your own images (pictures, charts, infographics, etc.) and video (clips, GIFs, etc.).

                                                          If it's not possible to make your own, use images and

                                                     videos that are legally free to use. These might be called "open

                                                     access," "Creative Commons," "public domain," "royalty-free,"

                                                     "free stock," or simply "free," and there are many websites

Creative Commons Logo by Creative Commons, Used per  devoted to them. Just search for "Creative Commons images" to
Creative Commons policies.                           find several websites. Alternatively, after conducting a Google

                                                     Images search, find the Google "Tool" that allows you to specify

that your results only show images with "Usage Rights" set to "Creative Commons licenses."

Once again, you should also discover what resources your college or university can make available to you. It is

possible your library already subscribes to an image service you can use for free. Otherwise, if an image or video does

not explicitly give you permission to use it, assume it is protected by US copyright law.

If you really want to use a copyright-protected image or video and do not have explicit permission to use it, try

to obtain permission from the copyright holder. Explain who you are (likely a student), what you want to use (the specific

image or video), what you will use it for (likely a class assignment), and who the audience will include (likely your instruc-

tor and classmates). This path can be simple if the holder is clearly named, is easy to contact, is quickly responsive to

your request, and grants you free access. More typically, however, it is not that easy or fast, which is why creating your

own images or finding legally available images or videos is a preferable option.

Fortunately, in some cases, you can legally use

copyrighted images or video clips without receiving per-

mission. Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows copy-

righted material to be used without explicit permission,

based on four factors:

   the purpose and character of use
   the amount or substantiality of use compared with

      the work as a whole
   the nature of the copyrighted work
   the effect on the potential market for sale or value of

      the copyrighted material

                                                                                              Doctrine Of Fair Use by Nick Youngson via Pix4free.org, CC BY-SA.
You must apply these four factors each time you want to
use a copyright-protected image or video to assess the applicability of fair use.2 Your librarian or professor may be able
to help you, and your college or university may have a guide to fair use that provides a more detailed explanation.

Citing Images and Video

Whenever you use images or videos you did not fully create by yourself, exercise academic honesty by correctly citing
them through written citations. That means abiding by the following advice:

   Follow a style guide (like MLA or APA). They typically have citation guides for artwork, YouTube videos, social
      media posts, and so on.

   If you used legally free images or videos, follow our advice in chapter 9 to use the TASL method developed by the
      creators of Creative Commons licenses.

   If you used some form of artificial intelligence (AI) to produce a visual aid, follow our guidance in chapter 9 for cit-
      ing the use of AI tools: Name the AI tool and version you used as well as the company that makes it, list the date
      you used the tool and what you used it for, and include a URL to the tool.

   If you used copyrighted material based on the fair use doctrine or with the originator's permission, you should
      specify that along with your citation.
            You might wonder where you should include written citation information for viewers. Recall our advice in chap-

ter 9 to either create a "credit page" at the end of the slide deck or video or add citations to the visual slides or in the
video itself. If you choose the latter, you can use a small font and a low positioning of the citation so it does not compete
with the image or video for the audience's attention. Wherever you decide to offer a written citation of a visual image or
video, including the citation builds your credibility by giving credit to the source who created the image or video clip.

          Box 29.4 Improving Your Visual Aid Design
          After you have created a visual aid, improve it by using the design principles and answering the following
       questions. Alternatively, apply the principles to a peer's visual aid to help them improve their design.

Usage Principles

Once you have designed your visual aids, plan how you will incorporate them into your speech. We offer five usage prin-
                                                                                                        Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an Audience | 377
ciples, or advice, to guide you: introduce and explain your visual aids, give the audience time to digest your visual aids,
do not be afraid of a blank slide or screen, talk to the audience or camera rather than to your visual aids, and practice
with your visual aids.

Introduce and Explain Your Visual Aids

                                     First, introduce and explain your visual aids. Do not expect your visual aids to speak for them-
                                     selves or for their connection to your speech to be self-evident. Instead, introduce your slide,
                                     video clip, or audience-interactive visual aid by providing a transition and any necessary con-
                                     text or instructions. Then explicitly acknowledge your visual aid and explain what you hope
                                     the audience notices or concludes from it.

                                  If you display a chart, graph, map, or photograph, for instance, point out what you want the
                                     audience to visually attend to.

                                  If you play a video clip, cue the audience for what to look for and/or explain afterward what
      they should have noticed.
   If you use an audience-interactive visual aid, draw conclusions from the resulting visual aid that the audience's
      feedback helped produce.

Give the Audience Time to Digest Your Visual Aids

A second usage principle is to give audiences time to digest your visual aid. It takes people a moment to process a visual
aid, even when it's simple. Consider pausing while they watch or read, and plan that moment into your allotted time.
When you talk, speak about the visual aid, which buys your audience more time to focus on it. If you too quickly move
to the next point in your speech, the audience's attention will be split between listening to you and reading your slide,
chart, or GIF. They are more likely to pay attention to the visual aid than to you.

Do Not Be Afraid of a Blank Slide or Screen

Third, do not be afraid of a blank slide or screen. Shifting to a blank screen at key points in the speech--for instance, when
you want to tell a story--is a great way to refocus attention on you and your ideas. You do not need to show an endless
series of images or clips while you speak.

Talk to the Audience or Camera Rather Than to Your Visual Aids

Fourth, talk to the audience or camera rather than to your visual aids. When speaking in person, we recommend the fol-
lowing:

   Don't turn your back on the audience to face your visual aids projected onto a screen. Keep your body facing your
      audience even as you glance at your visual aids to talk through them.

378 | Designing and Using Visual Aids to Reach an Audience
   Don't read from your visual aids! Don't stare at the slides as if looking for answers. Use your speaking notes instead
      and make eye contact with the audience if you are able.

When speaking remotely through a screen, we similarly insist on the following:
   Don't read your notes from your computer or tablet screen nor look only at the visual aids you are sharing on your
      screen. If your face is visible, it is obvious to viewers that your eyes are looking down, away, or even left and right
      as you read your notes.
   Instead, look at the camera if you can, or, if appropriate, turn off your camera and just focus viewers' attention on
      your visual aids while you discuss them.

Practice with Your Visual Aids

Finally, practice with your visual aids. This is one of the best pieces of advice we can offer. Many presentations could be
more powerful if slides, a video clip, or an audience-interactive visual aid were timed better. Practicing your speech with
visual aids will help you work out the timing and gain familiarity and confidence using them.

          Box 29.5 Improving Your Use of Visual Aids
          When incorporating visual aids into your presentation, abide by the following usage principles as you pre-
       pare and practice your speech:
             Verbally introduce and explain your visual aids.
             Give the audience time to digest your visual aids.
             Do not be afraid of a blank slide or screen.
             Talk to the audience or camera rather than to your visual aids.
             Practice with your visual aids.

            In conclusion, we remind you that visual aids are powerful--and potentially fun--public speaking tools. As you
plan and design your visual aids, keep your focus on the ways visual aids can assist and build civic engagement in a well-
crafted speech.

     Summary

        Visual aids offer many advantages to speakers when they are well designed and effectively incorporated into
     a speech. However, when poorly crafted or mishandled, visual aids can do more harm than good. In this chap-
     ter, we established the following:

30. Rhetorical Criticism as Civic Engagement

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Describe rhetoric as symbolic action.
          Complete the descriptive, interpretive, and evaluative steps of rhetorical criticism.
          Demonstrate five mentalities through their rhetorical criticism.

To this point in the textbook, our attention has focused on aiding your civic engagement through the creation and facil-
itation of speech. That is, we have primarily concentrated on producing your own rhetoric.

                                          We now turn to rhetorical criticism to closely examine other rhetors' messages. Rhetori
                              cal criticism (or its synonym, rhetorical analysis) is the description, interpretation, and evaluation
                              of rhetoric to form judgments about its functions and consequences. In other words, rhetorical
                              criticism equips us to investigate the rhetorical choices other people make.

                                          Rhetorical criticism functions as a form of civic engagement. Through rhetorical criticism,
                              we become better, more knowledgeable consumers of public information. In other words, we
                              notice persuasive appeals in the messages that bombard us daily and think more deeply about their
implications. We can use this knowledge to educate fellow community members. Such insights help us hold officials and
speakers accountable, weigh policy options, and lend support for, or voice resistance to, plans and proposals. In sum,
rhetorical criticism enables democratic participants to improve both our understanding of public communication and
the decisions made by our communities.
            In this chapter we first describe rhetoric as symbolic action. We then explain the goal and steps of rhetorical
criticism, which helps illuminate a rhetoric's symbolic action. We end by describing rhetorical criticism as an intellectual
discipline for which critics should adopt specific mentalities.

Rhetoric as Symbolic Action

In chapter 1, we defined rhetoric as a civic art devoted to the ethical study and use of symbols (verbal and nonverbal)
to address public issues. Let's consider what we mean by "symbols." A symbol is something that expresses an idea or
refers to something beyond itself. Our definition of rhetoric references verbal symbols (language, our words) and non
verbal symbols (facial expression, body language, etc.). Symbols can also be visual (images, graphics, signs, etc.) or audio
(sounds, beats, etc.).

            In this chapter we examine the use of symbols more closely to see how they act and what they accomplish. We
take as our guiding inspiration the conception of rhetoric as symbolic action, which comes from the most influential
rhetorical scholar of the twentieth century, Kenneth Burke. Burke contended that we see and understand our world and
ourselves through the medium of symbols.

382 | Rhetorical Criticism as Civic Engagement
            Symbolic action refers to the power of symbols to do things--that is, to shape our
thoughts, values, and actions. As Burke explains, our words (as verbal symbols) are simultane-
ously reflections, selections, and deflections of reality:

   Words offer a reflection of reality--that is, they can be used to describe everyday situations,
      human society, our world, and the universe.

   Words offer a selection of reality because we can never describe everything about some-
      thing or all the angles or perspectives that can be taken on it. Thus, all descriptions are
      incomplete selections of reality.

   Finally, words provide us with a deflection of reality in that all descriptions focus our attention on certain aspects
      and take our attention away from others.1

            As a high school student, for example, you may have made plans to hold an event at your house while your par-
ents were away. When you invited your friends, you might have described the event as a "party." This term reflected the
event and selected the fun and possibly raucous aspects of the event to excite your friends to attend. However, when
you described the event to your parents to gain their permission, you may have called it a "get-together" or "hangout."
Those terms also reflected the event. But they deflected your parents' attention away from its possible raucousness and,
instead, selected its social nature to focus upon.

            We make language choices--as well as choices with our nonverbal, visual, and audio symbol use--because we
recognize that symbols do something. Through selection and deflection, they shape the way we see and understand the
world. You might even say they constitute our reality; that is, our symbols compose the world we know and act within.

   Box 30.1 Symbolic Action in Practice

   Imagine you are driving and hit another car. No
one is hurt, but both vehicles are damaged, and the
incident is reported to the police.

 When you call your automobile insurance

agent about the incident, you probably want

to minimize what happened so your insur-

ance rate does not increase. What do you call

the incident? A "fender-bender"? A "bump"?

 When you call your significant other to tell

them what happened, you may want to

amplify what happened to gain their sympa-           Image via Rawpixel, Public Domain.
thy. What do you call the incident for them?

Perhaps a "crash" or "collision"?

 Who else might you talk to about the incident, and what alternative words might you use to differ-

ently influence their perceptions of it?

                   Consider: What does each label deflect listeners' attention away from? What aspects of the event do
       each of the words select for listeners to focus on?

Rhetorical Criticism

If symbols function persuasively, then how can you best study this symbolic action? Rhetorical criticism is designed to
do just that! As we defined earlier, rhetorical criticism is the description, interpretation, and evaluation of rhetoric to
form judgments about its functions and consequences.

          Though it's easy to confuse "criticism" with complaint or fault finding, in rhetorical criticism, the word
       refers simply to analysis and study.

            Through rhetorical criticism, we study how rhetoric--be it verbal, textual, visual, or material--acts persuasively.
More specifically, we study how rhetoric functions through artifacts. A rhetorical artifact is an object of study in rhetor-
ical criticism. By "object," we mean a specific instance of rhetoric that was produced for an audience at a particular time.
A rhetorical artifact is the focal point of analysis. Box 30.3 discusses the National Debt Clock as a sample rhetorical arti-
fact. In the next chapter, we provide guidance for selecting a rhetorical artifact to analyze.

            The rhetorical critic, or person conducting the rhetorical criticism, seeks to understand how the artifact func-
tions persuasively:

   How does the artifact create meaning for audiences?
   How does it invite audiences to perceive reality?
   How does the artifact attempt to persuade audiences?
When we say "audiences" in rhetorical criticism, we typically include an artifact's direct audience. As described in chap-
ter 10, a direct audience consists of the people who are exposed to and attend to a speech--or, in this case, the artifact.
However, we keep "audiences" plural, because a critic may want to differentiate how an artifact functioned persuasively
for various types of audiences discussed in chapter 10: a target audience (those most likely to be influenced by, or to
act upon, the message), an implied audience (those represented in the artifact), and/or an implicated audience (those
impacted by the artifact if its persuasion is successful).

            As a rhetorical critic, you will seek to discover how an artifact functions persuasively for audiences. To do so,
you will analyze a rhetorical artifact in a thoughtful and systematic manner, following three basic steps: description,
interpretation, and evaluation.

384 | Rhetorical Criticism as Civic Engagement
Description

                              In rhetorical criticism, description involves noticing, identifying, and explaining a rhetorical arti-
                              fact's content, form, and absence. In terms of rhetorical content, you examine the message or argu-
                              ment(s) that the artifact advances and the appeals used to do so. You ask what the rhetoric is
                              claiming, conveying, or implying, and you try to provide specific answers.

Rhetorical

analysis also investigates

the form that rhetoric

takes. The form includes

but is not limited to sym-

bol type (verbal, nonver-

bal, visual, audio),

organization,      style,

medium, and genre. For

instance, it is one thing

for an environmental

activist to publish an edi- Image by cottonbro studio via  Just Stop Oil by Just Stop Oil via Wikimedia Commons, Attribution.

about fossil fuels, and it's

another for the same activist to deface a museum or historical painting. In both cases the point being made--expressing

opposition to climate change--is the same, but differences in protest forms likely produce differing reactions and under-

standing. Consequently, it's important for you to describe not just the content but also the form of the rhetoric being

analyzed.

Finally, you may also describe anything significant the artifact leaves out. When describing a political advertise-

ment that quotes an opposing candidate, for instance, it may be important to note if the quotation was cut off early or

made more sense when the comments just before it are included. Sometimes absence can be as important to notice and

describe as presence.

For your rhetorical criticism, use the prompts in box 30.2 and the example in box 30.3 for guidance and help

with description.

Box 30.2 Describing a Rhetorical Artifact

  Content: What is the artifact's primary message, claim, or point? Does it communicate that message
     explicitly or implicitly? What types of appeals does it use to communicate (logos, pathos, ethos)?

  Form: What types of symbols does the artifact utilize (verbal, nonverbal, visual, audio)? How might
     you characterize the artifact's style? How is it organized or arranged? What medium or genre does it
     use?

  Absence: What does the artifact exclude or overlook that is significant?

Box 30.3 Describing the National Debt Clock

   We engage in description regularly as we encounter messages of all types. For example, imagine you are
visiting New York City, and as you walk near Times Square, you come upon the following large display:

                                                                            If you were on your cell phone with a
                                                                friend at this moment and wished to describe it to
                                                                them, you might start by saying something like, "I

            Notice, too, that the display qualifies as a rhetorical artifact. It is the object (focus) of our analysis,
and it is a specific instance of rhetoric that was produced for an audience at a particular time.

Interpretation

Interpretation is the second step in rhetorical criticism, though it often closely accompanies description. Interpretation
involves making inferences about how an artifact's content, form, and absence function persuasively.

            Returning to the notion of symbolic action discussed earlier, you make interpretations by asking, "What's that
doing?" where "that" refers to the elements you described. For instance, how do pathos appeals invite the direct audi-
ence to perceive the situation? What do they emphasize? What does the artifact's organizational structure deflect the
audience's attention away from? How might the artifact's absence of conflicting perspectives narrow the audience's
memory of the topic or event? Your answers should use active verbs to accentuate the symbolic action. If you are not
using verbs when interpreting a rhetorical artifact, then you are probably describing rather than interpreting its per-
suasive functions or symbolic action.

            The prompts in box 30.4 and the example in box 30.5 give you further support and help with interpretation.

          Box 30.4 Interpreting a Rhetorical Artifact
             How do the rhetorical artifact's content, form, and absence attempt to influence audiences' percep-

             What do the rhetorical artifact's elements emphasize or draw attention to?
             What do the rhetorical artifact's elements deflect attention away from?

                   Use active verbs when answering these questions to accentuate the artifact's symbolic action.

          Box 30.5 Interpreting the National Debt Clock
          Let's return to the phone conversation (started in box 30.3) with your friend about the National Debt
       Clock that hangs in New York City.

                   Fairly quickly after describing the clock, you would likely move to interpreting how its content,
       form, and absence function persuasively. You might exclaim the following:

             Form: "Wow, the size and height of that huge sign convey the enormity of the debt!"
             Content: "The use of the word `our' on that sign drives home the shared burden all Americans have

                and stokes fears that we cannot pay it off."
             Absence: "But by not showing if or how the debt has decreased in the past, the sign implies it has

                only steadily grown."
                   Those are interpretations because they infer how the content, form, and absence are functioning

       persuasively. Notice that active verbs ("convey," "drives home," "stokes," "implies") capture the sign's sym-
       bolic action.

Evaluation

We clarified earlier that "criticism" in rhetorical criticism does not mean complaining or fault finding. However, rhetor-
ical analysis does include evaluation.

                                        Evaluation in rhetorical criticism involves making judgments about the functions and con
                            sequences of the rhetoric examined. Judgments are based on the artifact's rhetorical features: what
                            they are (description) and how they function persuasively (interpretation) in the context. Evalua-
                            tions are not about, nor based on, the critic's feelings about the artifact. Box 30.6 provides an exam-
                            ple to make this distinction clear.

               You might wonder why rhetorical critics judge an artifact's functions and consequences. Typically, such evalu-
   ations teach us about ourselves, a particular group, or a specific rhetorical artifact.

               The evaluation generated by rhetorical criticism
   can help us see an aspect of our society we had not seen
   clearly before. For instance, rhetoric scholar Michael But-
   terworth analyzed how the continued regular perfor-
   mance of "God Bless America" at sporting events since 9/
   11 promotes nationalistic thinking that places sport in the
   service of US militarism. In doing so, Butterworth helped
   us see deeper meaning in what we might otherwise con-
   sider a harmless and even soothing ritual.2

               Other times the evaluation teaches us something
   about a particular group we had not known about or paid
   close attention to. Examples include analysis that provides
   insight into the rhetoric of political and social movements Andrew Scharnhorst Sings the National Anthem by U.S. Navy via

   advocates. Here evaluation highlights the implications
   and ethics of tactics designed to move audiences and generate support for a cause.

               Sometimes the evaluation teaches us about a particular rhetorical artifact's potential dangers or benefits on the
   beliefs, attitudes, and courses of action of those who experience it. This might range from a critic judging what they per-
   ceive to be the damaging gender stereotypes promoted in some Disney films to valorizing the depiction of superheroes,

   such as Captain America, as embodying cherished values including freedom, equality, justice, and courage.3 Evaluation
   is the most complex and significant component of rhetorical criticism.

             Box 30.7 Evaluating a Rhetorical Artifact
                How does your rhetorical criticism help us notice and understand an aspect of our society we had

                   not clearly seen before?
                What might your analysis teach us about a particular group, individual, organization, company, or

                   institution?
                What can your rhetorical criticism illuminate about the dangers or benefits of a particular rhetorical

                   artifact's potential impacts on audiences' beliefs, attitudes, or courses of action?

               In sum, rhetorical criticism carefully investigates the symbolic action by a rhetorical artifact through the steps
   of description, interpretation, and evaluation. It is both a practice and an intellectual discipline, which we will consider
   next.

 Rhetorical Criticism as an Intellectual Discipline

   How do you know when your rhetorical criticism--following the steps of description, interpretation, and evaluation--has
   led you to the right answer? How do you know if your conclusions about a rhetorical artifact are correct? To answer, we
   need to characterize the discipline of rhetorical criticism. As we will explain, it is a systematic and reasonable as well as
   a creative and manifold field of study. And it requires critics to adopt a set of specific mentalities.

  Systematic and Reasonable

   On the one hand, rhetorical criticism is a systematic and reasonable discipline.

      Systematic: Your rhetorical criticism will more likely produce compelling insights if you systematically follow the
         three steps we discussed (description, interpretation, and evaluation) by answering the prompting questions we
         provided for each step.

      Reasonable: Critics ultimately make an argument about how an artifact functioned persuasively. As we discussed in
         chapter 26, an argument requires supporting claims with credible evidence. In rhetorical criticism, critics typically
         draw evidence from the artifact itself (i.e., quotations, descriptions, etc.), information about the artifact's historical
         context (which we explore in the next chapter), and possibly from the rhetorical method used by the critic (also
         discussed in the next chapter). Such evidence is required to give the audience reasons to accept your claims about
         the rhetorical artifact.

                                                                                                                             Rhetorical Criticism as Civic Engagement | 389
            If you do not provide sufficient, relevant evidence to support your claims--discovered through your systematic
analysis of the artifact--your rhetorical criticism may be insightful but not compelling. In other words, your work will be
interesting but insufficiently supported.

Creative and Manifold

On the other hand, rhetorical criticism is also a civic art, much like rhetoric itself. That means it is a creative and mani-
fold discipline.

   Creative: No matter how carefully or comprehensively you analyze an artifact, your criticism will be influenced by
      your own personality, interests, choices, experiences, and values. That's a strength of rhetorical criticism! Some-
      what like painting a picture, your unique perspective can prompt creative insights and understanding about the
      artifact that other critics might miss.

   Manifold: Rhetorical criticism includes multiple, evolving methods, approaches, and conceptual lenses. Different
      critics will probably choose different approaches, notice different elements, interpret them differently, and/or
      offer different evaluations. That's another strength of rhetorical criticism! The more critics who analyze a rhetori-
      cal artifact, the more insights we can gain.

            Thus, if you follow the process of rhetorical criticism too rigidly or focus too much on describing the artifact
rather than interpreting and evaluating it, your claims are likely to be reasonable but not insightful. They will lack the
awareness and knowledge that your unique perspective can bring to your audience.

            Together, the systematic/reasonable and creative/manifold qualities mean there are no "right" or "wrong"
answers or conclusions when conducting rhetorical criticism. Does that mean anything goes or that any rhetorical cri-
tique you produce deserves an A grade? No! Instead, we tend to measure rhetorical criticism according to its strength.

 Stronger Rhetorical Criticism

 Reasonable: offers compelling evidence for claims.

 Insightful: helps people understand the artifact and its consequences in ways they might have missed.

            Notice we included arrows between stronger and weaker rhetorical criticism to indicate a spectrum or range
of quality possible rather than two simple categories.

Mentalities to Adopt

Because rhetorical criticism is systematic and creative, critics must adopt particular mentalities
to produce insightful and compelling rhetorical criticism. These five mentalities include the fol-
lowing:

   Curiosity: The persistent desire to understand how rhetoric functions for audiences. This
      curiosity drives you to go beyond what you want or expects to see to detailed observation

390 | Rhetorical Criticism as Civic Engagement
   and analysis.
 Imagination: The ability to break apart and examine rhetorical artifacts from multiple perspectives.
 Systematic examination: The employment of a thorough and orderly approach when analyzing discourse by mov-

   ing from description to interpretation to evaluation.
 Discernment: The ability to see beyond the surface of an artifact and shift from description to interpretation. You

   determine which rhetorical elements to focus on to generate the greatest insight into the functioning of an arti-
   fact.
 Reasoned analysis: The use of credible evidence, appropriate and representative examples, and an adherence to the
   standards of valid argumentation.

  Summary

      This chapter introduced rhetorical criticism as an intellectual discipline and form of civic engagement. It pre-
   sented the understanding needed to appreciate what rhetorical criticism entails, such as the following:

        Rhetoric works as symbolic action as symbols have the power to shape thoughts, values and actions.
        Rhetorical criticism is the description, interpretation, and evaluation of rhetoric to form judgments

           about its functions and consequences. Description involves noticing, identifying, and explaining a rhetor-
           ical artifact's content, form, and absence. Interpretation occurs when you make inferences about how an
           artifact's content, form, and absence function persuasively. Evaluation involves making judgments about
           the functions and consequences of the rhetoric examined.
        Rhetorical criticism is a systematic and reasonable discipline as well as a creative and manifold field of
           study. Consequently, your work is judged based on its strength or weakness rather than its rightness or
           wrongness.
        To produce insightful and compelling rhetorical analysis, you should adopt such mentalities as curios-
           ity, imagination, discernment, systematic study, and reasoned analysis.

Democratic Principles

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Identify a rhetorical artifact that addresses a substantive public matter.
          Reconstruct basic elements of a rhetorical artifact's historical context.
          Evaluate a rhetorical artifact's impact on democratic principles.

In the previous chapter, we defined rhetorical criticism as the description, interpretation, and evaluation of rhetoric to
form judgments about its functions and consequences. We equipped you with basic instructions to conduct a rhetori-
cal criticism: Describe a rhetorical artifact's content, form, and absence, interpret its persuasive functions, and evaluate
the functions and their consequences. We suggested that rhetorical criticism empowers you to account for an artifact's
symbolic action--the power of symbols to shape our thoughts, values, and actions.

            In this chapter, we supplement those basic instructions with a richer understanding of how to select a rhetori-
cal artifact, situate the artifact in a historical context, and evaluate it against democratic principles.

Selecting Rhetorical Artifacts

In chapter 30 we defined a rhetorical artifact as an object of study in rhetorical criticism. We explained that it is a spe-
cific instance of rhetoric that was produced for an audience at a particular time. Today, the range of potential rhetorical
artifacts is limitless! That was not always the case.

            In the early twentieth century: The modern field of rhetorical studies in the US was referred to as "speech" with
a narrow focus on public, political speeches.

            Since at least the 1960s: The range of rhetorical artifacts studied expanded to include literature, art, film, televi-
sion, social movements, the internet, and social media.

            As the examples in box 31.1 illustrate, today a rhetorical artifact can be anything from a billboard advertisement
to a Taylor Swift song to a Disney film.

            Consequently, we might expand our understanding of the rhetor, which we defined in chapter 1 as a person who
speaks publicly, to the author or creator of the rhetorical artifact under examination. Thus, a rhetor may be a speaker,
writer, lyricist, filmmaker, and so on.

                                                                                       Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and Democratic Principles | 393
   Box 31.1 Rhetorical Artifacts

   To help you appreciate the array of rhetorical artifacts available, read through this wide-ranging list of
examples. Perhaps it will help you discover a type of artifact you'd like to analyze! This list is by no means
comprehensive; it's simply meant to spark your own ideas and discovery.

   Artwork or photography                              Public address, lecture, or sermon
Billboard                                              Social media post or meme
Blog, editorial, or news column                        Social movement campaign mate-
Book or graphic novel                                  rials
Commercial or marketing ad                             Song or music video
Film                                                   Statue or memorial
A particular space                                     TV show
Political declaration, manifesto, or                   Video
campaign materials                                     Video game
Political or animated cartoon                          Website

            Choose a rhetorical artifact that meets the definition's criteria and, for the purposes of this textbook, that
addresses a substantive public matter. First, the artifact must be a specific instance of rhetoric that a rhetor (speaker,
writer, etc.) produced for an audience at a particular time. That is what makes a rhetorical artifact different from a topic
or subject. Use the following table to better distinguish between rhetorical artifacts and topics.

Topics         Rhetorical Artifacts

Mental health  A YouTube video devoted to talking about mental health
                  A clothing campaign that emphasizes mental health messages
                  Pamphlets produced by your college's health and wellness office

Christianity   A sermon delivered by a pastor
                  A music video by a Christian artist
                  An altar inside a church building

            Second, ideally choose a rhetorical artifact that addresses a significant community concern or problem. In other
words, locate an artifact that engages a social, political, or financial issue that a community cares about and that carries
notable implications for that community's welfare. Find a rhetorical artifact that attempts to influence how audiences
view or act on that issue. Don't assume that only serious rhetorical artifacts qualify. An advertisement, a video game, or
even a sports team mascot might be eligible if, for example, it engages a political issue or communicates a social mes-
sage about gender, race, religion, and so on. If you're unsure if an artifact addresses a substantive public matter, ask your
instructor for help.

394 | Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and Democratic Principles
Situating Rhetorical Artifacts in Historical Context

In addition to selecting an appropriate rhetorical artifact, you also need to situate that artifact in a historical context.
Context refers to the conditions or situation within which rhetoric is produced. Critics are typically less concerned with
a rhetorical artifact's lasting or enduring beauty and much more interested in its relationship with its particular context.

              The Reciprocal Relationship of Artifacts and Contexts

All rhetorical acts take place in a historical context of some type--be that a particular social context, financial context,
legal context, and so forth. That context influences the rhetorical artifact's nature, content, functions, and goals. For
instance, consider the following example:

Context                                                                         Rhetorical Artifact

The ongoing Civil War, the setting of a battlefield, and the occa-  influenced  the content and form of President Lin-
sion of a dedication ceremony for the National Cemetery of Get-                 coln's Gettysburg Address.
tysburg

            The relationship between an artifact and its context is reciprocal, however. Just as contexts influence rhetoric,
rhetors produce artifacts to influence the context! A rhetor may hope to move an audience to improve a community
problem, buoy a person into leadership, or strengthen community relationships. Let's return to the previous example:

         Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and Democratic Principles | 395
Rhetorical Artifact  Context

 Lincoln used his Gettysburg Address to influence Americans to end the Civil War and reunite as a nation.
                                                                

            Thus, just as the context shapes the artifact, so too the artifact attempts to influence the context.

Determining an Artifact's Historical Context: Six Questions to Answer

To determine an artifact's historical context, answer who, why, what, to whom, when, and where surrounding the
rhetoric's production. Use the prompting questions in box 31.2 and the example in box 31.3 for help.

          Box 31.2 Reconstructing the Historical Context
             Who: Who was the rhetor? What might audiences have already known about them?
             Why: What seemed to prompt this rhetoric? What was the rhetor's goal?
             What: What type of artifact are you analyzing? What are its major characteristics?
             To Whom: Who were the direct, target, implied, and implicated audiences for the artifact?
             When: When was the artifact produced, delivered, aired, or uploaded? What was the specific date?

                What might be useful to know about the time period in which it appeared?
             Where: Where was the artifact delivered, consumed, or uploaded? Name the medium it used and

                the physical location or the technological platform employed (YouTube, Snapchat, etc.).

          Box 31.3 An Example of Establishing the Historical Context
          In the previous chapter, we introduced the National Debt Clock that hangs outdoors in New York City. We
       used it to exemplify how you might describe, interpret, and evaluate a rhetorical artifact. What is its histori-
       cal context? Based on our research, we discovered the following:
             Who: The clock was originally designed by New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, who

396 | Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and Democratic Principles
                   worried about the ramifications of governmental debt.1
                To whom: See box 31.4.
                Why: According to The New York Times, Durst "wanted a vivid way to show Americans how big the

                   national debt was, and also to nudge elected officials to do something about it."

                           2

                What: The display is an eleven-by-twenty-six-foot billboard with static (unchanging) words and
                   digitally displayed numbers that continually change to reflect the US gross national debt and each
                   American family's share moment to moment. It is more widely referred to as the "National Debt Clock."

                When: The display was installed in 1989 after two terms by President Ronald Reagan, under whose
                   administration the national debt nearly tripled to $2.6 trillion.3 During the early to mid-1990s, because
                   the national debt decreased under President Clinton's administration, the clock's total went down. In
                   the late 1990s, the clock's total went up again as President George Bush Sr. increased the national
                   debt. The clock continues to run today along with a virtual edition.4

                Where: The billboard was originally hung on the side of a Manhattan building on Sixth Avenue
                   between Forty-Second and Forty-Third Streets, just one block away from Times Square. It moved in
                   2004 but was repositioned near its original spot in 2017.

                       Notice how learning about the display's historical context enriches our understanding of the recip-
          rocal relationship between a rhetorical artifact and its context. The context prompted the clock's production
          (as a response to the national debt tripling), and the clock attempted to influence that context (hoping to
          prompt legislators to lower the national debt).

               Take special care when identifying the audience ("to whom") for your rhetorical artifact.
   Rhetoric creates meaning in relation to audiences; it is they who respond to, endorse, or reject a
   message.

               To determine audiences, let's return to the ways we conceived of them in chapter 10.
   Namely, we differentiated among the direct, target, implied, and implicated audiences. Recall the
   following:

      The direct audience refers to the people who are exposed to and attend to the rhetoric.
      The target audience consists of specific members who are more likely to be influenced by the appeals and/or more

         likely to act on them.
      The implied audiences are the groups represented in the message.
      The implicated audiences refer to the groups affected by the message if it is successful.

   Knowing who interacted with, was targeted by, was referenced in, or was potentially impacted by the artifact can help
   you make more specific arguments about how the artifact functioned. See box 31.4 for an example.

             Box 31.4 An Example of Identifying Audiences ("To Whom")
             Let's return to the National Debt Clock to discuss why identifying an artifact's audience can aid your
          rhetorical analysis. The clock's audiences included the following:
                Direct audience: For the National Debt Clock, the direct audience includes everyone who walks by

                   and notices the clock, which likely consists of local residents, tourists, and nearly business workers
                   and customers.
                Target audience: Based on Durst's original goal, the target audience was--and likely
                   remains--elected officials who can lower the debt as well as Americans who can pressure their offi-
                   cials to do so.
                Implied audiences: Clearly Americans, particularly American families, are referenced by the bill-
                   board through the use of "our" and "your family share."
                Implicated audiences: Americans are among those affected by national debt, particularly when that
                   debt exceeds the limit authorized by Congress. When exceedance approaches, Congress historically
                   has voted to raise the debt limit to avoid defaulting on the nation's legal financial obligations. A default
                   would send the economy into a recession, affecting not only families but also employers and a wide
                   host of industries.5 But even when default is avoided, elected leaders and their constituents are
                   impacted every time the debt approaches exceedance. Republican and Democrat leaders negotiate
                   (often aggressively) before they agree to vote to raise the limit, which can be stressful for all as the
                   fear of default looms.

                       While the national debt display likely grabs the attention and concerns of the direct audience who
          walk past it, it may fail to adequately move the Americans--who are the clock's target, implied, and impli
          cated audiences--to action. American families likely feel inadequate to slow or stop the looming and con-
          stantly increasing numbers, especially given the rancor between political parties every time leaders need to
          raise the debt limit. The sign, consequently, may amplify feelings of doom and powerlessness more so than
          encourage Americans or officials to decrease the national debt.

             Box 31.5 Researching the Historical Context
             How can you learn about an artifact's historical context? Look for answers to the six contextual questions
          in such sources as the following:
                Reliable news sources: Check for news stories about the artifact, the rhetor, or the occasion.
                Opinion sources (blogs, editorials, social media posts, polls, etc.): Discover what some audiences

                   You can also research references made or names mentioned in the artifact.
                   Make sure to review chapters 8 and 9 for guidance on researching effectively.

            Every rhetorical artifact takes place in a historical context. Understanding that context provides important
insights into the rhetoric's functions.

Using a Rhetorical Method

Once you have identified a particular rhetorical artifact and researched its context, you must determine the most appro-
priate way to conduct your analysis. Often this means making use of a particular method. A rhetorical method is a per-
spective, approach, or orientation for analyzing an artifact.

                                                Each method focuses your attention on some elements of rhetoric and, thus, away
                                    from other elements. For example, within rhetorical studies there are methods that focus on
                                    metaphors, myths, and gender depictions, among many others. As each name suggests, the
                                    method directs your attention to the use and function of certain elements in an artifact. In the
                                    chapters that conclude this textbook, we discuss two methods for analyzing rhetoric for
                                    democracy and civic engagement: public communication analysis (chapters 32 and 33) and
                                    ideological criticism (chapters 34 and 35).

          Box 31.6 Rhetorical Methods as Lenses
          To better understand how rhetorical methods work, think about when you get an eye exam by an
       optometrist.

                                                         lenses change what you can see.

                                                                     A rhetorical method is like using a power-
                                                         ful lens that focuses your attention and shapes your
                                                         vision, resulting in new insights about an artifact.
                                                         Different methods, like different lenses, change
                                                         what you see. When done well, rhetorical methods
                                                         help you provide profound insights into human

 Evaluating an Artifact's Impact on Democratic Principles

   In the previous chapter, we named evaluation as the final step of the rhetorical criticism process. We explained that
   evaluation involves making judgments about the functions and consequences of the rhetoric examined. We suggested
   evaluations can help us see an aspect of our society we had not seen clearly before, teach us something about a partic-
   ular group we had not known about or paid close attention to, or even reveal a particular rhetoric's potential dangers or
   benefits on those who experience it.

               Here we add that your evaluation of an artifact can--and should--also judge how the rhetorical artifact impacts
   our democracy. By explicitly attending to this impact, you will strengthen the civic engagement function of your rhetor-
   ical criticism. To explain, we'll first recognize the power of rhetoric on democracy and then provide guidance for evalu-
   ating artifacts accordingly.

  Rhetoric, Democracy, and Demagoguery

   We believe rhetoric that addresses public affairs should strengthen democracy. This position--that great rhetoric aids
   democracy--has long been held by many Americans. In 1948, for instance, communication scholar Earnest Brandenburg
   noted,

          Every orator of sufficient prominence to be considered in the area of Statecraft has been a champion of democ-
          racy and the will of the people. Or, to state it another way, rhetorical critics and historians have seemed to decree
          that prominence be accorded to those who have championed democracy.6

            In contrast, notoriety accrues to rhetors who            Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, National Archives and Records
place their personal gain over democracy. Some speakers,             Administration via Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.
for example, have practiced demagoguery, which is a
rhetoric that explicitly claims to speak for the public's
best interests but implicitly gains more political power for
the speaker and exacerbates divisions among the public,
thereby weakening democracy. People who employ dem-
agoguery are called demagogues. Their discourse typi-
cally overly relies on emotional appeals (especially fear
and hatred), exaggeration, and divisiveness to encourage
listeners to blame others for their problems and to act
before thinking through a matter. Demagoguery, such as
in Senator Huey Long's 1934 speech "Every Man a King"
and Senator Joseph McCarthy's 1950 speech "Enemies
from Within," are considered important speeches but
never great because of the ways they undermined and
ultimately weakened democracy.

Considerations When Evaluating an Artifact's Impact on Democracy

                                       As you decide how a rhetorical artifact impacts democratic principles, keep four considera-
                                       tions in mind: Consider the artifact's historical context, recognize that a rhetorical artifact
                                       can aid democratic principles while forwarding an ideology with which you disagree, be
                                       aware that the rhetor's conscious motive should not dictate your evaluation of an artifact's
                                       impact on democratic principles, and realize the success of a rhetorical artifact may not
                                       necessarily correspond with its impact on democracy. Let's briefly explore each of these
                                       considerations.

          Box 31.8 Evaluating a Rhetorical Artifact's Impact on Democracy
          When evaluating a rhetorical artifact's impact on democracy, keep four considerations in mind:
           1. The artifact reacts to and impacts a specific historical context--that is, a specific community at a

                particular place and time.
          2. A rhetorical artifact can aid democratic principles while forwarding an ideology with which you dis-

                agree.
          3. The rhetor's conscious motive should not dictate your evaluation of an artifact's impact on democ-

                ratic principles.
          4. The success of a rhetorical artifact may not necessarily correspond with its impact on democracy.

Consider the Artifact's Historical Context

First, consider the artifact's historical context when judging its impact on democratic principles. The artifact was created
at a specific moment for a particular audience or set of audiences. Rather than ask if the text strengthens or weakens
democracy in a general sense, you need to more specifically ask whether and how it aided or hampered these democra-
tic principles for this community at this place and time in relation to this issue.

Do Not Simply React to the Ideology Advanced by the Artifact

Second, a rhetorical artifact can aid democratic principles while forwarding an ideology with which you disagree. In fact,
the inclusion of diverse perspectives and the tolerance for disagreement are two hallmarks of democracy. Demagoguery
can become an overly used accusation to silence those with whom we disagree. A person's political stance, background,
and vision do not necessarily make their rhetoric demagogic; rather, their expression, proposals, and appeals determine
whether their rhetoric harms or aids democratic principles.

            Thus, we need rhetorical critics who can carefully examine specific examples of rhetoric to determine how they
are functioning. If we don't have these critics at work, we risk a cynical public who believes all politicians or public fig-
ures receive (and deserve) the same types of disparagement.

                                                                                       Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and Democratic Principles | 403
Motive Is Insufficient

Third, the rhetor's conscious motive should not dictate your evaluation of an artifact's impact on democratic principles.
Senator Joseph McCarthy may have truly believed he was saving the United States from a communist takeover even
as his speeches undermined democratic ideals by silencing dissent, creating division among Americans, and securing
greater authority for himself. Alternatively, a rhetor may appear to be aiming to hurt American democracy, perhaps by
aggressively critiquing the country, while their rhetoric actually strengthens democratic principles by pointing out vio-
lations.

Democratic Impact May Differ from Success

Fourth, the success of a rhetorical artifact may not necessarily correspond with its impact on democracy. It is possible
that a rhetor might accomplish their goals but weaken democracy or vice versa. Box 31.9 offers an example.

          Box 31.9 Evaluating the National Debt Clock
          The case of the National Debt Clock offers an example of an artifact that failed to reach the desired objec-
       tive but still reinforced a fundamental democratic value.
             Durst failed in using the clock to pressure lawmakers to lower the debt, given that it has increased

                from $2.9 billion in 1989 when the display was erected to over $30 trillion in the 2020s.
             However, the clock encouraged--and continues to encourage--ordinary citizens to get involved in

                civic affairs. It prompts us to pay attention to and question the debt amount.

     Summary

        This chapter provided additional tools to conduct an insightful and productive analysis of public communica-
     tion. They included the following:

          Any rhetorical criticism begins by selecting a rhetorical artifact, which functions as the object of study.
          All rhetorical criticism situates the rhetorical artifact within its historical context, which refers to the

             conditions or situation within which rhetoric was produced. It addresses who, to whom, what, when,
             where, and why surrounding the production of the rhetoric.
          Rhetorical critics often use a rhetorical method to guide their analysis.
          Critics best use rhetorical criticism as a form of democratic participation when they explicitly focus
             attention on how rhetorical artifacts impact democratic principles.

32. Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical
Artifacts and Historical Context

Chapter Objectives

Students will:

  Identify an appropriate rhetorical artifact for a public communication analysis.
  Reconstruct the historical context for the rhetorical artifact.

What can you accomplish through speech? What does--or doesn't--rhetoric have the power to do?

It's tempting to name a popular (or notorious)

speech--especially by a US president--and jump to its

presumed effects. Some people may say, for instance, that

President Ronald Reagan's 1987 Brandenburg Gate speech
("Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."1) caused the Berlin

Wall to come down. Or that then-Senator John F.

Kennedy's debating skills against President Nixon won

Kennedy the 1960 election. Or that President Donald

Trump's January 6, 2021, rally speech caused the ensuing

attack on the US Capitol.

These uses of rhetoric are well known, but did

they produce these outcomes? If so, how? Perhaps more

importantly, how did the rhetoric impact democracy? Did

the rhetorical features in speeches strengthen or weaken    President Ronald Reagan Gives a Thumbs Up at the Berlin Wall,

duced and outlined in chapter 31? An advocate can suc-

cessfully achieve their speaking goals without necessarily strengthening democratic principles.

Public communication analysis is an approach to rhetorical criticism that helps critics determine a rhetorical

artifact's features and ascertain their likely consequences. It focuses on these central questions:

 Does the rhetorical artifact achieve the rhetor's goal? How or why not?
 Does the rhetorical artifact strengthen or weaken democratic principles? How?

  406 | Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
This approach expands and updates the traditional method of criticism known as Neo-Aristotelianism to address our
interest in democracy and to include several more contemporary rhetorical concepts.

            We see this critical approach as an important building block for you as a speaker and democratic participant. It
is an approach that will cultivate your analytical sensibilities and enhance your understanding of public speaking funda-
mentals as you focus on how other rhetors have employed them.

            In this chapter, we outline the principles of public communication analysis and give you the tools to set up a
rhetorical critique. We will focus on the first two of four major steps: identifying an appropriate rhetorical artifact and
reconstructing the artifact's historical context. The next chapter will focus on analyzing the artifact through the final
two steps: describing and interpreting the artifact and evaluating the artifact.

          Box 32.1 Public Communication Analysis Steps
           1. Identify an appropriate rhetorical artifact.
          2. Reconstruct the artifact's historical context.
          3. Describe and interpret the artifact's rhetorical features.
          4. Evaluate the artifact's effects in terms of achieving the rhetor's goals and strengthening democratic

                principles.

Identifying a Rhetorical Artifact

Recall from chapters 30 and 31 that a rhetorical artifact is an object of study in rhetorical criticism. It is a specific
instance of rhetoric that was produced for an audience at a particular time. To begin a public communication analysis,
we recommend you choose an artifact that meets the criteria in box 32.2. We offer these criteria because public com-
munication analysis best illuminates such artifacts. Rhetorical artifacts that more heavily use visual or audio symbols are
typically better suited to different rhetorical methods, such as ideological criticism described in chapters 34 and 35.

          Box 32.2 Guidelines for Selecting an Artifact for Public Communication Analysis
             The artifact should address a significant community concern or issue (i.e., focuses on a problem

                that a community cares about and that carries significant implications for that community's welfare).
             Find an artifact that attempts to persuade an audience (i.e., not a purely informative artifact).
             The artifact should mostly use verbal symbols (i.e., uses more words/speech than images, music,

                etc.).
             The artifact you select should offer a single "voice" or manner of expression. Even if written by a

                group (such as a company), the artifact should express itself as an individual (i.e., the artifact should
                not be a group discussion, dialogue, or online exchange).
             Ideally, you should have a complete transcript of the artifact and, if relevant, access to audio or
                video of the artifact being delivered.

                                                                          Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context | 407
            Recall that in chapter 30, we characterized rhetorical criticism as an act of civic engagement. Using public com-
munication analysis will improve your ability to think critically about public messages, educate fellow members accord-
ingly, and participate in democratic governance. As we explained in chapter 31, these outcomes are more likely, however,
if you choose rhetorical artifacts that pertain to civic affairs (the first criterion in box 32.2) than to, say, a group's hobbies
or interests. Our preference for public speech that addresses significant community concerns aligns with others who
have identified such rhetoric as particularly valuable for democratic participation. Box 32.3 provides examples.

   Box 32.3 Public Speech Should Address Significant Community Concerns and Issues

   Rhetorical practitioners and scholars have often deemed rhetoric that addresses substantive public issues
as essential for maintaining a healthy democracy.

                                                                                           For instance, in 1919 as the Chautauqua

In this and the next chapter, we will focus on President Trump's January 6, 2021, speech as a rhetorical artifact.

We will use it to exemplify the steps of public communication analysis, beginning with explaining why it qualifies as an

appropriate rhetorical artifact.

   408 | Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
   Box 32.4 President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech as a Rhetorical Artifact

   A sample rhetorical artifact that meets the criteria is President Trump's January 6, 2021, speech in Wash-
ington, DC.

     It addressed a significant community concern or issue: the validity and legality of the 2020
        national election.

     Its goal was to persuade: President Trump attempted to convince audiences that the 2020 presi-
        dential election was "stolen" from him and that they needed to "save our democracy" and "take back
        our country."4

     The speech primarily used words to communicate: Trump's vocal and nonverbal delivery are
        important to consider, as is the visual setting and backdrop, but the speech mostly consisted of his
        words.

     It offered a single voice: While it was written with speechwriters (as is typical for speeches by US
        presidents), the final, delivered speech featured Trump's voice and perspective--unlike, say, an inter-
        view that would also include the interviewee's questions and viewpoint.

     It is relatively easy to find a complete transcript and video of the speech online.

Reconstructing the Historical Context

Once you've identified an appropriate rhetorical artifact, you need to reconstruct its historical context. We defined con
text in chapter 31 as the conditions or situation within which rhetoric is produced. In that chapter, we said that con-
text addresses "who, why, what, to whom, when, and where surrounding the rhetoric's production." The answers to
these questions help the critic determine how the context prompted and shaped the rhetoric. In this section, we briefly
explain how learning about the historical context enhances your public communication analysis, and we return to Pres-
ident Trump's January 6, 2021, speech to illustrate.

"Who?"

        Find out what audiences might have known about the rhetor (the "who"). In the previous chapter,
        we expanded the definition of rhetor to include the author(s) or creator(s) of the rhetorical artifact
        under examination. The rhetor's public reputation at the time the artifact was produced, the
        rhetor's position in society, and/or the rhetor's background could have influenced what audiences
        expected from them.

Box 32.5 President Trump as the Rhetor of the January 6, 2021, Speech

   President Trump first became famous in the
United States in the 1980s as a millionaire real
estate mogul, known for his lavish lifestyle and his
1987 book The Art of the Deal, a New York Times
best seller. Starting in 2004, he regularly appeared
on TV's The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice,
which he coproduced and hosted until 2015.

He successfully ran for president (for the

first time) in 2016, using the campaign slogan "Make

America Great Again." During his four-year term,

Trump amassed large groups of supporters--and

critics--for his stances and policies on immigration,  President Donald Trump, U.S. Department of Agriculture via
climate change, transgender people, and the            Rawpixel, Public Domain. Editorial use only.

COVID-19 pandemic and for his granting of pardons, to name a few.

            The 2020 election proved a close race against former Vice President Joe Biden, taking several weeks

for final votes to be tallied and Joe Biden to be declared the winner in both electoral votes (306 to Trump's
232) and the popular vote.5 During the time between that loss and his January 6 speech, Trump and his team

sought to overturn the results through lawsuits and public appearances.

            Therefore, audiences were likely very familiar with Trump when he spoke in early 2021 as a former
real estate mogul and media celebrity and, more recently, as a controversial president.

"Why?" and "What?"

                           Consider what prompted the artifact and the rhetor's goal(s) (the "why") as well as the type of artifact
                           the rhetor created (the "what"). Typically, a rhetor's goals and the artifact itself are responsive to the
                           events, conditions, or forces that prompted the artifact's creation. Knowing the reason or motivat-
                           ing cause for the rhetoric's production, the speaker's goal, and the type of artifact created (including
                           its major characteristics) can help guide your analysis as you look for strategies the rhetor employed
                           to respond to the provocation and attempt to achieve their goal.

   410 | Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
                Why (Prompt): President Trump's January 6, 2021, speech was provoked by the outcome of the 2020
                   national election with Joe Biden being chosen as the forty-sixth president.

                Why (Goal): He hoped to incite enough negative public reaction to convince Republican members of
                   Congress and, especially Vice President Mike Pence, to reject the states' certification of Electoral Col-
                   lege vote counts.6 The joint congressional meeting scheduled for January 6, where Congress would
                   affirm the count, was the last legal step to confirm Biden as president.

                What: Trump delivered in person a nearly seventy-two-minute speech. His presentation addressed
                   numerous subjects. Primarily, though, President Trump claimed the 2020 election results were fraud-
                   ulent. He accused Democrats of committing the fraud and blamed the media for helping them. He
                   promised his supporters that they would rectify the deception with the help of Vice President Mike
                   Pence and other Republicans. Trump encouraged supporters to march to the Capitol to encourage
                   these leaders to overturn the results.

  "To Whom"

   Research the artifact's audiences. Recall that in chapter 10, we differentiated the following:

      direct audience (those who are exposed to and attend to the rhetoric)
      target audience (those the rhetor hopes to reach)
      implied audience (those who are represented in the message)
      implicated audience (those who will be affected by the message if it is successful)

               We also considered whether the audience is

      discrete (limited to those who show up for an event at a particular day and time) or
      dispersed (unlimited by location and/or time).

               Such information can help you later analyze whether and how the artifact was adapted to these audiences. We
   discussed audience analysis and adaptation in chapters 10 and 11.

6. According to the Final Report of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol,
   Trump "pressured Vice President Pence to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6th, falsely claiming that
   he had the power to refuse to count certain electoral votes. President Trump knew this was illegal but attempted to
   justify it with lies about the election." U.S. House of Representatives, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., Final Report of the Select

   Box 32.7 The Audiences for the January 6, 2021, Speech

   President Trump's direct audience included those in the discrete audience who joined his "Save America"
rally in person at the Ellipse, a park near the White House in Washington, DC. His direct audience also
included dispersed viewers who watched the speech live (or later recorded) on C-SPAN or PBS NewsHour.
Trump likely recognized that while he could target his message at supporters, his speech would also be
heard and viewed by critics and advocates of Joe Biden. These Biden supporters, as well as Pence and other
Republican congressional leaders, composed Trump's implied and implicated audiences--those referenced
by his message and impacted if his speech was successful.

"When?"

                              Consider the timing of an artifact
                           (the "when"). Timing includes both
                           the specific date and time for the arti-
                           fact and the time period in which the
                           rhetoric was situated. The latter is
                           important to consider because com-
munities may think and talk about public issues differ-
ently over time as new problems, information, and
perspectives emerge.

6, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. EST. The time period of this speech is important, especially as we look back years later.

His claims about what would or should happen if he was not elected president rang differently in the lead-

up to the 2020 election compared to before the 2024 national election.

            Before the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Trump's encouragement to "take back our country"
or "fight" seemed more like fiery metaphors than literal instructions to inspire voter turnout.

            After the attack, however, Trump's comments sounded more literal since we know what happened

after his speech. The physical attack on the Capitol also colored his later threats--such as at a March 2024

       January 6, such rhetoric sounded more nefarious or potentially threatening (and was criticized as such).
                   Whether you think Trump's rhetoric contributed to the January 6 attack or not, a critic studying

       Trump's January 6 speech would need to differentiate between audience members who heard the speech
       live and audiences who watched a recording of the speech later (after the Capitol attack occurred), since
       their responses might differ accordingly.

"Where?"

Reflect upon an artifact's location (the "where") to help you later analyze how the rhetor adapted
to it. Location can include the following:

   the specific place the rhetor delivered or disseminated the artifact (e.g., the geographic loca-
      tion and/or actual building or street)

   the medium by which the rhetor distributed the artifact (e.g., face-to-face, television,
      YouTube, newspaper, online blog)

All locations pose limitations on and offer opportunities for how a rhetor can most effectively present their message. In
chapter 10, we touched on the environmental factors a speaker must adapt to, such as the time of day, audience size,
and communication medium, and we suggested ways a speaker may adjust to them.

          Box 32.9 The Location of the January 6, 2021, Speech
          The location for President Trump's January 6 speech gave him challenges and opportunities. It's difficult
       to hold a large crowd's attention for long, especially when speaking in person outside on a cold January day.
       At one point, Trump worried, "I hope you don't get bored," and he later acknowledged, "It's freezing out
       here."

                   Trump was also being broadcast, and the rhetorical choices a speaker might make for the immedi-
       ate physical conditions--such as speaking more loudly, talking directly to the immediate crowd, and trying
       to keep them fired up--may not translate well to television viewers who are experiencing the speech differ-
       ently.

                                                                          Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context | 413

physical setting. The Ellipse is a grassy area
between the White House (which could be seen
behind Trump) and the Washington Monument. It
butts into the National Mall and is just a few blocks
from the US Capitol, where Congress would con-
vene one hour after Trump began his speech to
approve the Electoral College's votes. At one point,
Trump even said, "Right over there, right there, we
see the event going to take place." So in addressing
the crowd, Trump could capitalize on their physical
proximity to the Capitol to help stress the urgency
of the moment and the importance of walking to
the building after the speech.

            Reconstructing an artifact's context helps the critic determine whether and how the artifact achieved the
rhetor's goal(s). The context explains the pressures, influences, and/or problems addressed or negotiated through the
artifact, which can enable the critic to better understand how the artifact functioned in that moment. This is also par-
ticularly important when considering the artifact's impact on democratic principles, which we discussed in the previous
chapter. While we can talk about democratic ideals in general or broad terms, a community defines, prioritizes, and
enacts those principles in relation to a specific issue at a particular moment in time.

Box 32.10 Questions to Ask About Historical Context

  What might the audience have known about or expected from the rhetor?
  What prompted the rhetor to produce the artifact?
  What was the rhetor's goal(s) for the artifact?
  What type of artifact did the rhetor produce? What medium did it use?
  Who were the audiences for the artifact, and how did the rhetor need to adapt to them?
  What was the timing of the artifact?
  What was the artifact's location, and what restrictions or opportunities might that have created for

     the rhetor?

            Contextual information informs the critic's analysis of the artifact as they interpret how the artifact was shaped
by and helped shape its context. In the next chapter, we will turn to analyzing the artifact itself by providing instruction
on the next two steps of public communication analysis.

     Summary

414 | Public Communication Analysis: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
   Public communication analysis is an approach to rhetorical criticism that enables you to determine whether
and how a rhetorical artifact achieves its goals and whether and how it strengthens democratic principles. The
approach assumes that rhetoric that addresses public issues should strengthen democracy. This chapter pro-
vided the first two methodological steps necessary to conduct such an analysis.

     You begin by identifying a suitable rhetorical artifact. For public communication analysis, such an arti-
        fact must address a significant community issue or concern and should be persuasive, verbal, and
        expressed in a single voice.

     You then reconstruct the historical context for the artifact by discovering what the audience might
        have known about the rhetor; what prompted the artifact and the rhetor's goal(s); the type of artifact
        developed and its medium; the audience(s) exposed to the artifact, targeted by the artifact, referenced in
        the artifact, and impacted by the artifact if its message succeeds; and the artifact's location and timing.

33. Public Communication Analysis: Description,
Interpretation, and Evaluation

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Describe and interpret a range of rhetorical features in a rhetorical artifact.
          Evaluate the artifact's success or failure in achieving the rhetor's goals and in strengthening or weaken-

             ing democratic principles.

The previous chapter defined public communication analysis as an approach to rhetorical criticism that helps critics
determine a rhetorical artifact's features and ascertain their likely consequences. It guided you through the first two
steps of this rhetorical method: identifying an appropriate rhetorical artifact and reconstructing its historical context.

            In this chapter, we focus on analyzing the artifact itself by describing the next two steps of public communica-
tion analysis. First, we will explain how to describe and interpret an artifact's rhetorical features. Then we will instruct
you on how to evaluate an artifact's functions and consequences, focusing on whether or not the artifact achieved the
rhetor's goals and strengthened democratic principles.

Describing and Interpreting the Rhetorical Features

Public communication analysis begins with description. In chapter 30, we defined description as noticing, identifying,
and explaining a rhetorical artifact's content, form, and absence. In this chapter, we will introduce you to more specific
types of features, from argumentation to delivery. Some of these features focus more on an artifact's content (e.g.,
pathos, ethos) while others emphasize its form (e.g., organization, style), though many features consider both aspects
(e.g., argumentation). You should find, label, and observe each feature with specificity. You should also always ask what
might be missing or absent from the artifact.

            Public communication analysis follows description with interpretation. In chapter 30, we defined interpretation
as making inferences about how an artifact's content, form, and absence function persuasively. Interpretation explores
the artifact's symbolic action, which we defined in that same chapter as the power of symbols to do things--to shape our
thoughts, values, and actions.

            Notice that critics infer interpretations; you can rarely prove your inferences as definitively as you can describe
rhetorical features. For example, you can name an artifact's organizational structure ("Notice how the speech moves
chronologically from past to present to the future"), but you infer how that structure functioned ("By moving chronolog-
ically, the speaker shifted the audience's attention from the past crisis to the more hopeful future, leaving them feeling
more optimistic and comforted").

                                                                          Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 417
             Remember the insight we provided in chapter 30: A critic's interpretations should use active verbs to
          accentuate the symbolic action. If you are not using verbs when interpreting a rhetorical artifact, then you
          are probably still describing, rather than interpreting, its persuasive functions or symbolic action.

             Box 33.1 Describing and Interpreting a Rhetorical Artifact
             For each rhetorical feature,
               find the feature in the artifact,
               describe the feature with specificity, and
               interpret how the feature may have influenced the audience's beliefs, attitudes, or courses of

                  action.

              Not every rhetorical feature you examine will be important or even present in every artifact, but you cannot
  know that until you closely attend to the artifact and determine its central features. We recommend you conduct your
  rhetorical criticism by initially describing and interpreting each element systematically and then deciding which ele-
  ments provide the most important rhetorical insights to share with others.

              We now turn to specific rhetorical features to describe and interpret for your artifact. They include the follow-
  ing: argumentation, appeals to emotions and loyalties, rhetor's credibility, construction of the desired audience, con-
  struction of the undesired audience, organization, style and framing, and delivery. For each, we will explain the feature,
  provide prompting questions for your own description and interpretation, and offer an example.

 Argumentation

  Recall from chapter 26 that an argument is the advocacy of an idea, position, or course of action
  that is supported by evidence. Drawing from Stephen Toulmin's model, we identified the three
  main components of any argument as including a claim, data (evidence), and warrant(justifica-
  tion for using the data to support the claim).1 In chapter 25, we noted that Aristotle considered
  argumentation to be a form of proof he called logos.

                             false dilemma

            Describing an artifact's argumentation does not mean simply restating its main point(s) or message. Rather, it
means doing the following:

   carefully identify the artifact's claims, data, and warrants to determine the type and validity of the argumentation
   note the patterns of reasoning utilized as well as any inclusion of fallacies, which we described in chapter 27 as

      flaws or defects in reasoning that undermine the validity of an argument
   consider whether and how an artifact includes counterarguments to its claims or proposals

Rhetorical criticism requires going beyond merely describing these aspects, however, to interpreting how they may have
persuaded (or failed to persuade) an audience to accept the rhetor's position. Box 33.3 offers questions to help you
describe and interpret your rhetorical artifact's argumentation.

Box 33.3 Questions to Ask About Argumentation

Description

  What claims, data, and warrants did the artifact provide or not provide?
  Did the artifact use valid and sound arguments, or did it make use of fallacies? How so?
  What patterns of reasoning did the artifact include?
  How well did the artifact identify and reasonably respond to counterarguments?

Interpretation

  How might the artifact's claims, data, and warrants have resonated--or failed to resonate--with the
     audience(s), given the historical context?

  How might the argument(s) have persuaded, or failed to persuade, the audience of the speaker's
     viewpoint, given the historical context?

  What kinds of attitudes, values, conclusions, or actions did the argumentation encourage or dis-
     courage?

             Box 33.4 Argumentation in President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech
             In the previous chapter, we turned to President Trump's January 6, 2021, speech to exemplify the criteria
          for an appropriate rhetorical artifact and how to identify its historical context. We return to this artifact in
          this chapter to illustrate how to analyze each rhetorical element. Descriptive labels are bolded, and inter-
          pretations are underlined.

                       In his January 6 speech, President Trump constructed an argument about the 2020 election using
          inductive reasoning. Early in the speech, he made his thesis clear: "Today, I will lay out just some of the evi-
          dence proving that we won this election, and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election." His
          data (evidence) included the three common types of evidence explored in chapter 26: example, statistics,
          and testimony. Trump alleged specific examples of illegal actions in several swing states that resulted in
          fraudulent votes for Biden, cited numerous statistics for ballots illegally counted against him in those
          states, and occasionally integrated testimony, mostly from unnamed people like a "real pollster," "eyewit-
          ness testimony," and "a career employee" of Detroit. Indeed, Trump provided no sources for his examples
          and statistics of fraud, and most of his sources for testimony were vague references ("people," "an eyewit-
          ness," "a real pollster," "poll watchers," "a career employee" of Detroit).

                       By inundating listeners with multiple forms of apparent evidence and repeatedly referring to them
          as "the facts," Trump created the impression of validity and truth. He encouraged the audience to accept his
          inductive conclusion that, based on the numerous instances he named, he easily won the election and that
          Democrats were lying and "stealing" the election for Joe Biden.

                       This claim, however, required the audience to place tremendous trust in Trump to have ethically
          researched the topic and presented his findings--a trust undercut by many legal decisions. By January 6,
          2021, the Trump administration, lawyers, and supporters had presented their evidence in courts to support
          lawsuits to overturn the election; they lost sixty-one cases and won one.2 Indeed, the House of Representa-
          tives Committee that later investigated the US Capitol attack concluded that Trump had been made aware
          by this point that his claims of fraud were baseless but persisted anyway with the "Big Lie," making false
          claims "more than 100 times during his [January 6] speech."3

lacies, including false dilemma. He offered listeners only two possible outcomes
based on whether they accepted or rejected his thesis that he won the election.
Acceptance would "save our democracy" while rejection means "our country will
be destroyed." Such a false dilemma appeared as reasoning but actually played,
instead, on American's feelings for their country. It also ignored additional possible
outcomes, such as helping save the country by rejecting his attempt to alter official
election results.

            Thus, in place of sound argumentation, valid reasoning, and verifiable evidence, Trump's speech
made points that sounded like arguments but offered falsehoods instead.

Appeals to Emotions and Loyalties

                                    Rhetorical artifacts typically appeal to the audience's emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness) and
                                    loyalties (e.g., liberty, family), or what Aristotle called pathos. As we explained in chapter 25,
                                    pathos is concerned with the psychological state of the audience; it is a measure and reflec-
                                    tion of the extent to which we are moved by and feel invested in a topic and a message.

                                                Describing an artifact's appeals to emotions and loyalties means that you identify

                                 the specific emotions and/or loyalties elicited by the artifact and
                                 how the rhetor appealed to these emotions and loyalties.

            You then interpret how the pathos appeals functioned persuasively. Infer how soliciting particular emotions and
loyalties may have aided (or hurt) the rhetor's goal, such as by

   relating pleasurable feelings and allegiances with the rhetor's position or
   associating painful emotions and the disloyalties the audience rejects with counterproposals, a standing policy, or

      a problem (as described in chapter 25).

            You might also pay attention to the balance or imbalance of positive and negative appeals to emotions and loy-
alties as well as to the balance or imbalance of these appeals with argumentation. Recognizing an artifact's extensive
reliance on fear appeals, for example, may indicate that a rhetor attempted to frighten the audience into accepting their
position.

                ested in the message--or failed to do so?

             What did the rhetor gain or lose from the emphasis or de-emphasis on appeals to emotion and
                audience loyalties?

             How did the emotional appeals focus the audience(s)' attention? Toward what? Away from what,
                given the historical context?

          Box 33.6 Pathos in President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech
          In his January 6 speech, President Trump elicited pleasurable feelings of pride and
       the loyalties of patriotism and democracy by praising "the magnitude of this crowd"
       and calling his audience "patriots" who "love our country," "do not want to see our
       election victory stolen," and want "to save our democracy." Trump's language--magni-
       tude, patriots, victory, democracy, save--instilled feelings of righteousness and confi
       dence in rejecting the election results. He lamented that "weak" Republicans like Mike
       Pence lacked such "courage and guts." He ended his speech by encouraging his audi-
       ence to walk to the Capitol and give the "weak" Republicans the same "pride and boldness that they need to
       take back our country." He implied that insufficient feelings of courage and pride were what prevented con
       gressional leaders from rejecting the Electoral College votes.

                   Trump paired such appeals with painful feelings of anger, outrage, and even
       hate. His very first sentence--"The media will not show the magnitude of this
       crowd"--immediately expressed outrage at the "fake news media" for allegedly refusing
       to show the audience's size. He associated the news media with the disloyalty of com-
       munism, comparing their "suppression" with "what happens in a communist country."
       He went on to accuse Democrats of "stealing" the election by "cheating," stoking anger
       at the election outcome and hatred toward the opposing political party.

                   By pairing such extreme and antithetical emotions (pride and shame, love and hate) and loyalties
       (democracy and communism), Trump left little room for Republican supporters to accept the election
       results. To do so was to no longer love your country and to side with despicable criminals and even commu-
       nism. He also amplified the magnitude of Congress's January 6 meeting as a historical moment in the battle
       between courage and shame: "We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or

422 | Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eter-
nity, they'll be ashamed."

            This showdown of feelings corresponded closely to the false dilemma analyzed earlier as part of
logos, revealing that Trump's speech emphasized feelings over sound argumentation and verifiable facts.
Trump implied that the crowd might help these leaders choose the "courage" to deny the election. He
encouraged his audience to demonstrate the "strength" of their feelings to congressional members,
"because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be
strong."

Rhetor's Credibility

A third feature typically found in rhetorical artifacts are appeals to credibility, or what Aristotle
called ethos. In chapter 5, you learned that ethos refers to the state of a rhetor's public character
or persona. This definition should draw your attention to the rhetor's credibility as a rhetorical
creation. That means the following:

   Analyzing ethos involves examining how the artifact presented the rhetor as a character that
      the audience(s) would perceive as credible.

   Although a rhetor's previous reputation plays a role in this perception, the critic is more interested in how an arti-
      fact strengthens, modifies, or builds the rhetor's credibility through the public message under examination. Beginning
      critics can make the mistake of merely explaining a rhetor's prior reputation without examining the artifact itself.

Box 33.7 Credibility in President Obama's July 19, 2012, Speech

   President Obama addressed the nation on July 19,
2012, a few days after George Zimmerman was
found not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin. Zim-
merman, a neighborhood watch coordinator for his
Sanford, Florida, community, fatally shot Martin, a
seventeen-year-old African American boy who was
walking home through the neighborhood.

            Saying Obama had credibility when speak-  [President Barack Obama] by David Lienemann via

persona he emphasized in the speech as an African
American man: "Trayvon Martin could have been
me 35 years ago....There are very few African Amer-
ican men in this country who haven't had the expe-

Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 423
          rience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me."4 Looking to the
          speech for ethos reveals that Obama drew upon his personal experience as an African American man and
          as a member of the African American community to depict himself as an authoritative source on race con
          flicts.

               As box 33.7 exemplifies, you must specifically describe what kind of credibility or persona the rhetor attempted
   to construct within the artifact being analyzed and how that credibility was developed. In chapters 5 and 25, we suggested
   rhetors typically try to establish their credibility in terms of one or more qualities:5

      competence (expertise, preparation, intelligence)
      trustworthiness (moral standing, integrity)
      goodwill (having the audience's best interests at heart)
      dynamism (charisma).

   Rhetors may use a variety of rhetorical means to establish any of these qualities, including but not limited to all the
   other rhetorical features highlighted in this chapter: argumentation, appeals to emotions and loyalties, construction of
   the audience and the other, organization, style, and delivery.

                What overall impression did the rhetor attempt to create for themselves?

              Box 33.9 Credibility in President Trump's January 6, 2021 Speech
              In his speech, President Trump developed at least three types of credibility through a variety of rhetorical
           features:
                Competence: His reference to multiple examples and statistics cultivated the impression that he

                   was well researched on election fraud; he even claimed that "nobody, until I came along, had any idea
                   how corrupt our elections were."
                Goodwill: His expression of outrage, along with praise for advances made by his presidential admin-
                   istration, suggested he wanted what was best for the country.
                Dynamism: His use of humor and coarse language--such as "They're all running around like chick-
                   ens with their heads cut off....Nobody knows what the hell is going on"--suggested a gregarious and
                   straight-talking personality.

                       Together, these three qualities--competence, goodwill, and dynamism--presented Trump as a
           forceful spokesperson against the election results, helping cultivate some audience members' trust in his
           claims and evidence.

                       Of course, these very rhetorical appeals also hurt Trump's ethos in the eyes of critics and those
           who acknowledged the courts' decisions against his claims of fraud. His use of unverified evidence weak-
           ened perceptions of his competence, his outrage at the election results reflected someone willing to hurt
           the country's democratic process, and his coarse manner of speaking reflected someone unfit for the presi-
           dency.

  Construction of the Desired Audience

                                    In addition to analyzing how an artifact developed the rhetor's credibility, you can also examine
                                 how it constructed the desired audience. You might think of the desired audience as another char
                                 acter the artifact constructs, similar to how it develops the rhetor's own persona. In chapter 11, we
                                 explained that through speech, a rhetor can offer a vision of a desired audience--that is, of an audi-
                                 ence that does not yet exist. That vision may emphasize key qualities and attitudes the rhetor
                                 wishes actual audience members to adopt. It might also attempt to unite listeners into an idealized
                                 community for a better future.6

          Box 33.11 Construction of the Desired Audience in President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech
          President Trump developed two different desired audiences in his January 6 speech.

                   First, he presented a desired audience of Republican leaders who would reject the Electoral Col
       lege votes to overturn the election results. He particularly identified Vice President Mike Pence as becom-
       ing part of this group:

426 | Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
            I hope Mike is going to do the right thing....I
hope so, because if Mike Pence does the right thing,
we win the election....All Vice President Pence has to
do is send it [the electoral vote tally] back to the
states to recertify, and we become president, and
you are the happiest people." Trump also included in
this desired audience currently "weak" Republicans
who needed to become "strong" by supporting this
effort: "So we're going to walk down Pennsylvania
Avenue...to try and give our Republicans, the weak
ones, because the strong ones don't need any of our
help, we're going to try and give them the kind of
pride and boldness that they need to take back our
country.

This desired audience functioned as not just an

invitation to but also pressure on Republican leaders to

execute Trump's wishes to remain in the good graces of

Trump and his supporters. For politicians, the fear of los-

ing public support--and thus their political office--was

real and ongoing.                                            Mike Pence by Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia

supporters who would give these Republicans the

"courage" to reject the election results. This audience consisted of true "American patriots" who would

remain committed, together, to "stop the steal" because they "cannot take it anymore." Trump frequently

constructed this audience with "we": "We will never give up. We will never concede." "We're gathered

together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: to save our democ-

racy." Trump constructed this desired audience as victims of the "fake news media," "big tech," Democrats,

and many others who conspired to "steal" the election for Joe Biden. Rather than give in or admit defeat,

Trump's desired audience would remain banded together with Trump to buoy Republican congressional

leaders to overturn the election results.

            This desired audience functioned as a savvy adaptation to Trump's target audience. Trump's sup-
porters likely felt defeated and deeply disappointed by the election outcome--even confused by it. Trump's
vision offered a clear action they could take (walk to the Capitol) to remain on the winning side and over-
come their sense of victimization.

  Construction of the Undesired Audience

                               Yet another rhetorical feature you can examine is how the artifact constructed the undesired audi-
                               ence. This is the audience the rhetorical artifact negates by denying or dismissing their relevance or
                               existence.7 Artifacts typically construct an undesirable audience in one of two ways:

                            First, they may silence a group by failing to include them, even though that audience is directly
                               affected by the artifact. (We referred to this group in chapter 10 as the implicated audience.)

               A history textbook that relates the United States' westward expansion without ever referencing the perspec-
         tives of Native American peoples, for example, negates these groups' existence and silences their voices, thereby
         making them an undesired audience.

      Second, a rhetorical artifact may construct an undesired audience by characterizing it negatively, typically associ-
         ating the person or group with the "characteristics, roles, actions, or ways of seeing things to be avoided," making
         the undesired audience the opposite or flipside of the rhetor's desired audience.8 (We referred in chapter 10 to
         groups spoken for as the implied audience.)

               If the history textbook referenced earlier included Native Americans in its explanation of the United States'
   westward expansion but presented a racist depiction of them as bloodthirsty, unreasonable, and uncivilized, then it
   would negate the Native Americans' human existence by portraying them as animalistic and, thus, undesirable--pos-
   sibly in contrast to the qualities ascribed to the white settlers. Of course, just like the rhetor's credibility and desired
   audience, the undesired audience is a rhetorical construction that does not necessarily bear resemblance to the actual
   existing group it represents.

               Recognizing undesired audiences can help you discover how artifacts rationalize favored positions, foster unity
   among the desired audience by creating a common enemy, or discourage the adoption of alternative perspectives.

              Box 33.12 Questions to Ask About the Undesired Audience
              Description

                Whose perspective or voice, if any, was missing from the artifact that could or should have been
                   included?

                Who was the "they," "them," "he," or "she" the artifact associated with negative qualities?
                What negative qualities, actions, or viewpoints did the artifact associate with the undesired audi-

                   ence?
                How did the artifact relate the desired audience with the undesired audience? Typically, they are

                   presented as opposites. How did the artifact offer such a construction, or what other kind of relation-
                   ship did it build?

7. This rhetorical feature is based on the concept and theory of the "third persona" as developed by Phillip Wander, "The
   Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory," Central States Speech Journal 35 (1984): 210.

             What attitudes and actions might the construction of the undesired audience have attempted to

                rationalize or encourage (or debunk/discourage)?
             What type of community did the undesired audience help unify (against it) or define?
             How did the construction of the undesired audience possibly mobilize actual listeners to adopt

                qualities of the desired audience?

          Box 33.13 Construction of the Undesired Audience in President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech
          In his January 6 speech, Trump used negative characterizations to construct an undesired audience con-
       sisting of the "fake news media," "big tech," "radical left Democrats," and many others. He depicted these
       groups as wanting to "steal" the election. The news media and "big tech" "suppress[ed]" thought and speech
       and downplayed the size and success of Trump and his supporters. After "years" of getting "away with elec-
       tion fraud" and enacting poor policies, Democrats "us[ed] the pretext of the China virus and the scam of
       mail-in ballots [to]...attempt the most brazen and outrageous election theft." Trump also included in this
       undesired audience any "weak" Republicans who allowed Democrats to succeed.

                   In so doing, Trump presented all groups who might oppose, counter, or hold Trump accountable as
       detestable, representing the worst elements of society and driven by widely rejected vices: personal greed,
       unchecked power, and corruption. This portrayal attempted to justify their undoing through an overwhelm-
       ing and outraged public response.

Organization

An artifact's organization can also be a useful feature to analyze. The ordering of points or argu-
ments--what Aristotle called arrangement--can do the following:

   Reveal the rhetor's logic or way of thinking. In chapter 13, we explained that patterns of
      arrangement depict common ways of thinking.

   Identify the rhetor's presumptions about the audience: as knowledgeable or ignorant about
      the topic and as favorable, apathetic, or hostile toward the rhetor's thesis.

   Suggest what the rhetor deemed important or unimportant, based on the amount of time or space the rhetor
      devotes to each topic, reason, emotion, and so forth.

            One of the best ways to determine the artifact's organization--especially its pattern of arrangement--is to cre-
ate an outline of the artifact, noting its main points and sections. Doing that will help you avoid the mistake of simply
restating what the rhetor said in the order they said it: "She started by saying...then she claimed...and she ended by con-
cluding that..." Notice that such statements do not describe or interpret the artifact; they merely summarize or restate
it.

                                                                         Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 429
               Once you identify an artifact's pattern of arrangement, you can interpret how the organization took the audi-
   ence on a rhetorical journey. Infer how each part of the artifact, starting with its beginning, may have shaped or influ-
   enced how the audience received what came next in the artifact; how that section of the artifact then affected how the
   audience received what followed; and so on until the artifact concludes.

                                                Such rhetorical movement is like what rhetoric scholar Stephen Lucas has called the
                                    textual context, which is the evolving environment created within an artifact that conditions the
                                    audience's responses to the artifact from its beginning to its ending. Lucas explains that "a text
                                    [artifact] creates its own internal context as it unfolds in time and is processed by the listener or
                                    reader."9 The textual context is quite different from how we used the word "context" earlier in
                                    this chapter, for textual context exists entirely within the artifact itself. It forces the critic to
                                    infer how the structure may have impacted the audience's reaction to the text because of the
   organization. It prevents organization from being undervalued by suggesting that how a rhetor moves strategically from
   the beginning to the end of the artifact matters.

                What parts of the artifact received the most emphasis or time? The least?

                How might the artifact's structure have impacted audiences' impressions of the topic/issue?
                Why might the rhetor have chosen the structure, given the historical context?

                                          President Trump's speech at first seems to be organized a little like stream-of-con-
                                       sciousness, jumping from idea to idea. After a more careful inspection, however, the
                                       speech appears to come closest to the nonlinear pattern of a star. We explained in
                                       chapter 13 that a star pattern provides multiple main points--like the tips of a
                                       star--that may appear disparate from one another, but all support the thesis.

                                                   Interestingly, Trump's speech emphasized five main points that focused on
                                       the problem (the election result was fraudulent, and the news media are suppressing
       that information) and the solution (we will stop the steal, but Mike Pence and other Republicans need to
       reject the electoral vote count, which is why we need to march to the Capitol and give them the courage to
       do that). These points made logical sense together and supported the thesis, "We will `stop the steal.' Today,
       I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election, and we won it by a landslide."

                   In a star pattern, one main point is typically focused upon and developed at a time, though the
       ordering of main points can be altered for different audiences and situations. In his speech, however, Trump
       frequently moved back and forth among the five main points in various orders. That gave it the feeling of
       stream-of-consciousness as he bounced from one point to the other in no predictable pattern. By doing so,
       Trump could speak in a somewhat impromptu manner, which some might have interpreted as more authen
       tic and engaging than reading a manuscript speech, while also emphasizing his thesis and main points.
       Indeed, the five main points became so interrelated that the structure may have helped audience members
       remember each point. However, speakers who repeatedly shift from point to point run the risk of sounding
       disorganized, appearing frenetic or undisciplined, and boring the audience through repetition.

Style and Framing

                                   We defined style in chapter 16 as language or expression. You are already analyzing an artifact's
                                   style when you consider the rhetorical features previously discussed. To enhance your analysis
                                   of an artifact's style, however, you can attend to at least three additional aspects of an artifact.

                                               First, examine the level or type of language the artifact employed. You might describe
                                   the simplicity or complexity of the language (e.g., folksy versus grandiloquent), the informality
                                   or formality of the style (e.g., colloquial versus learned), or even the type of voice--manner of
                                   expression--it reflects (e.g., lawyerly, sermonic, motherly, etc.). Then interpret how these
                                   choices may have shaped the audiences' impressions of the rhetor, the audiences themselves
(how they were addressed), and the topic or issue.
            Second, consider the stylistic devices the artifact employs. Recall from chapter 16 that such devices are language
techniques and literary tools that clarify meaning, express ideas in a compelling manner, and appeal emotionally to an
audience. Identifying and describing these devices can aid you in interpreting how the artifact used them to create a
sense of rhythm, encourage visualization, enhance argumentation, or develop a sense of community.
            Finally, analyze the artifact's persuasive framing of the issue addressed. In chapters 21 and 25, we defined fram-
ing as the use of language to order and make sense of the world. We explained that framing is how we employ language
to help shape perceptions of reality. Use guidance in chapter 25 to describe and interpret how the rhetor framed the
problem and its cause (i.e., who's to blame) in ways that appear worthy to the audience and logically set up the desired
solution.
            Analyzing how an artifact framed the issue enables you to determine how its presentation of the problem

                                                                          Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 431
matched, or failed to reflect, the actual issue that prompted the artifact (the "why" in the historical context). Drawing
from chapter 25, you can also consider whether the framing appears to be an honest attempt to persuade the audience
to adopt the rhetor's solution or a potentially dishonest effort to win supporters by intentionally confusing the audi-
ence's understanding of the issue.

             How well or poorly did the artifact's persuasive framing reflect the issue that motivated the artifact?

                How did the framing relate to (or contrast with) alternative framings of the same issue at the time?
          Interpretation
             How might the artifact's style and framing have shaped audiences' impressions of the issue? How

                might those impressions have encouraged audiences to adopt the rhetor's perspective (or not)?
             How did the stylistic devices create a sense of rhythm, encourage visualization, enhance argumen-

                tation, or develop a sense of community?
             How did the style and framing complement or contradict the other rhetorical features, such as

                argumentation, appeals to emotion, and the desired and undesired audiences?

          Box 33.17 Framing and Style in President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech
          President Trump's framing of the election explicitly defined the problem, its cause, and the solution. As
       mentioned previously, he identified the problem as mass election fraud; the causes as Democrats' corrup-
       tion, the news media's suppression efforts, and "weak" Republicans' failures to respond; and the solution as
       supporters' pressure on Republican leaders to overturn the election results.

                   This framing dishonestly diverted attention from the actual problem--Trump lost the election--to
       an invented problem of election fraud. That diversion whipped his supporters into outrage and action
       instead of acceptance and contemplation. Trump's framing also left somewhat unclear what that action or
       their pressure on Congress should look like. Trump encouraged rally attendees to "walk" and "march" to the
       Capitol and even once said "to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard." Yet his framing empha-
       sized the causes of the fraud as so despicable, coordinated, and strong that peacefully marching and
       protesting would be an insufficient solution, leaving open the possibility that supporters might need to
       escalate their response.

                                                       that escalation. Trump drew heavily on the stylistic

                                                       device of metaphor. One of his most heavily used

                                                       metaphors likened the election results to theft:

                                                       "You don't concede when there's theft involved."

                                                       "Democrats attempted the most brazen and outra-

                                                       geous election theft. There's never been anything

                                                       like this. It's a pure theft in American history." "They

                                                       want to steal the election." "We must stop the steal."

                                                       "This is a criminal enterprise." By likening the

                                                       results to a crime, Trump's metaphor depicted him

                                                       nefarious lawbreakers; thus, they were justified in

defending and retrieving what was rightfully and legally theirs.

How they might do that was informed by a

second popular metaphor in Trump's speech: Their

response was like a physical fight. Trump

instructed, "And we fight. We fight like hell and if

you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a

country anymore." He characterized the Republi-

cans who objected to the results as "warriors" who

were "fighting. The House guys are fighting." He

criticized the "weak" Republicans who "are con-

stantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied

behind his back. It's like a boxer, and we want to be

so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody,     Image by Lee Murry via Pixabay, Pixabay Content License.
including bad people. And we're going to have to

fight much harder." Through this metaphor, Trump likened their response to an unrestrained physical

assault that was both required and justified to win. Some supporters took this metaphor literally.

Delivery

To analyze a rhetor's delivery of an artifact, you must have access to an audio or visual recording.
In chapter 17, we defined delivery as the actual means of expression: "It is how a speaker physi-
cally conveys words and ideas, verbally and nonverbally, to the audience." You can describe a
rhetor's

   vocal delivery (how the voice and mouth are used to deliver words),
   nonverbal delivery (how the body is used to communicate),
   televisual delivery (how a speech is presented through a screen), and
   use of memory (how one stores and recalls the information shared in a speech).

                                                                         Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 433
            You should then interpret how the rhetor's delivery functioned persuasively, given the historical context. As
explained in chapter 17, delivery is situational; its effectiveness depends on the rhetor's ability to adjust to situational
factors (e.g., occasion, purpose, audience composition, and size) and conditions and constraints (e.g., distance from the
audience, use of a camera, the arrangement of the speaking platform or lectern, etc.). You can identify the delivery
choices the rhetor made for their speaking situation and infer whether and how they met the demands of that situation
to achieve their persuasive goal.

          Box 33.18 Questions to Ask About Delivery
          Description

             How would you characterize the rhetor's vocal delivery in terms of their volume, tone, rate, pauses,
                articulation, pronunciation, and vocal fillers?

             How would you characterize the rhetor's nonverbal delivery in terms of their eye contact, facial
                expressions, gestures and movement, and appearance?

             If the artifact was delivered through a screen, how would you characterize the rhetor's use of, or
                adaptation to, the camera's framing, angle, and distance; the lighting and background; and the cam-
                era's movement or steadiness?

             How did the rhetor adjust their delivery to suit the historical context, or how did they fail to do so?
             What mode of delivery did the rhetor adopt (extemporaneous, memorized, impromptu, manu-

                script)?
          Interpretation

             How might the rhetor's delivery have influenced audiences' impressions of the rhetor? How might
                those impressions have compared or differed if audiences watched in person or via a screen?

             How might the rhetor's delivery have aided or hurt their attempt to persuade their audiences?
             How did the rhetor's delivery complement or distract from the artifact's other rhetorical features?

          Box 33.19 Delivery of President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech
          President Trump's speech delivery appeared to strengthen his claims by depicting him as presidential.
       Dressed in a black, long overcoat with a white collared shirt and red tie, he looked presidential. The setting
       helped. His podium featured the presidential seal, American flags waved in the breeze on either side of him
       onstage (and in the camera's frame), and the White House was easily visible behind him. The stage placed
       him physically above audience members, reflecting his power over them.

                   His nonverbal delivery was restrained. He remained standing behind a podium. He frequently ges
       tured to underscore his points, such as shrugging his shoulders, pointing at the crowd, or dropping his hand
       with specific words. But his gestures were made fairly close to his body. His vocal tone and volume stayed
       rather consistent, with only occasional vocal emphases on particular words or phrases. While the speech
       was scripted and teleprompter screens stood on both sides of him, Trump appeared to mostly look out at
       the crowd and cameras. He paused occasionally when the crowd cheered or chanted.

434 | Public Communication Analysis: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
                        Consequently, Trump's delivery depicted a man who was--and was ready to remain--the US presi
            dent. He talked directly to the people as their leader and their choice.

  Evaluating the Rhetorical Artifact

                                Once you have systematically described and interpreted your artifact for features such as the ones
                                listed previously, you can judge the artifact's functions and consequences. Focus on whether the
                                artifact successfully achieved the rhetor's goals (or not) and strengthened or weakened democratic
                                principles. We will discuss both assessments in turn.

  Did the Artifact Achieve the Rhetor's Goals? Why or Why Not?

    You should judge if and why the artifact achieved the rhetor's goals. Use
       your research and understanding of the historical context (i.e., evidence from outside sources) and
       your description and interpretations of the rhetorical features (i.e., evidence from the artifact)

    to argue how the artifact helped the rhetor achieve their goals or why they fell short.
                Of course, determining success can be complicated. What counts as success, with what audience, and how

    quickly must it occur? As a critic, you must decide and ultimately argue how to define success or failure for the artifact,
    given its context.

               Speech scholar W. Norwood Brigance claimed, "The success of any speech is determined, not by whether
            it carries the day, but by how far it moves toward that goal."10

               Box 33.20 Evaluation of Whether President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech Achieved His Goals

enforcement officers were injured, five people died

damages was done to the Capitol, and congres-                Image by Sherrod Brown via Wikimedia Commons, Public

sional leaders had to end their meeting suddenly
and be escorted by police to safe hiding spaces.13

According to NPR, "The FBI has estimated that around 2,000 people took part in criminal acts on Jan. 6," and
they continued to investigate and make arrests through 2024.14

            Did Trump's January 6 speech cause the Capitol attack? On the one hand, the answer is no. The
attack started before his speech ended, and most people who walked to the Capitol did not directly engage
in violence or enter the building. He never told his audience to enter the building or attack congressional
leaders or Capitol police officers.

On the other hand, the answer is yes. His speech contributed to his previous rhetoric that encour-

            aged supporters to travel to Washington, DC, to stop congressional leaders, especially Pence, from certify-
            ing the votes. He whipped up his audience's outrage through false evidence and fallacies as well as contrasts
            of love and hate. He depicted the encounter as a showdown between patriots and enemies and encouraged
            his supporters to "fight" the "thieves" to "save" the country. Such rhetoric overly simplified the situation and
            downplayed the weighty implications of attempting to overturn a democratic election.

                        While Trump did not overtly tell the crowd to attack the Capitol, he stoked feelings and beliefs that
            helped justify such violence. As one professor noted for the BBC, "He clearly knew there were people in that
            crowd who were ready to and intended to be violent, and he certainly did nothing to discourage that. He not
            only did nothing to discourage it, he strongly hinted it should happen."15 Several investigations made a simi-
            lar conclusion, resulting in Congress impeaching Trump for a second time and the Justice Department
            indicting him on four counts, including the "Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceed-
            ing."16

                        Trump's speech failed to fulfill his ultimate goal of overturning the 2020 election results. Congress
            reconvened the following day to finish their certification of the Electoral College votes, officially confirming
            Joe Biden's election victory as the forty-sixth US president.

  Did the Artifact Strengthen or Weaken Democratic Principles? How?

    In addition to assessing the artifact's ability or failure to achieve the rhetor's goals, public communication analysis
    requires you to also consider the artifact's impact on democratic principles.

How Did the Artifact Indirectly Support or Hurt Democratic Principles?

An artifact can strengthen democracy indirectly by modeling or practicing democratic principles. Any artifact that quali-
fies as responsible public discourse, for instance, reinforces democratic principles. Recall in chapter 4 we defined respon-
sible public discourse as public communication that draws on the qualities of productive discourse to produce a more
inclusive and equitable public sphere. It may or may not be polite or civil. Alternatively, some artifacts indirectly weaken
democratic principles by practicing irresponsible public communication that uses the qualities of unproductive dis-
course and restricts the public sphere in inequitable ways.

            A rhetorical artifact may fall along a sliding scale between strengthening and weakening democratic principles.
Most artifacts probably improve some principles and hurt others. Clearly, the more ways a single artifact strengthens
democratic principles, the better. You will need to decide in which direction your artifact tends by paying close attention
to the artifact's rhetorical features and historical context.

   Box 33.21 Evaluation of the Effects of President Trump's January 6, 2021, Speech on Democratic Princi
ples

   President Trump's speech directly hurt democratic principles. Though he claimed to "save our democ-
racy," his speech called to overturn a democratic election. That directly violated such principles as the rule
of law, the importance of the common good in balance with personal gain, and the accountability of officials
and public leaders to the will of the people.

            Trump's speech also indirectly weakened democracy by making heavy use of division, dichotomous
thinking, certainty, combativeness, and winning and by attempting to restrict valid voters to those Ameri-
cans who voted for him.

Summary

   This chapter provided the final steps necessary to conduct a public communication analysis. After identifying
a suitable rhetorical artifact and reconstructing its historical context, you should continue to analyze the arti-
fact itself:

     You describe and interpret several rhetorical features, including argumentation, appeals to emotions
        and loyalties, the rhetor's credibility, the desired audience, the undesired audience, organization, style
        and framing, and delivery.

     You next make two types of judgments about the artifact, using what you learned from the historical
        context and rhetorical features. You evaluate whether the artifact was successful or failed to achieve the
        rhetor's goals, recognizing the need to argue for what counts as success or failure. You also judge
        whether the artifact strengthened or weakened democratic principles by considering the principles the
        artifact attempted to directly reinforce (or violate) and indirectly practiced or modeled (or failed to do so).

     Discussion Questions

         1. Which of the rhetorical features seems most important to analyze? How should you decide which to
             focus on or to include when sharing your work?

        2. What kinds of evidence best support a critic's interpretations of an artifact's rhetorical features? How
             does a critic know when their inferences are right? How should we judge the merit of a critic's interpre-
             tations, especially when two critics disagree about how a rhetorical feature functioned?

        3. How can you ever really make judgments about an artifact's success or failure or impact on democratic

34. Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and
Historical Context

Chapter Objectives

Students will:

  Identify a rhetorical artifact suitable for ideological criticism.
  Reconstruct the historical context for the rhetorical artifact.

At the center of ideological criticism is ideology. When you hear that word, what comes to mind? Perhaps you associate

it with ideas or beliefs, like those shared by a group. Maybe you think about the kinds of beliefs and values that drive

extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan or Antifa. Or maybe your mind goes to the most recent political conflict between

Democrats and Republicans as a clash of ideologies. Or perhaps you're simply unsure what to think.

In this chapter, we define an ideology as a set of shared beliefs and values that forms an interpretation of the

world and suggests appropriate ways to act in it. We all adopt ideologies--not just extremists or political actors. In fact,

ideologies are so plentiful and common that we often overlook their influence in our everyday lives. That's where ideo-

logical criticism can be useful. Ideological criticism is a method of rhetorical criticism that exposes the ideology com-

municated by a rhetorical artifact and interprets how the artifact uses the ideology to exercise power and control.

Ideological criticism aids democratic participation in several ways. It allows you to notice and think critically

about communication. That includes recognizing how an artifact expands or contracts civil liberties. When you discover

artifacts that restrict participation, ideological criticism provides you the ability to resist and even produce artifacts to

counter that work. We'll more fully explain each of these benefits.

First, by making ideologies visible in rhetorical artifacts, ideological criticism enables you to thoughtfully

respond to such messages. Without conducting ideological analysis, you are less likely to notice an artifact's ideological

functions but just as likely to be influenced by them. Ideological criticism helps you recognize and investigate an artifact's

ideological work.

                                                                     Second, ideological criticism can illuminate how

                                                             some artifacts communicate ideologies that limit democ-

                                                             ratic participation. For instance, a Black rhetor--a

                                                             speaker, singer, or public figure--in the 1950s had few

                                                             opportunities to participate civically due to the prevailing

                                                             societal ideology of racial segregation (i.e., racism). That

                                                             ideology was promoted in numerous artifacts at the time

                                                             (films, novels, speeches, etc.). Consequently, ideological

                                                             criticism can sensitize us to see which artifacts con-

mote ideological messages that inhibit democracy. We
can even produce our own rhetorical artifacts that com-
municate counterideologies that expand and strengthen
democratic principles and enhance community engage-
ment.

            In this chapter, we will walk you through the first
two steps of conducting an ideological critique of your
own rhetorical artifact: identifying an appropriate artifact
and reconstructing the artifact's historical context. The
next chapter continues with three more steps: describing
the artifact's ideological message, interpreting how the
artifact uses the ideology to exercise power and control,
and evaluating how the ideology strengthens or weakens
democratic principles.

Box 34.1 Ideological Criticism Steps

1. Identify an appropriate rhetorical artifact.
2. Reconstruct the artifact's historical context.
3. Describe the artifact's ideological message.
4. Interpret how the artifact uses ideology to exercise power and control.
5. Evaluate how the artifact's ideology strengthens or weakens democratic principles.

Identifying a Rhetorical Artifact

The first step of ideological critique is to identify an appropriate rhetorical artifact. Recall from chapters 30 and 31 that
a rhetorical artifact is an object of study in rhetorical criticism. It is a specific instance of rhetoric that was produced for
an audience at a particular time.

            Expressions of ideology pervade nearly every aspect of human society; they are present in our social and reli-
gious rituals, our political lives, our intellectual commitments, our economic choices, and our forms of entertainment.
This means you might find rich artifacts among advertisements, popular music, social media posts, video games, or
political cartoons--just to name a few possibilities.

            We have found, though, that artifacts best served by ideological criticism tend to meet the criteria in box 34.2.

          Box 34.2 Guidelines for Selecting an Artifact

442 | Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
             Uses verbal, nonverbal, visual, or audio symbols--or a combination.
             Elevates or challenges a common way of seeing the world.

             May be familiar to your audience, but your audience has not reflected on its ideological assump

                tions.

Uses Verbal, Nonverbal, Visual, and/or Audio Symbols

An appropriate rhetorical artifact for ideological criticism can use any combination of verbal, nonverbal, visual, and
audio symbols (movies, television episodes, songs, viral videos, commercials, etc.).

Elevates or Challenges a Common Way of Seeing the World

A second criterion to consider for ideological criticism is finding an artifact that elevates or challenges a common way
of seeing the world (or both!). Let's briefly consider each possibility.

Elevates

Many artifacts elevate widely held sets of values and beliefs. Sometimes that ideological work is hard to notice, however,
because we've become blind to it. Think, for example, of the video game that reinforces militarism or a music video that
upholds heteronormativity. Push yourself to observe how everyday artifacts might promote ideological messages.

Challenges

Some artifacts challenge common ways of seeing the world by calling them into question. These may be easier to notice
because they "call out" a widely held perspective, such as the example in box 34.3.

          Box 34.3 An Artifact That Challenges a Common Way of Seeing the World

                                                                                         Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context | 443
          Have you seen the pilot episode of AMC's 2021
       television series Kevin Can F**K Himself? It first
       appears to be a typical sitcom: Kevin McRoberts
       and his friends are in a brightly lit living room
       where they tease his wife Allison while we hear
       canned laughter. However, when Allison leaves the
       living room, the show quickly becomes a disturbing
       drama. It focuses on Allison's pained expressions. It
       features an ominous soundtrack and dark lighting
       while using a single camera (as versus the tradi-
       tional three-camera setup). If the pilot episode was
       your artifact, it would probably grab your attention!
       Its scenic contrasts seem to challenge the casual
       sexism encouraged by sitcoms when women are
       consistently the butt of the jokes.

                                                                                              Image made using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Elevates and Challenges

Sometimes artifacts both elevate and resist common ways of seeing the world at once. Consider the example in box 34.4.
Such artifacts can provide rich grounds for an ideological criticism, though you must recognize its multiple functions.

   Box 34.4 An Artifact That Elevates and Challenges a Common Way of Seeing the World

   You have likely seen advertisements for US politi-
cal candidates that promote American patriotism
while challenging the conservatism or liberalism of
an opposing candidate. In these cases, a commonly
held value (patriotism) is upheld, while a widely
held set of beliefs (conservativism or liberalism) is
called into question.

The bottom line is that the best choices for ideo-  Republican Elephant & Democratic Donkey by DonkeyHotey

logical criticism are artifacts that reinforce a widely accepted way of seeing the world, challenge that widely accepted

way of seeing the world, or both.

444 | Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
Attempts to Persuade

Additionally, identify an artifact that tries to persuade an audience to live and act in a certain way. Such persuasion
might appear explicitly or implicitly. A political ad, for example, might

   explicitly critique liberalism by telling viewers the opponent is "a liberal" while writing that word across the screen
      in large, red letters or

   simultaneously promote patriotism implicitly by showing the candidate dressed in red, white, and blue and stand-
      ing beside waving American flags.

            Steer away from artifacts that are informative or educational in purpose unless you can find implicit persuasive
statements related to communal thought or action. Otherwise, you may become frustrated because you can find little
about ideology to critique in the artifact.

Familiar but Not Reflected Upon

Finally, you may find it particularly fruitful to look for an artifact you believe is familiar to your audience but that your
audience has not yet reflected on its ideological assumptions.

   Perhaps the lyrics of your favorite rap musician are violent toward women, yet you see friends rapping along with-
      out thinking about what messages they are coming to view as normal.

   Maybe you notice friends laughing at a particular Super Bowl commercial that presents a newer, more expansive
      view of masculinity. You might help them look past the humor to see what is compelling in the message.

            The key idea is that it's likely your audience has missed these messages or given little thought or attention to
them or the artifacts themselves.

          Box 34.5 #IfTheyGunnedMeDown as a Rhetorical Artifact for Ideological Criticism
          An example of an appropriate artifact emerged in the days and months following the fatal shooting of
       Michael Brown, an unarmed eighteen-year-old African American man in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9,
       2014. Brown was killed by white police officer Darren Wilson in a confrontation on a residential street that
       had few witnesses and no video footage.

                   In the days that followed the fatal shooting, tension emerged about how Michael Brown was por-
       trayed in the media:

             His family and friends stressed he was a recent high school graduate and a good kid who was about
                to begin college classes.

             Police spokespersons, however, released video footage that appeared to show Brown stealing cigars
                from a convenience store on the morning of his death, and they suggested he had physically attacked
                the police officer who shot him.1

                                                                                         Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context | 445
                       Our rhetorical artifact is a Twitter (now X) campaign under the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
          that was most immediately a response to a photo of Brown that NBC News tweeted the day after his shoot
          ing.2 The photo portrayed Brown without a smile, in front of a brick building, with a hand gesture that some
          have said was a peace sign and others interpreted as a gang sign. In other words, in the photograph, Brown
          could be read as unfriendly and even aggressive.

                     -- NBC News (@NBCNews) August 10, 2014

                       To protest this media representation of Brown, many Twitter (now X) users, particularly young
          people of color, started tweeting photographs of themselves under the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown.
          They each posted pairs of photographs of themselves. One photo depicted the subject as partying, smoking,
          making an offensive hand signal, or looking at the camera in an especially provocative way. In the second
          photo, the same subject was shown in their military uniform, wearing their graduation cap and gown, caring
          for their children, smiling or looking friendly, or perhaps reading a story in an elementary classroom. The
          visual contrasts were striking, and they made powerful statements about the choices news outlets make
          when they select and publish photographs.

                     -- C.J. Lawrence (@CJLawrenceEsq) August 10, 2014

                       These photo pairs tweeted for the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown social media campaign meet the crite-
          ria for an appropriate artifact for ideological criticism:

                They used verbal and visual symbols by combining two photographs, the hashtag caption, and
                   often a version of the question "Which picture would the media use?"

                They challenged a common way of seeing the world, of viewing news photographs of Black people
                   that are racially biased as unbiased reflections, while elevating another perspective, of the humanity
                   of people of color.

                They clearly attempted to persuade viewers to scrutinize more closely how people of color are rep-
                   resented by the media.

                For audiences who had not previously reflected on images like the one publicly shared of Brown,
                   an ideological critique of the photo pairs would help listeners recognize and consider their ideological
                   messaging.

   446 | Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
Reconstructing the Historical Context

Once you have located a suitable artifact, the next step in ideological criticism is to reconstruct the artifact's historical
context. The context helps you understand why the artifact looks and sounds the way it does, which will aid your analy-
sis later. It assists you in recognizing how the artifact was a product of, as well as a participant in, its time, place, and
culture.

            To determine the artifact's historical context, find answers to the questions we established in chapter 31: who,
why, what, to whom, when, and where? Use box 34.6 for guidance.

          Box 34.6 Questions to Ask About Historical Context

             Who was the rhetor for this artifact--that is, the person or entity most invested in how the artifact
                looks, sounds, and was received by audiences? Is there anything compelling in the rhetor's biography
                that led to the creation of this artifact?

             Why was the artifact created? What social, economic, or political realities prompted its creation? If
                there are earlier or historical references in the artifact, what connection might the rhetor have hoped
                audiences would see between the past and the artifact's present?

             What type of artifact was created? What were its major characteristics?
             To whom was the artifact addressed? What visual or textual clues in the artifact hint at the target,

                implied, and implicated audiences? Whom did it reach? Who was the direct audience, and were they
                discrete and/or dispersed?
             When was the artifact's timing? That is, what date was it delivered, produced, or published, and
                what was occurring politically, socially, or economically that may have influenced audiences' response
                to the artifact? How did the artifact compare with or differ from similar types of artifacts that pre-
                ceded it?
             Where was the artifact's location? In other words, what was the specific place it was delivered or
                disseminated, and/or through what medium did it circulate?

"Who?"

        Who was the rhetor for the artifact? In previous chapters about rhetorical criticism, we have
        defined the rhetor as the author(s) or creator(s) of the rhetorical artifact under examination.
        Depending on the artifact, the rhetor might be obvious. However, artifacts such as photographs,
        popular songs, video games, or television commercials can make the rhetor harder to pinpoint.
        Your rhetor may be the photographer, the songwriter, the production team, or the director, for
        instance. Who was most responsible for the rhetorical artifact's production?

        Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context | 447
             Box 34.7 Rhetors of #IfTheyGunnedMeDown Posts
             The rhetors for the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown posts are the Twitter (now X) users who posted pairs of
          photos of themselves. C. J. Lawrence sparked the trend one day after Brown's death,3 but many more X
          users quickly followed his model.

                       Having said that, Lawrence's tweet caught on because it was retweeted by people with large follow-
          ings, so it's possible to think of those who retweeted--possibly while adding their own additional messages
          or photos--as rhetors as well.

               The question of "who" the rhetor is can be potentially complicated if you choose social media artifacts, since
   audience members can resend posts and alter or comment on them (thus, creating a slightly different artifact). Ulti-
   mately, think of the rhetor as the person or entity most responsible for the artifact's creation and intending to influence
   others' thinking or behavior.

  "Why?" and "What?"

                               Second, answer "why" by looking for the specific social, economic, or political events that led to the
                               creation or circulation of your rhetorical artifact. This is where you ask why the rhetor made the
                               arguments they did in the ways they did. If possible, unearth the rhetor's goal. Third, answer "what"
                               by clarifying what type of artifact the rhetor produced in response to the events that prompted it
                               and by naming its major characteristics.

             Box 34.8 Prompts for, and an Account of, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
             Why: In an interview about #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, Lawrence--who posted the original
          tweet--explained his motivation: "The questions began to resonate in my mind that, how are people being
          convinced that the prey is the predator?...And then I decided that it has to be directly attached to appear-
          ance. So I began to think about, what type of social commentary can be jarring to the extent that we can
          begin to challenge the narrative, that whether I look one way or the other, you cannot capture or embody
          who I am as a human being on a snapshot....The point was to disrupt people mentally."4

       he paired two very different photographs of himself: In the first, he was speaking outdoors at a graduation
       ceremony with President Clinton laughing in the background. In the second photo, Lawrence was inside a
       house or apartment, dressed in black and wearing sunglasses while holding up what looks like a liquor bot-
       tle. Lawrence paired the photos with the caption, "Yes, let's do that. Which photo does the media use if the
       police shot me down? #IfTheyGunnedMeDown."

            Answering "what" is much easier than explaining "why" an artifact was created. If you cannot find a credible
source that explains the rhetor's goal, that's OK. Knowing the rhetor's goal is not necessary for ideological criticism. You
can, instead, identify the social, economic, or political realities that may have motivated the artifact's production and
circulation. For example, imagine we did not find the interview with Lawrence (highlighted in box 34.8) to identify his
goal for #IfTheyGunnedMe Down. Without that, it would be fairly easy to conclude that the social and political contexts
for the Twitter (now X) posts were established in reaction to Brown's death and the ensuing media coverage. Knowing
why an artifact was produced can help you notice and later analyze rhetorical features chosen by the rhetor(s).

"To Whom?"

Third, consider who the audience was for the symbolic action. Recall in chapter 10 (and chapter 32) we differentiated
the following:

   direct audience (those who are exposed to and attend to the rhetoric)
   target audience (those the rhetor hopes to reach)
   implied audience (those who are represented in the message)
   implicated audience (those who will be affected by the message if it is successful)
We also considered whether the audience is
   discrete (limited to those who show up for an event at a particular day and time) or
   dispersed (unlimited by location and/or time).
Researching and understanding audiences can help you later analyze how the artifact's ideological messaging might
have functioned similarly or differently for each.

          Box 34.9 Audiences for #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
          Returning to our artifact, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown posts were initially viewed by a dispersed audience of

                                                                                         Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context | 449
           Twitter (now X) users. According to Lawrence, it was fellow members of "Black Twitter"--a vibrant subset
           that communicates about race-centered issues--who retweeted his post, causing it "to catch a fire."5 By the
           following day, the hashtag had been used so many times--over 168,0006--that a Tumblr blog was created to
           collect the tweets7 and several major news organizations reported about the hashtag campaign.

                       Consequently, while the target audience
           was Twitter (now X) users, the direct audience ulti-
           mately encompassed a much wider group of news
           media consumers and companies. Interestingly, this
           reach matched the posts' implied and implicated
           audiences: the news media (for selecting pho-
           tographs of the subjects they report), news con-
           sumers (to become more aware of these choices),
           and Black Americans (who too often were depicted
           negatively by the news media).

                                                                                                  Newspapers by Jon S via Flickr, CC BY.

  "When?"

   The next step is to consider the artifact's timing. In chapter 32, we explained that timing includes both the specific date
   and time for the artifact and the time period in which the rhetoric was situated.

      What date was the artifact produced, delivered, or published?
      What was happening politically, socially, or economically that may have influenced how audiences responded to

         the artifact?
      How did the artifact relate to similar types of artifacts that preceded it or to other types of commentary on the

   450 | Ideological Criticism: Rhetorical Artifacts and Historical Context
   Understanding how your artifact relates to a broader time period or history of similar artifacts can give you greater
   awareness of its ideological functions.

              Box 34.10 Timing of #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
              Brown's death and NBC News's tweet with his photograph occurred on August 9, 2013. The next day,
           tweets using the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown first appeared.

                       However, we know that NBC's photograph did not appear in a historical vacuum. Media critics and
           civil rights activists have long noted that the news media visually portray some minorities--and African
           American men in particular--with a negative bias. Portrayals of violent or threatening men of color will sell
           news, this protest contends, and these negative portrayals, in turn, feed cultural perceptions of African
           American men as dangerous and untrustworthy.8 As a result, we as media consumers are much more likely
           to encounter images of African American men as criminals than as teachers, fathers, soldiers, or political
           leaders.

                       Given this long-running critique of media portrayals, some Twitter (now X) followers viewed the
           NBC News-circulated photograph of Brown as yet another occasion where a mainstream news organization
           chose a threatening-looking photograph of an African American man when they could easily have chosen a
           photograph that showed Brown smiling or in his graduation cap and gown. As blogger P. J. Vogt wrote, "A
           photo can be an argument, and the photo NBC News tweeted made a different argument than a more typi-
           cal victim photo (at a graduation or at home) would have."9

  "Where?"

                                  The final element of context to consider is the artifact's location. In chapter 32, we described
                                  location as including both/either the specific place an artifact is delivered or disseminated and/
                                  or the medium through which it circulates. The latter can help you determine whether the arti-
                                  fact reached its target audience and who its unintended audiences might have been. Is your arti-
                                  fact a confidential or classified document that was later leaked to the press? If it is a document or
                                  film, has it been translated into other languages? Is your artifact a video or internet meme that
                                  went viral?
               Thinking about circulation will help you consider more fully how ideologies infiltrate cultures. You may begin to
   explain how certain beliefs or values come to be shared and widely held--or how certain forms of resistance gain wide
   adherence--when you identify how artifacts spread among groups.

               Box 34.11 Location of #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
               Twitter (now X) was the medium of communication for the original #IfTheyGunnedMeDown post.
            According to Lawrence, who produced that post, two Black Twitter users with large followings quickly
            retweeted his post, which helped it go viral.10 After that, the tweets began appearing in other social media
            (resulting in a devoted Tumblr blog) and in many news media reports about the campaign. Eventually sev-
            eral scholars published research on the campaign, often including examples of tweets in their work.11 We
            can also include this textbook as a location that is further disseminating the campaign and its original
            tweet!

                        Consequently, while the original rhetor distributed his post on Twitter, it--and the tweets that fol-
            lowed--circulated and spread in ways and in places he probably could not have anticipated or imagined.
            What began as one man's post to resist racist depictions of African Americans by the news media resulted in
            a large and well-publicized protest campaign.

                When you take time to research your artifact's historical context--answering who, why, what, to whom, when,
    and where--you gain important clues. You discover what contributed to the artifact's production and what it attempted
    to influence. These clues are invaluable as you describe, interpret, and evaluate the artifact to illuminate its ideological
    functions. We explain those next steps of ideological criticism in the following chapter.

          Summary

            As a method of criticism, ideological analysis seeks to understand how a range of rhetorical artifacts shape
         our understanding and use of ideologies. To provide such understanding, critics using ideological criticism
         must keep in mind the following concept and steps.

               Ideology is a set of beliefs and values that forms an interpretation of the world and suggests appropri-
                  ate ways to act in it.

               You begin by identifying a suitable rhetorical artifact. For ideological criticism, such an artifact uses
                  verbal, nonverbal, visual, and/or audio symbols; elevates or challenges a common way of seeing the
                  world; attempts to persuade an audience to live or act in a certain way; and may be familiar to your audi-
                  ence, though they may not have reflected on its ideological assumptions.

     You then reconstruct the historical context for the artifact by discovering what audiences might have
        known about the rhetor, what prompted the artifact, the rhetor's likely goal(s), the type of artifact pro-
        duced, the audience(s) for the artifact, and the artifact's location and timing.

35. Ideological Criticism: Description,
Interpretation, and Evaluation

     Chapter Objectives

        Students will:
          Describe an artifact's ideological message.
          Interpret how an artifact uses ideology to exercise power and control.
          Evaluate how a rhetorical artifact's ideology strengthens or weakens democratic principles.

The previous chapter introduced you to ideological criticism. We explained that it is a method of rhetorical criticism
that exposes the ideology communicated by a rhetorical artifact and interprets how the artifact uses the ideology to
exercise power and control. We defined an ideology as a set of shared beliefs and values that forms an interpretation
of the world and suggests appropriate ways to act in it. We also guided you through the first two steps of ideological
criticism: identifying an appropriate rhetorical artifact and reconstructing its historical context.

            In this chapter, we will explain the next three steps: describing the artifact's ideological message, interpreting
how the artifact uses the ideology to exercise power and control, and evaluating how the ideology strengthens or weak-
ens democratic principles.

Describing the Artifact's Ideological Message

In ideological criticism, the description step entails determining your artifact's ideological message. To do that, name
and describe the ideology your artifact communicates (i.e., the artifact's content) as well as the rhetorical features it
employs to communicate it (i.e., the forms it uses).

454 | Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
Name the Ideology

   Critical to ideological criticism is naming the ideology
the artifact elevates or challenges. As mentioned previ-
ously, an ideology is a set of shared beliefs and values that
forms an interpretation of the world and suggests appro-
priate ways to act in it. Notice that an ideology consists of
a set or collection of beliefs and values that coheres into a
perspective. Students often mistake a single value or
belief for an ideology.

Devotion                     Patriotism

                             Patriotism consists of a set of beliefs and values:

Devotion is a single value.   devotion
                              sacrifice
                              pride
                              attachment to one's homeland
                              belief that one should do what's best for their country and its inhabitants

            You will know you are naming an ideology when you can identify the collection of interrelated values and beliefs
that form the outlook. Box 35.1 offers a list of sample ideologies to help you get started.

Hegemonic Ideologies

                              In addition to naming the ideology, identify if it is hegemonic or resistant. A hegemonic ideology
                              is an ideology that has become a predominant way of seeing the world and serves the interests of
                              those who hold institutional or social power. You will know an ideology is a predominant viewpoint
                              because it is promoted, practiced, or reinforced through institutional (social, economic, educa-
                              tional, political, and religious) practices and policies, and it is likely reflected in majority opinions.

                                          Hegemonic ideologies typically privilege people who hold posi-
                              tions of power and/or who have dominantly situated positionalities. In
chapter 7, we drew on standpoint theory to explain that our social identities influence our knowl-
edge of the world and our perceptions of what is "true" or "normal." Dominantly situated identi-
ties--such as those perceived as white, able-bodied, or native English speaking--occupy
positions of social privilege. They are granted more social power and prestige than their margin-
ally situated counterparts, such as those perceived as nonwhite, physically disabled, or nonnative
English speaking. Hegemonic ideologies typically promote values and beliefs that reinforce the power of dominantly sit-
uated identities, though we often are unaware of this function.
            Indeed, hegemonic ideologies are so predominant that most people perceive their values and beliefs as given.
That is, these ideologies seem natural, commonsensical, or even ordained by god. In the United States, for example, we
might identify such hegemonic ideologies as the following:

   Christianity
   individualism
   heteronormativity

You might support and adhere to one or more of these ideologies. We all support some hegemonic ideologies because
we find their beliefs valid and their values laudable. Frankly, it's very difficult to reject all hegemonic ideologies and
belong to a society.

            Remember, though, that hegemonic ideologies typically serve the needs and interests of dominantly situated

456 | Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
  positionalities while ignoring, downplaying, or rejecting the needs and interests of marginally situated positionalities
  (locally or globally). We'll return to this notion when we discuss the step of interpreting your artifact's ideological work.
  The point here is that it is helpful to identify if the ideology communicated by your artifact is hegemonic and, if so, if
  your artifact reinforces this ideology or calls it into question.

             Box 35.2 Naming Hegemonic Ideologies in #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
             In the previous chapter, we introduced you to a Twitter (now X) campaign named #IfTheyGunned
          MeDown. It began on August 10, 2014, one day after Missouri police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed a
          young, Black man named Michael Brown. The campaign sought to highlight the news media's repeated habit
          of publicizing pictures of Black people that make them appear potentially menacing.

                      In tweets, African American participants paired two photos, with one photo presenting themselves
          in a potentially negative light and the other photo depicting themselves in a more positive light (as gradu-
          ates, parents, public servants, etc.). In most cases, the person posting included the hashtag #IfThey-
          GunnedMeDown to provoke viewers to wonder which photo the news media would publicize if a police
          officer killed the person posting.

                    Yes let's do that: Which photo does the media use if the police shot me down? #IfThey-

                    -- C.J. Lawrence (@CJLawrenceEsq) August 10, 2014
                      We return to this example in this chapter to illustrate the description, interpretation, and evalua-
          tion steps of ideological criticism. Here we begin with description by naming the ideologies the tweets ele-
          vated or challenged.
                      In the case of #IfTheyGunnedMeDown tweets, we can identify racism as the hegemonic ideology
          communicated and challenged.
                      In each tweet, the rhetor provided a photograph that portrayed a person of color in ways that could
          trigger racist associations of Black people with criminality. In the US, racism is hegemonic, sadly; its ongo-
          ing influence can be found in social, legal, educational, political, and religious institutions, and it serves the
          dominantly situated positionality of whiteness by associating it, in contrast, with purity and innocence. 1
                      The tweets challenged racism by pairing each photograph with a second that portrayed the same
          person in roles and activities we typically celebrate (as a soldier, graduate, parent, etc.). The pairing made
          clear that the racist associations with one set of images were unfair and racially biased.

Resistant Ideologies

Just as there are hegemonic ideologies, there are also resistant ideologies. A resistant ideology is one that directly chal-
lenges a hegemonic ideology. To revisit our earlier examples,

Egalitarianism                                                                              heteronormativity.

Collectivism                                                                                resist(s) individualism.

Alternative religious systems (Hinduism, Islam, etc.) or nonreligious ideologies (atheism)  Christianity.

Artifacts that challenge hegemonic ideologies often (but not always) also promote a resistant ideology.

   Box 35.3 Naming Resistant Ideologies in #IfTheyGunnedMeDown

   We might argue that the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown tweets promoted the resistant ideology of humanism
as they sought to challenge the racial bias in typical photographs circulated by the media of Black individu-
als. By pairing two very different photographs of themselves, the rhetors reminded viewers of how we all
pose and appear differently in varied contexts. They prompted viewers to realize we all have at least two
images of ourselves that might prompt very different conclusions about us. In doing so, the tweets pro
moted the belief in our common human experience as well as the value of emphasizing our shared connec-
tions.

Describe the Artifact's Rhetorical Symbols That Communicate the Ideology

In addition to naming the ideology communicated by the artifact and identifying it as hegemonic
or resistant, you must specify how the artifact communicates the ideology.

            Focus on the artifact's verbal, nonverbal, visual, and audio symbols that convey its ideo-
logical message. For instance, if your artifact is a photograph,

   How is it visually framed or cropped?
   Is it in black and white or color?
   What is the eye drawn to first?
   Is there text within the photograph itself or superimposed on the photograph?

458 | Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
            If your artifact is a music video,

   What lyrics accompany what scenes?
   How are scenes visually shot?
   How is the singer or character in the video dressed?
   What does the lighting emphasize or what is placed in the shadows?
   How does the music change in volume and tempo as the video progresses?

            Also consider who or what is missing from your artifact. Use your reconstruction of the historical context to
notice conspicuous absences. Overall, look closely at the artifact and help your audience understand how its rhetorical
features and absences communicate the ideology.

          Box 35.4 Rhetorical Symbols to Describe and Interpret in Ideological Criticism
             verbal symbols: word choice, juxtaposition of words with visual or audio features
             nonverbal symbols: appearance, facial expressions, gestures, posture, eye contact, physical move-

                ment
             visual symbols: color, lighting, framing, font of text in the image, camera angle, distance, editing or

                juxtaposition of images, symbols, materials used, size
             audio symbols: sound quality, tempo, pitch, volume, juxtaposition of sound with visual or verbal fea-

                tures
             absence: based on your reconstruction of the context, who or what is conspicuously missing or

                downplayed by the artifact

Which Comes First? Naming the Ideology or Describing the Artifact's Rhetorical
Symbols?

Describing an artifact's rhetorical symbols goes hand in hand with identifying the artifact's ideology. You can tackle them
together.

            However, you may find it helpful to begin with the artifact's rhetorical symbols and use them to help you name
the ideology the artifact communicates. You can, in other words, work backward from the rhetorical symbols to naming
the ideology:

   Spend time with your artifact and list its most striking rhetorical symbols, whether they are verbal, nonverbal,
      visual, or audio, as well as any glaring absences.

   Identify the belief or value each symbol communicates or challenges. This may take some time.
   Then look over your list and decide what ideology pulls the beliefs and values together into a coherent perspective.

      You may find it helpful to look back through the sample ideologies in box 35.1 or talk with your instructor for help.

                                                                                        Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 459
          Box 35.5 Moving from Describing the Rhetorical Symbols of, to Naming the Ideologies Communicated
       by, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown Posts

          If we were unsure of what ideologies the Twitter (now X) posts communicate, we might focus initially on
       their rhetorical symbols. We would probably begin by listing patterns in the visual and nonverbal contrasts
       between the photographs coupled together, including their differing

             physical settings,
             lighting,
             facial expressions,
             camera angles, and
             ways the subject is depicted in their attire, expression, gestures, or activity.

                   We could then move to the beliefs and values these features communicate.

             We might notice, for example, that the visual imagery in one group of photographs can be read
                through a racist lens as suggesting a threat (or guilt).

             The other group of photos communicates innocence by depicting success, pride, joy, and devotion.

                   We might next consider the consistent verbal feature in the posts. The hashtag "#IfThey-
       GunnedMeDown" returns to beliefs of guilt and innocence but flips the racist script. It suggests that "They"
       (the police) are guilty of killing or harming "Me," the innocent Black person depicted in both photos.
       Through visual, verbal, and nonverbal features together, then, the tweets promoted the belief (and values)
       that if the police unfairly acted violently against the rhetor, one photo would showcase the rhetor's inno-
       cence while one might imply the victim was the perpetrator.

                   The tweets' communication of these beliefs and values, along with their historical context of appear
       ing the day after NBC News publicized a particular image of Michael Brown, can help us piece together the
       ideologies they communicate. They illuminated and challenged the hegemonic ideology of racism at work
       in photos more often selected by the media by pairing them with photos the media could have selected that
       communicate the resistant ideology of humanism.

            Taking time to carefully list all the significant rhetorical symbols of your artifact--and identify what value or
belief each communicates--will serve you well. Most directly, it will help you name the ideology communicated by the
artifact.

            In addition, such work will aid you in identifying and explaining to your audience the specific beliefs and values
that compose that ideology. It's not enough to name the ideology; you need to briefly define and describe its contents
as well.

            Further, such preparation will also help you name and point out specific rhetorical symbols that communicate
the ideology. You may want to pair your descriptions with well-designed visual aids or include an audio or video clip
that focuses attention on specific rhetorical symbols. They can help supply evidence needed for
your claims about the artifact's ideological messaging. If you jump to your interpretations without
pointing out the presence of ideological features in your artifact, your interpretation will lack
validity.

            Finally, listing your artifact's rhetorical symbols will set you up well to make interpreta
tions, which is what we turn to next.

Interpreting How the Artifact Exercises Power and Control

If you only identify an artifact's ideology and rhetorical symbols but don't interpret how they function persuasively, you
will mostly have summarized or narrated the artifact. You will miss its symbolic action.

            To interpret an artifact using ideological criticism, infer how it uses an ideology to exercise power and control.
We will unpack what that means--and explain how to do it--by providing the concept of agency as well as additional
factors to consider when your artifact supports a hegemonic ideology, when it resists a hegemonic ideology, and when
it does not neatly do either.

Agency

Agency is an individual's ability to act freely or to independently intervene in a situation, their
own life, and the world. When you analyze an artifact for agency, you interpret how the arti
fact depicts an individual or group's freedom to act. Agency is particularly important in ideo-
logical criticism because it helps you discover how artifacts employ ideologies in ways that
attempt to expand or contract the liberty of others. You can also reveal the ways democratic
participants can resist such messages.

          Box 35.6 Agency in #IfTheyGunnedMeDown
          If we return to the tweets, we see how the paired photographs drew attention to the agency exercised by
       major news corporations like NBC News over the images they select to report stories involving people of
       color. The posts suggested that of the photographs publicly available, the news media chose an image that
       could be damning when reporting about crime or violence. Relatedly, the posts highlighted the lack of
       agency that people of color, such as Brown, have over how they are depicted by the news media.

                                                                                                   By posting the paired images, however,
                                                                                      Twitter (now X) users asserted their own agency
                                                                                      and invited audiences to join them in seeking social
                                                                                      change. C. J. Lawrence sparked the broad participa-

          participate."2 His use of "let's" called out to readers who shared his frustrations to join the campaign. As
          they did, they promoted positive images of Black individuals, reclaiming some of their agency and circum
          venting the major news media's gatekeeping. These photos helped promote the ideology of humanism by
          depicting themselves in ways all viewers could relate to and identify with.

               When you interpret your artifact's persuasive functions, ask how it renders an individual's or group's agency,
   using the prompts in box 35.7. Your interpretations of agency can and should contribute to your analysis of how your
   artifact supported hegemonic ideologies, resisted hegemonic ideologies, or both.

             Box 35.7 Questions to Ask About Agency
                How much and what type of freedom does the artifact depict people as having or exercising? Which

                   people?
                How does the artifact depict an individual or group as lacking freedom or being controlled by or

                   under the power of others?
                Does the artifact conspicuously exclude anyone? If so, how might their exclusion attempt to restrict

                   or expand their or others' agency?
                How does the artifact's depiction of agency help justify or challenge a particular ideology, especially

                   given the historical context?

 When Your Artifact Supports a Hegemonic Ideology

                                   Remember that a hegemonic ideology is a set of values, beliefs, interpretations, and assumptions
                                   that becomes a predominant viewpoint and serves the political and economic interests of domi-
                                   nantly situated positionalities. Consequently, they are typically used to portray and legitimize
                                   those standpoints as superior to marginally situated positionalities.

                                               If your artifact reinforces a hegemonic ideology, then interpret how the artifact uses
                                   that ideology to exercise power and control. Use the questions in box 35.8 to guide your inter-
                                   pretations.

   462 | Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
   Box 35.8 Questions to Ask When an Artifact Supports a Hegemonic Ideology
     Who or what does the artifact depict as desirable, moral, innocent, trustworthy, normal, and/or

        good-natured? Are they dominantly situated positionalities? How does the artifact encourage audi-
        ences to side with them?
     Who or what does the artifact define as undesirable, immoral, guilty, sneaky, abnormal, and/or
        threatening? Are they marginally situated positionalities? How does the artifact encourage audiences

        to reject or disapprove of them?
     What way of acting or behaving in the world is highlighted--or even praised--in the artifact? What

        ideas, beliefs, or values does the artifact obscure or hide--or perhaps overtly discredit?
     What hierarchies--unequal ranking(s) of people or groups--does the artifact produce through its

        ideological messaging? Hierarchies can consist of multiple, ranked groups.
     How does the artifact use hierarchies to try to justify or legitimate particular actions or policies? To

        serve the needs of those in power? To ignore, downplay, or reject the needs of marginally situated
        positionalities?
     How does the artifact present the ideological beliefs, values, and depictions as natural or normal?
        How does it discourage audiences from questioning it?

   Box 35.9 Interpreting How News Media Imagery Exercises Power and Control
   When the news media include a picture of the subject they are reporting about in their story, they don't
typically encourage consumers to reflect on this choice. Little or no information is given about where jour-
nalists found the picture or its original context (e.g., at a Halloween party, goofing around). Consequently,
their selection implies that's who the person depicted "is."

            Depictions: As we've established, NBC News publicized a photograph of Brown wearing a Nike Air
tank top, staring down at the camera with no smile, and showing a hand signal. This picture is innocuous on
its own. But paired with the tweet's caption, "Unarmed Missouri teen killed by officer after `physical con-
frontation,'" the photo could be read as implying that Brown, though unarmed, prompted or even partici-
pated in the confrontation. This reading is encouraged by and reinforces the hegemonic, racist depiction of
African American men as threats. By implication, this reading also implies that the (white) police officer who
killed Brown acted reasonably.

            Hierarchy: Together, the image and caption suggest a legal and racial hierarchy where the white
police officer is depicted as morally and legally superior to the African American teenager.

                                                                                Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation | 463
            Support for powerful people and institutions: Such depictions implicitly (and unfairly) attempt to
justify or explain police officers' use of violent force against African American men. Thus, images and cap-
tions like the one NBC News used for Brown serve the interests of those in positions of power (such as
police officers) within the legal system.

            Normalization: By selecting yet another potentially damning image of a Black man, the NBC News
post helped renaturalize the association of Blackness with crime. It perpetuated racism.

When Your Artifact Challenges a Hegemonic Ideology

Artifacts can, alternatively, challenge a hegemonic ideology, often by exposing the hegemonic ideology as a social con-

struct. A social construct is a category, idea, or description that humans have created to explain reality. The important

idea here is that a social construct is a product of human language and interactions rather than something biological,

natural, or ordained by God.

                                                                          The goal of artifacts that challenge hegemonic

                                                                   ideologies is to expose them as social constructs that are

                                                                   human rather than natural conceptions--and therefore

often do so by advocating a resistant ideology. Recall that a resistant ideology is one that

directly challenges and counters a hegemonic ideology. In such cases, the critic may also

ask how the resistant ideology offers an alternative depiction (or counterpresentation) of

dominantly and marginally situated identities. Does the resistant ideology replace a hier-

archy with a new hierarchy (perhaps with the groups' positions switched) or a more equi-

table or egalitarian depiction?

Box 35.10 Questions to Ask When an Artifact Resists Hegemonic Ideology

  How do the artifact's verbal, nonverbal, visual, or audio symbols challenge a hegemonic ideology?
     What does the artifact suggest is wrong with our collective way of seeing?

             What social constructs does the artifact challenge or expose?
             What hierarchy does the artifact resist?
             How does the artifact promote a resistant ideology that runs counter to a hegemonic ideology?
             What does the artifact replace the hierarchy with: a new hierarchy (that depicts a dominant group

                in an unflattering way and/or presents those with less societal power favorably) or a more equitable
                or egalitarian depiction of individuals and groups?

          Box 35.11 Interpreting How #IfTheyGunnedMeDown Exercised Power and Control
                   Challenge hegemonic ideology: The tweets posted under #IfTheyGunnedMeDown directly coun-

       tered the racism perpetuated by the news media's choice of potentially damning images of Black people by
       promoting the resistant ideology of humanism. This ideology was communicated through the pairing of
       photographs.

                   Replace hierarchy with an egalitarian depiction: As we established earlier, by pairing contrasting
       photos, the rhetors reminded viewers of how we all pose and appear differently in varied contexts. All of us
       have selfies that may not reflect positively on us when viewed out of context. This belief directly resisted
       the racist hierarchy that oppressed African Americans as threats.

                   The other set of photos invited viewers to identify with Black subjects through their depiction in
       roles (as parents, graduates, soldiers, etc.) and doing actions (nurturing, graduating, serving, etc.) that we
       collectively celebrate. Such identification produced egalitarianism in our shared humanity.

                   Reveal a social construct: By countering racism with humanism, the paired photos revealed depic-
       tions of Black people as threats as a social construct--one that could easily be replaced with depictions of
       the same people as productive members of society.

But What If My Artifact....?

Perhaps your artifact does not neatly fit into the two previous categories. Not all artifacts wholly reinforce or resist
hegemonic ideologies.

hear a sermon, for example, that critiques egalitarianism when it comes to gender nonbinary people and upholds a gen-

der binary by supporting religious fundamentalism. In such cases, use the guidance provided in the previous section for

when artifacts reinforce hegemonic ideologies. You might add to that your consideration of how the artifact strives to

counter a resistant ideology by depicting it as a social construct.

A final word of caution about interpretation in ideological criticism: Not everything that is interesting about

your artifact and its context may make it into your critique. You are looking, in particular, for one of two things:

 First, you might explain how symbols in your artifact reinforce a particular set of beliefs and behaviors as "natural"
   when, in fact, these beliefs or behaviors are socially constructed, and how that ideology produces a hierarchy
   among individuals or groups, perhaps to try to justify a policy or action.

 Second, you may illuminate how symbols in your artifact explicitly challenge a hegemonic ideology and suggest
   that we can and should think and act differently--especially for the benefit of those groups that are traditionally
   silenced, overlooked, or politically and economically oppressed.

   Box 35.12 Gender Critique as a Form of Ideological Criticism

   Questions and assumptions about gender are often rooted in ideology. Philosophers and rhetorical critics
see many commonly held ideas about gender as social constructs.

            If this is a topic that interests you, you might wish to focus your critique on how gender is por-
trayed and prescribed in your artifact. Does your artifact reinforce the hegemonic belief about gender as a
binary (i.e., men and women as separate and different), or does it challenge that assumption, such as by
depicting gender as fluid or as existing along a spectrum? Do you see your artifact's portrayals of people as
limiting or policing what's considered appropriately masculine or feminine? Do you want to argue that your
artifact is working to expand what the culture defines as acceptable behavior and gender expression? If
your answer to these (and similar) questions is yes, then your ideological criticism is performing a gender
critique.

Evaluating the Rhetorical Artifact

   We wrote this chapter because we are interested in
educating civically engaged critics. We believe you are
more able to participate in and shape democratic organi-
zations when you can recognize how rhetoric and ideol-
ogy influence ideas and exert social control.

            With this in mind, the final step to any rhetorical
critique is to help your audiences understand how your
artifact relates to democratic principles and practices. In
chapter 31, we defined democratic principles as the
behavioral standards necessary for democratic gover-
nance to exist and thrive, and we gave examples such as
the rule of law, the unity or shared identity of community
members, and the open and thoughtful engagement of
public issues, arguments, and positions.

            In your ideological criticism, make certain to
argue how the artifact strengthens or weakens democra-
tic principles so your audience members are equipped to
be fuller participants in a democratic society.

Did the Artifact Strengthen Democratic
Principles? How?

In chapter 33, we explained that

an artifact can strengthen democ-

racy directly by explicitly advocat-

ing democratic principles or                                     Facade of the Capitol Building by Ramaz Bluashvili via Pexels, Pexels

ing the principles. We further

explained that any artifact that

practices responsible productive discourse indirectly reinforces democratic principles because it, as defined in chapter 4,

draws on the qualities of productive discourse to produce a more inclusive and equitable public sphere. You might, then,

illustrate how your artifact strengthens democratic principles by showing the following:

 how it explicitly advocates for specific democratic principles
 how it illustrates qualities of productive discourse
 how it sparks discussion about an overlooked and ongoing societal problem
 how it expands the public sphere by including historically marginalized members of the public and empowering

   them to act as democratic participants
 how it questions the power of historically dominant members of the public rather than unreflectively granting

   their perspectives authority

Did the Artifact Weaken Democratic Principles? How?

Artifacts that weaken democratic principles tend not to do the things we just listed. You likely have an artifact that dis-
courages democratic principles if you see that your artifact

   explicitly calls for the dismissal of democratic principles, subjugates them to other values, or refuses their applica-
      tion to particular groups of people;

   exemplifies qualities of unproductive discourse;
   quells discussion about an overlooked and ongoing societal problem;
   restricts the public sphere by actively excluding or denigrating historically marginalized voices; or
   preserves the power of historically dominant groups by uncritically accepting their perspectives.

   Box 35.13 Evaluating #IfTheyGunnedMeDown

   The Twitter (now X) phenomenon that paired photos of young people of color supported the democratic
principles of free speech and the participation of people in civic affairs by empowering the young peo-
ple--whose voices had historically been largely excluded from news coverage--to tell their own stories. Par-
ticipants' posts sparked a discussion about the ongoing but often overlooked issue of racism in the news
media and questioned the media's historic power to shape audiences' perceptions of the people they cover.
The tweets also imagined equality by offering images that better matched the news media's typical, and
more humanizing, photographs of white individuals.

            By revealing how such posts upheld democratic principles, an ideological analysis of the paired
images can help viewers better understand the photographs as rhetorical artifacts functioning persuasively
in our world.

                                                                          The important point is that ideological criticism

                                                             is ultimately interested in social change. Will a critique of

                                                             Twitter (now X) posts change the way US news outlets

                                                             select pictures for their publications? Maybe not. Perhaps

                                                             all an analysis of the Twitter/X feed will do is plant a seed

                                                             of awareness that will move some audiences to think dif-

                                                             ferently about the way they receive news and the way

                                                             members of their community are portrayed in the media.

                                                             Such seeds of awareness, however, have the power to

                                                             grow and reshape culture when enough people take

                                                             notice. The power of consciousness raising should not be

                                                             ignored, as it encourages the sharing of diverse opinions,

                                                             powerful--and most true to its roots--when it opens

avenues for more people to participate in their society, culture, and government. An ideological critique should move

people to respond and to respond with action. The original proponents of ideological criticism wanted their analyses to

help change social structures and material conditions.

As you craft your ideological critique, invite your audience to participate in an action or protest to counter

468 | Ideological Criticism: Description, Interpretation, and Evaluation
   the form of ideological control you analyze or to support the challenge you investigated. You might model such action
   by producing and publicizing your own artifact that ideologically counters the one you analyzed. Similar to Lawrence's
   original tweet, invite your audience to join your efforts. Whatever you do, make your insights available to the public, and
   invite them to move on this evidence.

             Professor of communication James Arnt Aune makes the point this way:
                     There remains the risk...of the scholastic illusion that "raising consciousness" will create libera-

                  tion, failing to recognize the inertia which results from the inscription of social structures in bodies.
                     Radical social change--dare I say "revolution"?--appears to come when bodies learn to move in dif-

                  ferent ways, when Rosa Parks refuses to move, when drag queens riot at Stonewall, when Egyptians
                  take to the streets against Mubarak, or when workers of all kinds shut down the Wisconsin State
                  Capitol Building.3

        Summary

           As a method of criticism, ideological analysis exposes the ideology communicated by a rhetorical artifact and
        interprets how the artifact exercises power and control. But this method is also deeply invested in the health of
        our democracy and social change. Ideological criticism's goal is to help audiences resist ideological messages
        that constrict democratic participation and support those that expand such engagement.

              To analyze an artifact, the critic names the ideology communicated by the artifact, identifies it as hege-
                monic or resistant, and describes the verbal, nonverbal, visual, and audio features that convey the ideol-
                ogy's beliefs and values.

              When an ideology gains enough adherents that it becomes a predominant viewpoint and serves the
                interests of those in power, we say it is a hegemonic ideology.

              Ideologies can also be resistant. Those that are established to counter or challenge a hegemonic ideol-
                ogy are called resistant ideologies.

              The critic interprets how the artifact uses the ideology to exercise power and control.
              Because ideological criticism is deeply invested in social change, it is important that critics evaluate

                how the artifact's ideological assumptions elevate or challenge democratic principles. These evaluations
                themselves can function as acts of resistance and open ways for democratic participants to enact social
                change.

     Review Questions

         1. Explain the difference between hegemonic ideology and resistant ideology.
        2. What kinds of rhetorical symbols might you describe when arguing that an artifact communicates a

             particular ideology?
        3. What types of questions might you ask and answer when interpreting how a hegemonic ideology exer-

             cised power and control? A resistant ideology?
        4. What is the ultimate goal of ideological criticism?

     Discussion Questions

         1. Think of a current television commercial or music video that bothers you for some reason (for example,
             the way it portrays a group you belong to or a group you don't belong to). Explain to your classmates why
             you find the commercial problematic. Can you identify an ideology at work in the artifact?

        2. What ideologies do you think are good or useful? Which are bad or harmful? Explain.
        3. What is an example of an artifact exercising power and control? Over whom? How?
        4. Does resistance work? In other words, can you think of a time when resistance to a hegemonic ideol-

             ogy made a marked difference in people's lives?

Appendix A: Sample Preparation Outline for an
Informative Speech

Note: This outline is modeled on the informative speech for deliberation that we teach in chapter 20. There we suggest you
think of this speech's pattern as a problem-alternatives-solution arrangement without the solution. This is ultimately what
makes it more of an informative than an advocacy speech.

Javon's Speech to Inform Community Members About Multiple Perspectives
on High School Football and Concussions Before They Engage in a
Deliberative Discussion

Pattern of Arrangement:
Problem-Alternatives-Solution (Without the
Solution)

Specific purpose: To inform community members about

the problem of concussions in high school football and a

range of approaches to solving the problem they should

consider before they deliberate on the topic.

The purpose statement is not spoken in delivery, but it

can add focus to the outlining process--it reminds you what

your speech should do.                                       Football players by Muyuan Ma via Unsplash, Unsplash License.
   I. Introduction

A. Three weeks ago, after our favorite local quarterback, Brian Ramos, suffered a severe concussion during the

homecoming football game--the fourth football player on our team to suffer a concussion this season--it seemed

everyone in Columbus was an expert on concussions.

Begin decisively and get attention. Javon chooses the strategy of naming a well-known local figure and reminding

the audience of an important event in their recent past (the injury to a local high school football player). This helps

him connect with his audience.

1. Parents blamed coaches for not protecting "our" kids.

2. Coaches claimed school districts did not provide adequate funding for athletic trainers and on-the-

field medical care.

Notice that each element in this outline is phrased as a full sentence. This helps ensure (and illustrates to

your professor) that you have outlined a complete thought.

3. Parents and coaches both blamed players who downplayed their injuries so they wouldn't be cut from

games.

4. If you turned on the TV, it seemed Americans across the country were blaming "football culture" for

glorifying violence and aggression at the expense of players' health.

B. As "the great concussion debate" came to our town, we all agreed that Columbus needed fewer concussions,

                                               Appendix A: Sample Preparation Outline for an Informative Speech | 471
          but at the same time, many of us feared the beloved game of football might suffer under a cloud of reactionism
          and misunderstanding.

             Javon compels his audience to listen by appealing to a common feeling.
             C. As a member of the football team and as a concerned friend, I would also like to see fewer concussions on
          the field. But while changes in high school football programs and culture may be needed, we know that looking
          at a problem from only one angle is a poor way to make community decisions.
             By stating his own stake in the problem, Javon builds his ethos and increases the audience's trust that he will
          approach the topic thoughtfully.
             D. (Thesis) So the first thing we in Columbus need is a fuller understanding of the problem, as well as multiple
          perspectives on addressing concussions in high school football, before we are ready to advocate and implement
          specific changes. With this goal in mind, the question that guides my speech this morning is, How can we best
          address the issue of concussions in high school football?
             State and clearly label the thesis. In an outline to inform your audience in advance of a deliberative discussion,
          the thesis is a focusing or guiding question. See Riley's outline in Appendix B for a more traditional thesis.
             E. I will first outline the problem of concussions and youth sports and then turn to three different approaches
          for how to solve this problem. The three approaches include, first, redirecting resources away from the football
          program and toward healthier sports and activities; second, changing the culture of football; and third, providing
          more funding for medical expertise.
             The preview is an element that also signals the end of the introduction. It tells the audience where the speech is
          going and what to listen for next.
   * (Transition) I will begin, however, by outlining the problem we face as a community.
   Transitions are clearly marked.
   II. There is no denying that concussions are a real danger in football and youth sports in general. They are considered
a mild type of traumatic brain injury (or TBI).
             A. According to an October 29, 2024, report entitled "TBI Data" produced by the Centers for Disease Control
          and Prevention (CDC), there are more than 586 traumatic brain injury-related hospitalizations and 190 TBI-
          related deaths per day ("TBI data"). Football is a contributor to these numbers.
             Sub-subpoints are outlined as separate points rather than written together as a single paragraph.

                       1. According to a study published in the 2021 edition of Sports Health, the sport most likely to see con-
                    cussed male athletes is football (Chun et al.).

                       2. A February 23, 2021, study published in Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach by a group of eight
                    coauthors found that kids aged six to fourteen years old who played tackle football experienced nearly
                    fifteen times more head impacts during a game or practice compared to kids who played flag football
                    (Waltazman et al.).
             B. Athletes who have three or more concussions experience an enduring negative impact on cognitive function.
          According to a 2023 report by Donna Lu and Stephanie Convery for The Guardian, a study found the following:

                       1. Three concussions can permanently affect a person's ability to plan and pay attention.
                       2. Four concussions negatively impact memory and processing speeds.
                       3. Dr. Matthew Lennon, the study's lead author, clarified, "If you have multiple concussions in your
                    teens, 20s, 30s and 40s, you will still be feeling the effects when you're 70 or 80" (Lu and Convery).
             C. Despite these serious medical concerns, experts worry that many head injuries in high school sports go
          unreported (Breslow).
                       1. One reason may be the culture of football. A widely cited and NFL-funded study published in 2014,
                    titled Sports-Related Concussions in Youth, reports that athletes are reluctant to report concussions and
                    even are lax about following treatment plans when they have been diagnosed because it may not be per-
                    ceived as "manly" to follow the doctor's orders (Graham et al., 7).
                       2. A second reason some concussions go unreported may be due to too few medical personnel being
                    available for teams. According to a 2020 study of Massachusetts high schools that was published in

472 | Appendix A: Sample Preparation Outline for an Informative Speech
                    Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation by six coauthors, "55% of the high schools" studied didn't
                    "have a full-time athletic trainer and 50% did[n't] have a team physician" (Kahan et al.).
             * (Transition) Now that I have covered the growing problem of concussions and the long-term medical risks
          that come with them, I will move to the first perspective on how to solve this problem.
   III. The first solution that is gaining proponents in Columbus is to redirect resources away from the high school foot-
ball program and toward healthier sports and activities.
             A. This solution argues that the growing medical research on lifelong cognitive effects of concussions requires
          adults to make tough--even painful--decisions for kids' safety. Many parents are already effectively making this
          decision for kids by encouraging them to pursue sports like basketball and track and field. You now hear parents
          say, "My son can play any sport but football."
             The principle of subordination is illustrated here and throughout the outline. The items listed as 1, 2, and 3 all refer
          to and support A.

                       1. One suggestion for implementation suggests the school district reallocate funds currently dedicated
                    to football to developing other athletic activities and club sports that students can participate in for a life
                    time.

                                 a. Football--which has high rates of injury--is a sport players tend to outgrow with age and often
                              leaves them with lingering ailments.

                                 b. Clubs and teams that create skills and enthusiasm for hiking, golf, and canoeing teach stu-
                              dents to love a physical activity they can participate in for years to come.
                       2. Another sample action--recognizing the loss of community spirit if we were to end our football pro-
                    gram--would explore moving fall volleyball matches to Friday nights.
                       3. The value prioritized in this first solution is lifelong health. The approach embraces the necessity of
                    sport and physical activity in the lives of young people, but it places more value on those sports that have
                    a better track record of long participation and a pain-free lifestyle into adulthood.
                       Parallelism is also at work in this outline. Notice that under point A, there are three subpoints, and under
                    point 1, there are two sub-subpoints (a and b). This is what we mean by "every little one has a little two."
             B. The benefits of this approach are many, but I will name two of the most salient:
                       Each time Javon plans to orally cite a source, he includes the full spoken citation in what he will say. He
                    also adds an in-text written citation in parentheses to help the professor find the source in the bibliography
                    that follows his outline.
                       1. First, kids would still gain physical fitness while reducing head injuries and avoiding pressure to return
                    to play quickly after a concussion. As Chase Ray explains in their 2018 article published in City Scene Mag
                    azine, "Non-contact sports...still provide all the same health benefits without encouraging physical colli-
                    sion between players" (Ray).
                       2. Second, we would invest as a community in students' lifetime involvement in low-impact sports. This
                    turns schools back into educational institutions that put their resources into teaching and modeling life-
                    time physical fitness. It downplays what can sometimes feel like an obsession with varsity athletics, which
                    provide a community pastime but can compete with the curriculum.
             C. As with any approach, there are drawbacks to this one, and I will outline two of the most central.
                       1. First, football teaches many important lessons that are not easily replicated in another team sport and
                    are certainly not taught in more individualized physical activities like hiking and canoeing.
                       2. Second, many, like Jonathan Chait in his 2014 column in New York Magazine, argue that football
                    doesn't feed or promote aggression; rather--and especially in high school--it may provide a suitable chan-
                    nel for kids to express aggression. This outlet for aggression is not the same in other team sports like
                    diving or golf (Chait).
             * (Transition) Now that I have covered the first approach to the problem of concussions and youth sports in
          Columbus, I will move to the second approach.
             Transitions continue throughout the speech. They only refer to the two sections of the speech they connect.

                                                                                      Appendix A: Sample Preparation Outline for an Informative Speech | 473
   IV. The second approach to the problem of concussions in high school football calls for a change in football culture.
             A. This approach argues that we need to change the culture of toughness that dominates football, for this pres-

          sure is a major contributing factor in concussions. The Sports-Related Concussions in Youth study I referred to in
          the introduction calls for a change in culture as one of its official recommendations. Players, parents, and fans
          can work together to make this change.

                       1. One sample action is to encourage players to express their feelings and create comfortable spaces for
                    these conversations. Teams can mimic programs similar to Men of the House in Pittsburgh, which helps
                    players redefine healthy masculinity, and by pointing athletes to NFL players who model and encourage
                    such sharing, such as Bobby Wagner, Dak Prescott, and A. J. Brown (Stimmel; Vogt).

                       2. Another sample action encourages parents and fans to help by creating new mottos and catchphrases
                    about safety. To counter mottos like "No pain, no gain," a new motto--like the one prominently placed on
                    the CDC's HEADS UP educational materials--could be spread. It reads, "It's better to miss one game than
                    the whole season" ("Concussion Poster").

                       3. This call to change football culture prioritizes the value of education. It believes that fans, parents,
                    coaches, and teammates all need to learn that the game and the team cannot go on if individual players
                    are expected to sacrifice their safety or welfare.

                       Notice that each solution requires Javon to articulate a common value that solution prioritizes. We discuss
                    more about the specifics of this type of speech in chapters 20 and 21.
             B. This approach foregrounds two benefits.

                       1. It tries to address the unhealthy aspects of hypermasculinity within football culture, like ignoring pain
                    and ignoring the recovery protocols that may slow the chances of repeated concussions.

                       2. The education extends beyond players and coaches to include parents, fans, and community mem-
                    bers who often perpetuate attitudes that celebrate players who sacrifice their bodies for the game.
             C. But there are also drawbacks to this approach.
             Notice that because this is an informative speech, Javon outlines the benefits and drawbacks of each solution. This
          will help his audience focus on the impact of a given solution during a deliberative discussion.

                       1. Many question whether the emphasis on the team and winning are so ingrained in football culture
                    that they cannot be extricated. Cory McCune of The Bleacher Report stated a popular belief that there are
                    two types of football cultures: "A winning culture and a losing culture. There is no in between." Though he
                    was talking about collegiate football, many feel the same about high school sports (McCune).

                       2. The second drawback is time. Changing culture is a long project, and given the growing concern
                    about football and concussions, we may need a quicker, more decisive solution.
             * (Transition) Having looked at a second approach to the problem of concussions and youth sports in Colum-
          bus, I will move to the third and final option.
   V. The third solution is to increase player safety on the field by helping coaches get better, more consistent medical
care for high school players.
             A. Advocates for this solution argue that increased access to trained medical professionals is likely to result in
          higher reporting of concussions and better postconcussion rehabilitation.

                       1. The first suggestion for this approach stresses that coaches encourage parents and community mem-
                    bers to advocate for more and higher-quality student-athlete health care from school boards and com-
                    munity partners.

                       Internal signpost words like "first" and "second" remind the audience of the speaker's well-thought-out
                    organization.

                       2. A second sample action mandates that schools should require football programs themselves to fund
                    athletic-training services and on-the-sidelines medical expertise. For a football budget to be approved, a
                    certified athletic trainer must be available to supervise and follow up with injured students both during
                    the game and in the weeks after the injury.

474 | Appendix A: Sample Preparation Outline for an Informative Speech
                       3. This approach prioritizes the value of safety and insists that easy access to skilled medical care must
                    be evenly distributed among players; it should not be a luxury.
             B. I would like to highlight two of the many benefits of this approach.

                       1. First, it better ensures safety and good medical care for players and takes some of the burden off high
                    school coaches. In a February 8, 2019, report for InvestigateWest, Lee van der Voo reported that a study of
                    Oregon high schools discovered that high schools with athletic trainers were much more likely to diag-
                    nose concussions in high school football players.

                       2. Second, it is a fairer system. The risks of football are the same whether a student plays for a school
                    with access to good medical care or not; we would end a two-tiered system of care for those who play by
                    making sure every football program or school district offers skilled care to players.
             C. There are also drawbacks to this approach.

                       1. The first is cost. Skilled personnel are costly, and many school districts might have to take money
                    away from other programs if they were forced to provide skilled trainers or more nursing staff for athlet-
                    ics.

                       2. The second drawback is the possibility of medical personnel being pressured to not report concus-
                    sions. A 2019 survey of college and university athletic trainers by the National Athletic Trainers Associa-
                    tion found that 10% reported being pressured "to make a decision that was not in the best interest of a
                    student athlete's health" (Only Half of Collegiate Sports).
             * (Transition) Now that we have examined a third solution to the problem of concussions and high school
          football, I will conclude by reviewing what my speech has covered and then turn this topic over to you--the con-
          cerned community members--for deliberation.
   VI. Conclusion
   The conclusion is clearly labeled, and the content that follows is subordinated to the Roman numeral and label. In this
conclusion, Javon reminds the audience of the problem that leads to the need for deliberation. He restates the focus question
that appears as part of the thesis.
             A. (Thesis) When Brian Ramos was injured during the homecoming game, it was clear our community was ready
          to do something about high school football and concussions. But how can we best address concussions in high
          school football? My speech today has used this focus question to explore three different solutions.
             Next, Javon briefly summarizes the three solutions he covered.
             B. The first solution we explored was to divert resources from the high school football program and invest in
          clubs and sports that kids can pursue for a lifetime. The second solution was to change the culture of football,
          specifically the aspect that encourages players to downplay or ignore their injuries. The final approach stressed
          the necessity of better-trained medical care to support coaches and players.
             Javon closes by turning the question for deliberation over to the audience.
             C. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. As you consider these solutions and weigh the
          values they prioritize, what do you think is the best way for Columbus to address our shared concern for our
          football players?

Riley's Advocacy Speech for Animal Welfare Activism

Pattern of Arrangement:
Problem-Alternatives-Solution

Purpose statement: To urge audience members to

become animal welfare educators in our county.

The purpose statement is an important focusing step in

the speech-writing process but will be eliminated in deliv

ery.

I. Introduction

      A. In 2020, the Netflix documentary series Tiger

      King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness aired and

      became widely popular.                                 Image via Rawpixel, Public Domain.

      1. The series featured Joe Exotic, who

      owned an Oklahoma roadside zoo that mostly housed tigers and big cats. According to Sharon Guynup's

      January 4, 2020, National Geographic report, it was "one of the largest tiger breeding and cub-petting

      photo op attractions in the U.S." (Guynup).

      2. Tiger King followed Exotic's feud with Carole Baskin, who ran a cat sanctuary and accused Exotic of

      animal abuse. Her threats caused Joe to attempt to murder Baskin by hiring two hitmen.

      3. On April 2, 2018, Exotic was found guilty of two counts of murder-for-hire as well as seventeen

      wildlife charges. Specifically, according to Guynup, "Joe Exotic was convicted of killing five tigers, shoot-

      ing them in the head to make room for other cats. He sold and trafficked tigers and other endangered

      species and falsified government documents to hide his activities in violation of federal laws" (Guynup).

      The introduction should get attention. Riley chooses the strategy of naming a popular Netflix show that

      some audience members may recall.

      B. Many of you may have heard of or even watched Tiger King, or you may have laughed at parodies and memes

      of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin. But how many of us have focused on the animals who were treated cruelly?

      C. Today I want to talk about this issue that is of great importance to me, and I know to many of you as well.

      I'm an animal lover, and I became aware of animal abuse in our county through my volunteer work at the animal

      shelter. I was saddened by the Tiger King story and was motivated to do something locally.

      By turning from the national stage to the local county, Riley raises a need for their community to think about these

      issues. Stating Riley's own investment and acknowledging that some audience members care about animal rights

      helps Riley build credibility and audience engagement.

      1. Animal abuse is not only an issue in Oklahoma or for big cats; we see animals abused right here in

      Montgomery County.

      2. But the good news is, there are ways we can quickly and tangibly change the lives of local pets.

      D. (Thesis) There are several ways to support our local animal control agency's power to remove and care for

                                                   Appendix B: Sample Preparation Outline for a Persuasive Speech | 477
          abused animals in Montgomery County, but the most important thing you can do is to increase awareness in our
          county so more people know what counts as abuse and how to report it.

             Thesis is clearly marked and stated.
             E. In my speech, I will first establish the problem of animal neglect and cruelty in our county and state. Next, I
          will examine a frequently proposed solution and tell you why it will not make an immediate difference in the lives
          of our animal friends. Then I will advocate my preferred approach of educating the public about animal abuse,
          and I'll tell you specific ways you can help spread the word.
             The preview is an important signpost. It tells the audience where you are going and helps them know what to
          listen for.
             * (Transition): Let me begin with the problem.
   II. Animals are being abused and neglected in our county and state.
             A. According to a January 28, 2016, news report by WUSA9, a Rockville woman was discovered with sixty-six
          dogs in her home. Three of the dogs had to be euthanized immediately because of neglect. The woman was fined
          $1,000 and given six months in jail with the possibility of owning dogs again in the future ("Woman Arrested";
          WUSA).
             B. In the fall of 2023, dozens of cats and kittens were dumped in the Wheaton area. A group of animal rescuers
          said the cats were "scared and hungry" (Davison).
             C. On March 18, 2024, Greg Wehner reported for Fox News that two Maryland men were charged with animal
          cruelty after the charred remains of seven dogs were found in a burn pile on their property along with the skele-
          tal remains of several additional dogs (Wehner).
             D. These are just the cases that drew news attention in our state. How many acts of cruelty do we not know
          about? Clearly, we need to do better for our animals.
             * (Transition) Having addressed the problem of animal cruelty in our county and state, I will now turn to a
          potential solution to this problem.
             This transition contains a mini summary and mini preview.
   III. A frequently proposed solution in our county is that we stiffen penalties against abusers.
             A. Advocates say the current legislation isn't tough enough.

                       1. According to the Montgomery County Animal Services and Adoption Center, the current minimum
                    fine of only $500 is given to anyone who fails to provide for their pet "proper vet care," "proper food or
                    water," "proper space," and "proper shelter" ("Animal Control").

                       Here we see the required spoken citation of the source for the quotation that Riley includes.
                       2. The WUSA9 report I mentioned earlier states that the current penalty for people who neglect animals
                    to the point that the animals have to be euthanized, like in the Rockville case, is a $1,000 fine and ninety
                    days in jail.
             B. Some people propose we toughen these penalties.
                       1. According to Lindsay Watt, in a March 9, 2022, report for Fox 5, Maryland Senate Bill 672 sought to
                    increase the penalty for neglect to a $5,000 fine and three years in prison (Watts).
                       2. In 2018, the Maryland legislation considered a bill to outlaw the selling of cats and dogs at retail pet
                    stores in order to end the existence of puppy mills that breed dogs in cruel conditions (Chason).
                       3. Advocates hope such laws would show that we take animal welfare seriously and deter offenders.
             C. While I support tougher penalties, I don't think they are the best solution for increasing the quality of life
          for pets in our county for a couple of reasons.
                       1. First, they are hard and slow to pass. For example,
                       Riley uses internal signposts ( first, second) to help the audience follow the progression of their argument.

                                 a. Maryland's Senate Bill 672 died in committee.
                                 b. The state bill against retail stores selling dogs and cats was signed into law in 2018, but it was
                              then tied up in courts for two years until a judge upheld the ban (Chason).
                       2. Second, laws are difficult to enforce.

478 | Appendix B: Sample Preparation Outline for a Persuasive Speech
                       The principle of subordination is at work here and throughout the outline. Those items listed as a, b, c, and
                    d are all in support of item 2.

                                 a. Local animal control and welfare agencies must have knowledge of animal mistreatment in
                              order to intervene, but much abuse takes place on private property, where witnesses are unlikely
                              to see or hear it.

                                 b. In addition, animal welfare agencies tend to lack personnel to look for and ticket those break-
                              ing the law.

                                 c. Researchers refer to all of this as the "enforcement gap." In a 2022 article published in the jour-
                              nal Animals, M. B. Rodriquez Ferree explains that the "enforcement gap" occurs "between welfare
                              legislation as declared, and the actual enforcement of that legislation." Rodriquez Ferre declares
                              that this gap is "well-documented" (Rodriquez Ferre).

                                 d. In a 2020 article in the same journal, Rochelle Morton and three coauthors identify causes
                              for the enforcement gap occurring at multiple stages of the process, from reporting the abuse to
                              court determinations (Morton et al.).
                       3. Consequently, passing tougher laws to address animal cruelty is difficult, slow, and hard to enforce.
                       * (Transition) Now that I have critiqued a popular solution for decreasing animal abuse in Montgomery
                    County, I will next turn to my preferred approach.
   IV. Instead of focusing more time and energy on changing laws, I recommend we take the more immediately effective
approach of increasing awareness in our county so more people know what counts as animal abuse and how to report
it.
             A. A 2020 study published in Animals reviewed previous research on the enforcement gap (Morton et al.).
                       1. One study reviewed found that 27% of respondents did not know how to appropriately report a case
                    of animal cruelty.
                       2. Another study reviewed discovered that the public did not understand what legally qualified as animal
                    abuse.
                       3. The reviewers suggested that "rectification of reporting issues is likely best achieved through public
                    education, focused on the identity of the appropriate enforcement agency and what constitutes an animal
                    welfare offence" (Morton et al.).
             B. There are also several ways you can participate in raising awareness to help the public know what counts as
          animal abuse and how to report it.
             Notice how Riley ends their speech with a clear call to action and one that encourages civic engagement.
                       1. Use social media to broadcast pet news in our county.

                                 a. Spread news about pet abuse and neglect to broaden awareness of this issue.
                                 b. Spread news about current laws protecting animals.
                                 c. Publicize agencies and phone numbers residents can call if they witness abuse or neglect.
                                 d. Follow the Montgomery County Humane Society on Instagram and "like" them on Facebook.
                       2. Also, make and circulate posters and fact sheets about animal protection laws and phone numbers
                    concerned residents can call if they are worried about the life of a local animal.
             C. The solution of spreading awareness can have an effective, more immediate impact on the lives of neglected
          pets than waiting for the laws to change.
                       1. When residents are frequently reminded about the existing laws, they become more watchful of the
                    needs of animals in their neighborhoods.
                       2. When they know where and how to report animal abuse, they are more likely to follow up on some-
                    thing they witness.
                       * (Transition) I explained what I believe to be the most viable and immediate solution to the problem of
                    pet abuse and neglect, and so I turn to my conclusion.
                       Signaling the conclusion often makes the audience more attentive--but don't abuse this verbal device by
                    using it more than once or using it too early in the speech.

                                                                                         Appendix B: Sample Preparation Outline for a Persuasive Speech | 479
   V. Conclusion
             A. (Thesis) In my speech today, I have argued that we should spread awareness about what counts as animal

          abuse and how to report it.
             B. I explained that animal neglect and cruelty sadly exist in our county and state. I contended that we should

          not spend more time and energy on stiffer laws to penalize abusers because this approach is too difficult, slow,
          and hard to enforce. Instead, I encouraged you to spread awareness through social media posts and posters.

             Riley restates the thesis and mentions their main points.
             C. We can make a big difference in the lives of many animals and doing so is good for us. As the famous medical
          missionary Albert Schweitzer said, "Until he extends the circle of his compassion to all living things, man"--or we
          might say humans today--"will not himself find peace" (Global Animal).
             Riley ends decisively with a memorable quotation.

Javon's Speech to Inform Community Members About Multiple Perspectives
on High School Football and Concussions Before They Engage in a
Deliberative Discussion

   Notice there is no purpose statement. Purpose statements
are important for thinking and planning but are not part of
the oral presentation itself.

   I. Introduction
             A. Brian Ramos's injury
                       1. Parents blamed coaches.
                       2. Coaches blamed school districts.
                       3. Both blamed players.
                       4. Media, whole country blamed "football
                    culture."
                       Complete sentences are condensed. There
                    is just enough for Javon to recall the
                    thoughts he wants to convey. Not writing Football players by Muyuan Ma via Unsplash, Unsplash License.
                    everything out word for word will encourage
                    him to look up and connect with his audience, especially at the start of the speech.
             B. Needed fewer concussions; feared football's benefits misunderstood.
             C. Member of the team and a friend. Looking at a problem from one angle is a poor way to make decisions.
             The thesis, however, is written out because it's important to get it right.
             D. (Thesis) So the first thing we in Columbus need is a fuller understanding of the problem itself as well as mul-

          tiple perspectives on concussions in high school football before we are ready to advocate and implement specific
          changes. With this goal in mind, the question that guides my speech this morning is, [SLOW DOWN] How can we
          best address the issue of concussions in high school football?

             Javon added a delivery note here to remind himself to slow down so the audience will not miss his thesis statement.
             E. Start by outlining problem. Then three solutions: first redirecting resources, second changing the culture of
          football, third more funding for medical expertise.
             Notice that Javon put the different elements of his preview in bold so he can easily spot them during delivery. The
          bold print will help Javon see the parts of a longer point if he glances down at the notes partway through.
             * (Transition) Begin by outlining the problem.
   II. Concussions a real danger. Mild type of traumatic brain injury.
             A. According to an October 29, 2024, report entitled "TBI Data" produced by the Centers for Disease Control
          and Prevention (CDC), there are more than 586 traumatic brain injury-related hospitalizations and 190 TBI-
          related deaths per day. Football is a contributor.
             The keyword outline includes spoken citations, written out for accuracy. Javon underlines these citations as well
          to ensure he can easily find them while speaking extemporaneously. There is no need to include written in-text cita

                                                                            Appendix C: Sample Presentation Outline for an Extemporaneous Delivery | 481
          tions in a presentation outline, since you do not say those out loud. The presentation outline also does not include a
          bibliography.

                       1. According to a study published in the 2021 edition of Sports Health, the sport most likely to see con-
                    cussed male athletes is football.

                       Notice that the information cited can also be written out for accuracy. However, Javon refers to eight coau
                    thors rather than naming every one of them.

                       2. A February 23, 2021, study published in Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach by a group of eight
                    coauthors found that kids aged six to fourteen years old who played tackle football experienced nearly
                    fifteen times more head impacts during a game or practice compared to kids who played flag football.
                    [PAUSE]

                       Javon includes a note to pause here to allow the prevalence of concussions to sink in for the audience before
                    moving to his next subpoint.
             B. Athletes with three or more concussions experience enduring negative impact. According to a 2023 report
          by Donna Lu and Stephanie Convery for The Guardian, a study found that:

                       1. Three concussions permanently affect ability to plan and to pay attention.
                       2. Four concussions negatively impact memory and processing speeds.
                       3. Dr. Matthew Lennon, the study's lead author, clarified, "If you have multiple concussions in your
                    teens, 20s, 30s and 40s, you will still be feeling the effects when you're 70 or 80."
                       The coordination and parallelism of the outline remain. If Javon loses his place within point B, subpoint 1,
                    he can more easily locate subpoints 2 and 3 to find his way again.
             C. Many head injuries in high school sports go unreported.
                       1. One reason: The culture of football. A widely cited and NFL-funded study published in 2014, titled
                    Sports-Related Concussions in Youth, reports that athletes are reluctant to report concussions and even
                    lax about following treatment plans when they have been diagnosed because it may not be perceived as
                    "manly" to follow the doctor's orders.
                       2. Second reason: Too few medical personnel available. According to a 2020 study of Massachusetts
                    high schools that was published in Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation by six coauthors, "55%
                    of the high schools" studied didn't "have a full-time athletic trainer and 50% did[n't] have a team physi-
                    cian."
                       * (Transition) [LOUDER] Now that I covered the problem of concussions, I will move to the first per-
                    spective.
                       Javon adds a reminder here to say the transition a bit more loudly so the audience will take note of the
                    shift to solutions.
   III. First solution: Redirect resources.
             A. Argues that adults make tough decisions. "My son can play any sport but football."
                       1. Sample action 1: Reallocate funds to sports students can play for a lifetime.

                                 a. Outgrow football but live with lingering ailments.
                                 b. Hiking, golf, and canoeing.
                       2. Sample action 2: Move volleyball to Friday nights.
                       3. Prioritizing value: Lifelong health.
             B. Benefits:
                       1. Gain physical fitness and reduce concussions and pressure. Chase Ray explains in their 2018 article
                    published in City Scene Magazine, "Non-contact sports...still provide all the same health benefits without
                    encouraging physical collision between players."
                       2. Invest in lifetime fitness. Schools refocused as educational institutions.
             C. Drawbacks:
                       1. Lessons of football.
                       2. Important outlet for ritualized aggression. Jonathan Chait, in his 2014 column in New York Magazine,

482 | Appendix C: Sample Presentation Outline for an Extemporaneous Delivery
                 argues that football doesn't feed or promote aggression; rather--and especially in high school--it may pro-
                 vide a suitable channel for kids to express aggression. Not the same in diving or golf.

                    * (Transition) [PAUSE] Having covered the first solution, I will move to the second solution.
IV. Second solution: Change in culture of football.

          A. Argues we change the culture of toughness that dominates football. The Sports-Related Concussions in Youth
       study I referred to in the introduction calls for a change in culture as one of its official recommendations.

                    1. Suggestion 1: Encourage players to express their feelings. Mimic Men of the House in Pittsburgh. Point
                 to NFL players as models.

                    2. Suggestion 2: New catchphrases; CDC's HEADS UP educational materials: "It's better to miss one
                 game than the whole season."

                    Direct quotations are written word for word so Javon states them accurately.
                    3. Prioritizing value: Education.
          B. Benefits:
                    1. Addresses hypermasculinity.
                    2. Extends to parents, fans, and community members.
          C. Drawbacks:
                    1. Possible? Change the game beyond recognition?
                    2. Time.
                    * (Transition) [LOUDER] Having looked at a second solution, I will move to the third and final solution.
                    Signposting language in transitions is bolded to help orient Javon during delivery.
V. Third solution: Better, more consistent medical care.
          A. Argues that increased access likely to result in higher reporting.
                    1. Sample action 1: Advocate for better medical care with school boards and community partners.
                    2. Sample action 2: Require football programs to fund a certified athletic trainer.
                    3. Prioritizing value: Safety.
          B. Benefits:
                    1. Ensures good medical care; takes some burden off coaches. In a February 8, 2019, report for Investi
                 gateWest, Lee van der Voo reported that a study of Oregon high schools discovered that high schools with
                 athletic trainers were much more likely to diagnose concussions in high school football players.
                    2. Fairer. Would end a two-tiered system of care.
          C. Drawbacks:
                    1. Cost.
                    2. Medical personnel being pressured to not report. [SLOW] A 2019 survey of college and university ath
                 letic trainers by the National Athletic Trainers Association found that 10% reported being pressured "to
                 make a decision that was not in the best interest of a student athlete's health."
                    Javon knows he tends to say this citation too quickly, so he leaves a note to slow down here.
                    * (Transition) Now that we examined a third solution, I will conclude.
VI. Conclusion
          A. (Thesis) [LOUD] Brian Ramos's injury was the final straw. We had to do something. But how can we best
       address concussions in high school football? This has been my focus question.
          The thesis is written fully out again.
          B. The first solution: Divert resources. The second solution: Change the culture of football. The third solution:
       Advocate for better-trained medical care to support coaches.
          C. Each has advantages and disadvantages.
          [PAUSE] What do you think is the best way for Columbus to address our shared concern for our football
       players?
          Javon concludes by turning his guiding question over to the audience for a deliberative discussion.

                                                                        Appendix C: Sample Presentation Outline for an Extemporaneous Delivery | 483
