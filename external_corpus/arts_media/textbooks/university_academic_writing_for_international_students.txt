CAROL LYNN MODER

Overview of the Book

This textbook is designed specifically to meet the academic writing needs of international students studying at
universities in the United States. The materials in the book can be covered within a 14-week semester, but each chapter
or section may also be used independently.

   Based on a series of needs analysis projects, this textbook provides an overview of major rhetorical patterns of writing
that are commonly used in university settings in the United States.

   These commonly required genres include descriptive and evaluative summaries, short essays, comparison and
contrast assignments, literature reviews, descriptive reports, and proposals. The textbook includes chapters that
address the structure and purpose of these more common genres, including an awareness of the ways that the target
audience and situation should shape the writing of each.

   A second important focus of the textbook is teaching students how to make effective use of sources within established
academic integrity standards. Many international students come from academic environments in which intellectual
property is viewed as common to the community rather than belonging to an individual. Their prior academic writing
experience has generally not placed great emphasis on "giving credit" for ideas and words to a particular author. The
result is confusion about exactly how to avoid plagiarism. In this textbook, we incorporate a treatment of these issues
into the various chapters of the book. Using an iterative approach, we give students repeated exposure to standards
and practices. This iteration improves the students' ability to master these potentially unfamiliar practices.

   The third focus of the book is on key grammatical forms and constructions that are important in each of the types
of writing the students will practice. Although many other textbooks include grammar exercises, these are typically
presented in relation to isolated sentences, rather than integrated into the complex context of a particular assignment.
International composition students are often able to perform well on sentence-based exercises because these exercises
do not capture the complex content or structures that create errors in their academic writing. By treating grammar
integratively in context, we hope to address more effectively the aspects that cause difficulties in academic writing.
These sections are also presented cyclically, so that students will have multiple opportunities to practice and integrate
key grammatical features. To do so, the authors of the book have employed a usage-based approach, examining in detail
the grammatical structures used in both published and student writing in each of the genres of writing we discuss. All
examples used in the book come from authentic examples of university or professional academic writing.

                                                                                                                                                         OVerview of the Book | 1
OpenOKState and Student Privacy

OpenOKState and the OSU Libraries Library Teaching and Learning (T&L) Team* strive to enable engaging learning
experiences for students using a variety of digital resources**. When you--the student--use these resources, you're
likely to produce some data, such as data about how you used the resources (e.g., what you clicked on) or the content
you produced while using the resources (e.g., answering a question).

   In line with our values and our beliefs about student data privacy, our T&L team has created and closely follows a set
of guidelines, made up of 5 core principles, for any type of student data we might come in contact with.

   We aim to be exceedingly transparent with you about your data. On this page, you can learn about our team's values
and beliefs regarding student data privacy as well as explore the 5 core principles of our Student Data Privacy Guidelines.

   If you have any questions about these guidelines or about your data privacy, please don't hesitate to contact the
Director of Library Teaching and Learning, Holly Reiter, at holly.reiter@okstate.edu.

   *The data and Guidelines referenced on this page are unique to Library Teaching & Learning, and do not indicate
guidelines for the Library or the University as a whole.

   **For our purposes, digital learning objects include interactive tutorials, OStateTV or YouTube videos, the mobile
Library Scavenger Hunt, visits to web pages that host these items, Pressbooks, and graduate student workshop
registration.

Values and Beliefs

Values

Our Library Teaching and Learning team values:

  · Prioritizing student needs and welfare
  · Restoring and protecting equity and assisting students in doing the same
  · Incorporating student voice and experiences and using it to shape our practice
  · Providing "digital sanctuaries," or digital environments that prioritize and promote student safety

Student Data Privacy Beliefs

As a Teaching and Learning team, we have foundational, ethical, scholarship-shaped beliefs about student data that have
shaped our student data practice and guidelines.

   We believe in prioritizing student data privacy to...

  · Protect students
  · Respect student autonomy
  · Return power to students and establish equity
  · Protect students' intellectual freedom
  · Build trust between students and Library Teaching and Learning
  · Enable student data privacy literacy

Core Principles of Student Data Privacy

Responsibility

The Teaching and Learning team believes it's our ethical responsibility to protect your data privacy. Specifically, we
uphold the responsibility to:

  · Ensure any collected data is handled carefully, used effectively, and used only for the stated purpose.
  · Prevent unauthorized disclosure, use, or collection of your data
  · Follow specific steps in data collection, use, storage, and destruction.
  · Carry a shared understanding of our role in your data privacy.

Transparency

T&L believes you shouldn't have to wonder what's happening with your data, so we strive to be as open and transparent
with you as possible. For each digital learning object we use, we'll share the following:

  · What we are and are not collecting
  · Why we're collecting it
  · How it's being collected
  · How it's being used
  · Who has access to the data

To keep you safe, we strive to store and process all data according to best practices. We'll only collect the minimum
amount of data necessary to achieve our stated objectives.

Privacy and Consent

T&L believes that privacy is your right. We strive to honor your privacy by never releasing any personally identifiable
information unless it is to your instructor of record who is using the digital learning object within their class.

   Occasionally, we may share aggregates of de-identified or anonymized data internally (e.g., with Library
administrators) or externally (e.g., at Library or industry conferences). We do this to continuously improve effectiveness,
evaluate the effectiveness of our teaching and learning program, or to help evolve and shape the practices of our
profession. Aggregating the data means that the data is in summary form and no individual student can be identified.

   Finally, we will never sell or otherwise commodify your data, and will always prioritize the use of vendors and
resources that do the same.

Confidentiality and Security

T&L takes great strides to ensure that any and all data we collect is kept confidential and secure.

                                                                                                                                      OpenOKState and Student Privacy | 3
   We use several vendors to help us create and host digital learning objects and collect analytics. Sometimes, these
vendors have access to your personally identifiable information for operational purposes, so we intentionally investigate
and select vendors that also prioritize confidentiality and security.

Access

Sometimes we do collect and store personally identifiable information so we can do things like retain records for your
instructor of record or keep track of event registrations. In these cases, T&L believes you have the right to know what
that data is, request corrections if you think it's incorrect, and request that it be deleted. Please note, we'll always make
every effort to honor deletion requests, but sometimes we're required to retain records for various reasons. If that's the
case, we'll be open about why we can't delete it now, and if and when it can be deleted.

Acknowledgements

Library Teaching and Learning would like to acknowledge several projects that helped inform our Guidelines. We extend
our sincerest gratitude for the effort and dedication that individuals invested in these works.

WRITING THROUGH NARRATIVE

Why the Narrative Essay?

If you're like many college students, you have never written a narrative essay (and perhaps have never even heard of it),
and that's okay. This chapter is designed to help you understand why it's included as one of your writing assignments,
what separates it from other styles of writing, how to most effectively structure it, and what outcomes you should hope
to achieve once you've written it.

   The narrative essay provides a unique opportunity for you to tell a personal story within the context of academic
writing. Although empirical research and data are certainly vital in academia, personal experiences can provide
intriguing perspectives in helping us better understand the world in which we live, and should therefore be valued as a
useful form of academic writing as well. An added benefit to the writer is it narrative essays tend to be more enjoyable
to write than other types of essays because of the emphasis on personal storytelling: narrative writing encourages you
to express yourself by sharing personal experiences in a way most other forms of academic writing do not. Because
you're telling a story, you should definitely consider how you incorporate the various components that make up a story.
For instance, the beginning of a story is where you are introduced to the story's setting and main characters; therefore
your introduction should include this information. The middle of the story is where major developments, rising action,
climax, and falling action take place, which corresponds directly to your body paragraph. Lastly, the end of the story
contains the resolution, which in your narrative essay will be your thesis and any other last insights you want to leave
with your audience.

   It is important to keep in mind, though, that you are not simply telling the story to entertain or amuse use; the purpose
of a narrative essay is to communicate with specific message to your audience did the use of personal stories and
examples. Thus, you must intentionally choose personal experiences from your past that enable you to communicate
and meaningful message to your audience. Given a writing prompt, your audience will often be specified to help you
better understand for whom you are writing and why. However, in cases where your audience is not specified, you
should consider your audience to be someone who is interested in how your personal experiences provide insight into
the particular topic you're writing about.

   Considering your audience is crucial because your audience determines the particular style with which you
communicate your message. If you are skeptical regarding this truth or simply feel ill-equipped to properly address your
audience, consider the following examples. Do you speak to your grandparents differently than the way you speak to
your best friend? Does an email you sent to a classmate sound different than the one you sent your professor? If the
answers to these questions seem like an obvious "YES" (and they should), you can understand how audience shapes the
way we communicate with one another and should therefore keep this in mind as you write your essays.

                                                                                                                                                 Writing Through Narrative | 5

Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay

SETH FRENCH

Telling a Story vs. Exploring a Topic

Most essays you have written up to this point in your academic career have likely introduced you to a certain topic
and then asked you to explore that topic with three or more main points/examples/arguments. The narrative essay, in
contrast, requires you to tell a story in order to communicate the specific message related to your writing topic. While
there is certainly nothing wrong with other types of essays, it is vital that you approach this essay differently than how
you approached others in order to successfully achieved a narrative style that is required.

   Once you receive your writing prompt, begin brainstorming by thinking about what experiences from your past relate
to the particular topic you're writing about. As you recall these experiences, try to narrow down the experiences you
will include in your essay to the best one or two that you think would be most appropriate to write about. Since you are
writing a narrative essay, not a narrative chapter or book, the more stories you include, the less detail you will be able
to include because you will simply run out of space. So, it's best to focus on one or two personal stories that correspond
well with the writing prompt so you can go into as much detail as possible.

   Once you have selected the best personal example(s) you will write about, remember that you are telling a story, so
your essay should include elements which are typically present in stories, such as the setting, characters, problem/
conflict, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. While the level of detail you include regarding each of these
elements will vary depending on your particular essay, be sure you don't forget to discuss aspects that will help your
reader better visualize the story you are telling them.

Use of Personal Pronouns

Language components of the narrative essay that separate it from other forms of writing are the common use of
personal pronouns (I, me, my, we, our(s), mine), sensory language (taste, hear, smell, feel, see), dialogue, and the historical
present / past tenses. Other forms of academic writing favor passive voice in which the agent is hidden and personal
pronouns are limited, if not altogether absent. However, in the narrative essay you are sharing a personal experience
with your audience, so it will sound most appropriate for you to use personal pronouns throughout your essay rather
than use passive voice. In other words, if you were going to tell me about an event you attended with your friends, it
would be more appropriate for you to say something such as, "We all had a really great time," rather than, "A great time
was had by everyone."

Use of Sensory Language

Sensory language is often encouraged in narrative writing because it helps your audience bring themselves into your
story as you share with them details that only you can tell them. When you read or hear some of your favorite stories,
is it easy for you to visualize what the author is describing? If so, it is probably because the author is skilled at using
sensory language to tell the story. While it is probably not necessary to include each of the five senses when you

                                                                                                                       Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay | 7
describe a particular event, you should consider which sensory details would be most useful for you to include in
order to help your audience better visualize the setting(s) you describe. For instance, if your narrative setting were a
concert, you would probably discuss the sights and sounds you experienced at that time as useful sensory details for
your audience. On the other hand, if your narrative setting were a restaurant, it would perhaps make the most sense to
discuss the smells and tastes you experienced. Thus, when you construct your narrative essay, consider which sensory
details would be useful for you to include in order to more effectively engage your audience.

Use of Dialogue

The effective use of dialogue is another way of engaging your audience. Since your narrative essay contains characters
who are interacting with one another, you should feel encouraged to share moments of dialogue within your narrative
because it enables you to transition from simply telling your audience about what's happening to actually immersing
them in what's happening.

   Think for a moment about the conversations you have with your friends on a regular basis. When you're telling them
about an interaction you had with someone else or an event you witnessed, you probably include the dialogue from that
other situation without even realizing it. The reason we do this often instinctively is because we understand that stories
with dialogue are generally more interesting than those without dialogue.

   For example, "When I was at Walmart the other day, I saw two men getting into an argument. The guy wearing the blue
hat said, `I saw you trying to steal those. You better pay for them.' Then the other guy said, `It's none of your business.'
That made the guy in the blue hat mad, so he said, `You better pay for those, or else...' They almost got into a fight. It
made me really nervous to watch."

   Now, compare that to the following example: "When I was at Walmart the other day, I saw a guy with a blue hat arguing
with another guy because the other guy was stealing something. They argued back and forth and almost got into a fight.
It made me really nervous to watch."

   Which story is more intriguing, the first or the second? The first one, right? It's funny how a small change like
including dialogue can create such a significant difference in terms of engaging your audience.

Use of Historical Present and Past Tenses

Finally, the frequent use of historical present and past tense verbs also sets the narrative essay apart from other essays
you may be used to writing. In many other academic writing contexts, present tense verbs are favored because they
communicate general or ongoing events, truths, or realities. Present tense is a useful default tense to write in when your
writing context is not particularly interested in the aspect of time. The narrative essay, in contrast, certainly emphasizes
the aspect of time because you are telling a story which occurred in the past. Consequently, using the historical present
or past tense to write about these events will work best in this context.

   The historical present tense is useful when you are discussing an event that occurred in the past but would like to
convey a sense of immediacy with it, as the following example illustrates: "So, I am at my house, and guess who calls me
. . . My boss! I was worried at first, but then she tells me that she wants to give me a promotion! Isn't that great?" In this
example, the speaker is telling her friend about the unexpected call she received from her boss while she was at home.
Rather than using all past tense verbs, the speaker uses the historical present tense to describe this event, which makes
her friend feel as though she is experiencing the event at that moment rather than simply hearing about it.

   Nevertheless, you should not feel as though you are restricted to using only these two verb tenses exclusively
throughout your essay. Your thesis will likely be written using present tense verbs because your thesis will communicate

8 | Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay
some truth or realization you have learned through the experiences you share in your narrative. For example, if I were
writing a narrative essay about a cultural tradition of the United States, I might write a thesis like this: "Celebrating
Thanksgiving with my family reminds me that even though life can be hard and relationships can be complicated, I have
so much to be thankful for." As a general rule, use historical present or past tense verbs to discuss the events in your
narrative which occurred in the past, and present tense verbs elsewhere. For more information regarding verb tense
sequencing, refer to the appropriate link near the end of the "Impact of the Thesis" chapter under the "Useful Links"
heading.

Chronological Organization

Since you are telling a story, it often makes the most sense to organize your essay chronologically in the order that
the events happened. In other essays, you will likely organize your points/examples/arguments in the order of their
importance or strength. The narrative essay, however, is easiest for your audience to follow if you structure the events
chronologically. If your narrative contains two stories rather than one, either of the following organizational strategies
can be effective:

 1. Oldest to most recent
2. Most recent to oldest
Whichever organizational strategy you select, make sure the last story you share is strong because it will be the last
opportunity you have to leave your audience with a positive impression of your essay.

   Because the organization of the narrative is chronological, the transitional expressions you use within and between
paragraphs will likely be chronological in nature as well. Consider using some of the following expressions and other
similar expressions to transition from one event to the next as you construct your narrative essay: Then, Next, After that,
Once that was over, When I/we had finished, Eventually, and Finally. Learning to use transitional expressions effectively
will greatly enhance the quality of your writing.

                                                                                                                       Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay | 9
The Impact of the Thesis

SETH FRENCH

Thoughts to Consider

As with any essay you write, your thesis is one of the most important components of your essay. As such, it is vital that
your thesis is clear and effectively addresses the writing prompt inside. For the narrative essay, your thesis will likely
be a realization you have come to or perhaps a life lesson you have learned from the story you are writing about. We
will discuss in a moment where in your essay you should include your thesis, but for now let's consider other important
thesis-related points to keep in mind as you compose your essay.

   Keep in mind that while you are telling a story with the narrative essay, the goal of your story is to support your
thesis. Regardless of how interesting or well-written your story may be, if it fails to support your thesis then you will
need to make significant revisions to it before submitting your final draft. When some students struggle to develop a
working thesis, they choose to simply construct the rest of their essay and then create their thesis later. This is not a
wise strategy. Your thesis should determine how you construct your essay, not vice versa. Thus, determining your thesis
should be one of your first objectives to complete in the composition process. Once you have your thesis, you may still
need to refine it throughout the drafting process, but the general idea of your thesis will likely remain the same.

   As you compose the various parts of your essay throughout the drafting process, you should repeatedly ask yourself,
"How does this support my thesis?" If you respond to this question honestly as you draft, you will be able to identify
the strengths of your essay as well as the weaknesses and address them accordingly. Failing to support your thesis is
generally the result of your details being insufficient, irrelevant, and/or incoherent. Therefore, if you are concerned
that you have not adequately supported your thesis in a particular portion of your essay, ensure that your details are
sufficient, relevant to your thesis, and coherently organized.

   You may include your thesis in either the introduction or the conclusion of your essay. To help you choose where it
would be best to include it for your particular essay, keep the following considerations in mind.

Thesis in Introduction

Including your thesis in the introduction is common across virtually all academic writing contexts because it helps you
establish a clear focus early in the essay and gives your audience a general idea of what your essay is about before
reading it in its entirety. Often you will find the thesis as either the first sentence or the last sentence in the introduction,
although including it as the last sentence of your introduction is more common and often preferred. Your introduction
does not need to be very long because the majority of what you communicate to your audience will be in the body of
your essay, but it should contain the following aspects: hook/attention getter, optional development sentence(s), and a
thesis.

   The first sentence of your essay is often called an attention getter or hook because you want to get your audience's
attention (or "hook" them) from the very beginning. Hooks can come in the form of thoughtful questions, relevant
statistics, intriguing quotes, or simply a well-crafted sentence. Thus, if you include your thesis as your very first
sentence, make sure it is something that will engage your audience because you don't want your audience to lose
interest in what you have to say. Then, the only other components you would need to include in the introduction are
development sentences if you feel that your audience needs a bit more information before you begin telling them your

story. On the other hand, if your thesis is the last sentence in your introduction, your structure will be hook, optional
development sentence(s), then thesis. When using this structure, just try to make sure that your thesis transitions
logically into your first body paragraph.

   Your body paragraphs are where you will tell your audience the story that makes up the majority of your narrative
essay. As previously mentioned, be very intentional as you compose this story because you are not simply telling a story
aimlessly; you are telling a story to support your thesis. After you've written your body paragraphs, all that's left is your
conclusion, which should restate your thesis (using slightly different wording) and offer any last insights you would like
to leave your audience with that you have not communicated elsewhere in your essay.

   Below is a list of pros and cons for this essay structure that you should consider as you determine which structure
works best for you.

          Pros:

            · An introduction with a thesis makes it clear to your audience for your essays about without reading
                your essay in its entirety.

            · With your thesis in the introduction, you can reference it as you develop your essay and ensure that
                each body paragraph supports your thesis coherently

            · Because this structure is common in many other academic writing contexts, you may have written
                this is similar structure in the past and find it easier to construct than the alternative.

          Cons:

            · It can be difficult to engage your audience throughout the essay if you tell them the overall message
                you want to hear at the beginning rather than at the end.

            · It does not follow the typical structure of a story throughout: setting, characters, problem/conflict,
                rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Instead, both the introduction and conclusion
                contain elements of your resolution, and the other elements are more or less confined to your body
                paragraphs.

            · · Because it does not follow the typical structure of a story, you may be tempted to simply write an
                essay with several main points that come in the form of story-like examples rather than telling a story
                as you should for the narrative essay.

Thesis in Conclusion

Including your thesis solely in your conclusion is less common than the alternative in most academic writing contexts.
Nevertheless, it corresponds to the typical structure of a story and is therefore perhaps more appropriate to use for the
narrative essay. As you draft, you may find it helpful to think about some of your favorite stories from books, television
shows, and/or movies and consider how they are structured. It is essential that you do not simply include a story with
a moral at the end of it where the story's details are unrelated, but rather be intentional in the details you share so that
they are directly tied to your thesis in the conclusion.

   As in the previous section, a list of pros and cons for this essay structure is included below to help you decide which

                                                                                                                                                   The Impact of the Thesis | 11
structure works best for you. You may notice that the pros from the previous section correspond in some ways to the
cons of this section, and vice versa.

          Pros:
            · This structure corresponds to the typical structure of stories where the resolution that the

                audience is left with comes near the end rather than the beginning. As a result, it is perhaps easier to
                engage your reader throughout the essay because they are waiting until the end for the story's
                resolution.
            · Following this structure almost ensures that your essay will be a narrative essay and that you won't
                be deducted points for writing a narrative-like essay that does not adequately meet the requirements
                of this genre.
          Cons:
            · You may not have experience composing essays with this structure and therefore find it more
                difficult to write than the alternative.
            · If you are not careful, your essay could seem somewhat aimless without a clear thesis in the
                introduction, and only seem clear when you reach the resolution at the end. Thus, you must be all the
                more intentional about the details you share leading up to your thesis and have a clear thesis in mind
                as you draft to ensure the remainder of your essay supports it.

Self-Evaluation Checklist

You're a busy college student, so you probably have several other assignments you are working on in addition to the
narrative essay. Because of this, you will be tempted to spend minimal time revising your essay once you've written it.
However, know that your grade will inevitably suffer if you spend little or no time revising your first draft. This section
is dedicated to helping you revise by showing you what specific outcomes you should aim for with your final draft. The
outcomes are broken down by category and are listed in the form of questions you should ask yourself when you have
finished your first draft.

Content

  · Do you have a clear thesis that is strong supported by your narrative?
  · Are the details in your narrative cleared relevant?
  · Is your narrative thoroughly developed or does it lack certain necessary points or narrative structure features

Thesis in Introduction: Based on an Essay by Xihong Su

Essay Prompt: Overall, has technology made your life better or worse? Think of specific moments in your life that
illustrate how your relationship with technology has developed throughout your life in order to answer this question.
Keep in mind that you're not just telling a story. You're writing an essay to support your response and using stories from
your life to illustrate your answer. You should incorporate details to highlight your point and engage a reader's interest.
Your essay should be approximately 750 words.

                                                         The Internet Has Made My Life Better
   While walking around campus, many students access the Internet by phone. They may chat with other people and
play games. While attending class, we may participate in class activities and upload homework to D2L on the Internet. If
there were no Internet, what would happen? Whether you recognize that the Internet has changed our lives or not, the
Internet does change our lives. In my opinion, the Internet has made my life better.
   The Internet has changed the way that I can communicate with friends. I left my hometown and went to the first
university about fifteen years ago. I was excited that I could make new friends and learn new knowledge from the
university. However, I missed my friends who were in other cities. I often mailed letters with some photos to my friends
and told them something interesting in campus and kept in touch with them. It often took several days or one week
to receive letters. Sometimes, a letter might be lost. In June 2001, to my joy, there was a public computer room where
students could access the Internet in the university. In the first few months, the computer room was full of students all
day long. At the same time, the Internet chat tool, QQ, became very popular among students. When my friends and I
were all available, I used QQ to chat with them face to face and heard their voices and saw their facial expressions. How
wonderful the Internet was! In addition, sending an email partly took the place of mailing a letter. I composed messages
with some digital pictures and sent them to my friend in an email. An email was almost instant and helped me learn
about information from friends as soon as possible. Now, I can post my latest information and pictures in my Facebook
that is a worldwide network service. All my friends in Facebook can see the information and comment on it and share it.
   The Internet provides me a lot of helpful information. First, as a student, I need to write some essays and research
papers. For example, one assignment I had was to write about King David. I searched the keywords "King David" in
relative databases in the OSU library and chose several papers that were most relative to King David. I also input "King
David" in Wikipedia and saw relative descriptions of King David from different perspectives. These published electronic
resources really helped me write a thoroughly researched paper.
   Second, after one day of classes, I wanted to make healthy and delicious foods in my dormitory. Before buying foods,
I looked for nutrition information of foods and decided which kind of foods I would buy. After I prepared my food
materials, YouTube videos of cooking foods guided me to cook foods step by step. No matter what level my cooking skills
were, if I followed the guidance I would make delicious foods.
   Third, because I like relaxing myself on holiday, traveling could be very important in my life. Before traveling, I may
try to find as much information as I can on the Internet, such as weather, transportation, hotels, ticket prices and local
foods. There are also travel guides and comments from other people who have been to scenic spots. Comments and
relative information helped me make a better traveling plan about three years ago. My husband and I spent one month
in traveling across half of China and enjoyed the travel. Therefore, there are a lot of electronic resources on the Internet.
It may be very difficult for me to get much useful information without the Internet in a short time.
   The Internet gives me more entertainment as well. First, there are many games that people can play together on the
Internet, such as Popkart. I liked playing Popkart about four years ago. I did not need to worry about the speed limit or

                                                                                                                                                   Sample Narrative Essays | 15
accidents that a car might cause while I was driving a car in the game. Second, many entertainment performances can
be found on the Internet. It may not be easy to see some live performances on TV, such as TV shows. However, I can find
TV Shows on the Internet and see them many times.

   The Internet enables me to communicate with other people in an effective way. It provides a lot of electronic
information and increases the speed of obtaining information that I want. It also enriches my life. Therefore, the Internet
has really made my life better.

Essay Prompt: For this essay you already food near to illustrate a key point about the relation to food culture and slash
for identity keep in mind that you're not just telling a story you're writing an essay to support your main point in using
a narrative using corporate details about your poison engage readers centers. Your essay should be approximately 750
words.

                                                                    "You've gotta' try this!"
   My obsession with trying different types of food began in my dad's second floor apartment in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The
apartment was "cool" because it was on the second floor. It had stone steps leading upward to the small patio and
doorway that was teeming with many varieties of potted plants. A person passing by could see the soft blanket of
colors that the flowers made against the railing of the patio - an urban jungle. My dad always had an interest in things
that many, who are familiar with gender roles, would call "feminine." These interests and passions consisted of potted
plants, metro-sexual fashion, wine, and of course, fine cuisine. My dad was the type of person who would go to the
grocery store to buy the freshest ingredients possible to try out the most recent recipe he had read in either his French
or German cookbook. He also enjoyed coming home with the most foul-smelling cheese you can imagine because
according to him "the stinky cheese is the best!" This sense of culinary adventure also extended into our experiences on
the nights when dad didn't feel like cooking.
   Dad always had a way of finding what he called a "hole-in-the-wall place." He always told me that "the hole-in-the-wall
places always have the best food!" and boy, did we live by this mantra. We often found ourselves at restaurants where
we were the only pair that spoke English. We would end up in the Mexican part of town at restaurants with the most
delicious, authentic food in town. We would also go to many different Asian restaurants and on special occasions, we
ended up at the nicest French restaurant in town and ate delicious, buttery escargot and flaky bread.
   My most vivid memory of adventuring into the world of food occurred at a small, "hole-in-the-wall" Japanese
restaurant called Ichiban. I was seven years old, and I loved Pokémon. The place was barely even visible from the road.
When you walked through the ordinary glass, you found yourself inside of the elegant world of Ichiban. Little red
cushioned chairs were neatly placed around square wooden tables. The red cushions gained even more vibrancy due to
the overall reddish glow of the restaurant's interior. A soft, red lighting beamed from lanterns that seemed to float in the
air, like lonely balloons that had been left behind after escaping a child's clutch. Bottles of Kikkoman brand soy sauce
found their homes atop the square wooden tables, and seemed to accessorize the little red cushioned chairs. When we
were seated, I did as any restaurant patron does: I looked at the menu and sipped on the glass of ice water in front of
me.
   As I was exploring the menu my dad leaned over and said to me: "You've gotta' try Tako salad!" The first thing I thought
of when my dad said "Tako salad" was the yummy combination of ground beef, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa, a dollop of
sour cream and various toppings of the consumer's choosing, that would all be served up in a crunchy, taco shell bowl.
Thus the name "Taco salad." When my dad asked me to try a food, I was always expected to give the dish a try. I was
never that kid who got chicken or spaghetti at every restaurant.
   I was a fearless and open-minded child who could never be labeled as picky eater. When my dad said we had to try the
Tako salad, I of course agreed to order it. When it arrived, I realized that this was not the Taco salad I had envisioned.

In front of me was a pure white bowl in the shape of a flower. In its center were colorful bits of cucumber with sesame
seeds, fresh strips of something soft and green, and glistening pieces of white edged in pinkish purple. My dad was
smiling at me.

   I picked up my chopsticks and put one of the thin white slices into my mouth. It was strange, chewy,
vinegary....delicious! We had ordered Tako Sun, cold octopus and vegetables in a sweet, savory vinegar sauce. That day
at Ichiban, a miraculous transformation happened: a seven year old girl, who loved Pokémon and was seated on a red
cushioned chair, fell in love with Asian cuisine. I began to make connections between food and culture. Japan is an island
nation surrounded by bodies of water. With this abundance of water, the Japanese enjoy many seafood dishes that are
not typically served in other cultures. One of those strange creatures is octopus. The simple elegant furnishings of the
restaurant and the beautiful white bowl and the elegant arrangement of each item in it spoke of the Japanese attention
to meticulous detail and fondness for precise rituals.

   I am forever grateful to my dad for taking me out of my comfort zone. He made me give different and exotic foods a
try. This did something even deeper for me than tantalize my taste buds: it made me love and appreciate cultures other
than my own. Food is now the focal point of my experience with other cultures, and I have blossomed into a lifelong
cross-cultural "foodie" thanks to the simple phrase my dad loved to say: "You've gotta' try this!"

WRITING FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES

At the University much of the writing that you do will be for the purpose of communicating information. In some cases,
you will write to demonstrate your own understanding of specific information. For example, in exams or assignments
you may be asked to explain or summarize information that you have read or heard in class. In other cases, you will
write to inform others about a topic on which you have gathered information. Examples of this include reports about
experiences, surveys or lab activities, as well as papers in which you read sources and describe previous research on a
particular topic.

   Because the specific purposes and audiences for informational writing vary greatly, it is important to pay close
attention to the assignment and to consider who the proposed audience is for your writing. The key to writing to convey
information effectively is to understand the point of view and previous knowledge of your reader. If the audience is
your instructor, make sure that you understand his or her expectations. Carefully read any information your instructor
provides about the assignment and make sure you understand what criteria the instructor will use to evaluate it. If the
instructor provides a rubric or a grading sheet, look at this before you start writing, and think about how you can best
shape your writing to fit the guidelines.

   If the writing assignment has a different audience, you should try to find as much information about your possible
readers as you can. You need especially to consider how much the possible readers know about your topic and try to
match the amount and type of information you provide to what those particular readers need to supplement what they
already know. For example, if you were writing about a concept or idea in your major for advanced students in that
major, you would assume that they already know something about basic information in the field. On the other hand, if
you are reading to introduce first-year students to the same topic, you would need to provide much more background
information. You might need to explain unfamiliar terms, give more details, or explain more specifically what links one
point to another.

          FOCUS: Reader's Knowledge & Point of View
           1. Assume that you are writing for a person of your own age from your own country. Describe your

                favorite food from your home country.
          2. Assume that you are writing for an American university student who has never been to your

                country. Describe your favorite food from your home country.
          Compare your two descriptions. How are they different? Why?

                                                                                                                                       Writing for Information Purposes | 19
20 | Writing for Information Purposes
Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples

CAROL LYNN MODER

In academic settings, writers commonly base the content of their writing on materials they have read. For example, an
instructor might ask you to describe or discuss specific information from an assigned reading (see Example 1). The first
step to approach this writing task is to carefully read the assignment in order to make sure you understand what it will
require.

          Example 1:
          Using information from The Cultural Feast and other assigned readings, Define ethnocentrism and
       cultural relativism. Provide specific examples of your reactions to the readings that might be instances of
       each.

   This assignment indicates that the instructor expects you to use one key reading, called The Cultural Feast and other
related readings to answer the question. The assignment makes clear that you need to have read these texts carefully
and to refer to the text in your answer. So how do you refer to those texts correctly?

Informal In-Text Citations

As you saw in earlier chapters, there are a variety of ways to refer to another text in your writing. For many kinds
of writing, you will have to use a formal documentation style, like APA, for your in-text citations and you will have to
provide a reference page, as well. And other kinds of writing, particularly if you are referring to readings assigned for a
class or if you are writing in a magazine or newspaper style, you may be allowed or expected to use a more informal way
of referring to a text. You should check in with your instructor about which approach he or she expects you to use.

   Note that the assignment in example one refers to the key text as The Cultural Feast. Here the instructor uses the title
of the text and puts it in italics. The italics show this is the title of the book. Know if you are writing by hand, you would
underline the title of the book, The Cultural Feast, since you can't put it in italics. The title of an article or chapter would
usually be put in quotation marks. In answer 2, we see this in the use of "Eating as a Cultural Affair." In this example, the
writer puts the title in parentheses and gives the specific page number, a variation on a more formal in-text citation. If
the instructor uses an informal citation in the question, it is probable that you can use it in your response. Remember,
though, that it is always a good idea to ask the instructor what in-text citation format he or she expects.

   A second in-text citation strategy is to use the name of the author of the article or book. We see this in Answer 1,
where the student writes: "In Davidson's article..."

                                                                                                                 Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples | 21

According to Bryant and colleagues,....
   The two most important aspects of citing texts to display knowledge are to be sure that: 1) you refer explicitly to
each specific reading you mentioned and 2) you make very clear when you are paraphrasing ideas or examples from the
readings.

Reading the assignment CAREFULLY

The most important part of writing to display knowledge is to read the assignment VERY CAREFULLY and make sure
you understand how many parts the question has and what they are. The most common mistake that students make on
such writing tasks is to read the question too quickly and, as a result, answer only part of it. The assignment in Example
1 asks the student to do two main tasks: DEFINE and PROVIDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.

   This is a typical format for some reading-based assignments and exam questions. In the two sample answers below,
we find two different ways of organizing the response. In Answer 1, the writer addresses the first part of the question,
defining the first term in the first sentence into the second term in the second sentence. The writer then provides
examples in the following sentences. This answer follows the order of the question - defining first and then providing
examples. In short answers of this kind, it is critical for the writer to make clear how he or she is connecting each
definition to the examples. One way to do this is to repeat key terms from the question to show clearly how the examples
illustrate the terms.

          Look at Answer 1 and underline each place where the writer uses the key terms ethnocentrism and
       cultural relativism or a variation of those terms. Why does the writer repeat the terms in those places?

   In this kind of writing, you need to be very clear which examples show the meaning of each term. Remember that you
are writing to display your own understanding of the terms. You should not leave it to the reader to guess.

          Answer 1
          Ethnocentrism is one's belief that they are superior and they judge other cultures based on the values and
       standards of their own culture. Cultural Relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs or behavior should be
       understood by others in terms of that person's own culture. When reading about eating insects in Eating is a
       Cultural Affair, my initial reaction was that it was gross and weird but I realized that I was being
       ethnocentric, rejecting the idea because it is odd in our culture. After stopping to think, when I tried to be
       more culturally relativistic, I realize that it is a common occurrence in many cultures in the insects can
       actually be a good source of protein. In Davidson's article, he describes the Europeans as having
       ethnocentric reactions to the new foods that were brought back from the Americas. They quickly adopted
       the new beans, because they were similar to some European varieties, but the stranger, unfamiliar foods,
       like tomatoes and potatoes, were viewed with suspicion and even assumed to be poisonous. The description
       of body images in The Cultural Feast takes a cultural relativism viewpoint, describing the health and beauty

                                                                                                                Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples | 23
       values that led traditional Polynesians to prefer fat bodies. We may not agree that obesity is beautiful, but
       we can try to understand how the Polynesians can see it that way.

          Answer 2
            · Ethnocentrism: viewing others cultures to your culture's lens and assuming that other cultures are

                           Reliance on cassava since it is low in nutrition but didn't require much cultivation, so they
                           called it the "lazy man's crop" and discouraged its cultivation. This reduced food security a bit,

24 | Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples
Writing from Data

CAROL LYNN MODER

Many academic writing tasks require you to present information that you have gathered or that you have been given in
to explain or interpret the information. One common way of presenting data is to use a table.

   Many beginning writers simply take the tables that they get from a database or statistical package and insert them
into their writing, but this practice is not usually very effective. When you present data in a table you should consider
whether the way you have labeled and organized it will be understandable to your audience. You should also consider
what your purpose as a writer is. Why are you presenting this information? What is the main idea that you want to
convey? Even when we are presenting numerical data, we as writers need to consider that the thesis of the writing is
and how we can make it clear to the audience. One important way of making sure the information in a table is clear is to
provide good labels.

TABLE 1: Health Statistics 2002 - 2003        France         USA
                                         72 years     69.3 years
Life Expectancy
Percent overweight (Body Mass Index 25)  49%          68%
Men
Women                                    35%          51%

   Consider Table 1. The title on the table "Health Statistics 2002-2003" gives the reader a very general idea of the kind
of information the table will contain and the dates it was collected, but it does not help the reader to understand what
the writer's main point is in presenting the table. What does the writer want the reader to focus on? By looking at the
headings for the columns on the right "France" and "USA," we can guess that the writer's focus is a comparison of the
two countries. The information in the rows suggests that the comparison will be related to "life expectancy" and the
"percent" of the population that were "overweight." By looking at these labels we can figure out what the purpose of the
comparison might be, but it would be much more effective if the writer put a title on the table that made its purpose
explicit.

       FOCUS: Labelling Tables
       Brainstorm some better titles for Table 1. Consider how each title might indicate the writer's main
    purpose.
       Why do you think the information about France is in the first column? What does the order of the
    columns suggest to you about the writer's focus?

The second key way to use the presentation of data to support your main purpose is to explain the information in the

                                                                                                                                                        Writing from Data | 25
table is clearly in the text of the writing. Do not assume that a reader will look at the table and understand it the way
you intend.

   FOCUS: Comparing for a purpose

   Look at Table 1 and write three statements that use the information in the table to compare France and
the USA.

   Think about the three statements you have written. How could you use them to develop a thesis? What
would the thesis be?

   The information in table 1 comes from an article by Paul Rozin in which he examines what has been called "The
French Paradox." From an American point of view, the paradox is that the French appear to eat food that is rich and
high in cholesterol - including cream, high-fat cheeses, and meats - but they seem to be healthier than Americans.
Since Americans generally believe that diet is a main factor in health and disease and since many diet experts in the U.S.
recommend low-fat diets, this combination of a rich diet and good health appears puzzling. To investigate the paradox,
Rozin and his colleagues conducted a survey of the attitudes about food of French and American college students. Some
of the survey results appear in Table 2. In Table 2, we provide the very specific title of the table that Rozin used in his
article. Note how clearly it defines the source of the information and its purpose. The box below gives an example of
how the results of the table could be described in the text to highlight the main purpose of the writer.

Prefer an inexpensive nutrient pill to eating                                                         26%        58%
                                                                                                      10%        27%

Prefer, at the same price, a luxury hotel with average food to a modest hotel with gourmet food  11%         77%

          In text description of Table 2 (based on Rozin 2005, p. S2010)

          Table 2 illustrates some major differences in French and American attitudes toward food and eating. For
       example, compared with the French study participants, much higher percentages of participants in the
       United States associated the words "heavy cream" with "unhealthy." More Americans said that they would
       prefer consuming an inexpensive nutrient pill to eating. Americans were also much more likely than the
       French to prefer, at the same price, a week at a luxury hotel with average food over a modest hotel with
       gourmet food. Overall, we found that for our survey participants, compared with Americans, the French
       seem to consider eating good food a more important part of life than Americans do.

Variation and Complexity

CAROL LYNN MODER

When making comparisons between and among groups, you need to be careful not to make over-generalizations. For
example, you would not want to say "French people are healthier than Americans" or "Americans do not care about the
quality of their food." In all groups there is some variation and a writer needs to be sure to limit big generalizations to
avoid stereotypes that suggest every member of a group is the same.

   First, you need to be careful NOT to assume that the people who responded to the survey represent all Americans or
all French people. For one thing, the respondents were college students. Older people in each country or less educated
people might or might not respond similarly. If you are writing from your own experience, you need to be careful in the
same way not to assume that the people you have met are just like everyone else in their group. If you are writing about
general assumptions that people have about different groups, you should be aware that all general statements about a
group are likely to be stereotypes that ignore vast variation and differences.

   Secondly, even within each group of the college students surveyed in this example, there is variation. If we look again
at the percentage in Table 2, we can see that none of the answers had 100% responses. Though a larger percent of
Americans than French surveyed said they would prefer to give up eating and take a pill instead, it is worth noting that
only 27% of Americans said this, compared to 10% of the French respondents. So, the vast majority of Americans, even
in this survey, (73%) said they would not want to do this, as did 90% of the French. If we think about the percentages in
this way, we could accurately say that the responses show that the great majority of Americans agreed with the great
majority of the French respondents in this question.

          Limited Findings
          Look back at the in-text citation for Table 2, and underline the words the writer uses to restrict the
       findings only to the amount of difference in the data:

            · much higher than
            · much more likely than
            · more
            · for our survey participants
            · seem to

   On the other hand, for the hotel question, 77% of Americans prefer the luxury hotel, whereas only 11% of the French
agreed. Here the difference between groups is much bigger, so we could be more confident about saying that most of
the Americans responded differently than most of the French. Even so, we should still keep in mind that 23% of the
Americans agreed with the 89% of the French who would rather have a modest hotel and good food. This means we
could not say "Americans don't care about food," since almost one-fourth of the Americans in the survey said they did
care more about food than a fancy hotel. We have to be careful to draw conclusions that fit the evidence and are not too
general. If you are making a comparison that is not based on actual data, you need to be even more careful to limit your
statements about each group.

28 | Variation and Complexity
   Table 4 comes from another article by Paul Rozin 1. In this article, he reports the responses of college students in India
and the USA two questions about Traditional Values concerning obeying and respecting parents and Elders. Note that
the responses suggests some contrast in the American and Indian responses, but also show a lot of variation within the
groups. The responses are also separated by gender, suggesting that the author expected some possible variation among
males and females in each group.

Organizing an Essay

CAROL LYNN MODER

When you are asked to write longer assignments, you will need to consider what your topic will be and what you want
to say about it. In many academic contexts, longer assignments may be in the form of an informational essay that will
present several points in support of one main idea about the topic. The writer's main purpose is normally stated in a
thesis statement. Depending on the type of essay you are writing and your purpose, you may have a choice of whether
to put your thesis statement in the introduction or in the conclusion. In informational essays, most American academic
audiences prefer you to state the main purpose of the essay explicitly at the end of the introduction.

   When a thesis statement appears in the introduction, it not only states the writer's purpose, but typically it also gives
the reader a preview of the main points of the essay and the order in which the writer will present them. For example, if
the thesis statement is: "in this paper I will discuss the three main factors that affect success in college prior education,
motivation, and the time devoted to assignments," the reader expects you to discuss these three factors IN THE ORDER
YOU MENTIONED them:

 1. Prior education
2. Motivation
3. Time devoted to assignments.

You should give some thought to what order will be most effective for the information you are presenting. Be sure that
your thesis statement presents that order clearly and then follows that order in the body of the paper.

   Following the introduction, it is typical to present each of your main points in a single unified paragraph. The most
coherent way to organize the paragraphs in your writing is to introduce each paragraph with a TOPIC SENTENCE. As
its name suggests, the topic sentence is usually a single sentence that states the topic, that is, the main point that the
paragraph will illustrate or discuss.

          Sample Thesis Statement & Topic Sentences:
          Thesis Statement:
          In this paper I will discuss the three main factors that affect success in college: prior education, motivation,
       and time devoted to assignments.

          Paragraph 1 Topic Sentence:
          Most research concerning success in college focuses on the importance of a student's prior educational
       background.

          Paragraph 2 Topic Sentence:
          Although prior educational background plays an important role, the amount and type of motivation that a
       student has can make a greater difference in college success.

30 | Organizing an Essay
          Paragraph 3 Topic Sentence:
          A final important factor in Student Success is the amount of time a student actually devotes two
       assignments.

   If we consider the sample thesis statement and topic sentences, we see that they have more than one function. As we
have said, they explicitly state the main point or points of the essay, but they also help the reader to understand how the
writing will develop. They tell the reader what to look for in the writing. These sentences are like directions you give to
help a person find a particular place. If you give clear directions that highlight the upcoming turn in the road, it makes it
easier for the reader to follow the path of your thoughts. A third important function of the thesis statements and topic
sentences is to make connections and show the relationships among the points. If we look at the sample topic sentences
for paragraphs 2 and 3, we see that they use words that make connections to other ideas in the writing. The words and
phrases involved in the sample help the reader to follow the path of the argument and make sure that the reader is on
the right road. Using these connecting phrases leads readers to understand how you, the writer, wants them to put their
ideas together.

   Once you have introduced the main point of a paragraph or the topic sentence, you then must develop the paragraph
with examples, details, or anecdotes to illustrate and develop the point. The kind of details or examples you use depend
on the purpose and requirements of the assignment.

   After you provide these examples, you may want to continue to help the reader to follow your reasoning, by the end
of the paragraph for the summarizing sentence or two that connects the example to the overall purpose of the essay.
Such sentences are sometimes called "wrap & tie" sentences. If your paragraph is a package that contains one of the
main ideas, the final sentence wraps up the package and ties a nice bow on top. The purpose is to make sure your reader
understands how you want him or her to interpret your examples and what conclusions you intend. If you do not use
a wrap and tie sentence, you are leaving the "package" open and your reader can put whatever he or she wants inside.
In American academic writing, readers usually expect a writer to make his or her interpretation is clear and explicit as
possible.

   When you have developed your writing with an introduction and the appropriate number of body paragraphs, you
then need to draw a final conclusion. The conclusion typically appears in a separate paragraph. Like "wrap & tie"
sentences, the purpose of the conclusion is to direct the reader to the interpretation that you intend. The most basic
conclusion reiterates the main points of the writing. It may also highlight some of the key examples. It must connect
these to the purpose stated in the thesis statement and draw a final conclusion.

   As with all kinds of academic writing, before you begin to develop your content you should look carefully at the
assignment. Sample assignment 2 requires the writer to develop content about food that would compare and contrast
food practices in the US with food practices in his or her home country. To gather information about American food
practices, each student interviewed an American student. The assignment requires the writer to use information from
the interview. The purpose of the comparison is to relate food practices to cultural or individual identity. It requires
students to use three themes from the interview to illustrate the main point.

                                                                                                                                                         Organizing an Essay | 31
          Sample assignment 2
          Compare and contrast to food practices, yours and that of a person you interviewed, focusing on the way
       that food relates to cultural or individual identity. Include at least three themes in your essay. Compare
       aspects which are similar and contrast aspects which are different.

          Sample Introduction 1
                                                 What Food Tells us about the US and Saudi Arabia

          Societies are often complicated to any stranger. They are hard to understand completely for an individual
       who does not live in that society, yet there is a way to understand them. The products of a society tell a lot
       about it. For example, artists express the views, ideas, beliefs and important issues of their society using
       their passion in doing certain art. Music, paintings, statues, and poetry convey the background of an artist.
       Such works of art carry an enormous amount of information that need to be analyzed by an expert, which
       brings us back to the complexity issue again. Foods are the products of each society that can be easily
       understood. According to Rozin, (2005) food takes a wider role than just nutrition, and identifies where
       people are from and what ethnicity they are. Food and food practices tell a lot about one's culture and
       identity (p. 108). Cooking food, just like art, explains many aspects of a society but in a simpler way. To
       gather information about American food and culture, I interviewed Mike, an American student. Through the
       conversation, the similarities and differences between the two cultures, his and mine, emerged. Food
       cuisines are significantly impacted by immigration in both Saudi Arabia and the United States. Also, in both
       countries there are foods that are associated with particular events and celebrations. However the
       involvement of fathers in food is different from that in the United States.

          FOCUS: Introduction & Thesis Statement
          Look at Sample Introduction 1.
           1. Is the title informative? Interesting?
          2. How does the writer introduce the topic?
          3. What does the writer do to capture the reader's attention?
          4. Underline where the writer cites a published source.Why does the author use this source here?

                What does it add to the introduction?
          5. Underline the sentences that indicate the writer's focus for this paper.What three themes will the

32 | Organizing an Essay
        writer describe? In what order will the reader expect to see these themes discussed?
   6. Look at Sample Assignment 2. Does the writer address all parts of the assignment?
   7. What do you expect to see in the rest of the essay?

   Sample Introduction 2
                                          Differences of Food Between Different Countries

   Today we all live in an increasingly diversified world. That not only means differences in economy and
politics, but also means the diversification of food cultures. Even though we all live in the same world, there
are many differences and similarities and different countries and areas. In order to find the differences of
food between two different countries, I have interviewed Sandy, an American girl from a small city in the
Midwest. Through the half-hour interview, we talked about many aspects about food.

   FOCUS: Critiquing the Introduction
   Look at Sample Introduction 2 and Sample Introduction 3 and evaluate how effectively each one:
    · Identifies the topic
    · Captures the interest of the reader
    · States the main purpose of the essay
    · Specifies the themes that will be discussed
    · Outlines how the essay will develop
    · Meets the requirements of the assignment
   What should each writer do to improve each introduction?

   Sample Body Paragraph 1: Differences of Food Between Different Countries
   Immigrants bring their cuisines with them to the country they move to. In the US the number of

                                                                                                                                                Organizing an Essay | 33
       immigrants is enormous. It is almost a country that was populated by immigrants and it is the country
       where the salad bowl metaphor is perfectly applied. Their food cuisine is a mixture of different cuisines
       from around the globe. For example, Mexican, Italian, Chinese and Japanese dishes are popular in the US.
       When I asked Mike to tell me more about the cuisine in his home state of Florida he said:

                    Since the Spanish came to Florida originally you have that influence. So you have Spanish cuisine
                 there. You also have a lot of people from New York who come down to Florida to retire because the
                 weather is a lot nicer in Florida, so they Regional food is common.
          According to Mike, immigration plays a role in Florida's cuisine. Similarly, Saudi Arabia is a country where
       Muslims from around the world come to practice rituals throughout the course of the year. Moreover, some
       stay for the rest of their lives in Saudi Arabia. Also, a small fraction of the immigrants come to work in Saudi
       Arabia. Those immigrants, just like others, bring their own unique dishes with them. They become popular
       with time. For instance, Egyptian, Moroccan, Pakistani, and Indian dishes are common in Saudi Arabia.
       Although the numbers of immigrants vary, both countries have been impacted in the same manner.

          FOCUS: Body Paragraph 2
          Look at Sample Body Paragraph 2:
           1. Underline the topic sentence. Does the topic sentence clearly identify the topic of the paragraph?

                Does it connect to the thesis statement? Does it connect to the idea in Body Paragraph 1?
          2. What examples or details does the writer use to support his main point in this paragraph? Do all the

                details contribute to the main point? Are any details not related to the topic of the paragraph?
          3. Underline the wrap & tie sentence. What interpretation of the examples does the writer offer in the

                sentence? Does this interpretation support the thesis statement?
          4. What improvements could the writer make?

          Sample Conclusion: Differences of Food Between Different Countries
          The US and Saudi Arabia have similarities and differences when it comes to food and food practices. Both
       had an immigration era that impacted their food significantly. Also, both countries link food items to special
       occasions, which tells a lot about their past and roots. Finally food preparation responsibilities and habits
       are different, conveying that the family structure and dominance are different too. To sum this up, food is a
       good was to understand and even compare to cultures. Moreover it is easier and much more fun to
       understand a society by food than it is by art.

Changing Food Practices in Saudi Arabia and the U.S.

Food practices illustrate a complex relationship between tradition, environment, and individual        Introduction
behavior. College students show this relationship well because they often make adjustments in
their food habits when they are away from home in a new place. In this paper, I will describe my       Topic Overview
food experiences in Saudi Arabia and in the US and compare my experiences to those of Peter, an           Describe Method
American student I interviewed. Our experiences show that food is shaped by traditional culture           Thesis Statement
and family but new environments can lead to change in individual food practices.

Food practices are usually based on what we learn from our culture and our families. And Saudi         Body Paragraph 1
Arabia, my family's food practices followed typical Saudi Arabian gender roles. My father was          Topic Sentence
responsible for purchasing food at the local market, but all the food preparation was done by my
mother and three sisters. Because of these typical roles, I never cooked when I was at home. In           Example: Saudi Arabia
my interview with Peter, he said that some American families followed similar traditional roles,          Example: USA
where the mother was responsible for all the cooking, but he said that in other families he knew
the father did a lot of cooking. And his family, his mother was the main preparer of food, but his        Wrap & Tie Sentence
father sometimes cook special items, like chili or grilled steak. Even so, like me, he never learned
to cook when he was at home. From this, we can see that each of our families followed a pattern
of food preparation that was common in our culture.

Although our food preparation practices come from our family and culture, new environments             Body Paragraph 1
can lead to change. When I got to America, I could not find any traditional Arabic foods where I
was living. I really missed those foods. I decided that the only way to satisfy my longing was to      Topic Sentence
learn how to cook some traditional dishes myself. I called my mother and asked her to tell me
how to cook some simple items. Soon, I was cooking lunch for myself everyday. When I was in               Example: Writer in USA
Saudi Arabia, I didn't like to cook, but now I cook, because I want to eat the famous dishes from      compared to Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia. Since Peter is studying in his home country, he is able to find foods he likes, but he
said that he misses some of the foods that his family used to cook. The food on campus is not as          Example: Peter in the USA
tasty as the food he had at home. He called father and asked him to tell him how to cook chili.        at home compared to at

From this we see that each of us has adapted to our new college environment by learning how to
cook. For me, this was new, since men do not usually cook and Saudi Arabia. Peter learned how to          Comparison:
cook the dish his father made, so for him the adjustment was not so big. Both of us enjoy this            Writer & Peter

A new environment can also lead to changes in social food practices. Here at university in the
United States, the way people eat and interact is very different from what I did in Saudi Arabia. In   Body Paragraph 2
Saudi Arabia eating is part of social gatherings. Families sit together during meals, and you also
eat with your friends. In the US, most of the time I eat alone. If I ask someone to eat with me, that  Topic Sentence
person is often too busy. Peter said that at home he was also used to eating meals with his family        Example: Writer in US
at dinner time, but for breakfast and lunch he just ate something fast. At the university, he seldom
sits down for a real meal. Usually, he just picks up something quick and eats it on his way            compared to Saudi Arabia
somewhere. He says that he and his friends are usually too busy to eat, which is why they eat so
much fast food. Both Peter and I eat on our own a lot here at the university. This does not seem          Example: Peter at home
to bother Peter, maybe because he thinks it is a typical American thing to do. For me, I don't like    compared to at university
the change. Eating with friends and family is too important for me to give up the Saudi custom
easily. One way I try to keep it is to invite my friends over to my house for traditional Saudi food      Comparison:

WRITING TO PERSUADE

This chapter focuses on the type of writing used to persuade readers into changing their opinions about a controversial
issue. As a college student in the United States, you will often have to employ this type of writing whenever your
instructors require you to take a stand on an issue and support your position. Although this task may sound daunting,
in this chapter we will show you that you have already been exposed to persuasive writing and informal context this
experience may prove valuable to help you get started. Therefore, we will begin by considering less formal genres and
topics where persuasive writing is also used from that familiar context we will move on to more formal issues. By the
end of the chapter, you should be able to plan, draft, and revise your own academic persuasive essay.

                                                                                                                                                         Writing to Persuade | 39

Engaging in Discussions about Controversial Issues

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

People constantly engage in conversations about controversial issues in different contexts and media. You may have
observed that sometimes people around you in favor of one point of view in everyday conversations or when they
interact online. Some may use memes, others discuss hot topics through social media, and some even participate in
online forums and blogs. These sort of controversies may deal with real issues but can also address leisure topics. We
will begin our exploration of persuasive writing considering a rather informal topic discussed in an online forum.

The Controversy About Female Characters in Science Fiction

Some people argue that women are usually misrepresented in fiction. This means that a great number of the main
characters in novels, movies, and even in comics are men, whereas women are pushed into the background to play
secondary roles. Just think of how many female superheroes you have heard or read about in your lifetime. Probably
not many, especially if you compare the number of female leading characters with cool superpowers to their male
counterparts. Right? The same happens with famous movies in the history of the film industry, particularly in certain
genres, such as action and science fiction, which have usually been dominated by male figures.

   How many famous female leading characters from your favorite movies/video games/comics/animes can you name
from the top of your head in one minute? Make a list and compare it to the male characters you can remember in
the same amount of time. You can use the table below. Remember they should be leading characters, not supporting
characters. For example, if you like the Harry Potter series, you cannot use Hermione Granger and your list, because in
that series Harry Potter is the main character.

Female Characters  Male Characters

In the United States, the lack of female-centered stories has been taken into consideration by the movie industry to
create a new generation of leading female characters in some movies such as Kill Bill, the Divergent series, and more
recently, the new Star Wars trilogy. However, some still believe that women are still far from being as well represented
as men are. In the first part of this chapter, we will explore the end of the Star Wars series and see whether they feel
that the situation has truly changed.

                                                                                                              Engaging in Discussions about Controversial Issues | 41
Presenting a Point of View on an Online Forum.

The following chart shows reactions of Star Wars fans to an article posted on The Guardian's Website about the
importance of having the Star Wars sequel centered on a female character.1

Poster2         Reaction

Elegant Weapon  Women are not some extreme minority. That said, white women leads in science fantasy films franchises
                aren't all that rare: the Hunger Game series, Resident Evil, Mad Max Fury Road, Lucy, Lara Croft,
                Underworld, Kill Bill, The Divergent series, Sucker Punch.

                I get Star Wars was hugely male-centered, but the people acting like a white woman lead in these kinds of
                movies is so groundbreaking haven't REALLY been thirsty for a lead in this kind of film... They're just getting
                to be commonplace.

Ender_and_Bean  It's definitely been improving steadily ever since Ripley in Aliens (those others you've shared are all fairly
                new) and now the Star Wars universe can be added to that list.

Mars 457        Nine heroines in fourteen years is hardly commonplace. And none of those approached Star Wars in being
                any kind of cultural touchstone. Plus, many heroines are pretty poorly designed. For example: Zack Snyder's
                idea of feminism is "girls dressed in sexy clothes and shoot things in their imaginary space, but in real life
                they just get abused and their agency robbed". After Padme (whose death by childbirth lost me because I
                thought this was a technologically advanced society and not the Middle Ages, never mind that bull where
                she can't muster up the will to live for her children) it's certainly nice to have a Star Wars heroine who is
                allowed to take charge and not be damasked or otherwise lose her agency.

Lee_            That's exactly what I was thinking. You can name a handful that are women, and several thousands that are
                men; that certainly doesn't speak to equality or them being commonplace. I think Rey is a very significant
Elegant Weapon  character as a female. Speaking of equality, let's bust out a definition, as the word "feminism" tends to so
Lee_            often invoke automatic reaction as if toward a resentful, man-hating she-beast. This is actually how the
                term is defined: Feminism- the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic
                equality to men.

                Three of the top 20 films this year were all white women lead big budget science fantasy films. I'm not even
                including straight fantasy films from this year starring white women like Inside Out or Cinderella. By
                contrast, the only high grossing fantasy film released this year featuring a woman of color was Pixar's
                Home. There were zero fantasy or sci fi films released this year that featured a man of color as THE lead, as
                far as I can tell. Forgot to mention, Star Wars: Rouge One next year will star a white woman.

                I'm not really overwhelmed by 15% as an argument.

The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text

  ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA
  In another chapter, we discussed the features of an informational essay. In this chapter, we will guide you to understand
  the essential elements of a similar type of academic text: the persuasive essay. Although informational and persuasive
  writing follow similar principles such as an orderly presentation of ideas that should be supported with evidence (e.g.
  facts, arguments, or examples), their purposes differ. The objective is written to take a stance (specific point of view) with
  respect to a controversial topic and persuade the audience to adopt the writer's position. Because of this difference,
  the thesis statement of the persuasive essay needs to introduce the writer's position in the controversy featured in the
  essay. Also, the preview of the essay's structure should outline the arguments that the author will use to support his/
  her stance.

 Should the US drinking age be lowered?

  In the US, drinking alcoholic beverages is illegal for people under 21 years of age (minimum legal drinking age or MLDA).
  This law has long caused a great deal of disagreement and debates. While some people think it is paradoxical that young
  people of 18 cannot enter a bar but still go to war, others believe that the law is the best way to keep youth away from
  irresponsible and heavy drinking episodes (also called binge drinking). The following texts were written by readers of
  the New York Times" Room for Debate page to express their opinions about the subject.1

    · Read the comments and underline the readers' main arguments (reasons to support one position or the other).
    · Identify which readers are against lowering the minimum drinking age (CON) and which are in favor (PRO)?
    · Which arguments seem the least convincing? Which are the most persuasive? Why?

Mason:          Ever since the minimum drinking age was raised to 21 in 1986 the United States saw just as many if not more
Erick Ban:      issues with irresponsible drinking as they did when the drinking age was 18. One of the major reasons for this is
                because kids are not learning how to drink responsibly before they can finally drink alone at age 21. If you look at
Jonah S.:       areas that do not have a drinking age as high as the United States you will find that the amount of people that die
                due to alcoholic accidents in much lower than that of the US. For example, in China there is no drinking age and
Robert Araujo:  the rate per 100,000 people due to alcohol is .3% compared to the United States' 2.91%. I believe the main reason
Kevin Blake:    for this is because the Chinese can legally grow up drinking with their families and are able to learn how to drink
Evan            responsibly due to the actions and teachings of their parents.
Altenburg:
                What makes me think people under 21 won't be responsible? I could drink legally when I was 18, that's what. I
                experienced and saw what happens when you give immature brains the right to pollute those brains. We
                shouldn't be talking about lowering the drinking age because "If they can buy a gun, join the military and vote
                they should be able to drink," we should be thinking about raising the age of those other things. After all, the
                brain doesn't fully mature until around 25, right? All lowering the drinking age will do is raise the number of
                drunk drivers with the least experienced and most accident-prone demographic.

                Turning 18 in the United States is the gateway to adulthood. When individuals turn 18, they can legally vote, get
                married and fight in our country's military. However, one thing these "adults" still cannot do is purchase or drink
                alcohol. The age at which a person can legally purchase and consume alcohol has been an active discussion since
                1984 when the MLDA was raised from 18 to 21. The original reason the United States Legislation Act raised the
                MLDA was because there had been a rise in alcohol involved fatal motor vehicle accidents. The belief was that by
                raising the drinking age, there would be fewer accidents on the roads. However, research has shown that raising
                the drinking age did not solve the problem it was intended to solve. The number of fatal motor vehicle accidents
                has not gone down since the drinking age was changed from 18 to 21. In fact, this change in law just drove
                drinking underground and into unsafe environments. Nowadays, 3.2% of deaths in America are alcohol related
                which is higher than any other country.

                Have you ever heard about age of onset? Thombs and Osborn (2013) advocate that preventing or delaying the age
                of the first use of alcohol is the optimal way to reduce alcohol abuse and dependence in the future. Nobody is
                saying that alcohol must be forbidden, this is not the case. If they return the law to 18, adolescents may drink at
                16 years old. Now, they may drink at 18. Research has documented that the early you drink, the higher the risk
                you have to become addict: 14 years or younger you have 15.1% of chance to become addict, 15-17 you have 9.1%
                of chance, 18-20 you have 4.4% of chance, 21 or older you have 2.7%, In other words, we are preserving the
                future, the integrity of our youth, keep them away from addiction, as best as we can, Say NO to drinking at 18!!!

                All of the facts and figures in the world don't matter to underage high school and college students that want to
                be cool and get wasted with their friends at the hottest party of the year. If you really want to lower the rates of
                underage consumption of alcohol and binge drinking, you need to make alcohol a mundane thing. A high drinking
                age is just prohibition at a targeted group, and everyone knows how well prohibition turned out. You're not
                deterring anyone from drinking, you're just making it a rebellious, fashionable thing to do.

                I believe that the drinking age should remain at 21. I'm not naive, I know that kids under 21 drink and find ways to
                get alcohol. Lowering the legal age to 18 will simply make the process even easier for them to get it. Changing the
                drinking age to 18 isn't going to affect kids 18-21. Those kids are in college, alcohol is everywhere and they have
                no trouble getting it. Changing the legal drinking age is going to affect 14-18 year old high school students. This
                model is clearly shown in colleges all around the country. Any freshman can walk onto a college campus and find
                alcohol almost instantaneously, because every junior and senior can buy it. If high school seniors can go buy
                alcohol than any underclassman can simply get alcohol from them. That's how it works now. . .But instead of
                buying liquor from the 4-5 college dropouts who live around your area, now all you have to do is ask one of the
                800 seniors at your school. Seems a little too easy doesn't it? If anything, change the age to 19 so that high school
                students can't buy it.

Content focus: Rating thesis statements

Considering these features, in the following task you will analyze how six college students drafted their thesis
statements for a persuasive essay on the MLDA controversy. In the prompt used by the instructor for this assignment,
students were required to address the following purposes:

  · Present the PROs and CONs of the MLDA to a group of college students' parents.
  · Persuade the parents to vote in favor of lowering the MLDA to 18 years of age.
In other words, the writers need to take a stance on the issue. Read the Thesis Statement and assess how well each one
fulfills the purposes given above and to what extent. Rate the Thesis Statement using a scale from 1 to 6, where 6 will

support your rating.

   a. The United States has more accidents caused by drivers under the influence of alcohol than other countries where
there is no MLDA ( )

   b. Young people should be allowed to drink without legal restrictions based on their age, which is ridiculous ( )
   c. Parents should teach their children how to drink alcohol in moderation. ( )
   d. Lowering the MLDA will allow parents to introduce their children to alcohol use under the supervision and reduce

Guidelines for a thesis statement

What should be considered when drafting a thesis statement for an essay that aims to persuade the audience to take a
stand in a controversial issue? Think of some possible guidelines to write an effective persuasive TS taking into account
the following:

  · How should you address your audience?
  · Where in your text should you introduce your stance?
  · What language features (words, phrases) could be useful?
  · How can you connect your TS with the main arguments you will use in your essay?

                    Write your guidelines below and discuss them with your colleagues and your instructor:

                                                                                                                          The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text | 47
   In some of the thesis statements listed above, the writers use modal verbs such as will and should. The first one (will)
is used to predict the results that could be achieved if the authorities follow a specific course of action regarding the
MLDA. The second one (should) is used to recommend what should be done with respect to the MLDA. These and other
modal verbs that express advice, convey an obligation, or predict an outcome are often used to introduce the writer's
stance because they are useful to express the speaker's desires, or his/her ideas of how the world should be. Other
modal verbs that are also used with these purposes are: must, can, could, ought to, and also the semi-modal have to.

   When using modal verbs to compose your thesis statement, however, you should be careful to select the one that best
represents your purpose. The meaning of your thesis statement can change a great deal if you use one or the other. Read
the following examples and explain how the meaning has changed with each modal (in bold):

Statement                                            Meaning

a. Authorities should lower the MLDA to avoid binge
drinking.

b. Authorities must lower the MLDA to avoid binge
drinking.

c. Authorities could lower the MLDA to avoid binge
drinking.

d. Authorities ought to* lower the MLDA to avoid
binge drinking.

   *Although ought to and must are accepted as standard forms, they are not used in Academic English very often
because they imply a strong and categorical position. Scientists usually abstain from categorical statements because these
expressions do not convey that the writer remains open to new possibilities. Scientist prefer to maintain a more open
attitude in their writing in case new evidence is discovered in the future that can change their points of view about the
world.

   Although the participants in the Room for Debate's and Star Wars pages hold different points of view regarding very
different topics, they all engaged in their online discussions with a common purpose: persuading their audience of their
point of view. They do so in a succinct fashion because their audience does not usually invest much time in reading blog
posts that are too long and complex. Therefore, effective blog/forum posters try to be direct and present one single
point per post. On the contrary, academic persuasive writing needs to be more detailed and provide the audience with
more than just the author's point of view.

Organizing Your Arguments

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

The way the argumentation is presented in a persuasive essay is also special because writers do not only care about
presenting their stance. They also want to include the point of view of their opponents to show that they have
considered all possible angles of the controversy and have enough evidence to prove that the other side is wrong.

Two Sides and One Controversy

Taking into account the need to incorporate both sides of the controversy, observe the arguments presented in the
Room for Debate page, which have been paraphrased for you below. If you were given the task to write a persuasive
essay on the MLDA topic, how would you organize these arguments to compose three body paragraphs?

alcohol we need to turn drinking into a common practice.

Organization Templates

Although the persuasive essay includes the two sides of a controversy, it does pay more attention to the position
with which the writer is siding. The order in which the arguments are introduced is crucial to make the piece more
persuasive. Traditionally, writers choose between three possible organization templates:

                                                                                                                                               Organizing Your Arguments | 51
   In organization template 1, writers present three of the arguments that support their point of view (PRO) and one
that supports their opponents' (CON). In the first body paragraph, the presentation of the opponents' argument is
immediately followed by a counterargument. This counterargument is an argument in favor of the authors' point of
view that directly addresses the opponents' point and nullifies its persuasive power. Organization template 2 shows a
variation of the same strategy that presents the counter argumentation on the third body paragraph. By contrast, in
organization template 3, the argument/counterargument opposition is used along the three body paragraphs.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Template

Which could be the advantages and disadvantages of these two different organization templates? List them down in the

  52 | Organizing Your Arguments
   Alcoholic consumption began for many as a symbol of friends and acquaintances coming together to simply enjoy life
and "be merry." However, in the United States, alcoholic consumption and the law have collided quite often in the past.
The most recent and ongoing controversy regarding drinking is whether the legal drinking age should be lowered from
twenty-one to eighteen. This is a huge controversy specifically relevant to college students, as drinking at American
universities has grown to become a defining part of college life despite the fact that a majority of college students cannot
even legally drink. It is clear through the prevalence and dangers of binge drinking among college students and the high
percentage of DUI and alcohol-related accidents and deaths that something needs to change in this country. Lowering
the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen would be an effective and beneficial step in changing the binge-drinking
culture in this country, encouraging drinking alcohol as a safe and enjoyable activity, and facilitating medical attention
for those involved in alcohol-related accidents.

   First of all, lowering the drinking age to eighteen will eliminate the thrill of breaking the law for eighteen to twenty
year olds. The idea of being rebellious and breaking the law while still having fun and not harming others in the process is
an appealing and exciting idea for many underage college students. With drinking being illegal for those under twenty-
one and with the risk of "getting caught" always present and stimulating, drinking tends to become a more furtive act
with it taking place in people's dorm rooms, basements, etc. It is in these situations where drinking becomes the most
dangerous, where pre-gaming, taking multiple shots in a row, and trying to get as drunk as quickly and efficiently as
possible fosters binge drinking. If the drinking age was lowered to eighteen, there wouldn't be that thrill to want what
we can't have because it would be legal. In traveling to England recently, where the legal drinking age is set at eighteen,
I have observed how Americans visiting, studying, or living in England who are in the eighteen to twenty-year-old range
treat drinking completely differently than the eighteen to twenty-year-olds here. In England, those Americans treated
drinking as simply a normal social activity because it was legal and there wasn't that thrill to break the law; in contrast,
I only witness the binge drinking and "Get drunk" mentality, rarely, the mentality to drink in a relaxed and normal
atmosphere for those under twenty-one range are going to drink regardless of if it's legal or not. The difference lies in
the fact that if it's legal, there is no peer pressure or temptation to commit something illegal so less risky behaviors and
treatment of alcohol will result.

   In the second place, because alcoholic consumption is considered an illegal activity for people until they reach age
twenty-one, oftentimes teenagers are never really taught how to drink in moderation beforehand and therefore are
more likely to abuse alcohol and binge drink. While the National Institute of Drug Abuse (2014) shows that drinking levels
among younger people (and the American population in general), are decreasing, younger people are more likely to binge
drink when they do consume alcohol (Kennet, 2008). However, I hold that binge drinking could be substantially lowered
if the drinking age was lowered. This is because 18-20-year olds would then be able to experience moderate drinking in
bars, restaurants, and other venues where there is supervision. Since this is currently illegal under the law, 18-20 year
olds are now forced to drink in unsupervised venues were moderation is untaught and binge drinking is encouraged.
In fact, having the drinking age set at the age of 21 has not stopped drinking among the 18-20-year-old age group, but
has rather encouraged the movement of drinking to such unsupervised places were dangerous drinking behaviors are
more likely to take place. The legal drinking age being set at 21 simply perpetuates the lack of a moderating culture
in this country. Oftentimes, parents dismiss the idea that they need to educate their child on alcohol. With a lower
drinking age, more parents would feel responsibility to introduce their children to alcohol in the controlled environment
of the household beforehand as a means of education and instruct them on how to use alcohol in moderation. A Penn
State research study (Abar & Turrisi, 2008) even showed a direct correlation between parents' talking to their child
about alcohol before entering college and subsequently lower rates of binge drinking. A lower drinking age would
expose 18-20-year olds to a greater multitude of adults who can provide supervisory guidance over how to use alcohol
moderately and therefore encourage less risky drinking behaviors.

   Many opponents to the lowering of the drinking age argue that it will result in more alcohol-related accidents and
deaths, especially while driving. Drunk driving deaths have actually steadily decreased in the past thirty years. In fact,
this trend began occurring since 1982, two years before the legal drinking age became twenty-one through the Uniform
Drinking Age Act. It has shown that this trend occurred throughout all age groups and various other categories and
therefore cannot be directly attributed to the drinking age. An estimated 90% of drunk driving deaths in the United

                                                                                                                                              Organizing Your Arguments | 53
States were found in the over 21 age group so drunk driving cannot be necessarily attributed to age (SAMHSA, 2010).

Furthermore, the same source reports that the amount of drunk driving deaths in the United States has decreased

at a slower rate than that European of European countries that have their legal drinking age at eighteen or lower. As

many people argue that lowering the drinking age is fatal, lowering the drinking age is actually going to save lives.

This is because it will reduce the amount of people that become injured due to alcohol or that simply die because of

alcohol poisoning who fail, or have others fail, to report their injuries to the police or the ambulance out of fear of legal

consequences for underage drinking. Many states currently have laws that protect an underage person from the legal

consequences of underage drinking if they go and seek medical attention; however, not many college students are aware

of these laws and are still hesitant nevertheless out of fear that it may get back to their parents. Lowering the drinking

age would encourage those in the 18-20-year-old range to seek medical attention for potentially fatal alcoholic injuries

without fear of potential consequences for doing so, in turn saving the lives of many young adults, especially those in

college.

We are all aware of the drinking culture that takes place in this country. Particularly among college students, drinking

has turned into a dangerous practice that is the result of the excitement of alcohol's illegality for most college students

and the fact that public officials and adults use drinking as a tool to punish and prevent a potentially enjoyable activity

among an age group instead of encouraging the enjoyable and safe practice that drinking can be fore them. Lowering the

drinking age, as exhibited around the world, can show how drinking can bring young adults and adults together in a fun,

safe way instead of creating a disparity among them. If those young adults in the 18-20-year-old range share the adult

same responsibilities that other adults do, then having the right to choose to drink should be no exception. It is time

that alcoholic use, especially by college students, becomes a safe practice in this country instead of one whose culture

lies concealed from sight and forced to grow uncontrollably and treacherously. It is time that eighteen, nineteen, and

twenty year olds finally be trusted as the adults we are considered in every other way.

Counterarguments

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

Using counterarguments appropriately is central to composing an effective persuasive piece. Remember that you should
assume that your audience does not agree with you. Therefore, your goal is to make your readers change their mind by
helping them see the matter from a different perspective. To accomplish this, you need to begin by acknowledging your
audeince's point of view and then address any weak point in their arguments. This is called "conceding and refuting." It
means that you first partially accept something your opponent says (concede), but then argue that your opponent's view
is not entirely true or accurate (refute).

Examples of Counterarguments

The following examples were taken from compositions written by international students who were requested to take
a side in a controversy. Examples 1 and 2 discuss the pertinence of allowing college students use a new technological
device called Google Glass in the classroom. Some people believe that this device will enhance students' learning, while
others fear that it will only distract students. If you want to know more about Google Glass, you can click on the
link provided in Example 1. Example 3 focuses on the dangers of using nuclear energy and whether it could harm the
environment or help to improve it. Read the examples carefully and use brackets to identify where the writers are
conceding and where they are refuting their opponents' arguments.

   Example 1
   Advocates of Google Glass think that it is a miraculous tool that can enhance students' learning experience at school.
They hold that the device will help students search information about many subjects during class and use class time
more efficiently. For example, by using voice recognition technology and screenshots to take notes. Information can be
easily registered and retrieved when needed. While this may be true, an excessive dependence on these tools can make
students' minds lose those thinking skills usually needed when taking notes in a traditionally way.

                                                                                                                                                 -Khalid Alkhaldi

   Example 2
   Opponents of using Google Glass on campus claim that it can cause accidents because people would tend to be
distracted while driving or riding their bikes. These concerns are understandable. However, plenty of accidents caused
by distracted drivers are associated to the use of other devices such as smart phones or car navigation systems. In
fact, the National Safety Council (2015) reports that one out of four car accidents in the United States is due to using
cellphones while driving. In spite of this statistics, cell phone use is not consider an issue in our campus. Why should
Google Glass be treated differently?

                                                                                                                                                -Mirai Nagasawa

   Example 3
   Scientists believe that nuclear power can solve the energy crisis once for all. Currently, nuclear-based power stations
are already used in aircraft carriers and submarines. Moreover, the use of nuclear power can be environmentally friendly
because it helps reduce fossil fuel consumption. Although there is some truth in these assumptions, they are based on
one condition: that all these nuclear power stations never leak. Unfortunately, bad things always happen. In 1986, the

To introduce the concession and the refutation, the writers of the examples given above used transitional words such
as: although, however, and while. Observe how other writers used these words in the examples below and answer the
following questions:

  · Where does the concession part appear? After or before the transitional word?
  · Where is the refutation placed?
  · How is punctuation used to separate concession from refutation?
  · Are while, however, and although used in the same way? If not, where does the difference reside?

      support is beneficial, it is clearly not essential to sustain reading.

2. It is true that those who enjoy numbers may be more able to take on billing challenges than others. However,
      medical billing involves more than comfort with numbers.

3. The use of technology in the teaching and learning of reading has been highly praised. Although it is true that

      critically assess the texts they read in their digital world.
4. Colleges and universities have been working hard to provide their students with wider online access. Although
      these efforts are commendable, they will undoubtedly result in an increase of tuition and fees.
5. Reading interventions programs are often selected on the basis of their availability, familiarity, and ease. While this
      may seem like a practical approach, it is not always the best way to determine their suitability for students' needs.
6. Traditionally, the diversity of the learner is defined by ethnicity, economic conditions, and gender. These variables
      are undoubtedly useful to conform this definition: however, there are other issues of diversity that can affect
      learning and should be considered. For instance, variable such as visual or auditory abilities or the disposition of
      the learner should not be overlooked.
   With your colleagues, work out a rule to sue while, although, and however to concede and refute. To understand more
about these transitional words you can refer to the Transitional Devices chapter.
   As a final exercise, you can go back to the essay by Victoria DeCesare and observe how she used concession and
refutation in her piece. Identify in which sentences she used words such as while, however, and although. Do you think
she used them effectively to present her counter argumentation? Why?

Writing a Persuasive Essay

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

Now that you are familiar with some of the most important aspects of the persuasive essay, it is time for you to begin
planning your own paper. The topic of your piece will very likely depend on the guidelines provided by your instructor.
Regardless of the topic, the following material will certainly be useful to help you plan, draft, and revise your work.

Researching and Planning

The topic of a persuasive essay should be a controversial one. This means that there should be at least two opposite
points of view and that you take a stand in the controversy. Therefore, once you have decided on the controversy and
your stance, you need to do some research to identify the different arguments that both sides use to defend their
positions. To help you organizing this information you can used the following chart. An example has been made for you:

             Arguments          Arguments

   Once you have a list of the arguments involved in the controversy you need to find the following:
 1. What evidence is there to support each one of the listed arguments? You will need to do some secondary research

      in the library databases to make sure you use reliable information.
2. Which is the strongest argument of your opponents?
3. Are there any weak points in this strong argument that you can use to refute your opponents' view?
Make a list of the facts and examples you can use in your argumentation and keep a careful record of the sources you
will use to back up your claims.

Outlining

Once you identify your arguments and sources, it is time for you to plan the organization of your essay. There are writers
who only think about the organization of a paper and begin to write following a mental plan. Others, however, prefer
more structure. If you are among those in the second group, you may need to outline your essay.

   In order to write an outline for a persuasive essay, you should remember there are at least three different templates to
use. You will also need to figure out the information you will use in your introduction and how you will relate your points
to broader issues in the conclusion. You can use the outline structures provided on the following pages depending on
the template of your choice.

Evaluating Your Work

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

Once you have outlined the main ideas you will use in your essay, you are ready to draft your first version. Remember
that you need clear topic sentences and appropriate transitions in each paragraphs. In order to to revise your work (and
that of your peers) you should check your instructor's assignment guidelines and make sure your work addresses them
to the best of your knowledge. As an alternative, you can use any of the following rubrics.

                                   Evaluation Sheet 1

                                                                       By Brianna Hook

   Instructions: This worksheet can be used during peer review sessions. You may write on this paper and on the
author's essay. After reading and critiquing your peer's essay, return your responses to the author. Alternatively, you may
use this sheet to revise your own work.

 1. Read the entire essay. Underline the thesis statement in the introductory paragraph. Has the author taken a clear
      stance on the issue? Are the main points clearly written, logical, and in parallel form?

2. Are the author's ideas organized in an effective manner? Did s/he follow the same order as the points were
      mentioned in the thesis statement?

3. Look back over the essay. Describe any point(s) where you were confused, unconvinced, or uncertain of the
      connections or ideas being explained and expressed. You may suggest transitions or recommend clarification of
      ideas. (You may also circle those in the essay.)

4. Find three places where you think the author could add more specific information, explanation, or evidence.
      Suggest specifically what kind of additions could be made (for example, facts, quotes, or statistics).

5. Look at the author's use of outside sources. Has s/he effectively integrated the sources into the essay? Does the
      information from sources clearly support his/her arguments/ideas? Has s/he properly used in-text citation to
      give credit to the sources?

6. If the author only had an hour to make changes, what top three things should s/he do?
 7. Now look at grammatical and sentence-level issues (including verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, use of

      prepositions, word choice, spelling, commas, etc.) and mark these clearly for the writer to see.
8. Lastly, do you think the author makes an overall convincing argument? Could you be persuaded to his/her side?

      Why or why not? Be specific in your critique.

                                   Evaluation Sheet 2

  · This rubric helps you assess your essay considering five categories:content, organization, documentation style,

   grammar and vocabulary, and spelling/punctuation/capitalization/formatting.
· In each category, you are given three levels of descriptors. The one on the top corresponds to a high-quality sort

   of essay, the one in the middle describes an acceptable essay, and the one at the bottom applies for a poor one.
· Read each descriptor and check on the lines next to the descriptors that best represent the features of your work.
· Once you finish checking, choose a mark within the range given for each level on the left column. Your rating

   should fall within the range given for the level where most of your check marks clustered.

EMAIL GUIDELINES

Communicating across cultures is challenging. Each culture has set rules that its members are unaware of because,
cultural norms and values are not taught explicitly, most of the information is absorbed subconsciously.

   With the advancement of technology in our world, Intercultural communication has become widely spread via email
communication. Be it an academic or professional contacts, email is one of the primary means of communication. Email
does not involve face-to-face interaction with the potential audience, however, it does not mean that it should be
considered less formal.

   International students often worry about how to address an email message to a professor - especially one whom they
do not know or they have not met in person. In this chapter, we will discuss some concerns students need to keep in
mind when composing an email to their instructors or professors.

                                                                                                                                                              Email Guidelines | 71

Example 1: Inappropriate Student Email

          Subject: [none]1
          Hello Mam,2
          I Adya, student of Composition on wednesday3 group at 5pm.4 I have tried a lot to submit assignment on
       drop box.5 But still i6 am unable to do so. Would you please help me?.7 When i click on drop box there `no
       folder found' is displayed. I am worried about it.
          Thank you8

The example above emphasizes an example of an inappropriately composed email sent to an instructor. Some problems
with the email are:

 1. There is no subject as to why the sender is composing to email.
2. Mam is in an appropriate salutation to a professor in an American context.
3. Then, the sender introduced herself, which is good. But, she had some technical problems with capitalization

      (Wednesday-3, 1-6) and space after period (4,5,6,7).
4. The main content of the message has some grammar errors and was not proofread before it was sent.
5. The sender did not close her message appropriately (8).

Example 2: Inappropriate Student Email

          Subject: [none]1
          Dear Mam2,

     I submit the student information.

          Hurray 3

                                                                                                                                                    Examples and Exercises | 73
The second example is a continuation of the first one. Subject line is missing, salutation is informal and closing is
inappropriate, as the sender use smiley and informal language.

Example 3: Appropriate and Formal Email

          Subject: Problem Submitting Assignment 1

          Dear Dr. Martin,

          My name is Adiya Kumar, a student in your Composition II class. I was unable to post my assignment on
       D2L. Would it be possible if I come to your office today, at 2 pm in the afternoon?

          Also, I have some questions related to our class project. Do we choose our team members or will you
       assign us?

          Thank you.
          Sincerely,
          Adiya Kumar

In the example above, the sender had a clear subject title that addresses her reason to compose the email. Then, she
saluted her professor professionally. Next, she introduced herself, and clearly mentioned her main concern. She used a
paragraph break to address another concern related to the class. At last, she concluded her email by a formal salutation
and signature (full name).

Exercises

 1. Write an email to your professor.
2. Write an email to a friend.
3. What differences have you noticed?

What to Consider When Writing an Email to a
Professor?

MIRIAM KINFE

Subject Header Should Be Informative

You are composing an email for a reason. To inform the recipient/professor about your main reason for writing the
email, write the purpose of your message. This is not a salutation line, therefore clearly state the main concern the email
intends to address. For example: "Request to enroll in your class".

Salutation

Make a polite and formal salutation that sounds good to the ears and looks great to the eyes. Do not write `Hi
professor' or `Hey there'. Instead, address your professor politely and professionally including title and last name. For
example: `Dear Professor Jones,' (followed by a comma), `Professor Jones' are polite and professional ways of addressing
a professor.

Do Not Use Smiley Faces or Other Emoji, Internet Acronyms and
Abbreviations

  Email style is not the same as text message style. All Electronic shorthand signals such as LOL, U for "you", smiley faces
and emojis such as  should be avoided.

Avoid Silly Mistakes

Spell correctly and write grammatically correct messages. Show that you care about how you present yourself and
writing to your professor.

Paragraph Breaks

If you have more than one concern, use paragraph breaks to help organize your message. It is hard and boring to read a
long paragraph addressing a lot of concerns. Paragraph breaks make your message clearer and easier to read.
76 | What to Consider When Writing an Email to a Professor?
Appropriate Closing

Once you compose your email and are ready to send it, make sure you use appropriate closure to your message. The
most appropriate ways are `Sincerely', `Regards', `Best Regards' followed by a comma.

Sender's Information

If it is your first time to email your professor, clearly identify yourself at the beginning of your email by saying: `My
name is Betty Steve, an undergraduate student in your International Composition class'... etc. At the beginning of your
message, right underneath your salutation, write your name.

   Another thing that you need to consider is to make your name appear as the sender of an email rather than your email
address or username. This means that the recipient of the email knows that the message is from Betty Steve instead of
`beti_steve12@okstate.edu'.

                                                                                                      What to Consider When Writing an Email to a Professor? | 77
Cultural Context

MIRIAM KINFE

Addressing a Recipient

Languages and cultures have different ways of addressing people. In Russian culture, it is essential that a plural form
of `you' is used to refer/address someone who is older or in a senior position than the writer. In Chinese culture,
addressing someone by their professional or courtesy name conveys respect as Chinese prefer to be addressed formally.
In Chinese, usually the title follows the family name. Chinese women use their maiden names even after marriage,
therefore marital status might be indicated using Mrs., Ms., Miss, or Madam could be used, but in modern times it is
used rarely. In some other cultures, first names are commonly used instead of last names or family names. In such
situations, people's profession is followed by their first names. The salutations `Dear Respected Sir/Madam' are very
common in Indian English. This is considered old-fashioned and native speakers of English do not use `respected' in
their salutations.

   In American context, when addressing a professor use the recipients professional title and last name. For example,
assume that you are writing an email to a professor whose name is Ben Jones. The proper salutation is: Dear Dr. Jones
or Dear Professor Jones and not Dr. Ben.

Message

Another cultural difference that occurs in email communication is the content of the message the email contains. In
some African, Arab and Asian cultures, the message is not clearly specified and it is left to be understood through
context, nonverbal cues, and through interpretation of what is actually said in the message. In contrast, English-
speaking countries expect messages to be explicit and specific.

Avoiding Plagiarism

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND YELIN ZHAO

In every part of culture, But especially in the academic world, plagiarism (the unauthorized or uncredited use of
someone else's ideas or words) is a very serious offense, and can result in devastating career and social consequences.
Simply Googling the phrase "plagiarism scandal" will reveal many cases of individuals (including U.S. vice presidents)
who were caught plagiarizing, sometimes in relatively minor ways, and suffered serious consequences.

   Plagiarism is wrong and is taken so seriously because it can be considered both dishonesty and theft. When you use
someone else's ideas or words in your work and do not provide credit, you are essentially claiming that those ideas and
words were written by you. Therefore, you are lying about the source of the words, & receiving credit for another's work.

Plagiarism of Ideas

Plagiarism of ideas is the use of another's ideas without providing credit. Determining what counts is plagiarism of
ideas can be very tricky, especially when riding in another culture. In many ways, plagiarism of ideas can be more
dangerous than plagiarism of words, because it is less straightforward and is easier to do accidentally. This typically
occurs for two reasons.

  · Students believe that information is common knowledge and does not need to be cited.
         What can be considered `common knowledge' varies widely based on your audience. As we have mentioned
            throughout this textbook, understanding your audience is absolutely essential to writing successfully and
            avoiding plagiarism.
         To use the example earlier, the fact that the United States of America was founded in 1776 is generally known
            by many Americans (and probably others around the world). However, in an article written for American
            history experts, this information is clearly general knowledge and does not need citing. On the other hand, in
            an article written in the field of soil sciences, this may be much less likely known, and may need citation,
            especially because the reason for giving this information may be found in a specific text (e.g. a law regarding
            farms was passed when America was founded).
         In addition to the problem of determining what is common knowledge, I have seen many students provide
            facts and information which may be commonly known and accepted, but it is simply untrue. For example, one
            student mentioned that Arabic contains Millions more words than English, which is simply not true (in fact,
            English may have more words in Arabic). This is a commonly-held belief, especially among Arabic speakers,
            and while the student's claimed did not count as plagiarism, the fact that no credit was given indicated that
            the claim may not be based on reality, and also caused the instructor to believe the student had given
            someone else's information as their own.

  · Students read an outside source, learn something from it, then give this information without citation.
         Reading is often an essential part of writing, especially academically, and we can strengthen our arguments by
            supporting them with the works of others. However, it is always necessary to give credit for someone else's
            ideas, even if you read them briefly. When you learned information which supports your argument, you must
            give credit to the author for this information.

Considering the consequences of plagiarism, it is much better to be safe when you are unsure about what is common
knowledge, and find a reliable source, then cite their information.

                                                                                                                                                          Avoiding Plagiarism | 81
Plagiarism of Words

Plagiarism of words is more straightforward. This involves using words or information (no matter how small the
amount) from someone else's work without providing credit. There are many softwares such as (turnitin.com) which can
search the entire internet and compare students work with other published works and report similarities. Remember
that is not wrong to use outside sources, and doing so is actually very important too much academic writing. However,
it is essential that credit is given when any information is taken from outside sources.

  · Note that anytime you paraphrase or quote directly, you must provide a page number for the location of the
      original words in the text, both to give credit, and to direct readers to that information if they want to find it for
      themselves.

Using Outside Material

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND YELIN ZHAO

Why We Use Outside Material

Before we discuss in detail three strategies to incorporate someone else's work into your own writing summarizing,
paraphrasing, and quoting, it is of great importance to first talk about why we need to use other writers work. There are
several important reasons:

  · First of all, at the institutional level, as a student, there's a great possibility that you will be asked to write a topic,
      perhaps a new topic that is unfamiliar to you. In this case, you need to first read the work of others and then
      demonstrate your understanding of others work accurately.

  · Second, at a broader level, as an academic writing is a community event, incorporating others' work is a great way
      to Showcase your knowledge, add credibility to your writing, and show your membership as part of a discourse
      community.

Strategies for Using Outside Material

Now we have a general idea of the importance of using others' ideas. Let us proceed to discussing what summarizing,
paraphrasing, and quoting mean:

  · Summarizing means using your own words to present the main ideas shown in an original source (a book an
      article etc).

  · Paraphrasing involves using your own words to present a specific part/segment from source material.
  · Quoting means the segment of the source must be identical to source material, word for word. Notice that this is

      one of the major differences that distinguish quoting from summarizing and paraphrasing.

Important tips:

All of the above presented strategies require you to attribute ideas (i.e. summaries, paraphrases, and quotes) to the
original source. Generally speaking, among the cases in which plagiarism is involved, the most frequent types are not
citing the original Source when summarizing or paraphrasing because you might think that there is no need to do so
considering you use your own words. However, as long as you have borrowed the ideas (excluding common knowledge),
you need to give credit to the author who originally proposed the idea.

   Now you know the definition of differences between summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting. You might have
wondered when to use each strategy. Additionally, you might have wondered whether you can use quotations most
often, since it is the easiest job to do. Notice that of these three strategies, quoting is rarely used, for several reasons.

   When you use direct quotation, you have given up the opportunity to use your own words to display your
                                                                                                                                                     Using Outside Material | 83
understanding of the original text for your own purposes. It also signifies the readers that you are highlighting a
particular word, phrase, sentence, or passage and trying to distance yourself from the original text as the words are
not your own. To use direct quotations effectively, you need to make sure that it is your intention that the quotation
serves the above presented functions. Using quotations due to its simplicity rarely leads to success. When you practice
summarizing, typically you should be objective by simply presenting the main ideas in the original text. In contrast,
paraphrasing allows for your own comment on the original source.

Giving Credit for Outside Material

Anytime that you use any outside material, it is essential that you give credit for this information. Failure to give credit
for either ideas or information which are taken from outside sources is plagiarism, and is a very, very serious offense,
even if committed on accident.

   In my experience as an Academic Integrity facilitator, I have encountered many honest students who did not mean to
deceive instructors or intentionally claim that outside information was their own, they simply weren't aware of how or
when to give credit for outside material. As a rule, you must always cite any ideas or words that you get from outside
sources, no matter how small they may be. Well this line can sometimes be blurry (for example, do you need to cite a
source to support the fact that America was founded in 1776, or is it general knowledge?). Keep in mind that it is always
safer to cite the information when you aren't sure.

   We know that it is essential to give credit, but how do we do this in academic writing? There's a very specific way
to give credit in academic writing which we call citing your sources. In almost every form of academic writing this will
consist of two parts, both of which are necessary. Before we describe these parts in detail, it may help to see a short
example of a properly cite a direct quotation. This example uses APA format. Various formats and citation methods will
be discussed in more detail below.

  · A reference citation. This provides full bibliographic information in a specific format (defined by your discipline or
      instructor). These will typically appear on a separate References or Works Cited page at the end of your writing.
      Reference citations serves two purposes:
         Gives full credit to the author of the work.
         Gives your reader the necessary information to find the original work for themselves.

  · An in-text, or parenthetical citation. This is a brief version of the reference citation (typically containing just the
      author's name and the year of the work) which appears right next to the portion of outside material you use,
      whether you summarize, paraphrase, or quote directly. Like the reference citation, this portion also serves two
      purposes:

84 | Using Outside Material
         Indicates to your reader that the ideas or words are from an outside source.
         Gives you a reader a link to the full information in the reference citation so that they can find the information

            for themselves.
               Take a look at this Wikipedia article about William Labov. Look at the first paragraph. Try clicking on
                  some of the small numbers in brackets at the end of the sentences. Where does the hyperlink read?

  · In-text citations can appear in several different ways, which are typically called author-prominent and
      information-prominent. Take a look at the above examples, and think about the differences between the two.
      Why might an author choose one over the other? What are the advantages in each example above?
         Author-prominent citations give the author's name in the text. This type of citation is typically used for one or
            more of several reasons:
               The author is well-known (this is probably the case in the example above, since William Labov is a very
                  famous linguist). If the author is famous in the field, mentioning their name first gives credibility.
               The text is addressing the author's work as opposed to only the ideas or words used from outside.
               It fits more appropriately with the structure of the sentence. This is usually a stylistic choice, and as you
                  can see above, both sentences are grammatically appropriate.
         Information-prominent citations give the cited material first, followed by the reference information. In
            contrast to author-prominent citations, these usually indicate a focus on the side of the information. This is
            typically done when the author is irrelevant to (or less relevant than) the information being cited.
               Given this information, do you think that it is an appropriate method for the example given above?

Different Methods of Citation

There are many different methods of formatting documents and given credit for outside information. These are typically
called styles, and while many disciplines and scholarly journals have their own styles of citation, we will describe several
styles which are frequently used and which you may be required to use during your academic career: APA, MLA, and
Chicago.

   Remember that there are different reasons for using outside materials. These reasons can vary by discipline, author,
and context. Each of the styles we will describe here gives credit and slightly different ways for different reasons. There
are extensive official guides online which describe the mechanics of citing information in each of these styles which
will be given below, so we will only discuss the major differences in the citation styles and some of the possible reasons
behind these differences.

   Before we go any further, take a look at the in-text citation and reference citation for each of the three styles below
and try to answer the following questions

  · What does each of the styles focus on in the citations that the other styles do not?
  · What do the styles all have in common?
  · What information is given in full, and what information is abbreviated in each of the styles?

                                                                                                                                                     Using Outside Material | 85

APA (American Psychological Association)

APA style is primarily used in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology, Linguistics, etc.). You may
have noticed that unlike MLA style, the in-text citation used in APA includes the year that the book was published.
By showing the years of the work you are citing, you allow the reader to follow the chronological development of the
research you cite, and can also show your reader how recent (or historically important) the research you are citing is.
Notice that in the reference citation, the author's first name is not given, only the initial. This is likely because most
disciplines would choose this style are more concerned with the research and its findings than with the author of the
study. In contrast, both MLA and Chicago style give the author's full name. Notice also that the year is the second piece
of information given, all the other two styles list it last.

MLA (Modern Language Association)

MLA style is predominantly used in the humanities (e.g. art, literature, music, etc.). You may have noticed that the in-
text citation for MLA does not include the year of the work. Instead, it includes only the author's last name and the page
number. As mentioned above in the description of APA, notice that the reference citation for MLA gives the full name of
the author. This is likely because works in the humanities (e.g. art, literature, music) are often more concerned with the
author and his/her work than when the work was published.

Chicago/Turabian

Chicago style is primarily designed for history and art history, but a variation of Chicago called Turabian style was
designed specifically for student research writing, and is used in many disciplines and courses, from business to
mathematics. This style is very flexible, so we recommend consulting your instructor for specifics about how you should
say to using Chicago/Turabian Style.

   In contrast APA and MLA style, Chicago and Turabian use footnotes, meaning that information about the work is
given in a footnote or endnote rather than in the text. This helps make your writing simpler and less interrupted by
bibliographic information. Credit is still given to the author, and your reader can still find the information that she/he
needs to find the source for themselves, but the style takes the focus off of the site of information and focuses on your
own writing.

Evaluating an Internet Source

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

Having internet access opens the door to an incredible amount of information that can be a great help when you're doing
your homework. However, there are so many options from what you can choose, being selective is essential. Otherwise,
you can invest a lot of time just reading, listening to, or watching available sources without getting your assignments
done. Moreover, you should also consider the possibility that some of the information you can find on the internet is not
totally reliable, appropriate for the audience, or relevant. Therefore, the challenge is to generate some well thought-out
guidelines for identifying a source, before you decide to use it for your assignment. The purpose of this lesson to tell
people about these guidelines.

Interrogating a source

As a first exercise, take some time to observe the following reference entry. Before clicking the link spend some time
observing the details provided in the entry to answer the following questions.

  · What information about the source can you get from this entry?
  · What type of source are you dealing with? How do you know that?
  · What are the details can you get from the entry?

                                        Source 1

   Now click on the link and try to find out if your guesses were accurate.
   Observe the information provided on the web page and answer the following question

  · What Is/are the names of the authors?
  · What is the name of the organization/company/group the insured information?
  · When was this information published/posted?
  · What do all these pieces of information tell you about the source?
  · Would it matter to you if any of these pieces of information were not provided? Why?

As you can see, the article comes from a newspaper. To know more about the information you can find on the different
sections of a newspaper, click on this link.

   The student has been given the following prompts to guide her as she writes her final papers for three different
structures. Read the prompts carefully and decide whether the article from the Guardian (Source 1) would be a good
source for any of the assignments. Does this article meet the student information needs as the writer of these three
papers? State the reasons for your answer.

 1. Write a descriptive essay in which you report the different opinions, good or bad, held by the general public about
                                                                                                                                            Evaluating an Internet Source | 91
      public vs private education. This should be based on the results of a survey that you will conduct in your
      neighborhood. The survey will collect people's opinions about private and public education with respect to the
      following topics student learning outcomes, quality and availability of learning materials, local schools facilities,
      the quality of teaching, and tuition costs and fees if any.
2. Write a persuasive piece in which you argue that the teaching profession in the U.S. is undergoing a severe crisis.
      You must include at least three reasons why teachers present situation to be considered as a crisis. You will have
      to support each of your argument with evidence e.g. statistics, experts opinions, scientific reports.
3. Summarize at least three different scholarly articles to address the problem of the shortage of teachers in England.
      Make sure you clearly state the purpose of each study, the method used, and the results obtained in each case.
      Take into account that you'll have to present your summaries to a committee of professors in your department
      who are experts on the topic.

Discuss two reasons with your classmates and your instructor. Compare your answers and opinions about this exercise
with their ideas for writing on a public page

Relevance, reliability, and appropriateness.

Relevance

The prompts in the previous section and Source 1 have overlapping ideas with regard to topics and subtopics, but also
differ in certain aspects. To find out if it is a good idea to use a source from the same as described in the prompts you
should consider the similarities and differences. Let us analyze each case separately.

   Prompt A and the newspaper's article have something in common: they both address the topic of education. The
article talks about the problem of public school teachers' salaries and one aspect included in the prompt also talks about
teachers' work, in particular the quality of their work. The similarities between the article and the prompt end there.

   There are differences between the articles and the prompt that should be considered.

  · The assignment prompt clearly states that the content of the paper should be based on a survey previously
      conducted by the student. The results of the survey will provide "first-hand" information that the author (in this
      case the student) is supposed to collect directly from her neighbors. For this reason, this type of information is
      considered as a primary source. On the contrary, the article provides information that the newspaper's writer has
      taken from various sources. She used this information to prove her point. This is why this sort of document is
      considered as a secondary source. Thus, the newspaper article is not the right type of source that the assignment
      prompt requires

  · The assignment requires information about the quality of public and private education. The article only talks about
      teachers' low salaries. It does not address the other topics required in the prompt such as learning materials,
      school facilities, or tuition costs. Therefore, the information in the newspaper article does not fully address the
      contents listed in the prompt.

   The content of the article and the type of information it provides do not address the prompt. Therefore, it could be
said that this particular source does not meet the writer's information needs. In such cases, you can say that, although
the article may be interesting and it is published in a well-reputed newspaper, the source is not relevant for the purpose

92 | Evaluating an Internet Source
of this particular assignment. A relevant source should address your information needs as a writer considering the
content and type of the source that best fits your writing purpose.

   Exercise 1
   Consider how relevant Source 1 would be to address Prompts b and c. Compare your evaluation with your colleagues
and your instructor.

Reliability

Let us revisit Prompt b and compare it with information available on Source 1:

       b. Write a persuasive piece in which you argue that the teaching profession in the US is undergoing a severe
       crisis. You must include at least three reasons why teachers' present situation should be considered as a crisis.
       You will have to support each of your arguments with evidence (e.g. statistics, experts' opinions, scientific
       reports).

Remember that Source 1 talks about the shortage of teachers associated to the low salaries offered in most teaching
positions. Considering that the assignment's purpose is to argue that the teaching profession is in crisis, you can say
that Source 1 is relevant for the assignment at hand. However, when you are preparing an assignment, relevance is not
the only characteristic you should take into account. You also need to consider the sources' reliability.

   Reliability refers to the extent to which the text represents reality. When a text is reliable, you can depend on its being
truthful, objective, and free from bias (personal tendencies or preferences). In other words, a reliable text should be
consistent with the world it tries to represent. A reliable source is supposed to represent reality as faithfully as possible
by offering facts, evidence, and logical reasoning, as opposed to mere opinions.

   A typical obstacle to hinder the reliability of a source is the writers' bias. This means that writers may sometimes mix
their personal opinions in the presentation of the facts, which makes us wonder whether one can truly trust in what
they say.

   Ideally, we all want information that we can fully depend on or rely on. Unfortunately, sometimes the information we
find on the internet may contain claims that are biased. We should take this type of information with caution, especially
if you are going to use the information in your assignments. This takes us back to consider whether Source 1 can be
considered reliable.

   You may remember that the article comes from a British newspaper called The Guardian. At this point you may ask
yourself if The Guardian is a well-regarded newspaper and, most importantly, you may ask if newspaper in general can
be taken as reliable sources. The answer to these questions is not straightforward. It may greatly depend on the type
of newspaper, the reputation of the particular publication, the section of the newspaper where a particular article is
published, and the editorial line of the newspaper. To know more about newspapers and how they are classified, click
on the following links:types of newspapers and objectivity.

   As a rule of thumb, before deciding on using a newspaper article in your assignments, remember that newspapers, no
matter how well-reputed they are, may have a political slant (preference or inclination) and most of them are oriented
towards profit (after all, newspapers are there for the business). This means that you should always keep in mind that
newspaper column writers do not provide "facts" for the sole sake of providing facts. They may be favoring a particular
point of view which colors their writing. Therefore, whether the newspaper is owned by a private company or by the
government, a conflict of interest is often at play in the presentation of the news. For this reason, always ask yourself:

· What is the political slant of this source?
· Whose interest are the writers favoring in this article?
· What evidence is presented to prove the writers' claims?

                                                            Evaluating an Internet Source | 93
Coming back to Source 1, you should know that The Guardian is a newspaper that has a liberal slant but a good
reputation because of its efforts to be as objective as possible. This means that, although the articles published in this
publication tend to support the left wing, they usually offer some evidence to support their claims. However, remember
that Prompt b requires you to write a persuasive essay, which means that you have to offer a balanced argumentation.
Using only an article from a leftwing newspaper as your source will not suffice. You need to get other points of view and
put them into conversation to make a well-balanced argument. In conclusion, Source 1 is only partially reliable for the
writing purpose at hand.

   The same considerations that we have discussed about newspapers also apply to all sort of news you can find on the
internet such as those on TV networks websites, radio station websites, and online magazines websites, among others.
An interesting example to consider is the one of Wikipedia. To find out more about the degree of reliability of this famous
open-access encyclopedia, click on the following link.

   A couple of ideas that can help you in your search of reliable material are the following:

       a) Whether the creator of the source is an expert or professional in that specific field
       b) Whether the source is reviewed by peer professionals in the same field before it was published.

Exercise 2
Look at the following two sources and rate their degree of reliability in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 means highly
reliable and 0 means not reliable at all. [Hint: Where they are from gives hints.]

Appropriateness

Saying that a source is appropriate may imply two different things:

       i) The source affords information that a particular audience may be inclined to accept and find as credible. For
       instance, scientists have preference for information that is supported by data and use specialized terminology to
       express complex concepts. On the other hand, personal experience and touching stories will be more appealing
       to the general audience.

          ii) The source successfully achieves a specific purpose with the audience. For instance, a source may
       successfully persuade the readers but fail to entertain them.

In any case, the question of whether a source is appropriate or not is related to the audience you have in mind when you

94 | Evaluating an Internet Source
write. Effective writers always think of their audience at every step of the writing process. This means that when you
select your sources you also need to consider your audience. Who are your potential readers? Do you want to inform
these readers, persuade them of your point of view, or tell a story to make a point? You need to answer these questions
when you are selecting your sources.

   Let us now consider whether Source 1 is appropriate for Prompt c:

       c. Summarize at least three different scholarly articles that address the problem of the shortage of teachers in
       England. Make sure you clearly state the purpose of each study, the method used, and the results obtained in
       each case. Take into account that you will have to present your summaries to a committee of professors in your
       Department who are experts on the topic.

This writing assignment expects students to summarize three scholarly articles (meaning they are written by a group
of specialists in the corresponding academic field). First of all, The Guardian is not a scholarly journal (to know what sort
of publication scholarly journals are, you can follow this link). So, even though the topic discussed in Source 1 is related
to that of the prompt (this means that the source is relevant), Source 1 is not the type of source required by the prompt.
Why is this so?

   First of all, your audience is a group of professors in your department, who are experts in the field. As such, this
audience expects highly reliable material, usually written by experts in their same field. That is the reason why the
prompt specifically asks you to use only scholarly journal articles.

   Second, your purpose or goal is to summarize the articles for this group of experts. The scholarly articles you use as
sources should feature primary research and your summary should succinctly incorporate the purpose, the method,
and the results of these studies. Newspapers like the Guardian can only provide facts and opinions from experts and
researchers, but such articles never describe research studies in detail. This is because newspaper articles do not target
a group of specialists as their main audience and their purpose is not to popularize research results.

   Therefore, for a source to be appropriate, it should contain information that may be consideredacceptable for the
standards of youraudience and contributes to the purpose of your writing piece.

   Exercise 3
With a group of two or more colleagues, consider the following two sources:

Source 2                                                           Source 5

Fulbeck, E. S. (2014). Teacher Mobility and Financial Incentives:  Teachers have it easy: The big sacrifices and small salaries of

Source 2 is about the relationship between teacher mobility and salary change. It is from a peer-reviewed journal. Source
5 is about the imbalance between teachers' efforts in work and their low pay. It is from a trade journal Education Week.

   With this information in mind, do the following two tasks.

       a. At first sight, make a guess about which one is more reliable than the other.
       [Hint: Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis is a scholarly journal. Education Week is a trade journal.]

          b. Consider the following situations and decide whether the sources are appropriate for the intended
       audiences, assuming that both sources are relevant and reliable.

                                                                   Evaluating an Internet Source | 95

Newspapers as a Source: Types, Sections, and
Objectivity

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

A newspaper is a publication that is periodically published (daily or weekly) that presents news and informative articles.
In the past, newspapers were only published on paper, usually of the cheapest quality possible to make them affordable
to the public and profitable for the publisher as well. Nowadays you can still find newspapers in their traditional form
(paper based) or online.

Types of newspapers

Newspapers can be classified in different ways depending on their format, the type of news they cover, and their
periodicity. One classification scheme divides this type of publications into two large groups: broadsheets and tabloids.
Initially this classification was only based on the size of the pages. A tabloid is usually half the size of a broadsheet.
However, with time, tabloids became associated with sensationalist news that present biased (or sometimes even false)
information written in a style meant to scandalize happenings so as to catch readers' attention. In contrast, broadsheets
are usually considered as serious publications that strive to present news in an objective manner.

   A second classification scheme is based on the coverage of the news published in the newspaper. Although most
newspapers would usually contain news of the most relevant international and national events, some newspapers have a
special focus on either regional or local news. For this reason, these types of newspaper are only sold in a specific town
or region. On the other hand, national newspapers cover news of national and international interest and are sold all over
a country. The last classification deals with how often the newspaper is published, which could be daily, three times or
twice a week (biweekly or triweekly), once a week (weekly), or even once a month (monthly). Those newspapers that are
published on a monthly or weekly basis sometimes focus on specialized news such as sports, arts, business, or news of
local interest [click here to go back to reliability].

Newspaper sections

The article "Golden handcuffs for teachers won't solve the staffing crisis in our schools" was published in The Guardian,
a well-respected British newspaper. Follow the hotlink provided in the reference entry to visit the article's webpage.
Once you are there, pay attention to the following details:

  · On the left of the article's title, you will notice a couple of subtitles. One of them says "Teachers Shortage" (orange
      fonts). The second title simply says "Opinion" (gray fonts).

  · If you follow these links, you will notice that the first subtitle gives you access to other articles on the same topic
      which were published in the previous months.

  · The "Opinion" link takes you to the section of the same name. What does the word "opinion" mean in this context?
  · How does the information in the "Opinion" section (also called "Editorial" section in other newspapers) differ from

      the information provided in other sections?

                                                                                                    Newspapers as a Source: Types, Sections, and Objectivity | 101
   In the past, when newspapers were actually just made out of paper, they all had different sections that readers could
actually differentiate because they were placed on different pages. These sections were used to present the information
classified in categories so that busy readers could only focus on those news they really cared about. For instance, if a
reader only wanted to read the sports news, s/he could simply search for the sport page and ignore other sections such
as entertainment or classified advertisements. Nowadays, if you want to search for a particular section on an online
newspaper you have to look at the hotlinks. These links are usually on a ribbon or link menu placed on one of the margins
of the webpage (usually the top or the left margin on Western newspapers).

   Knowing the nature of the information that each newspaper section affords is of great importance to evaluate a
source taken from a newspaper. The section of "Opinion" on The Guardian's webpage, for example, is devoted to articles
that express the writers' opinions on a given subject, usually a controversial issue. This means that the journalists do
not claim being objective or impartial when they write these pieces. On the contrary, the authors freely present their
political views or make value judgement of the situations/events being discussed, which is not usually done in other
types of journalism. This does not mean that in the "Opinion" section writers do not present evidence to support their
claims. They sometimes but not always do! In most of them, the author(s) voice their point of view and weakly support
that without providing adequate evidence.

   Furthermore, some of these pieces are not confident enough to bring up alternative viewpoints for the audience
to have a complete picture and then decide which side to believe. These types of articles are trying to persuade the
audience to adopt a particular point of view. By contrast, other sections may have a very different focus. For instance,
the "World news" section may only focus on presenting facts while the "Fashion" section may afford more visual material
to describe or promote a new trend. To sum up, be cautious before you decide to cite the content in the "Opinion"
section of the source.

   As an exercise, you can visit a different online newspaper and browse the news provided on each section. Ask yourself
the following questions:

  · What is the purpose of this piece? To inform? To persuade? To narrate a real story? To sell a product/service? To
      give advice?

  · Does/do the author(s) claim something about a specific topic? If yes, how do they support their claims? With
      logic/facts/statistics/emotional appeals/visual evidence/experts' opinions? [Click here to go back to Evaluating
      an Internet Source]

Objectivity

It was mentioned before that broadsheets usually publish news that are written in an objective manner. This means that
the writers do their best to represent the facts as close to the reality as possible, without involving their feelings or
opinions in the report. If you consider that writers are human beings with feelings and opinions, and that newspapers
are a business whose first objective is to make profits, being objective becomes a complex matter. For this reason, we
cannot talk about a piece of news that is absolutely objective and a newspaper that is 100% free from bias. In fact,
newspapers usually take a particular political stance (position) that somehow determines how the news, especially
the editorial or opinion sections, are presented. Some newspapers are said to have a left, center, or right tendency,
depending on the type of political views they hold or political parties they favor. A newspaper's political stance also
determines its audience. This means that, for example, a conservative audience would usually favor a conservative type
of newspaper.

   As a reader, it is important to be aware of the newspaper's stance and consider it whenever you read your news. A
good principle is not to get your news from a single source. This practice will allow you to see the different points of
views about a particular event and decide for yourself, instead of simply following other's opinions. This is especially

102 | Newspapers as a Source: Types, Sections, and Objectivity
important if you are considering using newspaper articles as part of your sources for an assignment. Moreover, you
should keep this principle in mind when browsing news on other sources different from newspapers, such as TV, radio
broadcasts, or online sources such as Google News, or Yahoo News. They all follow a stance and address an audience
with a political point of view [Click here to go back to reliability]

   As an exercise, you can observe the following statements about the problem of global warming taken from the
websites of two famous TV Networks (You can also click on the hotlinks to read the whole articles). Consider the
following questions:

  · If you only read the headlines on the Fox News article, what is the idea that you get about the causes of global
      warming?

  · Is that the same idea that you get once you read the content of the article (pay attention to the words that were
      bolded for your reading convenience)?

  · According to the CNN News website, what is causing global warning?
  · Do these two articles agree on the causes of global warming? Why is that?

The Case of Wikipedia

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA

The first and foremost criteria for checking the reliability of a source can include the following: a) whether the creator
of the source is an expert or professional in that specific field; b) whether the source is reviewed by peer professionals
in the same field before it was published.

   A practical example for using these criteria is the use of Wikipedia. The reliability of the information published on
the Wikipedia varies a great deal. The main reason is that Wikipedia is a web resource collaboratively constructed by
writers with various levels of credential and expertise. Both experts and novice can contribute to a topic. What's worse,
any addition or modification is published even before the designated administering team can oversee the content. If a
lie appears in Wikipedia, the content will be available on line for a while before the administrators can spot it. There are
several anecdotes of this sort of incidents with the Wikipedia. In one of them, a student made up a "famous" quote for a
Wikipedia page about the life and works of a famous composer. The student issued it right after the composer died. The
spreading rate was so fast that the quote had been cited at a huge amount before the administrators could eliminate
the false quote. Details of this story can be found at this news website: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30699302/
ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/student-hoaxes-worlds-media-wikipedia/#.VtoCS8D2ZMs or you
can google this article "Student hoaxes world's media on Wikipedia".

   In spite of this and other similar cases, the public is still inclined to trust the information in Wikipedia. In fact, many
people who are not familiar with one topic will first look something up in Wikipedia. Is this totally wrong? Well, not
entirely. Wikipedia sources can be useful when one is not familiar with a certain topic and wants to find out some
general introductory information about it. It can be a very nice ice-breaker between the information seekers and the
topic. However, its function will end here. If you are planning on writing a scholarly piece of writing or even a paper
for a college-level course, you should look for more reliable sources than Wikipedia. Always look for materials that have
been subjected to editorial scrutiny before being published. This means that someone else, who are usually colleagues
or professionals in the same field, had a close examination on the document before it was published or uploaded. The
most reliable sources are usually those that were reviewed by a group of experts on the subject. Therefore, to produce
a reliable piece of writing, such as a course paper or a journal article, one had better start from some scholarly journal
articles which have been subjected to a process called peer-reviewing. You can learn more about this process in the
following link.

Scholarly Journals

The articles that you can find in a scholarly journal may be research reports, essays, or book reviews. These texts
are usually written by experts and addressed to experts in the same field (e.g. scientists and university professors).
Therefore the language may be highly specialized or technical. Some scholarly journals are regarded as highly reliable
sources not only because they are written by experts, but because their content is submitted to a peer-review process.
This means that a group of experts in the field read the article before it is authorized to be published in the journal. In
this process, the peer-reviewers provide pertinent feedback so that the author(s) can make any necessary changes to
ensure the quality of the publication. If you want to make sure that your search in ProQuest renders only peer-reviewed
journals, you need to check the corresponding box before you click on search (see picture below). All scholarly journals
always provide detailed references at the end of the article so that the readers will be able to locate the sources used by
the author and read these sources directly if they desire to do so [click here to go back to appropriate].

Trade Journals

A trade journal is usually addressed to practitioners in a given profession. For this reason, the topics in this sort of
publications are usually related to practical matters within a specific type of work or occupation. You will not find state
of the art research reports in this type of journal. Moreover, some trade journals are peer-reviewed by experts, but
that is not the norm. In most cases, the articles only go under the scrutiny of an editor. This means that someone who
works for the journal, usually a professional writer, helps the author refine details such as grammar, spelling, and other
formatting details before the article is published. Trade journal articles sometimes provide lists of references, but these
lists tend to be rather short.

Magazines

Magazines can vary in topic but the contents are usually addressed to a non-professional/non-expert type of audience.
Therefore, the articles are not too specialized and may only be of interest to those who do not know much about a
specific topic. A magazine article is usually edited, but not peer-reviewed. In some cases, magazine articles may present
more in-depth information about a topic as opposed to a newspaper article. Usually, magazine articles can be longer and
the authors have more time to work on their articles. As for their sources, magazine articles may only mention the name
of the person who provided the information, or say that a certain fact was proved by a recent study. However, the details
of the sources used are not always provided. Finally, you should also remember that just as there are different types

                                                                                                                                       Sources in a ProQuest Database | 105
of newspapers, there are also different types of magazines written for different audiences and with diverse degrees of
reliability and levels of specialization.

Newspapers

Newspaper articles may be written by journalists who are not experts on a topic but have the necessary skills to do
some secondary research on the topic and report the information they find. Since newspaper writers are pressed by
time to publish on a daily or weekly basis, they have less time to refine their work and verify their claims than magazine
writers. Additionally, as in the case of magazine writers, newspaper writers do not always provide clear references for
their sources. In the best cases, the writers of online newspaper articles provide hotlinks to their references, but that is
not always the case. [Click here to go back to Evaluating an Internet Source]

Introduction

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS
Throughout your academic career, it is very likely that you will be asked to write a summary. This is related to, but
more extensive than, the summarizing discussed in the last chapter about how to incorporate outside material. Much
like the summarizing described in the last chapter, a summary provides a shorter version of a text. However, while
summarizing a text to support your own writing is typically only a few sentences, a summary is a standalone document
which gives the reader a brief version of the original text. This may seem simple, but the way that you write a summary
of a text depends on the purpose for writing the summary. In the following chapter, we will discuss the following
elements of writing a successful summary:

Reading and Understanding Texts

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS

2.1 Reading the text and getting started

When writing a summary, one very common tendency is to focus too much on only one or two points or details of the
text and fail to provide the reader with an overall view of the entire text. It may help to think of a summary as a
shrunken version of the original text. To help visualize this, imagine that the source text is a t-shirt with a pattern
covering the entire shirt. If you want to make the shirt smaller but still show the pattern, you cannot simply cut off the
sleeves or the bottom half of the shirt and put them together. You must shrink the entire shirt and keep everything the
way that you found it. As you write your summary, keep this image in mind, and as you revise, make sure that you can
see the overall image of the original text.

   As mentioned above, one important purpose of a summary is to help you understand the text, and in some cases, show
others that you understand the text. Therefore, it is essential that you read the text thoroughly at least twice in order to
develop a basic understanding of the ideas. Below are some tips for reading a text which you will be summarizing:

  · Annotate as you read. It is extremely helpful when reading to annotate the text (highlight, underline, make notes).
      These notes will help you to understand the text as you read it again, and will also help you keep track of
      important ideas.

  · Find the thesis. Remember that in your own writing, there is an underlying thesis, the main point (or points) of the
      text, which holds everything together, and all of the details and support in the text should point to and support
      this thesis. The same is true of most writing that you will read, so finding the thesis first will be greatly helpful as
      you attempt to understand and summarize the text.

  · Pay close attention to headings and subheadings. Most academic articles (and even many news articles, especially
      online) have headings and subheadings. These will help you to understand the material, but will also help you when
      determining how you will organize your summary and which details you will include. As you read, pay attention to
      the headings and subheadings and consider how each section contributes to the overall thesis of the text.

2.2 Strategies for successful reading

Although the tips above may help you understand how to read and understand a text generally, readers often get stuck
at the paragraph or sentence level. Sometimes you may have difficulty understanding new terminology. If you're reading
something from a new, unfamiliar discipline, you may have a hard time understanding a text without having background
information. Sometimes, you may just get bored while reading. Below, we offer some specific strategies to help you stay
on track while reading and understand texts at the sentence, paragraph, and whole-text level. If you're having trouble
reading, stop, take a deep breath, and try some of the strategies below to get a better grasp on what the author is trying
to express.

  · Skimming: Quickly look through the headings and subheadings: See if you can figure out what the author is trying
      to say; in other words, what his or her point is. Look for words related to headings and subheadings in the text.

  · Framing: Read the first sentence of a paragraph, then go the bottom of the paragraph. Ask yourself: Are you having
      difficulty understanding how the author got to the final sentence? If so, go back through the paragraph and read
      the rest of it, looking for the same or similar words from the initial and last sentences.

112 | Reading and Understanding Texts
· Scanning: If you are looking for a particular word, identify that word and search the printed text using your index
   finger, or with digital text, by scrolling and looking for it with your eyes.

· Referencing: Keep a dictionary on hand, especially when you are reading what you find to be a difficult text or it is
   in a discipline that is unfamiliar to you. Your dictionary can either be digital or print.

                                                                                                                                   Reading and Understanding Texts | 113
The Purpose of Summaries

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS

When a writer sees "summary" as part of his or her instructions on how to write something, this can fill the writer with
dread. The writer's mind might begin to seem backlogged with questions, such as What is a summary?, Why do I need to
do this?, What if I leave out something important?, and What if I plagiarize and don't even realize it?

   With the appropriate level of understanding and preparation, a writer needing to develop a summary can be better
able to face such a task with greater confidence and skill.

   What are some reasons why someone might want to summarize something?
  · Improve understanding (current self). When you summarize something, you are engaging a thought process

      which grants you the opportunity to internalize the subject undergoing summary and produce a work which helps
      you put the concepts into a shape which you can more readily comprehend because you did the work to make
      sense of it.
  · Create a concise version for future reference (future self). Especially when conducting research on a topic, you
      might not be able to keep every resource you need on hand at all times. An example of something like this is an
      annotated bibliography. Also, you may want to keep a record of sorts of the kinds of resources you'll need for
      different research topics and directions. A summary for future reference can help you at some future point when
      you need to analyze a source for usefulness.
  · Show someone or some number of other people that you understand (others). There are times when you will
      need to demonstrate your ability to comprehend and communicate others' ideas, such as in a complex research
      paper or when showing an instructor what you learned from different readings. How will each of these audiences
      affect the way that you write your summary? Audience is a paramount consideration in how one chooses to
      approach the development of a piece of writing. So, how do you go about dealing with the different audiences
      within these reasons we've mentioned: current self, future self, and others?

114 | The Purpose of Summaries
Types of Summary

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS

There are two primary types of summary: Descriptive and evaluative. As with many types of writing, not all summaries
will fit perfectly into one of these categories, but these descriptions can help you know where to start when writing a
summary.

  · Descriptive: A descriptive summary is very much rooted in expressing facts. It focuses on the essence of the item
      under review, sharing the main point and any important, supporting details. The writer's opinion is rarely found in
      a descriptive summary. It is a concise description of the work, which means the writer uses as a few words as
      possible to convey the essential elements of the item being summarized.

  · Evaluative: Just like the word "evaluative" suggests, this type of summary requires the writer to evaluate the item
      being summarized. This classification of summary is opinion-heavy. While a few basic facts about the piece are
      required, such as the author and the title and the main point of the piece, the remainder consists of the summary
      writer's viewpoints of the work. The author will detail his or her perception of the work in such areas as intended
      audience and purpose and how well these are addressed in the work. The person evaluating the item will also look
      at how this item will be useful to him or her and examine where it falls short. Because the types and frequency of
      examination found in the evaluative summary may involve extensive explanation, it will very likely be longer than
      the typical descriptive summary.

4.1 When are these used?

  · Descriptive: A writer uses a descriptive summary when he or she wants to gain and express an understanding of
      what the author said in the original text.

  · Evaluative: A writer will choose this summary type when he or she wants to examine the original text for
      usefulness, validity, strength of argument, or other important elements.

4.2 Connecting audience and purpose

  · More often than not, descriptive summaries will be used with two of the three intended audiences mentioned
      above - current self and others. The descriptive summary will help a writer process the main and supporting ideas
      in the works.

  · However, an evaluative summary could address current self, future self, and others, depending on why you might
      be writing the summary. If you are trying to work on a project in at a given moment which requires source
      analysis, then an evaluative summary might be the best way to go. When considering your future self and how to
      write a summary, an evaluative summary written early on may help you save time when you are in the middle of
      finishing a project later. And, if you are making a recommendation to others as to whether they should use the
      source, an evaluative summary might be your best choice.

                                                                                                                                                          Types of Summary | 115

   As you become familiar with how to write summaries and how to think about audience, you will likely be better able
to make such decisions by yourself. Note that both types of summaries will be in the summary writer's own words as
much as possible to avoid the suggestion of plagiarism, which we will discuss later in this chapter.

The Moves of Writing Summaries

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS

Now that we have discussed the two basic types of summary (descriptive and evaluative) and some possible reasons you
might use either one, we will give a few practical tips for writing summaries, including how to organize your summary,
which details you should include from the original text, and a few grammar points that can be tricky.

5.1 Organization

The organization of a summary will almost always follow the overall organization of the original text. Remember that
in a descriptive summary, your goal is to convey the same information as the original text in a more concise manner.
However, there may be some exceptions to this, especially when writing evaluative summaries. While it is still essential
to express the main points of the text, you may want to highlight some strengths or flaws in the text through your
organization.

5.2 Including details

One of the most common difficulties students have when writing summaries is deciding which details and information
to include. A summary, whether descriptive or evaluative, should portray the overall meaning of the text (remember
our metaphor about shrinking a t-shirt), but it can be difficult to balance showing the full picture with providing
unnecessary details. Here are a few tips for deciding which details to include:

  · Include one or two examples at most for each main idea presented in the body of your summary. Remember that
      in a descriptive summary especially, your objective is to give a general idea of what the text was about, so avoid
      including too many details. When writing an evaluative summary, it may be appropriate to give more details or
      examples when examining one particular idea in the text.

  · When writing, and especially when revising, consider whether the examples or details that you include are
      necessary to explain or support the main ideas of the text. Will your reader be able to understand the thesis and
      main points of the text without the detail or example?

  · Unless you are providing specific details (numbers, important quotes, etc.), express details and examples in your
      own words by paraphrasing. Many writers fall into the trap of simply copying and pasting information from the
      original text. Even if the quotation is properly cited (we'll discuss how to do this more below), too many direct
      quotations cause the summary to simply be a patchwork of the original text rather than a concise summary in your
      own words which still shows the overall image and main point of the text.

5.3 Language moves

There are a few important grammatical features that are common to summaries which may seem minor or unimportant,
but can actually have a significant effect on the meaning of your writing.

                                                                                                                                      The Moves of Writing Summaries | 117
   Let's begin by reading the following very brief summary. Focus especially on the verbs, how and when they are used,
and their tense. Take notes of the things you notice.

          In the essay "Making the Grade," Kurt Weisenfeld, a professor of Physics at Georgia Tech University,
       argues that there has been a discernible decline in his students' work ethic over the last generation. Based
       on his own personal interactions with his students, he observed that many of his students failed to see the
       connection between their final grades and their own personal hard work (or lack thereof). Rather, they
       seemed to feel they are simply entitled to the grades they want. Weisenfeld theorizes that their indifference
       towards learning is the result of a society saturated with superficial values and the "erosion of quality
       control" for grades in the public education system (e.g. giving out grades that were not really earned).
       Because most of his students are science and engineering majors, he fears that their poor work ethic and
       "hyperrational thinking" could potentially result in costly or harmful engineering accidents.

There are two prominent features in this summary which are important for any summary:
   1. The author uses verbs that indicate they are summarizing. For example, "Kurt Weisenfeld [...] argues that,"

"Weisenfeld theorizes that," and "he fears that." Generally, when you write a summary, your reader (whether a professor,
a colleague, or yourself) will know that you are summarizing from another text. However, it is still important to indicate
that you are summarizing because it helps you to ensure that you are summarizing the author's ideas rather than your
own. This is essential when writing an evaluative summary because you must keep the author's ideas and your evaluation
of those ideas separate.

   2. The author primarily uses present tense ("argues", "theorizes", "fears"), but also uses the past tense ("observed").
Why do you think the author selects these tenses? What difference would it make if the author said "Weisenfeld
theorized that..." in line 5? The use of tense when talking about someone else's work or writing is a challenge for almost
all academic writers, regardless of how long they have been writing, and unfortunately there are no hard and fast rules
as to which tense should be used when. However, there are some general principles which can help you decide which
tense to use:

   a. Generally, the present tense is used to describe an idea or argument which an author put forth in the text. It helps
to think of a text as the author talking to you. Although the author finished writing this idea down at some point in the
past, they are still presently making this statement or argument through the text. An exception to this would be if you
know for a fact that the author has since renounced their idea, or no longer believes it.

   b. Generally, the past tense is used to describe an event or action that occurs in the text. For example, this is
commonly used to talk about the methodology or events that the author used to reach their conclusions or support
their
arguments.

   c. It is important to note that the use of tense can also indicate the writer's stance on the idea reported. If the writer
uses present tense, he or she is not questioning the idea, but accepting it as still valid. If the writer uses past tense, he
or she often will go on to show that the idea is no longer valid or that the writer disagrees with it.

Avoiding Plagiarism when Writing Summaries

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS

Because a summary is a restatement of someone else's work, it can be very easy to plagiarize unintentionally. In the
section below, we'll discuss places where it can be especially easy to plagiarize unintentionally, some tips to avoid
plagiarism when summarizing, and when we need to cite in a summary.

6.1 When could plagiarism occur in a summary?

Because you are summarizing what someone else has written, it can be easy to commit the plagiarism of words that
we discussed in the previous chapter, especially when it comes to describing the details and specifics of an author's
argument or support for that argument. Many writers may incorrectly believe that because the reader typically knows
that a summary is taken from someone else's text, it is unnecessary to quote or cite words that are directly taken.
However, just like with any other use of outside material, you must always give credit for directly copied words. In
addition, the use of verbs which indicate that you are summarizing from another text will help you to keep your retelling
of the author's ideas separate from your own interpretation or evaluation of those ideas, especially in an evaluative
summary. Although the previous chapter gives great detail about how to cite from outside sources, we will review how
and when to do this in a summary below.

6.2 When do we need to cite in a summary?

You will recall from the previous chapter that there are two different types of citations: Full reference citations, and
in-text citations, both of which are important and used when writing any type of summary. It will help to recall the
reasons that we cite at all. First, to give credit to someone else for their work and second, to help our reader find the
cited information. Both types of citation perform both of these functions in a summary:

  · Again, even though your reader will likely be aware that this is a summary of another text and not necessarily your
      original ideas, you must include a full reference citation either before or after the summary, depending on your
      preference or your instructor's requirement. Some instructors prefer that the reference citation be at the top of
      the page before the text, and some prefer that it be on a references page at the end. Either way, the inclusion of a
      reference citation acknowledges that you are describing someone else's work and gives your reader the ability to
      find the source easily. When you write a summary for your own research purposes, this can help you create a sort
      of catalogue so that you can easily go back and find the original source if you need to.

  · In-text citations are mandatory after any direct quotation from the text, or after specific details and information
      (e.g. numbers, dates, etc.), even if they are not directly quoted. Citing this information directly first helps to
      separate the author's direct words from your description of their ideas. It also provides your reader with the ability
      to easily go back and find the information in the article themselves.

                                                                                                                    Avoiding Plagiarism when Writing Summaries | 119
Exercises and Resources

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS
Using about 250 words, reflect on your reading of this chapter and your participation in the above exercises. First,
summarize the main points of this chapter. Then, consider and write down what new information you learned. Also,
think through and document how this chapter reinforced your previous understanding of summary writing. Finally,
consider contexts in which you might need to write a summary. What types of information will you need to include for
these audiences. Describe how confident you are in your ability to write a summary now. If you think you need to do or
learn something else to gain more confidence, what do you think this is and how do you plan to go about doing it?

TRANSITIONAL DEVICES

In this chapter we analyze the use of two transitional expressions that are frequently used in academic writing: however
and although. Transitional expressions/signals are important coherence devices that guide your readers to understand
the logic between your ideas. For example, transitional expressions such as also, and, and in addition can help the
readers understand your intention to share an additional idea; transitional devices such as in summary, in conclusion,
and finally can signify the readers that you are concluding your previously stated ideas. It is very likely that you already
understand the meaning of these words. However, you may sometimes hesitate when using them in your writing.
Therefore, we expect that a closer observation of the examples provided here will help you improve the way you use
transitions in your writing.

                                                                                                                                                        Transitional Devices | 121

Activity 1

1.1. The following passages use the word however to connect ideas and express a specific purpose. Read the passages
and try to differentiate appropriate and inappropriate uses of however. Discuss with your peers why however has been
used inappropriately in each example.

 1. Department of Education noted that state and local officials should have the flexibility to determine appropriate
      content for a student's summary, which must be based on the student's individual needs and post secondary goals.
      However, this flexibility must be balanced with the need to assure that students with disabilities, upon leaving
      high school, have a comprehensive summary of performance (SOP) that promotes self-determination.

 2. One of the greatest advantages of using technology at schools is that students can communicate with people all
      over the world. However, in contrast there are also some disadvantages.

 3. After I finished my first year of college, I decided to move off campus and I saw many differences between living on
      and off campus. However, there are many differences between living on and off campus that can impact on
      students' health, academic performance, and personal comfort.

 4. Brazil's average per capita income had fallen from a peak of 25 percent of the U.S. average in the 1960s to just 16
      percent by the late 1990s. In the last decade, however, that number began to climb, and it has now risen to roughly
      20 percent.

 5. Nowadays most teachers can optimize instruction by using technology in their classes instead of just talking or
      using the chalkboard. However, digital devices such as the smartphone have become an essential tool for students.

 6. It cannot be established with any certainty what happened to the Titanic during its descent to the seabed.
      However, what is now known is that once the ship disappeared below the ocean's surface, it broke into three
      pieces.

 7. Nowadays, students spend a great deal of money on textbooks, however, the idea of replacing textbooks with
      tablets may be a solution to reduce the cost of education.

 8. There are many differences between English and Korean, such as their alphabets, grammatical structure, and the
      use of honorifics. However, it is clear that Korean is harder to learn than English because of its alphabet, grammar,
      and the use of honorifics.

 9. 25 Male participants' favorite brand of cigarettes remained stable across the 5 telephone surveys (2003-2008);
      however, female participants' favorite brand changed dramatically after the Camel No. 9 advertising campaign.

10. Teachers, students, and tutors responded that some student materials could be clearer; however, overall the
      clarity of those materials was acceptable.

1.2. List the passages in which however has been accurately and appropriately used (You can simply write the numbers
of each passage).

   Numbers: ____________________________________________
   1.3. In the following chart list the problematic cases and write down a brief explanation about each problem.

Passage Number  Possible Reasons

Based on an analysis of 100 student essays, we found that however, the transitional expression is often misused.
Therefore, the goal of the following activities is two-fold. First, it aims to raise your awareness of when and how however
should be used appropriately in academic writing. Second, these activities challenge you to practice the use of however
as a contrastive transitional device.

Activity 2

Read the following sentences in which however has been used appropriately and follow the instructions given below:

       1) Sentences 1-5 emphasize one main theme. Identify this theme and circle it.
          2) Sentences 6-10 emphasize two themes. Identify and circle them.
          3) In all of the sentences, two features are in contrast. Identify and underline these features.
          4) Work out a rule as to when however should be used.

Example: The United Arab Emirates' rapid modernization has brought remarkable advancements in public health.
However, modernization also has brought new risks (e.g. an increment in non-infectious conditions such as cancer).

 1. Brazil's average per capita income had fallen from a peak of 25 percent of the U.S. average in the 1960s to just 16
      percent by the late 1990s. However, in the last decade, Brazil's average per capita income began to climb, and it has
      now risen to roughly 20 percent.

2. Department of Education noted that state and local officials should have the flexibility to determine appropriate
      content for a student's summary, which must be based on the student's individual needs and postsecondary goals.

124 | However as a Transitional Device
      However, this flexibility must be balanced with the need to assure that students with disabilities, upon leaving high
      school, have a comprehensive summary of performance (SOP) that promotes self-determination and productive
      post school outcomes.
 3. Since 2001, student attendance failed to meet the state's requirements during testing days; However, in 2005,
      attendance on test days allowed the school to meet the annual attendance objectives as defined by the state.
 4. For the acceptability of online tutoring procedures, teachers and tutors all reported that the set-up was easy.
      Teachers, students, and tutors responded that some student materials could be clearer; However, overall the
      clarity of those materials was acceptable.
 5. An important increase in contaminant substances was found in Lake Ontario fish. PCNs have shown a dramatic
      decline since 1979; However, the levels are still above Ontario's fish consumption advisory guidelines for dioxin-like
      compounds.
 6. The poet Montoro witnessed some of the worst racial violence of his time and was forced to feel from his home in
      Cordoba (in 1473) during a riot. His poem to Enrique IV voices the frustration of a citizen who had lost hope that
      the persecution would end. However, his poem dedicated to Isabel illustrates that the presence of the new queen
      had restored in the poet some degree of optimism for the future.
 7. Usually, it's better to take a multivitamin supplement with meals. With an empty stomach, you'll absorb less of
      those vitamins. However, taking your multivitamin supplement on an empty stomach is much better than not
      taking it at all.
 8. If students with ID are auditing a class, then they are not receiving official university credit and are not required to
      submit assignments. However, if students with ID taking the course for credit, then those students must attempt
      to master all of the material which other students are expected to learn and submit all assignments as required in
      the syllabus.
 9. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 led to the forced relocation of thousands of Indian families from the Southeast to
      what is now Oklahoma. However, the growth and expansion of the white population has intensified the demand for
      Indian lands in most areas.
10. Most items in the questionnaire represent statements to which the students responded to on a four-point
      modified Likert scale ranging from strongly agree, agree, disagree and strongly disagree. However, in the last three
      items, students were requested to give open answers.

Rules to use however
In the academic writing context, however is often used as a transitional device in the following two ways:

   1) to contrast two features/variables/attributes of one theme
   2) to contrast two features/variables/attributes of two themes that belong to the same category

Activity 3

Read examples 1-10 in activity 2 again.
   1) Circle the punctuation marks used before and after however.
   2) Compare the different uses of punctuation before and after however between examples 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and

examples 3, 4, 5.
   Language usage notes
   However is used as a coordinating conjunction to connect two independent clauses. Very often, a period, a

punctuation mark to indicate the end of the first independent clause, is placed before However. In this case, the h in
however should be capitalized, and a comma should be used after However (see examples 1 to 6).

   As shown in examples 7-10, a semicolon can also be used before however to connect two main clauses in a single

                                                                                                                                      However as a Transitional Device | 125
sentence. In this case, the h in however should not be capitalized, and a comma should be used after however. Compared
to a period, a semi-colon is preferred if the two clauses are short.

8 use of honorifics. However, it is clear that Korean is
        harder to learn than English because of its alphabet,
        grammar, and the use of honorifics.

Although as a Transitional Device

ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA AND YELIN ZHAO

Based on the analysis of the uses of however in the previous section, we have learned that this transitional word is
used to contrast features of one or two themes. In this section, we proceed to discuss another transitional device
(i.e. although) that also serves the contrastive function. In fact, some students even view however and although as
synonyms and think they can be used interchangeably. This false assumption leads to some inappropriate uses of these
two transitional expressions in their writing. Task 1 intends to guide you to explore the differences between the uses of
however and although.

Activity 1

In the following exercise you will find three passages that contain however and three passages that include although to
present contrasts. Read the passages carefully and discuss the following questions with your peers:

       1) As you did in Activity 2 in the however chapter, in each of the following passages, first circle the theme(s) and
       then underline the features that are set in contrast.
       2) Within each passage, which sentence (Sentence [1] or [2]) introduces the contrast between features?
       3) Where in the passage is the transitional word placed? Sentence [1] or [2]?
       4) Using your responses, fill in the chart that appears below.

 1. [1] There is a general belief that compared to undergraduate students, graduate students are less likely to violate
      academic integrity since they are more mature and more educated. [2] Although the belief is prevalent, Brown
      (1995) reported that, in fact, graduate students are as likely to cheat as their undergraduate counterparts.

2. [1] Badge and Scott (2009) pointed out that little research has been done to examine the impact of plagiarism
      detection tools on staff teaching practices. [2] Although a number of recent studies have considered educational
      use of Turnitin, they focused on individual programs or subject areas rather than institutions as a whole and the
      relationship with policy.

3. [1] Activities which involved another party, such as copying and collaboration amongst students, created
      considerable diversity of opinion. [2] Although copying from other students was included in most definitions of
      plagiarism, for some participants from humanities and science, this was considered to be a different kind of
      cheating.

4. [1]Plagiarism by students is an increasing issue at higher education institutions that require attention. [2] However,
      the development of academic misconduct policies has done little to reduce the incidence of plagiarism.

5. [1] We intentionally offered students two articles in electronic form, available on the university Web site, and two
      printed in a journal, expecting that the electronic versions would be plagiarized more. [2] However, no differences
      in the plagiarism rate between the students who chose the electronic version of the source article or the paper
      version were actually found.

6. [1] When electronic software tools for the detection of plagiarism first became available, many educators believed
      that they would provide an easily implemented solution, which would cut down on the hours of tedious manual
      detection. [2] However, within a short period of time, it became clear that electronic detection software "is not a
      magic bullet" (Caroll, 2003a) and that it is just one tool among many.

1

2
3

4

          5

          6

Rules to use although
As we have learned in the previous chapter, however is often used as a coordinating conjunction to connect two
independent clauses that are of equal importance. In contrast, as shown in examples 1-3, although is used to connect
ideas that are within one sentence, so it functions as a subordinating conjunction.

Activity 2

Read the following examples very carefully. Pay attention to the grammar structure and punctuation used in each
sentence and complete the following activities:

       1. Enclose the first clause of each passage using square brackets: [ ]
       2. Underline the second clause: _______________
       3. In examples 2 through 5, which of the two clauses carries the central idea of the passage? Why is that so?
       (Example 1 has been done for you).
       4. Which clause is more important in examples 6 through 10?
       5. What differences can you find between examples 1-5 and 6-10?

1. [Although professors and classroom teachers are extremely busy with all of their duties], adding components of job
searching to teacher preparation will help candidates start their careers.

   The second clause (underlined) carries the central meaning of the passage. The writer wants to emphasize why it is
important to add a job searching component to teacher education programs.

   2. Although many reading specialists would probably argue that reading is the most important skill students need to
develop, the need to integrate technology into the school curriculum should not be overlooked.

   3. Although I still would like to find a way to increase my brain capacity, my interest has shifted toward student
learning and brain development over the past several decades.

   4. Although research is less clear about the appropriate test level for academically gifted students, Warne (2014)
conducted a study in which gifted students were tested above level with a test that was 2 years more advanced than
their grade level.

                                                                                                                                      Although as a Transitional Device | 131
   5. Although the literature is mixed concerning whether online discussion boards are conducive to fostering students'
critical thinking skills, strong evidence suggests it is a learning environment ripe with possibilities for doing so.

   6. Learning is fundamental to life itself and we probably internalize from every life situation and experience, although
we are not conscious of much of it.

   7. No local dengue fever cases were reported in 2013, although cases may have been underreported because of local
physicians were not familiar with the disease.

   8. Historically, counselors have not been involved in the academic mission of the school (Adelman, 2002; House &
Hayes, 2002), although recent research suggests an urgent need for them to be (Adelman, 2002; Clark & Amatea, 2004).

   9. Most test-takers managed to complete both choice exercises, although some only answered the first one.
   10. All the plants remained alive at the end of seawater treatments, although their vitality was strongly reduced.
As you surely noticed, the sentences in this exercise follow two main patterns:
   Although + clause / , / clause
Clause / , / although + clause
   In all the examples, the although+clause shows the contrast, while the other clause carries the central idea of the
sentence.
   Rules to use although
   1. The clause that starts with although is a dependent clause, so it carries less important information than the other
clause that is an independent clause. Use sentence [2] in passage 1 (Activity 1) as an example: the dependent clause
"Although the belief is prevalent" is less important than the independent clause "graduate students are as likely to
cheat as their undergraduate counterparts." In what follows, the writer is very likely to talk about detailed information
regarding Brown's (1995) study instead of how prevalent the previous belief is.
   2. Regardless of the order used, you should always use a comma to separate the two clauses.
   3. Unlikehowever, although is never followed by a comma.
   4. It is also important to point out that since at least one sentence needs to be an independent clause, a sentence
starts with "which," as in the following example is ungrammatical: Although a number of recent studies have considered
educational use of Turnitin, which focused on individual programs or subject areas rather than institutions as a whole
and the relationship with policy.
   5. Additionally, you might have heard, read, or even written a sentence in which the construction "Although xxx, but
xxx." This structure is inappropriate. The reason is that but is unnecessary, and contrast has already been indicated in
the word "although." This error might be due to direct translation from some languages other than English.

It will be helpful for you to master some key expressions that we commonly use in academic writing in order to
introduce specific examples. Two of the most common expressions of this type are such as and for example.

   You may think that these expressions are used in the same way and are interchangeable, but a closer look at the
contexts of their use will reveal differences. Mastering these differences will help you greatly improve your academic
writing.

   Look carefully at the following examples that show the most common way we use such as. 1 is from the introduction
to an article.

 1. Ethnographic observations find that homemade meals often consist of convenience foods such as canned
      vegetables with heavy seasoning, frozen fried potato products that would be reheated in the oven, macaroni and
      cheese out of the box, and hot dogs as the main meat item1.

2 is a similar example from the results section of a journal article.
             2. Results on food preparation ability of the students in this study are presented in Table 1. A large percent

          (=90%) of the students knew how to make basic foods such as hamburgers, tacos, mashed potatoes, and
          scrambled eggs. In contrast, a relatively small percent (=25%) of the students knew how to make quiche, pizza
          sauce, basic salad dressings, or mayonnaise.2
   Look closely at these examples. What phrases occur before such as? What occurs after such as? What do you note
about the punctuation and capitalization?

Phrase Before                Phrase After

               For example,
               For example,

Now consider 3 and 4, which show the most common way we use for example.
             3. In the context of this study, treats are sugary or salty snack items that fall outside the bounds of "eating

          right" or meeting children's basic nutritional needs. Treats serve several purposes in mother- child interactions.
          In most cases, treats are used as a reward for children's good behavior. For example, Nora in San Antonio would
          buy her daughters pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for good behavior.

            4. When mothers are short on funds, they often use cheaper and less healthful foods to substitute for those
         they cannot afford. For example, Karen in Chicago would try to buy as many fresh foods as possible as soon as
         her food stamp benefits are deposited in her account.

   Look closely at these examples. What kind of phrase occurs before for example? What occurs after for example? What
do you note about the punctuation and capitalization?

The expression such as is used to provide specific examples to illustrate the category named by the noun or noun
phrase that comes immediately before it.

   In the sentence from 1 above, repeated here, the writer makes the general category basic foods more specific by
naming the list of examples that follow such as. These are hamburgers, tacos, mashed potatoes, and scrambled eggs.

   A large percent (=90%) of the students knew how to make basic foods such as hamburgers, tacos, mashed potatoes,
and scrambled eggs.

   5a shows us a slightly different use of such as `
             5a. Silver (1996) demonstrated how college students use objects either as "anchors" to maintain previous

          identities or as "markers" to construct new identities. Anchor objects, such as dolls or baseball cards, were those
          left at home, while marker objects, such as photographs or music, were those brought into the college dorms.

   In the first sentence in 5a, the writers are introducing key terms - anchors and markers -from previous research. In
the next sentence, they further explain what these terms mean by stating that anchor objects are those students left
at home, while marker objects are those students brought with them to college. They provide specific examples to help
the reader understand what each type of object might be with the terms following such as - dolls or baseball cards and
photographs or music . Note that in this example, the such as phrase is separated from the rest of the sentence by
commas. The commas help to separate the examples in the such as phrase from the rest of the sentence. In this case
the items mentioned in the such as phrase provide additional information. We know that the phrases provide additional
information because the sentence would be grammatically acceptable and understandable if we leave out the examples
in the such as phrase, as we see in 5b.

             5b. Anchor objects were those left at home, while marker objects were those brought into the college dorms.

   Phrases using such as are:

  · inserted into a complete sentence or main clause,
         o Complete sentence

          Anchor objects were those left at home.

  · immediately after the noun that the examples are specifying
         o Insertion

          Anchor objects, such as dolls or baseball cards, were those left at home.

   Punctuation for such as
   If:

  · such as follows a general noun,

          General nouns that often come before such as include:
             items, things, issues, areas, factors, variables, activities, events

                                                                                                                                                                         'such as' | 141
  · the phrase that follows gives short specific examples from the category the general noun describes
          then it may occur without commas before such as
                     (As we see in 1 and 2)

   Otherwise, such as should have a comma before it.
   If the examples not at the end of the sentence and are followed by a long phrase, there should also be a comma
after them.
   (As we see in 5a.)
   NOTE: If you are in doubt, it is better to separate the such as phrase with commas, than to omit the commas. Using
the commas will make it easier for the reader to follow your sentence.
   SENTENCE FRAGMENT WARNING
   Such as must be inserted into a complete main clause; it cannot stand by itself in a separate sentence.
   Students left anchor objects at home. Such as dolls or baseball cards.
   THIS IS NOT GRAMMATICAL!
   Such as must be attached to the same sentence in which the noun it specifies appears.
   WORD ORDER WARNING
   The such as phrase must directly follow the noun that it specifies; it cannot be put elsewhere in the clause.
   Students left anchor objects at home, such as dolls or baseball cards.
   THIS IS NOT GRAMMATICAL! The such as specifies the category anchor objects, so it must come directly after this
noun phrase.

Punctuation Exercise: Such as

Look at the following examples from a research article and explain why the authors use or do not use a comma.
             The authors argued that some of our emotions, such as disgust, are learned through our interaction with

          others in food related activities.
             Several individuals described items such as fruit salad, homemade bread, or homemade cookies as their

          comfort food.

'For example': Introducing a Sentence

CAROL LYNN MODER

The most common use of for example in academic writing is the use we saw in 3 and 4. For example introduces a specific
example of an idea or concept that has been described in the preceding sentence. The most common use of for example
in academic writing puts it at the beginning of a complete sentence.

             3. In most cases, treats are used as a reward for children's good behavior. For example, Nora in San Antonio
          would buy her daughters pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for good behavior.

   For example is most commonly:

  · After a complete sentence that introduces a main idea or concept
  · At the beginning of a second complete sentence or main clause

         o The first letter of For is capitalized because it is the beginning of a new sentence.
         o For example is followed by a comma to separate it from the full sentence that follows it'

   SENTENCE FRAGMENT WARNING
   For example must be attached to a complete main clause; it cannot appear by itself followed only by a list of items.

   Treats are used as a reward for children's good behavior. For example, pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for
good behavior.

   THIS IS NOT GRAMMATICAL!
   What follows for example here is just a list of noun phrases. There is no finite verb in this sentence, so it is a fragment,
not a complete sentence. The for example phrase that appears at the beginning, must introduce a complete sentence

   In 3, the first sentence states one of the findings of the research study, that mothers use treats to reward children for
good behavior. The next sentence gives a specific example of this from one of the participants in the study. The phrase
For example, alerts the reader that the sentence that comes after it is going to provide an example of the idea described
in the previous sentence.

   Exercise: For example or such as?
   In the sentence below, decide whether For example or such as is the correct phrase and explain why.

             A. The physical activity of preparing the food, _________________ chopping the fruit or kneading
          the dough, can be therapeutic. _________________, one woman described making cookie dough as a
          tremendous reliever of distress.

 'For example': Inside a Sentence

   CAROL LYNN MODER

   We have described the most common uses in academic writing of For example and such as. If you master these uses and
   choose only to use them as we have described so far, you will not be likely to make errors. However, there is a second
   common use of for example, which you will encounter and which you may want to understand more fully. This use is
   shown in 6.

                6. Some attention needs to be devoted to the intricacies of our language. Students are in need of assistance
             dealing with the following: homograph and homonym. The former are words that are spelled the same, for
             example, Bow of the ship and Bow and arrow. The latter are words with a different spelling that possess the same
             sound, such as, to, too and two; plane and plain.1

      The use in 6, is very similar to the use of such as that we saw earlier. In fact, as we see here, the writer uses for
   example to introduce the examples for the first noun phrase and such as to introduce the second. So inside a sentence
   for example can be used in place of such as, BUT such as CANNOT be used everywhere you can use for example.

      Such as is very restricted in its use, but for example can be used in more varied contexts. As we saw earlier, For example
   can be used at the beginning of a sentence but such as CANNOT. Inside a sentence, such as MUST immediately follow
   the noun or noun phrase that it specifies, but for example can occur in other places inside the sentence.

      Let's look at some uses of for example inside a sentence, where such as CANNOT be used.

                7. The data analysis revealed several student ideas for situating writing course activity within digital contexts. A
             few interviewees, for example, discussed the possibility of having a course Facebook page, where students could
             interact with one another and the teacher to ask questions about homework.2

      In 7, for example follows a noun, but it does not introduce examples that specify that noun. We could NOT use such as
   in this context. The whole sentence in which for example occurs, is provided as an example of what the sentence before
   describes. In 7, the first sentence states that the analysis revealed several student ideas for course activities. The entire
   following sentence gives an example of those student ideas. So, the context for using for example inside the sentence
   use, is the same as the context that we saw in examples 3 and 4 when For example occurred at the beginning of the
   sentence.

      For example does not have to follow a noun or noun phrase, though.
      Look closely at examples 8-12. What kind of phrase occurs before for example? What occurs after for example? What
   do you note about the punctuation and capitalization?

                8. Many refugee children and youth do not have any print literacy skills. Take, for example, Jaabriil, a student
             we met through our study. He was born in a refugee camp in Yemen, yet he identifies with the language, culture,

and ethnicity of his family's Somali roots. Jaabriil came to Canada when he was 12 years old. Although he spent

two years in elementary school -- grades 7 and 8 -- when we met him in the English literacy development (ELD)
program in his first year of high school he had limited knowledge of Roman alphabet letter3

   9. By bringing students' nonacademic digital literacies into writing education, teachers can facilitate students'

critical thinking about the technologies they use. When Facebook is used in class activities, for example, teachers

can prompt students to discuss the construction of Facebook itself; a discussion of Facebook data collection can
lead students to become more aware of how the site provides information to advertisers.4

   10. The assessment techniques should be aligned not only with the course outcomes, but also with the

performance that learners/workers will be expected to achieve as a result of the new learning. If the course

is on programming, for example, it only makes sense that learners demonstrate their learning through a final
submission of a computer program project.5

   11. In many states, a much larger percentage of students obtain the highest label of proficiency. In Utah, for
example, 53% of examinees of the state-mandated language arts tests had "substantial" proficiency.6

   12. The students generally reported understanding very little about loans before borrowing for the first time,

but described the actual process of applying for a loan as fairly painless. Emily, for example, estimated the entire
loan application process took her only 30 minutes.7

Phrase Before                Phrase After

               for example,
               for example,
               for example,
               for example,
               for example,

As we see from these examples, for example can occur after verbs (take), prepositional phrases (in Utah), nouns or noun
phrases (Emily, a few interviewees) or dependent clauses (When Facebook is used in class activities, If the course is on
programming). Note that in all cases, it is inserted into what is otherwise a complete sentence.

      How do we decide where to place for example in a sentence? To answer this question, we need to consider the larger
   context of the writing and what the writer wishes to highlight.

      Look back at examples 7-12 and consider:

     · What information occurs in the sentence before?
     · What information does the for example sentence give us in relation to the first sentence?
     · What part of the for example sentence is the focus of the example?

   When For example occurs at the beginning of the sentence, the entire following sentence illustrates the point being
   made in the first sentence. In 3, repeated here, the author is presenting findings showing that parents use treat to
   reward good behavior. The full following sentence is an example of this, specifying how one parent, Nora, used specific
   treats, pudding cups, fruit roll-ups or ice cream, to reward good behavior. Thus, the whole second sentence serves as
   the example of the concept in the previous sentence.

                3. In most cases, treats are used as a reward for children's good behavior. For example, Nora in San Antonio
             would buy her daughters pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for good behavior.

      Compare that to 11. Here the first sentence introduces facts about student proficiency that are true in many states.
   The following sentence, gives us a sample of this by highlighting the specific percentage from only one state, Utah. The
   writer makes the information about states the focus of this section, so for example is put after the phrase In Utah.

                11. In many states, a much larger percentage of students obtain the highest label of proficiency. In Utah, for
             example, 53% of examinees of the state-mandated language arts tests had "substantial" proficiency.8

      Similarly, in 13 we again find for example after a prepositional phrase. This time the example is one of a set of items
   that the writers mentioned before. The authors' point in this section is that many texts that are part of curriculum have
   vocabulary and other features that are too difficult for the students. They introduce the names of three difficult works
   and then they use details about one of them to illustrate their point. For example is placed after the name of the title
   selected for the example.

                13. In a typical junior high class, students are expected to read such works as Homer's The Odyssey, William
             Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, or Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Many aspects of these wonderful and
             important texts might prove difficult for readers including vocabulary, themes and text structure. In To Kill
             a Mockingbird, for example, readers need to read and know the meanings of such words as assuaged, foray,
             impudent and taciturn.9

      For example can also be used to highlight one of a series of examples in a section of writing. We see this in 10. Here
   the focus of the section is on assessment techniques and the main point is that these techniques need to match what
   the work learners will be able to do. Two specific illustrations are used, the first is for a course on programming. The

   146 | 'For example': Inside a Sentence
second is for mobile learning applications. Here dependent clauses that begin with If specify examples of courses in
which worker performances could be assessed. The writer uses for example after the first if clause to highlight that this
is one of a series of conditions that illustrate the point in the prior sentence.

             10. The assessment techniques should be aligned not only with the course outcomes, but also with the
          performance that learners/workers will be expected to achieve as a result of the new learning. If the course
          is on programming, for example, it only makes sense that learners demonstrate their learning through a final
          submission of a computer program project. Similarly, if the mobile learning application offers video modules on
          the features of medical equipment, the learner should be able to share those features in a presentation format.
   As we have seen in these examples, the location of for example depends on what the writer has written in the previous
sentences and what the writer wants to do with the example. For example is most commonly placed at the beginning
of the sentence. If for example is placed inside the sentence, it is generally placed immediately AFTER a phrase that
highlights the writer's focus.

                                                                                                                                        'For example': Inside a Sentence | 147
